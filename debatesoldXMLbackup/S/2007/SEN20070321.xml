	<P>I have notice from Senator O&rsquo;Rourke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the reason for the delay in advancing new accommodation at St. Joseph&rsquo;s school, Rochfordbridge, County Westmeath and to give an update on the matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prioritise Granard, County Longford as a location for a new factory, to advance its development and meet the needs of the increasing population.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the report from the Committee on Procedures and Privileges concerning necessary changes to Standing Orders consequent to the establishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and other technical changes.  The report was circulated to all Members last night and the motion will be taken without debate; No. 2, Building Control Bill 2005 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 1.30 p.m.; No. 3, Defamation Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken between 2.30 p.m. and 5 p.m.; No. 4, Protection of <Col N="1110"/>Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 7.15 p.m. and to conclude no later than 9.30 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 23, motion No. 38, to be taken between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  There will be a sos between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Ambulance Association of Ireland stated, &ldquo;We have staff working round the clock trying to keep emergency ambulances on the road.  We have members doing back-to-back shifts, which is totally illegal, and we are genuinely worried that patients are being put at risk&rdquo;.  Front line medical staff such as ambulance crews and others have sought 400 additional paramedic and support staff in this area because the service is, in their words, at &ldquo;breaking point&rdquo;.  It will come as little comfort to them to read in today&rsquo;s newspapers that staff in the upper echelons of the HSE are coining it through the salaries and positions they have negotiated for themselves.  The notion that individuals can earn &euro;250,000 per annum and &euro;1,500 per day in overtime is a complete joke to front line staff who are trying to operate a service to help people up and down this country.  The Government and the HSE need to be held to account for this and I ask for time to be provided for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House and explain why a golden circle has negotiated these contracts while other health care workers must put up with Dickensian conditions within the service.  That is worthy of debate and I ask the Leader to respond to it.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I heard Senator Norris raise the issue of the Abbey Theatre.  I join him in calling for a short debate between now and Easter on this subject.  It is lunacy that we are talking about hiving off the Abbey Theatre to a part of Dublin which has no connection with our national theatre.  The logical solution is for the Abbey Theatre to be based at the old Carlton site on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  That would make sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said that for the past number of years.  I do not know why the Government has not been able to negotiate with the Abbey Theatre and Dublin City Council and get ownership of the old Carlton site.  It would be hugely significant for O&rsquo;Connell Street and for the establishment of theatre in Dublin city centre rather than hive it off to a part of Dublin that has no connection with the national theatre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I very rarely raise the issue of what people in the public service are paid because <Col N="1111"/>I genuinely believe they earn what they get.  However, I find it impossible to reconcile today&rsquo;s news on the issue of overtime, in particular.  I have been dealing with the public service and the Civil Service for many years but I have never heard of senior management getting overtime.  It does not happen in the Civil Service or in the public service where time in lieu operates.  When one is promoted to a senior management role, overtime is not paid, although one may get time in lieu.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance regularly tells us about creating precedent.  Many people who will read this morning&rsquo;s newspaper will ask from where this came.  These people are at Secretary General level in salary terms.  As far as I know, no Secretary General in the Civil Service can claim overtime, unless something new has happened.  I am not questioning what people are paid but rather how overtime can be applied to people in senior management positions.</P>
        <P>It is a major embarrassment to the Government and the Minister that this is happening.  Tonight I will meet people from the nursing unions and it is impossible to reconcile this.  It is unacceptable, although there may be issues about which we do not know.  This has not happened before.  I would like someone to come to the House to inform us how we arrived at this situation where people at Secretary General level can claim overtime.  It is unacceptable and reflects badly on the management of the health service.  We may have been given wrong information by the newspapers, which has happened previously, but if what we read is correct, it is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a particular irony about the fact these senior people claim overtime while at the same time they attempt to force through contract changes for doctors and nurses whereby they will work seven days per week, 24 hours per day rotas for a given salary and without any overtime.  These changes are referred to as new work practices which are supposed to be the fashion.  While the people at the coalface are being told overtime is an old fashioned idea, those attempting to force through these changes claim it.</P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I would not have an argument with the salaries if people were doing the job, which is a good question.  If one were running an organisation as large as a health service properly, I would not take issue with the level of reward.  However, I take issue with people claiming privileges which they are attempting, by every means of negotiation and use of public relations, to take from others.  It is hypocrisy on a grand scale and it is not the way to create the proper ethos.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of a Polish woman who was refused an abortion.  I am not attempting to make an issue of this but we cannot spend the <Col N="1112"/>next ten years with our heads buried in the sand pretending this is not happening.  This was not a ruling of the European Court of Justice but of the European Court of Human Rights and, therefore, the famous protocol to the Maastricht treaty is of no significance.  I would like a member of Government to come to the House to give us an authoritative view on how that decision will impact on the way we regulate this very difficult and emotional area.  The one thing we should not do is hope it will go away because I can assure the House it will not.</P>
        <P>Three cases, which have been taken by three Irish women, are due to come up and they may well produce a decision.  We would be better off to deal with this now sensibly and sanely and without recrimination and to recognise the fact that perhaps we will have to deal with a regime some of us might find distasteful.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that at long last a new copy of the rules of the road is being issued today, although only 12 years late.  I hope that once it is issued, all the rules of the road will be enforced because not a single truck on the road observes the speed limits.  How many people have come across a heavy goods vehicle, HGV, on a motorway doing only 80 km/h?  The answer is &ldquo;Nobody&rdquo;.  If a HGV were doing 80 km/h, we would probably think there was something wrong with it.  HGVs are supposed to have speed limiters on them but they do not because they are perfectly capable of travelling at speeds in excess of the speed limits.  Trucks are involved in three times as many fatal accidents as their numbers on the road would suggest.  Now that we have an up-to-date version of the rules of the road, perhaps they will be enforced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the issue of the rape case in County Clare was raised on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  Many fine Senators spoke on the issue and the Leader acknowledged that and said it was important to have a debate.  The time for discussion is over and we need to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what action he proposes to take.  He must outline that action so that we know this cannot happen again.  It is unacceptable that somebody can walk free with a suspended sentence when found guilty by a court.  We must do something about that.</P>
        <P>While I accept the Leader&rsquo;s bona fides in regard to a debate, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that after No. 5 concludes at 9.30 p.m., we invite the Minister to the House.  The Minister has nine hours between now and 9.30 p.m. and if that is not enough time, then this House has no jurisdiction and we might as well all go home.  This is the most serious issue to face this country in recent months and we should give it the same level of importance we gave the emergency legislation on statutory rape.  I would like the support of the House in this regard.  I apologise to the Leader for tabling an amendment to <Col N="1113"/>the Order of Business but we can no longer sit back and talk without taking action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Cox&rsquo;s amendment.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis will take place this weekend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Senator like to join us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with the theme of leading Ireland to the doldrums.  That has occurred over the past ten years.  If we face 15 years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, it will worsen.  We should look at what is happening in the areas of health, employment and law and order and at the lack of accountability of this Government.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House as soon as possible for a debate on the competitive challenge facing Ireland.  A large number of manufacturing industries are leaving Ireland because of stealth taxes, Government levies, insurance and so on which have been imposed on them by this Government since it took office five years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a net increase in manufacturing employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We have lost a large number of jobs to the Far East and eastern Europe, especially in manufacturing.  We need a debate as soon as possible to review industrial policy and to try to get our cost base back in order and avoid further job losses.  Such a debate is urgent because there is a great deal of public concern about the number of manufacturing jobs which are leaving Ireland for the Far East and eastern Europe.  This is due to an active Government policy on stealth taxes.  Since the Government took office, approximately 40 such taxes have been introduced.  This is killing both industry and jobs and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was not in Ballymahon last night and his absence was noted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He was in Athlone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it appropriate for the Leader of the House to refer to the absence of a Member?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate for her to so do. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to bring a matter, on which Members might have a debate, to the attention of the Leader of the House.  I refer to the question of loss leaders in supermarkets and below cost selling.  In particular, I refer to Tesco and its promotion on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, in which one received 12 free cans of Guinness or Budweiser on purchasing 12 cans in-store.  This encourages <Col N="1114"/>binge drinking and certainly undermines the status of the local public house.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These points were made yesterday on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There are pints and points.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that this issue has been brought to my attention and may not have received the requisite attention yesterday.  Perhaps it will receive more today.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach who comes from a rural area in County Mayo realises the effect on pubs.  Publicans control their business, do not permit binge drinking on their premises and control young drinkers.  This promotion constituted a major encouragement to young drinkers and non-Irish nationals, in particular, who could have availed of this offer of 12 free cans of Budweiser or Guinness on purchasing 12 cans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Every little helps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This undermines small businesses and is contrary to the ethos of below cost selling, against which Members fought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Which Government allowed below cost selling?  I believe it was the current Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>These offers constitute loss leaders.  This is grotesque, offensive and damaging to young people who are being encouraged and misled into engaging in binge drinking.  I wish to protest against such a promotion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also support Senator Cox and I am glad her proposal has been seconded.  I look forward to the vote.  In particular, I welcome the manner in which she introduced the matter because she asked for a debate rather than making a knee-jerk response by demanding mandatory sentences.  Members should listen to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as this matter is problematic.  The judge in question is a very fine judge and there may have been reasons for what he did in the knowledge that the sentence could be appealed against by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, there is a human tragedy behind this issue, as well as the fact that a remarkable young woman was put through this process.  She is extremely lucky to have the support of a valiant and dignified family.</P>
        <P>I warn against automatically seeking mandatory sentences which are blunt instruments.  This morning I listened to a programme on which a distinguished lawyer from Georgia recounted the story of a young man who was a fine athlete and student and who attended a party at which he had sex with his girlfriend.  He was 17 years old, she was 15 and he received a mandatory sentence of <Col N="1115"/>ten years in prison.  How does this improve society?  It was a consensual act.  It seems that this is what happens if one opts for the blunt instrument.  It constitutes easy politics; in America people went for the &ldquo;three strikes and you are out&rdquo; policy.  Consequently, a young man was sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing a pizza.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These issues can be raised in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, I welcome the points made by Senator Cox, as well as the manner in which she raised the matter, which was highly appropriate.</P>
        <P>I greatly welcome the interview given to <i>An Phoblacht</i> &mdash; not a journal I regularly take &mdash; by Mr. Gerry Adams.  I make this point as someone who had threats issued against his life by republicans.  It was a remarkable interview and I salute his courage.  It is an extraordinary development when someone such as Gerry Adams states he will support the police and that Sinn F&eacute;in will join the police boards and support the forces of law and order.  This constitutes a remarkable development and puts it up to Ian Paisley to bite the bullet, so to speak.</P>
        <P>Perhaps, like Senator Leyden, I am reheating yesterday&rsquo;s breakfast, but Senator Brian Hayes made a contribution on the Abbey Theatre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>This is regurgitation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In tandem with Senator Hayes, I ask for a debate on the site of the theatre.  It is unacceptable that capitalist buccaneers can hold the people of Dublin to ransom&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Senator not join the company?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;over a site that is of prime significance in the main thoroughfare of Dublin.  The Abbey is the national theatre and should not be allowed to become the prisoner of vested financial interests in a development on the south side or in the financial services centre.  As I noted yesterday, the ghost of Sean O&rsquo;Casey will come back to haunt them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he present in the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>On 15 March the Health Service Executive, HSE, advised people in Galway city and parts of County Galway to boil water.  Almost one week ago a boiled water notice was put in place to the effect that one should boil water before using it.  This notice affects approximately 90,000 people in Galway city and in towns such as Tuam, Athenry, Barna, Headford, Oranmore and Moycullen.  As it was issued by the HSE, I probably will be unable to raise the matter on the Adjournment as I would have wished.  However, Members should have an opportunity <Col N="1116"/>to debate the question of public water supplies.  While progress has been made in respect of water quality, I understand that in County Galway a parasite known as cryptosporidium is the source of the HSE&rsquo;s concern.  In its opinion, 48 people have been affected by mysterious stomach complaints because of this parasite.  As the executive has stated the boiled water notice will be in place for another week, I hope an answer will be forthcoming soon as to the cause of the problem.  Galway appears to have the highest number of cases affected by the bug.  If possible, Members should have a debate to elicit more information from the HSE than a statement to the effect that it is carrying out further research to ascertain the cause of the stomach ailment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments.  It proves, if proof was needed, that the HSE&rsquo;s priorities are not yet close to being correct.  I have become concerned that the old, the sick, the weak and the infirm will be neglected, given the trend that has developed regarding the new plan to which I referred yesterday, as well as the points made by Senator Hayes this morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s remarks on the national institution that is the Abbey Theatre.  As the Senator is a prominent and illustrious northsider, I bow to his superior knowledge on the matter and fully support all the points he has made about that great national institution.  As I am unfamiliar with them, I do not wish to echo his exact points about the buccaneers.  However, I strongly suspect he is correct.</P>
        <P>I refer to Part V of the Planning and Development Act and the 20% social and affordable housing provision.  Is the Leader of the House aware of any departmental guidelines in this regard?  Perhaps she will arrange a debate on the issue, although I am aware time is becoming short.  However, recent reports have pointed out that builders and developers have managed to provide alternative sites 4 km or 5 km from the development that was the subject of planning.  In other locations one reads of the provision of monetary compensation instead.  Ireland is too small to allow such a complete lack of uniformity; there should be guidelines.  While the law may not be specific, there should be guidelines and people should not be able&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator seek a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Very much so.  I want the Leader of the House to respond.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach will appreciate that one cannot have different practices in Kerry, Cork and Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a fine one to say that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1117"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Seriously, there is a complete lack of uniformity.  I respectfully suggest that something must be done.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I too would like to see the integrity of the public service ethos upheld.  On rare occasions in days gone by one could work through until 5 a.m. or 7 a.m. without overtime, bonuses or incentives.  I understand permanent civil servants now receive performance bonuses.  I cannot state I wholly approve of this development.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While most, or all, of us applaud the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to keep tabs on the EU Trade Commissioner, I must share a little of the satisfaction of a certain farm organisation of which I am a member that the said Commissioner cried off attendance at a conference in Kilmainham because of the warm reception he could expect there.  The farm organisations have about as much trust in the Commissioner sticking to the EU negotiating mandate in the WTO as Nationalists and republicans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak of more mundane matters.  I seek a debate on an issue which is presumably dear to everybody in this House, namely, planning matters.  A recent case highlighted in the press reached a new low.  In County Wicklow a farmer objected to the erection of two new windows by a man in a house on the grounds the sheep might be looking in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was cows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was sheep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it was cows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a photograph of a sheep but it does not mean cows would not look through also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is possible cows may have got through but they were not included.  This appeal was sustained by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and when the houseowner offered to put in reinforced glass it was also turned down by the planners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a danger to the sheep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  It was not in the interests of the sheep or the cows.  We have reached a ridiculous point in planning.  Planners, particularly An Bord Plean&aacute;la, should be accountable to someone, perhaps this House.  This is not the only case of animals being more important than humans in planning matters.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another, perhaps more serious, issue which was already discussed by Senator Bannon.  He stated the loss of jobs is a matter of great concern.  It is worthy of debate because nobody knows what is happening.  Two sides of the argument are put forward.  Some state multi-nationals are leaving for eastern Europe because costs are lower there.  The other side of the argument is that those jobs are being replaced quickly and we are being alarmist.  I do not know what is the truth and we should debate the matter.</P>
        <P>Everybody is agreed about one point on which there is no doubt and I speak as one who is not a great fan of trade unions.  The cost base here is a major problem.  It should be emphasised that it is not only the fault of staff or a matter of having a head count and laying people off to cut costs.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Employers behave extremely irresponsibly on this matter.  The Irish Business and Employers Confederation is an apologist for the food industry which has raised prices to an unforgivable level.  This should not be allowed and should be investigated.  Employers also behave irresponsibly with regard to banks and credit cards and this is another area which should be examined.  It contributes to the cost of living.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon mentioned semi-State bodies such as Bord G&aacute;is, the ESB and the VHI.  State <Col N="1119"/>employers contribute to the increase in the cost base.  We should debate this matter and not take the easy course and state the cost base is too high and too many people work.  We should examine both sides and ask why the cost base is so high.  Both sides of industry should come under scrutiny because it could be a serious matter for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s tribute to senior civil servants.  I have known many here, in the North and in Britain.  It seems the more senior they are, the longer hours they work.  We all owe them a debt of gratitude and I never heard the term &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; being introduced.  While people should be rewarded for what they do, it would be an unfortunate concept to introduce into the public service.</P>
        <P>I also wish to re-echo Senators Mansergh and Norris in welcoming the statement from Mr. Gerry Adams.  It is most important and timely and I hope, as do we all, that it will enable us to get over this week and look forward to progress in the North at the weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Last weekend, we had the horror of the number of road deaths increasing.  The real challenge to us is that we know the solution to part of this, which was recorded on the radio and in newspapers this morning.  In the area around Newry, north of the Border, the amount of speeding has dropped dramatically since the erection of cameras.  In the past, Senator Brian Hayes identified that cars coming from the North know once they cross the Border they can speed because it is unlikely penalty points will be applied because we do not have a united jurisdiction in this regard.</P>
        <P>We know speed cameras will force, delay and hold people&rsquo;s speed down.  We can see the solution and in the past we argued the answer is to erect modern speed cameras which do not require paperwork.  It needs the determination of the Minister and the Government to tackle road deaths due to speeding.  I urge the Government to act on this now.  It is not a matter to be put on the long finger because the answer is in front of us and we know what to do.</P>
        <P>I am greatly concerned about the fact that the other day <i>The Irish Times</i> reported British Government officials claimed 55% of the Irish-registered vehicles they checked are not safe.  Coaches and buses are in breach of safety regulations in Britain.  The figure is horrific and if it is the case, what about speed checks here?  We have a national car testing regime and believe this should not happen.  However, if the British Government is able to state it has a problem with Irish vehicles, particularly buses and coaches, the challenge applies here.  We must act on this and cannot allow it.  Otherwise, we must blame ourselves for the continuing road deaths.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on the State Airports Act.  As the Leader might be aware from some of today&rsquo;s news bulletins, there has been a breakthrough at Shannon Airport, where management, unions and staff representatives have finally agreed on a very significant cost-cutting measure to bring the airport in line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Did they vote on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Not yet, but an agreement has been made with the unions.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The vote will take place in the coming weeks.  I hope we can have a debate not just about that but how that this breakthrough will affect the future of the State Airports Act.  Clearly, if the vote is successful, a significant business plan will be put forward.</P>
        <P>It is also important that the Government makes a statement at this stage on the funding necessary for Shannon to deal with the fall-out from the open skies agreement.  It is incumbent on the relevant Minister and the Government to provide the required funding to allow Shannon to make the transition necessitated by what I would term the fall-out from the open skies agreement.  It would allow the airport to continue to offer services to the transatlantic routes and ensure facilities are on the west coast of Ireland so that we not only get our fair share of tourism from the United States but are also in a position to offer direct daily services 12 months of the year to the industrial base that is the entire Shannon Airport and wider mid-west region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Ross in calling for a debate on planning, a subject I have consistently raised in this House for five years.  It is a significant issue and on which we have not made progress.  We have had rural planning guidelines and although the Minister&rsquo;s intention was certainly to help the process, my experience in listening to people in a number of different counties is that the different guidelines have been used only to beat people as opposed to facilitating them.</P>
        <P>The idea of facilitating the views of cattle or sheep is laughable but it is testament to how ridiculous the planning system is.  It is the single most subjective process in this country and is grossly unfair.</P>

	<P>Its role as a prescribed organisation, along with others, needs to be monitored.  The influence of such organisations on the process is not always positive, although they do carry out some good work.</P>
        <P>I call for yet another debate on transport and road safety in particular.  I join Senator Quinn who stated that we know the problems and asked why we are not dealing with them.  Although speed cameras on the roads may have a role, if we persist in putting such cameras and checkpoints on roads where one could land a jumbo jet, we are not going to do anything to prevent the deaths of people like the eight killed over last weekend.</P>
        <P>If we are honest, we know these deaths are of people of a certain age and occur at certain hours of the morning.  They do not occur on wide dual carriageways or motorways.  I have nonetheless been told that the cameras we see cannot function on the roads where these accidents occur.  We can be busy fools and feel we are making a financial contribution to the State with speeding fines etc., but if we are truly to tackle this issue, we must be more draconian and focused in our measures.  There should be a debate on the matter.  If those who are Members of this House in five years time are to reflect on a reduction in deaths, we must take such steps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Ross for a debate on employment and, in particular, the job losses we have seen over recent months.  It is a matter of concern and I fully support the Senator&rsquo;s balanced approach to such a debate.  We should consider the various issues involved, including benchmarking and the minimum wage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Issues relating to research and development have been well addressed by the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There is a good emphasis on this and it is the way forward.  The House would do well to analyse the matter sensibly and a debate would be beneficial.</P>
        <P>I support the call by Senator Cox for a debate on the specific issues and general area of consistency of sentencing.  The issue from a few weeks ago, where sentencing was perhaps very lenient for the offence committed, has been well articulated.  Yesterday, we saw a case where the penalty seemed to be disproportionate to the offence.</P>
        <P>We must look at the area in a balanced manner because it is very difficult when removed from a case to make definitive judgments whereas a jury or judge will have sat through a case and heard evidence and arguments from both sides before making a considered opinion.  We must be cautious in the line we take, but there is public disquiet about sentencing policy, which is not good for the administration of justice.  Accordingly, we should have a debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn in his call for a debate on road safety.  Much of what Senator MacSharry has said would reflect my views.  Focusing on some aspects of Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s contribution, namely, the timeline in which many of these accidents take place and the age cohort involved, it has already been proven statistically that almost a third of accidents involve this younger age group.  How can we continue to put forward proposals to try to reduce carnage when there is support and encouragement for what is an endemic drink culture, especially and sadly among the younger generation?</P>
        <P>Is there any law preventing a large international multiple such as Tesco from indulging in an exploitative promotion such as that which occurred last week in advance of the national holiday?  That supermarket chain offered ten free cans of beer for every ten cans purchased.  This was an immoral decision taken by the corporate entity that is Tesco.  I believe the decision was taken in the UK and that it was done on the basis of a British stereotype of how the Irish react on St. Patrick&rsquo;s weekend.</P>
        <P>It was grossly immoral and I had many phone calls when wearing my other hat as a broadcaster of a programme in the north west.  The calls came from people who were helpless, as they saw it, in the face of this type of corporate consumerism, which was at the bottom of the issue.  It was about making money and it did not matter to the corporate directors of Tesco if young people would go out with 20 or 30 cans of beer as a result of this promotion and be killed the following day.  There must be some law preventing this act of encouragement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of what he termed the golden circle of top brass within the Health Service Executive being eligible for massive amounts of overtime, and I take on board Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point about the newspaper reports being correct.  Overtime was a term I never heard of in the six Departments in which I worked.  Secretaries General in those Departments worked all hours when necessary, with early mornings and late nights, but overtime never arose.  There was a performance bonus, but that was a separate matter.  I question whether the reportage is correct but if it is, the matter is an outrage.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes joined Senator Norris, who raised the issue yesterday, in asking for a debate on the Abbey Theatre.  It would merit a debate and I will endeavour to have the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, attend the House.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole inserted a caveat on the accuracy of overtime reporting, which must be checked.  Senator Ryan also referred to how wrong &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; reporting was.  He spoke about the Polish woman who was refused an abortion and who received significant compensation after taking the matter to the European Court of Human Rights, which did not acknowledge the protocol to the Maastricht treaty in its decision.  The precedent has been set.  As the matter has received considerable coverage, should we not debate what the decision will entail?  It was quite startling.  I presume she took the case because she was refused an abortion in her own country.  The Senator stated that it is about time the new rules of the road were issued.</P>
        <P>Senator Cox moved an amendment seconded by Senator Bannon asking that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attend the House at 9.30 p.m. or when we finish our business to debate the recent judgment in a rape case.  I will seek the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attendance, but I have not been able to leave the Chamber to do so, which I am sure Senator Cox understands.  I agree with the amendment and I hope our party will vote for it.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter, as it is in keeping with her ethos.  When I say I will seek the T&aacute;naiste, I cannot say I will get him.  I want to be clear in that respect, as I do not want to be accused of misleading the House.

We will work out the best way to deal with the Senator&rsquo;s legitimate request, which was seconded by Senator Bannon.  I thank Senator Cox for raising the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon, echoed by Senator Ross, sought a debate on the competitive challenge facing Ireland.  We will speak on the issue because it developed in an interesting way.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the matter of loss leaders in supermarkets.  Senator Mooney, when entering the Chamber, did not know his colleague had raised the matter previously.  It was a 12 for 12 offer.  I watched the television advertisement and could not believe that so wanton an invitation to destructive behaviour was aired.  Senator Moylan raised the issue yesterday, but it was due a second airing because of the idea that someone could haul 24 cans to a field where debauchery and so on would occur and would later perhaps be involved in road accidents.</P>
        <P>Pubs are becoming the safe place to have a drink.  One can drink in company and in moderation and pub keepers run good houses generally.  We have heard much about how rural pubs are being denuded of customers.  When one considers what we are willing to put up with in terms of drinks advertising, the pub seems a haven of security and safety for people who want to drink.  Senator Leyden used the word &ldquo;grotesque&rdquo;.  I had a vision of groups of 14 year olds and 15 year olds hauling cans away to a park or field&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Like all Members of the House, Senator Norris supports Senator Cox.  I share his concern about mandatory sentences because they are blunt instruments.  Our judges have different specialties and abilities, but we will see what comes of the debate.  Senator Norris praised the Gerry Adams interview in <i>An Phoblacht</i>, which I hope the Oireachtas Library will keep because I am about to go to look for it.  Senator Norris also called for a debate on the Abbey Theatre.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt referred to how people still need to boil water in County Galway.  He mentioned cryptosporidium, which is supposed to be responsible for the ailment, and he asked for a debate on public water supplies.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to how the HSE&rsquo;s priorities have gone awry.  He also wished to join with Senators Norris and Brian Hayes regarding the Abbey Theatre.</P>
        <P>Local authorities behave in different ways and there is no uniformity in how they undertake Part V of the Act, but most councils are flexible and have come to good arrangements with developers on acquiring housing under Part V.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about the lack of opportunities in the Civil Service.  He was in the position cited at one time, namely, working through the night and early morning, writing, thinking, reflecting and arranging.</P>

        <P>Senator Ross asked for a debate on planning matters, but the three debates we have had on the issue were not fruitful.  He raised in a funny way the planning situation involving the farmer, the three windows and the reinforced glass.  He also spoke about the haemorrhaging of jobs.  While he stated that we do not want to be too alarmist, our cost base is a problem, but it is not the only problem.  Senators have noticed that as soon as a firm announces it is to lay off people, one can be sure the next news bulletin will carry the news of another firm also wishing to lay off people.  It is as if the second firm wants to get in on the backwash of the earlier announcements of job losses.  Like the international scene, Irish employers can be examined in many ways.  I will seek a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes spoke about senior civil servants and the Gerry Adams interview.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about the special cameras at Newry.  Part of their efficacy is that they measure one&rsquo;s speed while coming and going.  While the Senator stated that 55% of Irish-registered vehicles are not in good shape, I cannot understand it because they must undergo strict <Col N="1126"/>national car tests.  Sometimes, one wonders about reporting in newspapers.</P>
        <P>Senator Dooley spoke about State airports and Shannon Airport and welcomed the fact that a resolution may be near, which I hope is the case.  He sought finance for Shannon Airport to work through the fallout of the open skies agreement, as it would be useful.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry called for a debate on planning.  While we have had three such debates, it is the most important issue facing people.</P>

They then get on with their business, which affects people in rural areas.  It is awful that they take no account of people&rsquo;s day-to-day housing needs.  They do not approve plans for balconies and conservatories, for example.  However, their own houses are always in beautiful locations, overlooking lakes or surrounded by verdant corners of rural land.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh supported the call made by Senator Ross for a balanced debate on employment.  He also supported Senator Cox&rsquo;s call for a debate on sentencing, as we all do.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney called for a debate on road safety.  He also spoke about an issue raised today by Senator Leyden and yesterday by Senator Moylan.  The Senators have helped to highlight the despicable behaviour of a particular supermarket.  It has been suggested a promotion was organised on the basis that Irish people, particularly young people, wanted to drink on St. Patrick&rsquo;s weekend and that the company in question decided to send them all out hopelessly and irresponsibly drunk.  An appalling lack of judgment was shown by the particular supermarket.  I hope it feels the pain as a result of what people are saying about its actions.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (1), line 30, to delete &ldquo;<i>11</i>,&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1128"/>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments have been drafted primarily with the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on architects in mind.  I acknowledge that section 11 of the Bill, as drafted, largely implements the authority&rsquo;s recommendations.  However, it falls short in one key area.  The authority&rsquo;s report states the profession should be regulated independently of the professional association which, in this case, is the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI.  While section 11 establishes an admissions board under the RIAI with responsibility for the registration of architects, it does not make any statement on the independence of the board.  The Competition Authority also recommended that what is currently referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;the Admissions Board&rdquo; should be referred to as &ldquo;The Architects Council of Ireland&rdquo;.  The amendments would give effect to the authority&rsquo;s recommendations.  They relate in particular to Part 3 of the Bill which deals with the registration of architects.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to accept the amendments which would enhance the Bill greatly.  It is important, in the interests of transparency, that they be taken on board.  Perhaps the Minister will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments.  I do not have any doubts about the integrity of the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland.  A question of principle needs to be considered in this context.  There was a time when the Government agreed with Senator Bannon and I that independence was an essential aspect of the role of bodies such as the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  However, it seems to be wavering.  It is clear that we have a captive Press Council, for example.  Some of us who were present for last night&rsquo;s debate on the Pharmacy Bill 2007 argued strongly in favour of the independent regulation of pharmacists.  I have received a considerable number of submissions from members of the architectural profession who have argued that if we are to be fair and transparent and seen to be fair and transparent &mdash; it is a question of perception also &mdash; it is essential that the regulatory body be independent.  Among the submissions I received yesterday afternoon, there was a large bulk of material that would have been more relevant to the Second Stage debate which had already taken place.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A pleasant and nice gentleman told me that he had been pursuing a grievance for 22 years.  I told him that while that may very well have been the case, it took him until 5 p.m. yesterday to send his submission to me.  The problem was that I had made my Second Stage speech a couple of weeks earlier.  I acknowledge that some very responsible briefing work has been done by professional groups and individuals representing <Col N="1129"/>the architectural profession.  While a number of individuals were quite late in joining the game, that does not invalidate the arguments they and many others have made &mdash; that for the good of the profession it is important that we establish the principle of independence in this legislation.  I reiterate that to do so would not cast a slur on the existing professional body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister to explain exactly what he has in mind in this respect.  When I asked an architect about his professional details some years ago, I discovered that he had no qualifications.  He was able to practise simply by putting the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo; on his gate, although I am sure that is not possible nowadays.  There is a need for strict and secure methods of ensuring that when we employ a professional, we know that the person in question is qualified.  I understand what the Minister is attempting to do but in selecting a single organisation it seems there is a danger one will create a monopoly.  The trend in recent years, driven by Europe in particular, has been towards competition and towards ensuring that people are aware that if competition prevails it will protect against the creation of a monopoly.  I do not know if the Minister can advise what is the position in other professions.  Is there only one organisation, body or association in the medical profession that informs a practitioner that he or she is entitled to call himself or herself a doctor if it permits him or her to do so, but without such permission he or she is not entitled to do so?  I am not sure if that power lies with one organisation, whether it is an organisation such as the one we have described.  I seek information from the Minister on that.  </P>
        <P>There is a need for this legislation and for the registration of such professionals.  The placing of responsibility for that in the hands of one organisation requires an explanation.  Otherwise we must question what happens if a person has fallen out with such an organisation, disagrees with its decision and has obtained his or her qualifications elsewhere.  Does that mean the professional is not allowed to practise?  In establishing an admissions board, does the Minister seek to achieve something in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret being a little late for this debate but I understand the discussion is on a matter on which I spoke on Second Stage.  I have concerns about the authorisation or acclamation of a professional being in the hands of one body, which would also design the curriculum, make assessments and its members might decide collectively that they did not like a group of people who had received training and education in another era and arena and thereby deny those people the rights they have exercised most successfully and fruitfully.  The hope was expressed during the debate on Second Stage that the Minister might examine this issue.  Perhaps he would sketch the history of consultations he may have <Col N="1130"/>had with the other group of people and the RIAI on this issue. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Norris, I am somewhat mystified as to why anybody, having waited for 80 years, would wait until the 59th minute of the 11th hour to lobby for further additional changes.  It seems a remarkable way to do business, particularly if this is a critical issue for people.  I appreciate Senator Bannon has put considerable work into these amendments but I make the point that the term &ldquo;Architects&rsquo; Council of Ireland&rdquo; is not used in the Bill.  No convincing argument has been put forward yet to do so.  </P>
        <P>To address the specific point raised by Senator Quinn, the structure of the admissions board, as is a function of it set out in the Bill, will be independent of the registration body.  It will have a majority of lay personnel among its membership.  Therefore, the dismal prospects forecast by some who are lobbying are simply not a possibility.  To address the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, the role and function of the admissions board were previously agreed by all the architectural representative bodies.  This includes the group of people who at the very last moment have promoted the amendments put forward by Senator Bannon.</P>
        <P>Architects on all sides of this argument who have stopped me in the precincts of this House, on the street, in my office and constituency have indicated their concern and determination that this legislation should go through.  They are anxious to protect their professional title and frustrated at having to wait 80 years to get to this point.  However, now that we are on the cusp of doing this, as Senator Norris eloquently said, and long after Senators have had the opportunity to make their contributions on Second Stage and the process has gone through the D&aacute;il, this same body come has come forward and indicated it wishes to make these changes.  This is not a sensible or a prudent way to do  business and it shows scant regard for the consultation process.</P>
        <P>The approach taken in the Bill was universally agreed by all the bodies concerned and they had sight of the legislation.  A great deal of consultation took place on it.  Anybody who suggests that the Bill has been sprung on him or her at the last minute is ignoring the fact that the profession has sought this legislation for 80 years since the foundation of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the RIAI?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator might let me finish.  The Bill was universally agreed by all the various bodies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It was.  That process continued up to the Christmas period and then for some <Col N="1131"/>reason, which I do not understand, this arrangement came out of the woodwork.  </P>
        <P>The issue of concern is whether we can ensure independence in this process.  While the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors are proposed as registration bodies under the Bill, I remind the House that their roles are separate from those of any other board or committee that would be established under the Bill.  I am satisfied that the procedures set out are fair and equitable and provide assurances that the registration system proposed is open and transparent.  Moreover, robust appeal mechanisms are provided for, something which has been lost on those lobbying, given that I, like Senator Norris, have received a phenomenal degree of lobbying, at the last minute.  I do not understand it.</P>
        <P>This undermines the value of the consultation processes which have been ongoing.  It also shows scant regard for the procedures and timetables of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have made a considerable effort to make sure that this Bill goes through.  I have bullied and browbeaten to secure time in both Houses to get it through and have dedicated, as have Members on all sides of this House, a fair amount of time on Committee and Report Stages to do so.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendments nor do I believe they are necessary.  It is clear that the lobby group that is pressing for changes did not consider they were necessary right up to Christmas.  This is the point.  I cannot understand what has changed during the past nine weeks.  This group was fulsomely involved in the consultation process and saw the draft legislation, which was published in 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>May I make a correction?  It is a grammatical one.  &ldquo;Fulsome&rdquo; does not mean what the Minister thinks it means; it means revoltingly oily and over-indulgence.  People often say fulsome but it is an inappropriate use of the word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Or perhaps they were oily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on the use of the word.  They certainly were not oleaginous.  I make the point that if lobby groups want to be listened to and to have their views taken on board, the least they can do to assist this and the other House, as Senator Norris said, is to be timely with the suggestions they put forward.  As the Senator also said, their waiting until the eve of his coming to this House to make a further contribution on this Bill does not show the kind of professionalism I would have expected of them, particularly given that the legislation was published in 2005 and there was full consultation on it.  I am not sure if some of the consultations were oleaginous but <Col N="1132"/>there was full consultation on the Bill and the opportunity was presented to discuss it.  </P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that amendments that were not suggested on Second, Committee or Report Stages in the D&aacute;il or on Second Stage in the Seanad should be brought forward at this time.  It is not a professional or appropriate way to do business.  It shows scant regard for the consultation process and for the urgency, from the point of view of all involved in architecture, to have this legislation be enacted.  More importantly, it shows scant regard for the necessity to protect in law the victims of people who profess to be architects but are not capable of drawing two lines on a sheet of paper, of whom, unfortunately, there are a number.  All one need do is consult a planning department in any part of the country and one will discover there are people who debase the professional title and who have no skills or experience.  They do not have the experience to be found in the longer standing practices whose members may not have the academic qualifications.</P>
        <P>There is a compelling urgency for the enactment of this legislation from the point of view of protecting the title and from that of protecting the consumer.  I know of scandalous cases involving a character in my constituency, who puts himself forward as an architect and who has submitted plans, which border on the fraudulent, to the local authority and has then told unfortunate clients that he would advise them to telephone the local councillor and push this issue.  That is not professional.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary, therefore, that these amendments were not suggested at any time up to this.  It seems the Bill has had the longest gestation period of any legislation we have handled during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  More importantly, the concerns at the core of these amendments are addressed in the legislation.  I draw the attention of the House to the various parts in the legislation which specify the eligibility criteria for automatic admission to registration and which set out the procedures designed to ensure that all applicants are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  Senator Norris was concerned that there should be fairness and transparency, and this has been provided for in the legislation.  No convincing argument can be made for this extraordinary degree of change at, literally, the 11th hour, the 59th minute and probably the 58th second.  I compliment Senator Bannon on making the effort to incorporate everything but sometimes it is better not to listen to the lobby.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand the Minister&rsquo;s reference.  When I spoke on Second Stage of this Bill two weeks ago I pointed out several anomalies in the Bill and I informed the Minister I would table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The GIAI fully supports the aims of this Bill to introduce a system of registration for architects and for the elimination of rogue architects.  This <Col N="1133"/>Bill fails to prescribe the methods of assessment to be used for those seeking registration.  It gives the new registration body a free hand to choose any method of assessment it wishes.  The registration body must be independent.  Reference has been made in this House on many occasions about the independence of various bodies which are set up in the Oireachtas.  The Competition Authority has recommended the establishment of this body and it must be fair and be seen to be fair.  I wish to put my opinion on the record of the House that the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland is not independent.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments.  I accept his concerns as he said he was not fully briefed, but he should not rush his decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Minister I think it extraordinary that up to Christmas, all sides appeared to be in concurrence about this Bill but, suddenly, at the 11th hour, there has been a <i>volte face</i>.  People in general do not become exercised about legislation until they know it is on the floor of some House, be it here or in the other House.  Members forget this because we are in the business of legislation and the various Stages of Bills, and it is part of our daily lives.  However, how Bills are processed through the House is a mystery to ordinary people.  This may be our fault because we do not explain the process in detail.</P>
        <P>This Bill passed through the other House with suitable amendments and when it came to this House, the groups who believe they may be affected by the legislation woke up to the fact that this is the last post and suddenly they became very busy and active in their lobbying.  I can understand their actions.  We know that this process is at the 11th hour and groups wish to make representations, which they are entitled to do.</P>
        <P>I have met representatives from the GIAI who are concerned about the matter and I have also received information from the RIAI pointing out the misunderstanding of the GIAI.  The RIAI has stated that the use of recognition of prior learning would be inappropriate in the case of GIAI members but I do not think so.  I feel a certain empathy with the members of the GIAI who believe they are chasing or must continue to chase their rights which they have had for many years.  The RIAI states it will not control the assessment process but the Bill proposes that this will be the case.  I am at a loss to understand the position.  Four non-architects will be appointed as well as a non-architect chairperson who will be a retired judge, barrister or solicitor.  The RIAI will nominate architects to the board who will constitute a minority of three members, albeit a learned and vocal one.</P>
        <P>We had a most vivid debate on planning on the Order of Business.  I have encountered the agents, as they grandly call themselves, who act for people seeking planning permission.  If the planning permission result is satisfactory, they claim the credit and if it is not, they tell the applicants <Col N="1134"/>they did not make sufficient representations to their local representative.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Minister that something should be done about county councils who will do anything to refuse planning permission to ordinary people who want to build a home on their site in their parish in their county.  It is a disgrace that county councils carry on as they do.  Planning officials build on the tops of hills with views of beautiful lakes and verdant glens but they do not want anyone else to be given planning permission.  It does not matter how many rules and guidelines exist, they will find some way around them and they will refuse permission.  This may be off the point of the amendment.  I defend the right of anyone to lobby, as would the Minister.  However, I am willing to be reassured by the Minister that the GIAI will not lose whatever influence and clout it has in this field and that its members will continue to be enfolded in the warmth of the approval which they have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not wish it to be thought that all those who briefed me on this question of independence did so at the very last minute, because that would not be the truth.  I was making the point that a number of them just dumped in the information at the very last minute, as is their right.  The material they supplied was for use on Second Stage and not on Committee Stage.  However, this does not mean I do not hold to the principle that there should be full independence and transparency and I hope this will be accomplished by the Bill.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I certainly share the Minister&rsquo;s opinion on cowboys who set themselves up as architects.  It is unacceptable that somebody puts up a plate and describes himself or herself as an architect when they have no qualification whatever.  I do not believe that Senator Bannon will delay the House on this matter because his next series of amendments deal with the grandfather principle, whereby people have experience and academic qualifications but for various reasons do not have a degree in architecture.  These people are afraid they may be excluded and that would be a real hardship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the group of which I was speaking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator indeed spoke very well.  I believe we will be able to arrange a system of recognition for them or at least an explanation that will satisfy them.</P>
        <P>On a practical note, I respect the fact that the Minister has pushed this matter which is very important and has not been addressed for many years, but I do not believe that amendments will be accepted.  It would come as a considerable surprise to me if amendments were accepted because at this stage of the game, with a general election looming and a barrage of legislation coming to <Col N="1135"/>the House to be processed, it is unrealistic to return the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  On the basis of practical politics, it will not happen.  The Minister may surprise me but I would be very surprised and like Senator Ross&rsquo;s sheep or cows, I might well jump through somebody&rsquo;s window with the shock.</P>

        <P>The Minister is competent.  He has studied this issue and is frustrated that it is being delayed again and again, and that nothing has happened.  He is the first Minister to grasp this issue, to introduce legislation on it and to bring it through the D&aacute;il.  It is now in the Seanad and the Minister is asking whether, at this stage, we would return again to square one.  I understand his frustration but does he not understand the concerns of those individuals who may be out of a job when the Bill is passed?  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>These are experienced people.  Anyone practising in the State prior to the enactment of this legislation who can prove they had been commissioned to carry out competent work should have some method of being registered under the Bill.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will pass the Senator&rsquo;s comments to Professor Harrison.  One of the last comments referred to a planning decision made recently by An Bord Plean&aacute;la which involved a good friend of mine &mdash; I must declare an interest.  I do not wish to appear in any way to be inflexible in this regard but we should stop the messing.  The reality is that if we do a substantial rewrite of the Bill, we know it will go back to the D&aacute;il and will never see the light of day.</P>
        <P>What we see here is the worst kind of pandering to a lobby.  The concerns which are now <Col N="1138"/>being expressed were not expressed before Christmas.  Senator Leyden made the point that I was very accessible to people and met with the group because I was anxious to listen carefully, not just to the advice from my Department or the lobbying of the RIAI but to every other group involved.  As far as I could establish at an organisational level, while there may have been individuals who did not agree with the organisational unanimity, there was virtual unanimity on this matter.  The GIAI was one of the parties consulted in this process.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to correspondence going back as far as 1986.  There is a report going back as far as 1997 but there is also correspondence of lobbying that goes further back.  One of the first issues lobbied on following the foundation of the State was this issue.  It is time to cut to the chase.</P>
        <P>As Senator Quinn noted, an amendment is to be introduced as a result of the debate in this House.  Senator O&rsquo;Rourke felt the term &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; was insulting, ageist and politically incorrect.  I went back to the parliamentary draftsman and, although the phrase had been used elsewhere, I agreed with the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I love being a grandmother.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Senator does and I am sure the grandchild loves having her as a grandmother.  However, the point is this is a textual amendment which will address a point made by Senators.</P>
        <P>All parties were consulted on this issue.  All agreed that the RIAI should be the registration body, provided provisions were included in the Bill to differentiate between and protect the interests involved.  The Bill was drafted to ensure fairness and transparency, and that proper procedures were put in place.  If, at this late stage, we decide to remove all of that and try to rewrite the whole process, we will endanger the Bill for no good purpose, in spite of the fact that all who were involved in the consultation agreed on the procedures which are in the Bill.  We will endanger the Bill but we will not add one jot to the protections and the fairness provided in it.  If we do this, we will behave irresponsibly.  It would be one of those occasions where we listened to too much advice on too many occasions.  Consultation is fine and fair but, at the end of the day, decisions must be made.  This issue has dragged on interminably.</P>
        <P>I understand the point made by Senators regarding the importance of recognising practical experience as a means of securing registration under the Bill.  I already stated that on several occasions, both here and in the Lower House.  I am also aware that a number of individuals are of the view that their practical experience may not be recognised, that the technical assessment process will be more difficult than that provided <Col N="1139"/>for in the Bill and that they could possibly lose their right to an adequate livelihood.  This will not happen.  Such an eventuality would be unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>I wish to offer Senators an assurance.  The purpose of the technical assessment procedure is to allow practical experience to be assessed in order that people might qualify for registration.  As Senator Leyden stated, it is designed to give people the opportunity to present a body of professional work that can be objectively assessed.  I am at a loss to understand why an organisation that was fully involved in the consultation process should, at an extremely late stage, seem to take a view which is precisely opposite to the consensus that existed up to November last.</P>
        <P>An important point appears to have been missed in the lobby material I have seen &mdash; Members may have been presented with different material &mdash; namely, that a robust appeals process under which decisions of any board or committee, including those made by the technical assessment board, may be challenged will be put in place.  In addition, there will be an ultimate right of appeal to the High Court.  The various appeals mechanisms are, therefore, in place.  It would be a matter for the court to make a ruling on whether the technical assessment process is carried out in a fair and equitable manner.  If the technical assessment board were to behave in a way that was despotic, unfair or unjust, its decisions would be quickly struck down.</P>
        <P>The Bill regulates the right of a person to call himself or herself an architect.  That point tends to become lost in the debate.  Senator Norris referred to the point I made earlier, namely, that from the point of view of consumer protection and professional protection, it is necessary to enact this legislation.  I am not being intransigent on this issue.  However, I am mystified by the extraordinary <i>volte face</i> that has occurred in the context of professional consensus on this matter.  The technical assessment and appeals processes are robust and make provision for what was suggested.  The Competition Authority recommended that there be an independent process and an independent body.  The Bill establishes the RIAI in order to meet that recommendation.</P>
        <P>On the RIAI and the Society of Chartered Surveyors, it is interesting that none of the type of lobbying or hysteria that has marked one side of this debate has appeared on the other.  I remind Members that the roles of these bodies are separate from those of other boards or committees to be established under the Bill.  I am satisfied the procedure being put in place contains the necessary protections and provides assurances that the registration system will be open and transparent.  Moreover, the Bill makes provision for robust appeals mechanisms.  There also will be a great deal of lay representation on some of the bodies to which I refer.</P><Col N="1140"/>
        <P>If we were to proceed to entirely rewrite certain of its sections, the legislation would become imperilled.  A complete rewrite would not achieve any additional beneficial effect.  The necessary procedures, appeals process and mechanisms are in place and people&rsquo;s right of appeal remains protected.</P>
        <P>For the reasons outlined, I regret I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that acceptance of our amendments would delay the passage of the Bill.  A total of 18 Government amendments have been tabled, which means the Bill will have to be returned to the D&aacute;il.  I am concerned that the proposed registration body has made it known that architects who are seeking to be registered will be subject to academically-focused methods of assessment known as RPL.  Will the Minister clarify the position in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made a number of solid points.  I gave careful consideration to the lobby material I received and I spoke to some of the people involved.  I tried to work my way through this matter on the basis of the experience I gained in other areas.  I set aside the Competition Authority&rsquo;s view on the matter.  I accept what it is saying but I am not sure it is completely relevant to what we are discussing.</P>
        <P>The main issue I raised on Second Stage was not so much related to the involvement of the RIAI as it was to protecting the careers and professionalism of architects who are not members of that organisation.  I want to go through what I believe to be involved here and perhaps the Minister might then indicate if I am right or wrong in my assessment.</P>
        <P>What is being done here has been done in other professions in many different ways.  I was centrally involved in the establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority at a time when it was felt self-regulation should not be allowed.  However, I managed to convince the Committee of Public Accounts that it is possible to have self-regulation with oversight.  I informed some of the lobby groups that I do not have a particular difficulty with the RIAI.  However, I would have a serious difficulty if that organisation could not be trusted.  That is the issue as I see it.</P>
        <P>Leaving aside members of the RIAI, my understanding is that the institute will be the registration body but that it will not influence admissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not do so now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The admissions board will be responsible for overseeing admissions.  This board will be comprised of seven members and a chairperson.  Three of its members will be architects nominated by the RIAI, four will be nominated by the Minister and will not be architects and a <Col N="1141"/>person with a legal background will be charged with chairing the board.  As well as registering graduates from the NUI and other bodies, it will be also in a position to register those with at least seven years practical experience of performing duties commensurate with those of an architect in the State.  I am seeking an assurance that the latter will cover the people with whom I have been speaking, namely, those who are not, who never have been or who were for a time members of the RIAI.</P>
        <P>There is somewhat of a catch-22 situation regarding the four ministerial appointments.  According to the Bill, the four individuals who will be appointed by the Minister will be people who are not architects.  I would have preferred it if the relevant provision had stated that these people should be individuals who are not members of the RIAI because this would allow the Minister of the day to nominate people who are working as architects but who are not members of the RIAI.  This would have given a degree of comfort to those who have a difficulty with this matter.</P>
        <P>A person who is not a graduate of the NUI, DIT or some other body but who has practical experience will be obliged to make his or her application to the admissions board.  Theoretically, the RIAI could nominate persons who are not its members to serve on the board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Fat chance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Highly unlikely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am sure it will not do so.  In terms of the way the legislation is presented, however, it could decide to proceed in this way.  If the admissions board is unsure about or does not wish to make a decision with regard to someone applying on the basis of experience, it will be able to refer the matter to the technical assessment board.  The latter will be also comprised of seven ordinary members, three of whom will be architects and the other four will be appointed by the Minister.  Non-architects will, therefore, be predominant on both the admissions board and the technical assessment board.</P>
        <P>Am I correct in stating there is nothing in the legislation which indicates that the registration body will be in a position to intervene when the admissions board, following consultation with the technical assessment board, makes a decision and forwards it to the registrar?  If, therefore, the registrar receives a proposal from the admissions board, he or she must accept it as being final.  The person then is effectively registered.  If the person has gone through an admissions body and perhaps a technical board, and if the admissions body does not agree to register the person, can he or she appeal to the High Court?  Can an individual who has been refused admission appeal to the High Court?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1142"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, there are three structures in place.  If that were the case, I would like to hear the Minister say so.  I also would like that the persons who were nominated by the Minister might necessarily be ones from without the RIAI.  I have no difficulty with the RIAI being the registration body <i>per se</i>, but I am uneasy that its members are the only architects involved in everything.  If we assume, as the legislation does, that there are other architects who are not members of the RIAI, I ask that they be given a say in it somewhere along the way.  For me, the only issue is that the Minister would so provide.  I am sure the Minister, like me, would feel uneasy about passing legislation which put decent, hard-working, professional, responsible, successful people out of work by not being able to use the term architect.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with the protection of the term &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, just as I agree that legislation will be brought forward shortly to protect the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; and with the way in which we have protected the term &ldquo;veterinary surgeons&rdquo; here recently.  These are important consumer protection measures.  My only difference with the Minister is that I want to see recognition given in some form to those architects who are not members of the RIAI.  I would trust the processes the Minister is putting in place.  They are good and sound.  If there was a way the Minister could provide for the other architects, then that would be a comfort to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator O&rsquo;Toole for illustrating that the process is robust, is not dominated individually and is multi-tiered.  That is important because it has a bearing on the fears and concerns that have been expressed in some of the material I have seen.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct that there is a preponderance of lay persons.  In the first instance, there are the architects, the persons who will be nominated by the Minister and the person with legal experience.  As he correctly stated there is then the second separate technical assessment process, which also is not dominated by the group, and also there is a further right of appeal to the court which could not be denied in any event.</P>
        <P>The contributions of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others raised a number of issues related to the technical assessment process.  The point of the technical assessment process is to provide for registration for persons with ten or more years experience in the State performing duties commensurate with those of architect.  It is a necessary process.  Section 20 sets out the criteria for which the technical assessment panel must have regard, and that is an entirely appropriate way of dealing with it.</P>
        <P>I understand the concerns raised about the recognition of practical experience and I also am <Col N="1143"/>aware of the views of some in the profession in this regard, but the concern that practical experience would not be recognised is a false one because the technical assessment process is not based purely on the academic learning.  The idea of recognition of prior learning is not unusual and exists elsewhere.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, for example, will be aware that HETAC states that the concept of life-long learning underpins the national framework of qualification.  Recognition of prior learning is a process and, therefore, the concept is not novel.</P>
        <P>The concept of prior learning encompasses, but is not exclusively focused on, formal learning.  The concept also includes non-formal learning which is the learning of on-the-job training and informal learning which takes place through life and work experience.  The idea that recognition of prior learning is a mystery, a new system, something novel or virgin territory with which we are not familiar is false.  All of that is protected in the legislation.  Once the Bill is in force, the registration body will nominate three architect members and there will be architects who are registered but who may or may not have been members of the RIAI.  One should note that if one is registered, one need not join the RIAI.  There is a pool of architects available for appointment by the registration body.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened carefully to debate on all of the arguments.  We are in danger of getting ourselves talked into a position of sterility on an issue that needs to be changed, both from the point of view of protection of a profession and from the point of view of protecting the consumers &mdash; the latter are a major concern of mine.  As Senator Norris generously recognised, there are many Bills in my Department that could have taken precedent over this legislation, and I would have run into rather less lobbying at the last minute in those cases.  Every available opportunity to meet people&rsquo;s reasonable concerns has been taken in this legislation.  As I stated, there was agreement on the legislation right up to the end of last year.  Senator Leyden was correct to remind me that there were one or two individuals who are outside any of the professional groups and, in fairness, I sought to meet them as well because I believed they also had a view.</P>
        <P>All of the concerns raised have been answered.  Persons are not being forced into the RIAI and there is a robust technical assessment system which will take account of life-long experiential learning, which is the point made by Senators Leyden and O&rsquo;Rourke.  Our long-established procedures recognise prior learning and we know what that entails from, for example, HETAC and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The point was made twice here that it was just about academic learning but that is disingenuous.  The lobby which has suggested it is simply not reading the Bill.  The reality is that prior learning is formal learning, non-formal and informal learn<Col N="1144"/>ing as well as experience over the years, and all of that is dealt with robustly.  For all of those reasons I will not be accepting the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The groups which cause me concern are those I mentioned with years of experience working as architects.  First, in the Minister&rsquo;s considered view would those who are working successfully as architects within the State encounter any difficulty in becoming registered?  Is there any reason they would not be registered?  Will they encounter difficulty in becoming registered?  If they did, I would take up their cause in that respect because it would be unfair.</P>
        <P>Second, if they get through the registration hurdle and may call themselves registered architects but are not members of the RIAI, is there a danger that they would not be able to influence the development of their profession in the future, in other words, is such influence maintained within the RIAI?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are two fair questions.  On the first question, there is no reason for professional people with expertise to fear.  There are many distinguished people who operated as architects in this State over the years who did not necessarily have that formal arrangement.  They are not in any way imperilled by this.  That was the point Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised earlier and I apologise for not addressing it.  There is no rational reason that such persons should have any fears or concerns about this because if it arises for technical assessment, they will present their own work.  This was the point Senator Leyden raised during our last debate on this matter.  When we have completed the set-up period and the process is underway, people who are not members of the RIAI but who have been recognised as architects will be able to serve after election by their own organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Will all registered people have votes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course.  I do not wish to appear impatient but I cannot understand why these arguments were made, particularly given that it is in the profession&rsquo;s interest, including those who have entered it through experience, to proceed with this legislation.  Consultations have been carried out, my door has been open and I have answered most of the e-mails I personally received.  I have met people who put forward coherent arguments, as well as one or two who made arguments that were not necessarily coherent.  I simply do not understand why we should change the legislation at this late stage.  I accept the points made by Senator Bannon but this process has already undergone almost 80 years of lobbying.  If any legislation ever deserved enactment without further chatter, it is this Bill.  I will be bringing several amendments which were drafted on foot of listening to the cogent argu<Col N="1145"/>ments made in this House.  If I have a fault, it is perhaps that I listen too often.  With regard to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s question, I have received the agreement of the Parliamentary Counsel that the changes do not imperil the Bill&rsquo;s process.  The matter has been fully addressed.</P>
        <P>A person who is an architect can of course go forward for nomination.  People who remain fearful of being dragged kicking and screaming into that dreadful body, the RIAI, need fear no longer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Several Senators, and Senators Leyden and O&rsquo;Rourke in particular, expressed concern on Second Stage about the use of the term &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; and its relevance to modern parliamentary language.  I have considered those views and, having looked at the record of the debate, I accept their well-made argument that the use of the term was patronising, carried connotations of ageism and did not agree with modern parliamentary language.  During debate on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, an amendment was accepted which defined the term in respect of a certain category of applicants.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is also of the view that an amendment is necessary because it believed the reference to &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; was inappropriate and politically incorrect and should be substituted by the more appropriate definition, &ldquo;practical experience assessment procedures&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am unable to accept amendments No. 4 and 5 because they are contradictory to amendments Nos. 3 and 6.  Amendment No. 6 provides for the definition &ldquo;practical experience assessment procedures&rdquo;, as advised by the Parliamentary Counsel.  That definition is relevant to sections 19, 20, 34 and 48.  Senator Bannon was correct to state that a raft of Government amendments are being brought in but they are intended to replace the words &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; with four words which more appropriately describe the specific concept.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1146"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What are those four words?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Practical experience assessment procedure&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The technical assessment board will be established under section 19 to assess eligibility for recognition of persons with ten or more years experience in this State of performing duties commensurate with those of architects.  Section 20 sets out the procedures for assessment and includes the requirement that an applicant submits to the board a curriculum vitae providing details of the work carried out by him or her in the field of architecture, information on projects carried out during the ten-year period of practice and a file containing at least four projects for which the applicant was responsible.  The documents submitted will be subject to independent verification.</P>
        <P>These are not onerous requirements and the people we have in mind would have no difficulty in meeting them.  Architects who operate professionally and provide good services should have no concerns with regard to meeting the requirements.  I hope Senators will acknowledge that the provisions clearly demonstrate practical experience will be fully considered as part of the assessment process.  Moreover, the criteria set out in section 20 are fair and transparent.  It will be the responsibility of the technical assessment board to operate in a fair and equitable manner.  The legislation provides for that in a complete manner.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 19, 49 and 51 are technical amendments consequential to the new definition of the term &ldquo;practical experience assessment procedures&rdquo; in section 2 and have been recommended by the Parliamentary Counsel.  The amendments will apply to categories of architects and surveyors who undergo technical assessments.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 43, 50 and 52 are consequential and arise from the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel following Second Stage debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for considering the issues I raised on Second Stage.  The term &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; was somewhat ageist but he has addressed the issue very well.</P>
        <P>I also welcome his response to Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others regarding the concerns of individuals who wish to continue practising their professions.  As a practising politician and someone with vast constituency experience, he is conscious of such concerns.  It would be unconstitutional to deprive a person of the right to a livelihood if he or she is at all reasonable in terms of practising a profession.  The Department compiles a formal list, to which some have applied.  Unfortunately, those who failed to apply are concerned because they are not on the list.  Senator O&rsquo;Rourke and I have been approached by a certain individual who I consider very competent but for some reason was not accepted.  The numbers <Col N="1147"/>involved are small and I can only cite two people who approached me on the matter.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s frustration regarding people coming out of the woodwork at this late stage but the issue has passed through a variety of Ministers and Departments.  I do not understand why it was dealt with at one stage by the former Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, who was a member of the RIAI.  He was seemingly more than favourable to the RIAI.  He is probably listening to this debate but he cannot deny that.  It creates a little concern.  Did the Minister consider setting up a council of surveyors to alleviate that concern?  John Lynch has campaigned strongly on this issue.  This is a democracy and we are putting forward his views as an individual.  The Minister&rsquo;s response is on the record and I will transmit that to Mr. Lynch.  The Minister has been more than open to meeting people in his constituency or in Leinster House regarding this legislation and he has given them a good hearing.  He has responded to our representations.</P>
        <P>The IPU has not been given responsibility to register pharmacists and pharmacies, although the union has an input and it is involved with its members.  I raised this issue on Second Stage and the Minister has inserted an appeals procedures, as a result of which this issue will not arise when the legislation is enacted.  People entering the pharmaceutical profession will be aware of the procedures that must be followed to obtain qualifications.  I am reassured by the Minister&rsquo;s comments that if those who have atypical qualifications forward their curriculum vitae to the board, they will be successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been heavily lobbied on this legislation.  Section 20 outlines the criteria that will be used by the technical assessment board and they cover all eventualities.  However, no reference is made to academic qualifications or requirements.  The appeals system provided for under section 22 is stringent and robust.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, three different layers of assessment will be involved.  Consideration should be given to those who have spent a lifetime working as architects but who hold related qualifications.  The Minister&rsquo;s reassurances will go a long way to allaying the fears of those working in this field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a little hesitation about this.  Amendment No. 5 is so broad that it could cover people such as Mr. Grant who operated in Gardiner Street, Dublin, and behaved in the most disgraceful fashion.  I would not like to see that.  Per<Col N="1148"/>haps licence will not be given to people who posed as architects in the past because a qualifications system and an assessment board will be in place.  Giving a blanket acknowledgement might be risky.</P>
        <P>However, to balance that, I have had discussions with very responsible people who took time out of busy lives to talk in detail about the issues involved.  During the 1960s and 1970s, they attempted to gain entry to the schools of architecture in UCD and Bolton Street but the courses were full because of the limited number of places.  Although they had sufficient points and an academic entitlement to take up the course, they were not in the top 30 or among the first applicants and, therefore, they did not gain entry to the course.  They were perfectly suitable candidates and, as a consequence, they pursued courses in draughtmanship, technical drawing and engineering.  They met the requirements to practise as architects.  They, therefore, have appropriate architectural qualifications, they have considerable experience and they have been employed at a senior level in architectural practices.  One man who visited me was a senior partner in a firm.  Those who have the experience, the portfolio and academic qualifications in an area clearly related to architecture are in a good position.</P>
        <P>Another worry expressed by the individuals I met concerned the portfolio criterion, under which they felt they could be required to demonstrate experience, for example,  in 100 different areas.  They would have to laboriously outline that from a specific drawing they learned how to put a screw in a gutter.  If that is the case, it is not fair because that will impose a higher standard than is appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>There is a group of persons that was not well served by the third level institutions.  Although there was a demand for architects at the time and theses individuals were entitled to a place, they were denied on the basis of a lack of places on the course.  They then undertook parallel courses and obtained academic qualifications.  They have a track record and they should be able to register easily.  This situation is historic and it will not recur.  They should be treated favourably but, at the same time, I would not like a portmanteau clause whereby anybody who is practising should be registered automatically.  Perhaps I am wrong about this but I do not like it.</P>
        <P>I refer to people like the gentleman in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency who could not draw two lines on a piece of paper and who did some scandalous work, which he tried to dump on the county councillors.  For the first and perhaps only time in my life, I felt a twinge of sympathy for county councillors when the Minister referred to this.  I would hate to think that individuals such as this would receive favourable treatment.  However, a strong argument can be made on behalf of those I referred to earlier and about whom Senator O&rsquo;Rourke spoke so convincingly.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for taking the trouble to read the report of the Second Stage debate.  I acknowledge the he studied our comments and then deleted the grandfather clause.  It was a funny clause, which I disliked intensely, and I thank him for deleting it.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  I still have republican feelings and when the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; was tagged on to a title, it would make one say &ldquo;Oh my God&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was very vague and Senator Leyden spoke about his views which are are not included in the Bill.  What is contained in it is what is important.  A Minister can express views inside or outside the House, but what is contained in the Bill is what matters.</P>
        <P>The Bill is of concern to many because, if enacted in its current form, it has the potential to deprive some members of the GIAI and others of their constitutional right to earn a living as an architect.  This is of great concern to me.  The Minister should acknowledge the established right of those practising for many years but without formal qualifications.  This is not fully acknowledged in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The two amendments I have tabled propose minor but very important changes to the definition of the &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo;.  The Minister referred to comments made on the last occasion we discussed the Bill.  It is crucial that the established right of a person falling within a certain category is expressed and recognised.</P>
        <P>In regard to the RIAI proposing an assessment system which would provide for the acknowledgement of the established right to practise for those without formal qualifications using uniform, fair and open procedures, it is important this is included in the Bill.  My amendment would copperfasten it.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to take my two amendments on board.  There is much concern <Col N="1150"/>that he is not taking on board the concerns expressed.  On the last occasion we discussed the Bill he indicated he would give them due consideration on Committee Stage.  Politics is about people and being a good listener.  All I ask is that the Minister listen and implement policies which are people-friendly and protect their jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am utterly mystified by Senator Bannon&rsquo;s contribution.  The amendment I have tabled provides precisely for what he has asked.  I am also mystified by his suggestion that the legislation does not deal with the objectivity of the assessment process.  Section 20 states that &ldquo;a person who makes an application under this section shall submit the following...&rdquo;.  It goes on to outline the objective matter to be submitted.  Amendment No. 6 provides for practical experience assessment procedures.  We have reached a situation in this House where Members are listening to one lobby only and not reading legislation.  That is the only objective, rational assessment I can make.  There is no logic in the Senator saying we are not doing something when we are providing in the Bill for precisely what he has asked.  If he looks at amendment No. 6, he will see that<?oasys _jy ?>&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;practical experience assessment procedures&rdquo; means the procedures under. . .&rdquo;.  To suggest in impassioned terms that somehow or other we are not listening, that we are not doing precisely what he has asked for and that somebody who meets the objective criteria will be thrown out of his or her job is nonsense.  It does not make any sense.  What the Senator has asked for is encompassed in amendments Nos. 3 and 6.  It could not be more clear-cut than the way in which it is set out in those amendments.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris made a very interesting contribution about the pre-points system of admission to universities.  He was right in that regard.  Those of us who went through the university system before 1977 entered universities in which there was much patronage and a degree of nepotism.  The Senator was right that if one wanted to enter certain faculties, one did not necessarily do so on the basis of one&rsquo;s academic capacity.  Many good people were prohibited from entering the professional faculties simply because they could not get in.  I say this as someone who was in university before the points system was introduced and who wished to gain access to a faculty other than the one in which I studied.  I saw the radical change brought about following the introduction of the points system in 1977.  The Senator was correct that the system in place before 1977 was bad and inappropriate.  There is no doubt that the system introduced since is a murder machine because the emphasis now is on points.</P>
        <P>The Senator had two concerns.  Oddly enough, one of them was the exact opposite, in many ways, of the concerns expressed by Senator Bannon who does not seem to have fully taken on board the import of the changes made in the amendments I have tabled.  If he reads them <Col N="1151"/>again, he will see that they fully take on board his concerns.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris has made the counter point that he does not want a portmanteau clause which will allows anybody, including the chancer to whom I referred, to become an architect.  That is not the purpose of the Bill and it will not be possible when enacted.  If the person I have in mind presented the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of work he has presented to an assessment board, it will not come through the process.  It is not quality work and has caused untold pain and difficulties for people who have gone through the planning process.  It is not unique to County Wicklow; it has happened elsewhere.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A concern which has not been mentioned and which sadly has been absent from much of the debate relates to consumer protection.  When one goes to somebody who calls himself or herself an architect, one goes believing a body of work will be produced which will stand up to scrutiny.  When one sees some of the work submitted to planning departments, one sees there is a dire need for this change from the point of view of consumer protection.</P>
        <P>I suggest Senator Bannon look again at amendments Nos. 3 and 6 which fulfil the objective he seeks to achieve.  He is right that we are enacting the Bill, not the wishes or views of a Minister.  The Bill provides for what the technical assessment board should be mindful of, on which amendments Nos. 3 and 6 elaborate further.</P>

	<P>The Minister has not made the position crystal clear.  I refer to the avoidance of doubt about a conflict of interest in regard to the regulations and registration process.  Representation is an important function of special interest groups and others such as the RIAI.  The Architects Council of Ireland should be included.  The Minister should do this.  I request him to broaden the scope of the Bill to include the council in all the functions of the regulation that will be carried out by this division.  Perhaps the Minister will consider the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, 12 and 13 are related.  The amendments <Col N="1154"/>provide for the recoupment by local councils of the costs incurred in the taking of enforcement measures by authorities in breaches of the building code.  The amendments arose from proceedings on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, accepted their principle and promised that further consideration would be given to them at an appropriate time.  I now propose a suitable text that will give effect to the outcome of the debate that took place in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>A number of issues have been raised by the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland and I am glad to propose them for inclusion in the Bill.  One of my greatest disappointments as a councillor, Senator, Deputy and Minister is that people are still blind to the difficulties of those who are wheelchair bound or who suffer from a disability, particularly in respect of access.  One would have thought that by now everyone involved in planning at any point would automatically consider the issue of access.  However, these requests were made and will be included in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8, 10 and 12 provide for amendments to sections 8 to 10, inclusive, to provide for the recoupment by council authorities of any costs or expenses reasonably incurred by an authority in the taking of enforcement procedures.  It also applies where the application has been made under section 9 to the District Court by a person for an annulment, modification or alteration of an enforcement notice served.  In addition, it applies to costs incurred by authorities in making application to the Circuit Court or the High Court under section 12 of the 1990 Act for an order of removal, alteration, discontinuation of works or making safe any building or prohibiting or restricting the use of any building under a fire safety certificate, a disability access certificate or a regularisation certificate.  The cost may include the cost of investigation and the detection of matters, the issue of warnings prior to the service of the notice and the remuneration or any other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers involved in the process.  The costs may be recouped as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Amendment No. 13 which is consequential is a renumbering amendment.</P>
        <P>As a general principle, when enforcement procedures must be followed, the taxpayer should not be obliged to bear the cost.  From my experience in my constituency of dealing with issues such illegal dumping, I am aware that massive legal and investigative costs were incurred which ultimately fell on the taxpayer.  There is something fundamentally wrong with this.  Those who set out to do wrong should be obliged to bear the full cost of their wrongdoing.  Consequently, the legislation will be strengthened by this measure <Col N="1155"/>and the changes will be welcomed, as they were in the other House.</P>

	<P>I completely accept the Minister&rsquo;s point about wheelchair access in new buildings.  It is essential that this is recognised on every occasion.  I assume it pertains to any new building where this is not taken into account.  I happen to have been involved in a business that always used trolleys and, consequently, this did not constitute a problem.  On that basis, one could not have steps.  However, I have seen many instances in which wheelchairs have not been provided for in new buildings.  A strong message should be sent, as the Minister has done on this occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Disability Authority, NDA, has produced a number of documents on accessibility of buildings for disabled people.  In its submission to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the review of Part M of the building regulations the NDA recommended, among other provisions, that the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; used in Part M should include a reference to the Disability Act 2005.  It also recommended the inclusion of those with a range of impairments, including those with hearing difficulties, to which I have referred, speech and other impairments limiting mobility, as well as hand and arm movements, etc.  Technical guidance standards for non-residential buildings in key problem areas should be raised to best international standards.  Several documents have referred to this and those of us in constant communication with people with disabilities know this should happen.  I would welcome the standards set out in Part M being reflected in other parts of the building regulations.</P>
        <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland proposed the Bill be amended to increase the sanctions for breach of the building regulations in the Bill.  Amendments have been tabled to increase fines and ensure the costs of the enforcement authorities for the investigation and prosecution of a breach in regu<Col N="1156"/>lations are carried by those who are non-compliant.  This should happen, as should publishing the consultation process before work commences on any construction in all major public developments.  As well as this, regulations in the Bill regarding disability access and the use of a building should be the same as in current building regulations.  An access statement should also be part of a planning application.  It is important that these be done.</P>
        <P>My party tabled amendments in the D&aacute;il which would have covered many of these recommendations.  Unfortunately, they were considered unnecessary and rejected by the Government.  I was greatly disappointed when I read the Official Report of the D&aacute;il debate and the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this issue.  I wish to put on record my concerns and I hope the Minister will address them.</P>

	<P>Senator Bannon did well until the last two sentences and I was going to congratulate him on his positive response.  If one examines what was said in the D&aacute;il, one will see I promised I would consider it further and this amendment faithfully incorporates what was discussed.  It is the specific point of this amendment.</P>
        <P>This issue of access is very important.  It is a matter of scandal that people still design buildings without having access in mind.  It is true not only in non-residential areas but also in residential areas.  Last night, I answered an e-mail from a constituent who moved into a new house and was delighted because it was wheelchair accessible.  It is only wheelchair accessible through the back door.  What kind of message does this give?  More thought must be given to this area.  This amendment takes on board the requests lodged by the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bannon mentioned Part M of the building regulations in passing.  A review of Part M was initiated and is under way.  Consultation must take place on this and it will be held with disability groups, which is appropriate because these are the groups one listens to in this area.  The consultation document will be published later this year.  It is important we evolve the thinking in Part M.  Senator Bannon is correct to state other access issues arise apart from purely physical access issues.  This is why the disability groups will be intimately involved in the consultation process.  Part M is good and we need to move beyond it and build on what is good.  I thank Senator Bannon for his positive comments.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister consider having discussions with senior planners in various local authorities?  I am greatly concerned about the tastes of particular planners.  In some parts of the country, a view is held that those building new houses should install smaller or narrower windows.  Recently, I was brought into a house and shown a window forced on a couple.  The window <Col N="1157"/>is a fire hazard.  This should not be the case.  Broad guidelines should be in place on the size and quality of windows installed in public buildings in the interests of the safety of the public.</P>
        <P>This issue must be addressed with a degree of urgency.  In one part of the country, planners want large windows and in another area, they want small windows.  It does not make sense.  The Minister&rsquo;s taste and mine may differ in this regard.  I may be keen on a large window while the Minister&rsquo;s taste may be for a smaller one.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, a commitment was made to give further consideration to amendments which had been tabled.  These concerned the increases in fines for breaches of the building code.  Section 9 of the Bill already provides for substantial increases in fines.  A fine of &euro;5,000 already cited in the Bill was increased from &pound;800.  I am advised &euro;5,000 is the maximum fine for the jurisdiction of the District Court and, accordingly, it is outside my remit to propose to increase it.</P>
        <P>The section originally provided for an amendment to section 9 to provide for an increase in the maximum fine for conviction on indictment from &euro;10,000 to &euro;25,000.  However, in light of the debate in the D&aacute;il, I propose to increase the original fine further to &euro;50,000.  We will make substantial changes in the level of fines.  I hope Senators from all parties will welcome the amendment which will act as a deterrent for those who may consider it profitable to be non-com<Col N="1159"/>pliant with building regulations.  It applies to the totality of the building regulations.  It is part of my philosophy that people involved in building who know the regulations and decide they will ignore them must bear the full cost and consequence of their actions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a comment.  Section 12(2)(<i>f</i>) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">a person who&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>i</i>) has at least 7 years&rsquo; practical experience of performing duties commensurate with those of an architect in the State,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>ii</i>) is at least 35 years of age[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">Why is there a minimum age of 35?  I believe the minimum age stipulation still exists for presidents in America, but I cannot remember what it is for our president.  It may be 35 years of age as well.  I would question this stipulation in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s actions in arranging for somebody to be able to practise on this basis are very worthy in that people must have at least seven years&rsquo; practical experience of performing duties commensurate with those of an architect in the State and have passed a prescribed register <Col N="1161"/>admission examination.  Why would we need the age stipulation in that case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a well made point.  I queried why this was included.  It emerged during the course of discussions because it was supposed to take into account the domestic circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Maturity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not even sure maturity necessarily applies.  When the Senator mentioned it I knew there was something odd about the age limit of 35 applying, as it does to the American presidency.  It is not necessarily true that maturity, logic or common sense would follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The stipulation exists because it arose from consultations.  If my memory serves, the explanation I received was that it was meant to capture experience and the reality that conditions have changed.  Senator Norris made the point that changes occurred in 1977 when there were different forms of access to university.  The stipulation is meant to capture such changes.</P>
        <P>It is amazing that the Senator is the first person to mention this in either House, and the Bill has received a fair hearing in both Houses.  I am not enamoured of general age requirements, but this arose from consultations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand exactly the wording and I can picture Frank Lloyd Wright, mentioned earlier as someone who is one of those exceptions.  It would be a shame if a young<?oasys _jy ?>Mozart-like person, an achiever at seven or eight who passes examinations at 22, 25, 28 or 29, would be excluded from becoming an architect until he or she was 35 because of age.  I do not know if it is too late for the Minister to reconsider the matter at this late stage.</P>
        <P>If it is not too late for an amendment I would suggest that section 12 should be adjusted by the removal of the age limit in total.  This would leave the stipulations of seven years of experience and a requirement to pass suitable examinations, as referred to in subparagraphs (<i>i</i>) and (<i>iii</i>).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the point made by the Senator, especially if there were a genius out there.  I believe it could apply to those who have started in an academic course but had to drop out due to illness or domestic and financial reasons.  The age limit came out of discussions and has not been raised to date.  It should be read in the context of the entire section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is section 12(2)(<i>f</i>)(<i>ii</i>).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately there is no amendment on the issue at this stage and none has been proposed at any point.  It is a well made point but it arose out of discussions, specifically because <Col N="1162"/>circumstances had changed.  It was meant to reflect the reality that it is easier to get access to courses for the profession, or rather that courses for the profession are more democratically governed today by the points system, etc. than they may have been in the past.  That is the point which is captured here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand that.  I would argue on regularly against the sort of ageism that is coming in, although it is usually ageism in the other way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It very often comes about from a group of people who are probably well over the age of 35 themselves and would regard 35 as being quite young.  I will not push the matter at this stage but it seems a shame it was not mentioned earlier.  It is a flaw, or at least a defect, in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite our full debate, we only failed to reach one Government amendment.  I thank Senators because the Bill has been improved in the Seanad.  On the 35 years of age matter, I share Senators&rsquo; general antipathy to the creeping ageism in society and to the fact that ageism cuts both ways.  While it was done previously, it is not possible to decide on the floor of the House to change something without reverting to the Parliamentary Counsel for good and prudent reasons.</P>
        <P>We had a long debate on this good and long overdue legislation.  I look forward to it becoming law and resolving a lacuna concerning protection for the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo; and the consumer, who can be forced to deal with people who use the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo; almost fraudulently.  The other amendments, particularly those on fines and access, which we did not have time to discuss, comprise good legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the Bill.  It is contentious in certain <Col N="1164"/>areas, but the Minister has paid attention to our queries and concerns and has found an acceptable balance.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Bannon, I regret that we did not continue for five minutes.  Perhaps I should have got to my feet and requested an extension.  I do not like the thought of a guillotine and this is one of the first instances of a guillotine being applied in the House that I have seen.</P>

	<P>There was no proposal to extend the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister would have responded, but he listened to the discussion.  When I first entered the House, I wondered about how I would examine Bills and I decided to look for the customer in every Bill.  In a hospital Bill, the customer is the patient.  In an education Bill, the customer is the student.  In this case, the customer is the architect&rsquo;s client, not the architect.  On that basis, we have paid attention to and listened carefully to the opinions of customers.  I congratulate the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials.  This legislation will have a significant effect, particularly from a consumer&rsquo;s point of view.  It is a considerable step forward in terms of disability access and follows on from other legislation.  I congratulate the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Quinn, I am disappointed that the Bill has been guillotined.  Everyone&rsquo;s point of view should be taken into consideration, but it is unfortunate that the Leader did not supply enough time for the discussion.  I had a number of valid points, but I will make them at a later stage.  The Minister has assured the House that the Bill will not impact on anyone&rsquo;s livelihood, which is an important matter.  I hope the Minister sees through his commitment that everyone will get a fair deal and no one will lose his or her livelihood.  I thank the Minister and his officials for taking the Bill in the House this afternoon.</P>

Amendments Nos. 25 and 27 are consequential on amendment No. 26.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 23 to 27, inclusive, are being discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy McDowell, back to the House.  I reiterate that I have to declare an interest in this matter as a director of Independent Newspapers and a writer.  I was also involved in the working party which prepared the proposals for the Press Council.  I will not delay the Minister too long on this amendment.  I would not die on the ditch for the particular wording proposed but I ask the Minister to consider a particular point.  I agree with the essence of what he is trying to do, which is to ensure apologies are timely and proportionate.  They should be timely in the sense that they should be published quickly, before people forget about the original matter, and proportionate in the sense that the same prominence should be given to the apology as was given to the original statement.  It would not be right to print an apology among the small ads at the back if the original article which caused offence was printed on page 1.  Justice will be done if we ensure apologies are timely and proportionate.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the Bill, as drafted, appears to contain an implication that judges should specify the date, time, space and place on which and in which apologies shall be published.  With all respect, judges are not editors of newspapers.  This provision disregards the process by which newspapers are produced.  It also disregards the possibility that on the day a judge ordered that an apology be made the front page story might be that of a tsunami or another natural disaster having happening or another event of major public interest.  I would prefer if the Minister would include a provision along the lines I suggest, namely, that the apology would be included in a timely and proportionate way and with due prominence and, if he wishes, with the proviso that the person concerned would have the opportunity to return to court if he or she is not satisfied with the apology given, when the court could then deal with the newspaper concerned for contempt for not having carried out the order of the court.  It is right that the court should order a correction, give some idea of the prominence and the proportionality of it, but it would be helpful <Col N="1166"/>if the Minister would have regard for the difficulty of producing newspapers and the difficulty that would be created by a judge specifying in fine detail where and how the correction should made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hayes&rsquo;s view.  All too often apologies have been published in some obscure section of a newspaper which related initially to a front-page article that was the subject of the libel.  It is important that an apology would be given the prominence given to the original article published.  The timing of the apology, which the amendment proposes should be given in a timely fashion, is an important aspect.  It should be made as soon as possible following publication of the article.  An amendment, such as that proposed by Senator Hayes, should be incorporated in the Bill.  It would be an important addition to it and it should be made.  Any just person would consider that an apology should be made and should be given as much prominence as the original article.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is honourable of Senator Maurice Hayes to declare his interest in this area.  This is a good and appropriate amendment and it is in the interests of the ordinary Joe Soap whose case I have been trying to make here.  This amendment is important.  If one is libelled or defamed on the front page of a newspaper by the publication of an unpleasant article, an apology for that should be given equal prominence.  However, there are certain circumstances where it would be no harm for the newspaper concerned to contact the aggrieved person.  </P>
        <P>In a recent case reference was made to a garda whose wife died in tragic circumstances and much play was made of the fact that the garda was involved in the Abbeylara case.  That prompted an enormous storm of controversy and a considerable number of people said they would not buy the <i>Sunday Independent </i>subsequently.  There was a commercial angle to this case.  A week later the editor put an apology on the frontpage of that newspaper.  I am not sure how appropriate that was.  I cannot speculate on the motives of those concerned as to whether they were genuine; they may well have had as much to do with circulation figures as anything else.  If a person was grieving and had his or her grief exacerbated by an unpleasant article, it is unlikely that pain would be salved by the matter being carried on the frontpage of the newspaper the next week again, even with an apology, because it would rub salt into the wound caused by the original offence &mdash; at least that is what I would feel if I was the person involved.</P>
        <P>I recognise it is a difficult situation for an editor but there should be the possibility of some degree of contact.  There was no question of damages in this case, as far as I know, because up to now we cannot be accused of libelling the dead, although I intend to table an amendment on that issue.  I <Col N="1167"/>am keen to support the making of an apology for such an offence.</P>
        <P>I was ambushed on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday night by a little squirt who made me think of Alexander Pope&rsquo;s lines about Grub Street: &ldquo;Yet let me flap that gilded bug ... that stinks and stings&rdquo;.  He referred to the fact, completely out of context in my opinion, that I had taken legal advice about an article that appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i>.  That article stated that I was the kind of person who would buzz off to Iraq because I opposed the war and pin medals on Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s two sons, Uday and Qusay, to reward them for torturing and murdering their own people.  I have been to Iraq.  No flights were available.  We had to go through the desert and when I inquired, on getting back to Jordan, why it was necessary to travel at 120 miles an hour through the desert, which was rather uncomfortable and gave me vehicle sickness, I was told it was because they had not been able to get insurance because of the number of people who were shooting at our types of vehicles.  I had a blazing row about human rights with the Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz.  I did not relish the fact, therefore, that my reputation was being taken away from me by being told that I was a supporter of Saddam Hussein.  I was one of the people who opposed him on human rights grounds from day one when Rumsfeld and the rest of them were colluding with him.</P>
        <P>I sought an apology but I was met with silence.  I then got my lawyers to make the initial moves towards suing.  We settled before the case came to court.  I got an apology and a moderate sum of money, most of which was devoured by the lawyers, but what I wanted was the apology.  I was told that I had a hissy fit &mdash; that was the expression used.  I wonder if the fact that I was ambushed on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; prompted  the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i>, which I have never infected my eyeballs by reading, to repeat a scurrilous article from its trashy sister, <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>, of some years ago in the past few weeks.  I also had an entire column devoted to me by Fintan O&rsquo;Toole, who is a fine journalist, but never in my life have I read an article by him which referred to the Seanad.  I wonder, because I am a naive person, if that could all be coincidence or could it have some relation to the type of comments I was making here in the House.  Is that the reason so many of my colleagues are a little wary of taking on the newspapers?  I am not at all bothered about that.</P>
        <P>That particular journalist is a stranger to the truth, to put it diplomatically, because I said on that programme that he described the Dalai Lama in a certain way.  It probably will not appear in the Official Report because it is vulgar but he said the Dalai Lama was a gobshite.  I did not believe that was appropriate.  He made many more vulgar remarks which I will not put&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought so too.  That is why I reprimanded him over it but the net effect of it was that he denied it and said he called him a goblin.  I have the evidence of what he said.  That is the type of behaviour of which I do not approve.  When one seeks an apology and it is not given one then has to sue and that is a fairly dicey game.  The individual who takes on a newspaper must have a great deal of courage, bipolar syndrome or a great deal of money behind him or her.  It can be nerve-wracking but if one believes one&rsquo;s reputation is impugned and one goes after the person responsible, he or she will not give an apology until one has them by the throat, and then they will try to do one afterwards.  </P>
        <P>Does anybody remember when the same stable of newspapers libelled the late Niall Andrews and he sued?  They laid in wait for him.  It took about 18 months but by God they got him.  That is what people are afraid of.  That is why it is appropriate that an apology should be given and it should be given the same prominence as the original article but lets us not be foolish and naive in these matters because there are people who will punish one for telling the truth.  There are people who do not know or care about the truth and who print stories in order to sell newspapers.  We in this House are barking mad to attempt to create two tiers of people.  If this Bill goes through, and I sincerely hope it does not, people like us in public life will be fair game.  The media can lie as much as they like about us because they will have every kind of available defence and although they will be able to apologise, we will not be able to use the apology.  Therefore, this is a good amendment and while I respect Senator Maurice Hayes for tabling it, I am deeply concerned about much of the rest of the contents of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I accept libel is a terrifying experience, especially for the person being sued.  I have been on both ends of this game, although I was not all that terrified in my case.  I do not have long pockets but I am an up and down kind of person.  I will table an amendment to say that the person who shall be liable for damages and costs shall be the proprietor of the newspaper and the editor because the buck should stop at the top desk.  The individual journalist should not be penalised in this way.  I am involved in a form of balancing act.  I am passionately on the side of the small person who may be crucified by newspapers which, by and large, do not give a damn, and the more English papers enter the market, the less they give a damn.  As a fellow journalist with many friends who are journalists, however, I also have a good deal of sympathy for people who are subject to libel actions because this could be disastrous for a person who is individually liable.</P>
        <P>I welcome this amendment but there is a lot more work to be done.  As the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s colleague, the senior partner in the arrangement, <Col N="1169"/>might say, &ldquo;Some done, a lot more to do&rdquo;.  I hope we can either get rid of this Bill or else make it more amenable to the rights of ordinary people as well as politicians who are merely ordinary people who accept a further level of responsibility on behalf of the community.  They should not be penalised simply because they take on this role.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Before Senator Norris had started speaking I indicated I wished to speak on these amendments but if I had heard him first I probably would not have indicated because it is not too easy to follow his contribution.  I watched him on television the other night and I admired the passion with which he made his point.  He left nobody in any doubt as to his views on aspects of this Bill.  I applaud him because it is courageous for politicians to take a stand, especially where it is in opposition to a newspaper.  The media contain a significant minority that do not fall into the category of responsible people.  One can expose oneself to being excoriated by being critical of the media.  The media, which rightly demand and maintain the prerogative to be critical of others, seem to operate to a different standard when it comes to themselves.</P>
        <P>I am persuaded by Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s amendment and I note the Government amendment No. 26 in this regard.  The granting of judicial discretion is good but I do not understand how it is either necessary or desirable in this instance.  On Second Stage I argued that if somebody is defamed, the very least that should happen is that the publication of an apology would be published on the same page as the original incorrect article.  My desire would be that any such apology would be published on the front page and I see no reason this should not be so.</P>
        <P>The defence of fair and reasonable publication as proposed in the Bill is to be welcomed.  However, aspects of the Bill need to be rebalanced because it seems the average person will have no possibility of any entitlement to remedying his or her good name or reputation without risking all their finances gained in a lifetime.  This is an invidious position for people.  I hope the House will achieve a rebalancing of the Bill.  I am not certain the Minister will go as far as I would like him to and require the apology to be put on the front page.  If an apology is on the front page, some newspapers would have many apology notices appearing on the front page which it is to be hoped would damage their circulation and credibility and so act as a deterrent to the newspaper industry.</P>
        <P>Arguments have been put forward for the establishment of a press council to improve and maintain adherence to a code of conduct for newspapers, and I am in agreement.  However, I concede that Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s amendment is probably more balanced than my line of argument.  I ask the Minister to consider the Senator&rsquo;s proposal positively as it is not an area that would require judicial discretion.</P>

	<P>I am a little mystified by the reaction to Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s amendment.  I am speaking to the Government amendment which is preferable.  Even though it has been praised by Senator Norris, Senator Hayes&rsquo;s amendment No. 23 would have the effect of removing entirely subsection 28(2) from the Bill and therefore remove the capacity of the court to specify the time or date or the form or content.  In those circumstances the Government amendment No. 26 is preferable.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, subsection (2), lines 7 and 8, to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)  specify&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) the date and time upon which, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) the period not later than the expiration of which,the correction order shall be published, and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 28(2)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;the form, content, extent and manner of publication of the correction&rdquo;.  This will stand in the Bill after the Government amendment is made but it would not stand if Senator Hayes&rsquo;s amendment were made.</P>
        <P>Senators Jim Walsh and Norris were being unduly generous in their praise for Senator Hayes because he was in fact proposing a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;significant dilution of what they were talking about.  In fairness to Senator Hayes he proposes that there should be an obligation in the order to give due prominence to the correction order to ensure it is communicated to all or substantially all the people involved.  This formula is already in place as set out in the last paragraph of section 28(2).  Senator Hayes is somewhat less prescriptive in his approach than the original Government text or the Government amendment.  The change is that the Government amendment allows a choice of time to be given to the editor or the publisher when the correction order would be published.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Although I am attracted to a non-interventionist approach, I believe the court must be in a position to state what kind of correction order it should be and the prominence it should receive.  To be honest, it is unfortunate that the newspaper industry has proven on many occasions that it is niggardly and almost insulting in the manner it chooses to apologise for the libels and slanders it carries out.  It always seeks to minimise the effect and always seeks to excuse itself and get away with the least possible apology in the least prominent position.  If it could be carried between miscellaneous and lost and found, that is what they would do.  Everybody knows this and everybody who has ever been involved in defamation law knows that this is what is done.  The miserable <Col N="1171"/>little items are headed &ldquo;Apology&rdquo; or &ldquo;Explanation&rdquo;.  If they can use the word &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;apology&rdquo;, they are delighted because they have not apologised.  There is not a genuine sense of contrition.  Going back to my catechism, neither is there a sense of firm purpose of amendment, which one always had to remember.  As Senator Norris said, they wait in the long grass and come after one again.  On many occasions one pays through the nose for whatever redress one has obtained.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris says he was ambushed when appearing on television recently.  If one sits in the front row of &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; audience, one cannot expect to have a controversy-free outing on the programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator took issue with Fintan O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s article some time ago on the proceedings of this House.  I am in the extraordinary position that Fintan O&rsquo;Toole, for once in his life, agrees with my position on these matters.  This gives me an uneasy feeling, not least because I remember on one occasion in the same column he vituperated against me for deceiving, lying and all the rest because I had said he was hostile to the concept of property &mdash; he said this was a malicious invention on my part.  I took this on board and thought he was slightly to the right of where I thought he was coming from until some time later he let his guard down on the Vincent Browne programme and admitted he had been a Marxist at an earlier stage in his life.  This was the Fintan O&rsquo;Toole I recalled.  However, whereas he was allowed to define himself and his position, I was not.</P>
        <P>One must have a thick skin in politics.  Day in, day out, I am likened to a Nazi by the Irish media.  If it is not in one newspaper, it is in another &mdash; that I speak in a German accent.</P>

	<P>I goose-step around the place and do all of these things.  All of this is written by people who have, apart from access to columns, little or no talent in life, apart from inhabiting houses of poor design quality and so on.  I think it was in a controversy between Denis Franks and Ulick O&rsquo;Connor that one of them likened the other to a sparrow picking at the droppings behind the dray horse of Irish literature.  I often think that if some of the people who write these columns had to fend for themselves in the <Col N="1172"/>real world &mdash; if they had to manage a small section of a company or sell their opinions in competition with others, or if their slot came up for tender every so often or they did not have an inside line of access to the editors or proprietors of newspapers &mdash; they would not be touched by anybody.  They are profoundly boring people in many respects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister painting them all with the same brush?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am referring to some of them.  When they write that I am a Nazi, a fascist or this, that or the other, it is puerile.  I am a liberal and a republican politician.  I have stood up for liberal values more coherently than most of them.  They like to go back to some kind of student, undergraduate mental approach to politics, where they liken me to some kind of fascist person.  They should show me anything I have done that is fascist.</P>
        <P>I noted recently that Vincent Browne announced that the referendum on citizenship was a racist referendum.  How foolish can anybody be?  How utterly devoid of common sense could any commentary be that would describe as racist a referendum on the question that Ireland should bring its citizenship laws into line with those of other countries in the European Union?  This is described as racism in Ireland.  These are the people who fill our newspapers.</P>
        <P>We should not be distracted by columnists who normally get things wrong.  With regard to the referendum, I remember one contributor to <i>The Irish Times</i> announcing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It makes one wonder in what society they move.  If they have not met 80% of the population, it makes one wonder what effete little lives some of them must live.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel much better.  I come back to the point we are discussing, namely, whether it should be open to the court in the context of a correction order to give a direction as to the form and extent of such an order.  What Senator Maurice Hayes is proposing is that the law should be less directive than this and that, effectively, it should be up to the newspaper editor to choose the norm and effect.  He proposes that the remedy would be for the person who was aggrieved by the non-prominence of the apology <Col N="1173"/>to return to court to seek redress by way of a contempt motion.  I am not content to do this.</P>
        <P>I appreciate Senator Hayes is trying to introduce flexibility but I am not content with the amendment.  This does not require precision from the court; a court can be reasonable in the way it gives flexibility to the editor or otherwise.  However, in the last analysis, it is a matter in which the court has the authority to make an order specifying the extent of a correction order.  If I were to accept Senator Hayes&rsquo;s amendment, I would be depriving the court of this and handing back discretion to the editor.  I am not keen to do this, given my experience.  Senator Hayes has admitted that he, like myself, has written for newspapers and that he is a director of a newspaper company, which is fine.  If he could point out to me one newspaper which has ever been generous with an apology, except with a gun to its head, I would be interested to hear of it.  I have seen the exact opposite in perhaps 98% of cases, namely, a constant desire to minimise the apology and the reparation to the individual.  From that point of view, I am not attracted to the amendment.</P>
        <P>What I have done in the Government amendment is provide for a maximum period during which the correction order must appear in order that if there is a tsunami or a similar event, the editor can choose over a number of days the day to get the news out.  For an old-fashioned newspaper, there is usually flexibility on the front page.  However, having run a front page story in a tabloid newspaper, if one was required by a court to place an apology on the front page, there is little room for manoeuvre on the front page of a tabloid &mdash; there is either one story or two and that is it.</P>
        <P>The point made by Senator Hayes that one cannot foresee events is fairly met by the Government amendment which gives a period within which the correction must be made.  I am not willing to go as far as Senator Hayes and say it is a matter for the editor to choose the level of prominence and interpret the court order.  It is fair to allow the court to state what it has in mind is, say, an apology of at least six inches high or four inches wide, not just a small little thing that appears in the corner of the front page, or wherever it may be.</P>
        <P>It is not an adequate remedy to suggest to somebody who thinks he or she did not receive a fair apology that he or she should bring the newspaper back to court for contempt.  To return to the point made by Senator Jim Walsh, the cost implications of such an application would be enormous.  What would it cost to bring a substantial newspaper back to the High Court on an attachment or a contempt motion?  If an apology was dubious and only half of what one expected in terms of size or prominence, what lawyer would say one was certain to win?  The person concerned would be left in a situation where the advantage would always be ruled in favour of the <Col N="1174"/>newspaper proprietor.  If such a proprietor was so egregiously mean and if the victim of libel could not be certain that he or she would win the contempt application, the latter would be advised by anyone wearing a wig and gown to avoid returning to court for a second battle because the case could go on forever.  I prefer the Government amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Senator Maurice Hayes will rise to the challenge and provide an example of a generous apology.  Unless I have completely misunderstood the position, the amendment is extremely specific.  It states the order shall specify the date, time on which an apology shall be issued, the form it shall take, etc.  What will happen if there is a tsunami or a particular publishing exigency arises and an apology cannot be printed on the requisite date?  A newspaper would then be in trouble.  Senator Hayes, in the light of his experience of what it is like to run a newspaper, is seeking a degree of flexibility.  The newspaper business is highly pressurised and in the sole circumstances to which I refer, I would have a degree of sympathy with those involved in it.</P>
        <P>I would separate the three newspaper articles to which I referred.  Two of them were despicable and the clear products of Grub Street.  However, even though it was unfavourable to me, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s article was intelligently argued, well written and easy to read.  Mr. O&rsquo;Toole is a person whom I respect.  The Minister announced that he had declared himself to be a Marxist but I must inform him that is one step up from his colleague, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is only a socialist.  I am fond of old pinkos.  I am definitely with the pinkos.  Therefore, that does not worry me a jot.</P>
        <P>I do not want people to get the notion that I would want to launch either a personal or professional attack on Fintan O&rsquo;Toole.  I do not always agree with him and life would be very boring if I did.  Sometimes he enrages me.  I will not go into the reasons for this, save to say he was terribly soft on China once he arrived there.  I would have been a great deal harder on that country, particularly in the context of its treatment of Tibet.  Mr. O&rsquo;Toole is a fine journalist and I do not take exception to the content of what he wrote.  He expressed a perfectly legitimate view and sustained it by argument.  Unlike the two other articles to which I referred, his did not contain any personal abuse.  I am quite happy to read what he has to say as a contribution to the debate.  His words do not bother me in the slightest.</P>
        <P>I may be wrong but I do not recall Fintan O&rsquo;Toole referring to the Seanad previously.  Journalists are somewhat like academics.  The latter are terribly precious about their own little areas; they have corns that would do justice to Mother McCree and no matter what one does, one is guaranteed to walk on them.  I reiterate that I do not recall Mr. O&rsquo;Toole writing about the <Col N="1175"/>Seanad before.  A writer from a newspaper which is a direct rival to that for which Mr. O&rsquo;Toole writes has been giving tremendous disquisitions about the Seanad and how it should be reformed.  I have never once seen the former&rsquo;s lean and hungry form in the press gallery.  However, I will give him the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps he was watching proceedings on the monitor.</P>
        <P>It was unusual and interesting that attention was suddenly focused on this subject.  One of the few occasions on which one will gain the attention of and coverage from newspapers is by taking a whack at them in the Seanad.  Unlike all the other newspapers, including that with which Senator Maurice Hayes is involved, <i>The Irish Times</i> continues to cover the deliberations of the Seanad.  It is a great shame that no other newspaper reports on our business.  I would prefer to be presented with intelligent questioning by somebody of the calibre of Fintan O&rsquo;Toole rather than to be met with the awful dull silence accorded to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by the other newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris.  I have a high regard for Fintan O&rsquo;Toole who wrote a splendid biography of Sheridan.  That is not to say I do not strongly disagree with his views on occasion.  When I was a columnist with <i>The Irish Times</i>, I recall entering its headquarters in the company of two other journalists early in my career and one of them welcomed me to the &ldquo;real establishment&rdquo;.  When I stopped writing, one of them admitted to me that <i>The Irish Times</i> was a metropolitan newspaper.  If one wants confirmation of this, one need only read the second editorial piece in today&rsquo;s edition which states there are not half enough unannounced farm inspections.  I am sure this was written by someone who rarely darkens a farm gate.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister in this matter.  As far as discretion for newspaper editors is concerned, these individuals have all the time in the world before cases come to court to make apologies or issue explanations.  I accept that editors may be obliged to negotiate with the person or persons to whom such apologies or explanations relate regarding the form they should take.  By definition, matters such as those to which I am referring have not been resolved because they have had to come to court.  Hence, there is an in-built reluctance among editors to admit that they are wrong.  If that stage has been reached, there is a clear case for the courts to be quite specific in order that people will not be obliged to return to them in respect of inadequate apologies.  Like everyone else, journalists are loath to admit that they are wrong, unless it is in respect of some trivial matter such as an incorrect date.</P>
        <P>I have some sympathy with Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s suggestion regarding the carrying of apologies on the front page of newspapers.  A possible compromise would be that if an apology <Col N="1176"/>does not appear on the front page, its presence on the relevant page of the newspaper should at least be signalled there.  This would automatically mean that people could not miss the apology, unless they wanted to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to end the agony because we are undergoing a charade.  I do not want to provoke the Minister into another love-in with the press.</P>
        <P>I indicated that I was not wedded to a particular form of words.  The flexibility provided by the Minister in amending the legislation to the effect that a correction order shall specify &ldquo;the period not later than the expiration of which, the correction order shall be published&rdquo; is extremely helpful.  He suggested the court should not be unnecessarily specific.  I am concerned that a court might indicate that a correction or apology should be in 20-point font and located three inches from the top of the page to the left hand side and down six columns.  The courts should merely state it should be given due prominence, that it should be contained on the front page, that it should of a particular size and that it should appear within a particular time period.  That would meet my requirements.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal to be said for the approach suggested by Senator Mansergh.  At the very least some signal should be provided on the front page of a newspaper that a full apology is to be found in a prominent position within.</P>
        <P>Although I do not want to restart the Minister on his proto-Nazi point by referring to the former Unionist Parliament in Northern Ireland, over the years of the Stormont Parliament, the only Bill ever passed which was sponsored by the Nationalist minority was the Wild Birds Protection Act 1931.  This amendment of mine is like the Wild Birds Protection Act 1931.  It was the only amendment to which I was ever going to get anyone&rsquo;s attention, but the Minister has gone some distance towards accepting the spirit of it.  I hope he might be able to enlarge a little on the question of how a court would treat a request to specify.  Would that be in punctilious detail or is it a question of a general direction on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Maurice Hayes forgot to give us an example of a grovelling and generous apology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make two points.  Undoubtedly, the Minister has put forward the argument and I must concede that the Government amendment is an improvement on the current text.</P>
        <P>I was taken with the phrase in Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s amendment &ldquo;and to give due prominence to the correction order&rdquo;.  I do not wish to be pedantic, but the requirement to give it due prominence may be inherent in subsection (2), where it states that a correction order shall &ldquo;require the correction to be published in such manner as will <Col N="1177"/>ensure that it is communicated to all or substantially all of those persons to whom the defamatory statement was published&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister consider providing in section 28(2)(<i>b</i>) that the correction order would specify the form, content, extent, manner and prominence?  This would involve the Oireachtas flagging to the judge that it must be prominent.  It may be inherent, but there would be nothing wrong with adding the word &ldquo;prominence&rdquo; and the Minister might consider that.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Mansergh for his support for the idea that an apology should be printed on the front page.  The Minister might consider the following between now and Report Stage.  I can see nothing in the Bill which addresses serial offenders.  What will happen with all this is what has happened to date, namely, that certain newspapers will be much more prone to being involved in defamatory cases than others.  Where it occurs and where a press council does not have significant powers of sanction, the sanctions should be in the legislation.  It strikes me that in this section one sanction could be a requirement, following perhaps one or two offences, that the correction would have to be printed on the front page of the newspaper concerned.  It would signal to the editor and the management of the newspaper that one cannot use the pen to defame people to promote circulation.  Often creating certain controversies which in turn give them publicity might be reasons for people to do so.  I ask the Minister to look at that aspect.  Although I may be missing something in the Bill, I can see nothing in it that distinguishes between a newspaper which finds itself in such a position once every few years and one which finds itself in such a position once every month.  There should be such a distinction.  Our laws reflect that serial offenders are dealt with differently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with so-called pinkos or their views.  If one had an allergy to pinkos, one would never read a newspaper in this country.  However, I have a slight degree of contempt for that class of the community who have abstracted themselves to a moral plain higher than the one rest of us are on, who know a moral issue 1,000 miles away but who regard profits, employment and risk taking as profane matters which are below their moral radar and of concern to lesser people.  There are many examples of that in the commentariat.</P>

	<P>Exactly.  There are people who think that they can write about moral issues and social justice day in, day out and at the same time effect a complete disdain for and ignorance of what makes a company profitable, innovative and successful, what drives a company, etc. so that matters such as incentive, profit and motiv<Col N="1178"/>ation are all issues for lesser beings than they who live on a cloud where they can morally judge the rest of us.  That is probably the most intellectually offensive aspect of so-called pinkoism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in Ireland, that these people live on a level where if a company goes out of business, it shows how evil capitalism is and if a company is successful, it is another indication of how evil capitalism is.  They live in a different world where the social order, underpinnings and economic substructure of society are a matter on which either they express naive, ideological views when they are in China, Cuba or wherever, or else simply state that they are above all of that, it does not matter whether companies are profitable, they do not care about those issues which do not concern them, they are more elevated and abstracted intellectually and morally and they live on a higher plain than most of their fellow men.  I hope it is not Thomas Gradgrind reincarnated to state that such is an effete view of the world and that nobody who believes in liberal politics should eschew liberal economics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What is wrong with effete?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing wrong with effete, but effete is what it is.  If we are to label people as pinkos, etc., why can we not add in the little word &ldquo;effete&rdquo; while we are at it?  If one believes in liberal economics and liberal politics, one should be willing to embrace both.  What I regard as contemptible is this middle class self-hatred that success is something which we in Ireland do not deserve, that companies which are successful, individuals who are successful and prosperity itself are matters about which we should have considerable difficulty and over which we should agonise, and that poverty somehow brought out the best in us.  This constant refrain is a counterpoint to modern Ireland put forward by a group of people, who, if left to fend for themselves, would make an awful job of it.  I will not put it more strongly than that.  They should know that there are people who get on with their lives, who day in, day out worry about issues such as whether they will bring in enough revenue to their companies this week to keep the employees paid next week, that such people are not lesser beings and that those are their concerns rather than wondering about injustices at the other end of the world.</P>
        <P>There is also a partial commentariat of people who are deeply concerned, as I am, about what happens at one end of the island of Cuba in Guantanamo but who are not concerned and have never given prominence to what happens at the other end where people with HIV were herded into concentration camps by the regime to which they lick up in public.  Senator Norris knows I am correct in this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In my time I have had to give visas to persons to come from Cuba to get medical treatment in Ireland and, therefore, I would not get too excited about that.  I am just making the point that if one is to be consistent about human rights, one must be consistent right across the world and one must be consistent about what is happening in China.  Today the editor of an Internet site got six years for allowing critical remarks about the regime there.</P>

	<P>We must be consistent about this.  What I find is the effete, pinko commentariat are very excited by one set of injustices and blind to another.  I try to be equally opposed to infringements of civil liberties, whether coming from the right or left.  That is my position in life and that does not make me something else.</P>
        <P>I will consider further refinements to this section on Report Stage.  I do not want to be overly prescriptive but no newspaper editor should be able to believe that the correction order can be of such dimension and prominence that he or she can effectively engage in a minimising way.  There is unanimity in this House in refusing that.  We would all agree that the best solution would be a less prescriptive formulation which still clearly provides that a correction order will not amount to compliance with the Act unless it is given adequate and full-blooded prominence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak about the purpose of these amendments because we allowed ourselves to be carried away.  I am glad the Minister has stated that he will reconsider the wording of the section before Report Stage with a view to reflecting the unanimity expressed by the House on the issue.  He should take cognisance of the argument made by Senator Jim Walsh regarding front page apologies.  Senator Mansergh made the valid suggestion that if an apology is not printed <Col N="1180"/>on the front page, it should be put on a page that would highlight its prominence.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s view on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the substance of the Minister&rsquo;s argument but wish to make a brief comment on what could be called his ideological digression.  I agree with much of what he said but would not go all the way.  For the past 20 years, whenever a prominent Deputy on the Opposition benches in the other House has used the words &ldquo;private profit&rdquo;, he has spit them out as if they have represented some sort of deep obscenity.  If one is to criticise the 1960s generation, from which I come, it should be that we have tended to hold that attitude.  I hope, however, we have educated ourselves out of it.</P>
        <P>I sometimes aspire to what a 17th century writer called the character of a trimmer, which is defined as shifting the boat if it leans too much to one side.  Equally, however, one does not want the boat to turn over on the opposite side.  There are excesses on the capitalist side.  We had, for example, a debate on the Order of Business about advisers to the Health Service Executive.  In other contexts, bonuses, incentives, overtime and share options can at times reach obscene levels.  I simply do not accept that all these are necessary for a tiny multimillionaire elite to do an honest day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Mansergh.  The excesses of salaries and bonuses paid in some areas can leave one slightly shocked, especially in respect of publicly quoted companies.  However, I think that is a fault of shareholder power rather than a weakness elsewhere.  There is no doubt that excesses exist in the capitalist system but I make the different point that we should not idolise failure when making commentary on our society.  The words &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo;, &ldquo;profit&rdquo; and &ldquo;multinationals&rdquo; should not be used as terms of abuse because these concepts have transformed this country and brought substantive social justice much further than the theoretical social justice on offer for so many years.  Theoretical and ideological social justice is of little use to people who cannot put bread on the table or provide their families with a decent way of life.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh has stated on several occasions he is unhappy with the requirement to take up a lodgment for defamation and leave quietly.  In my rebalancing of this Bill as it progresses through the Houses, I will consider the possibility that where a person takes up a lodgment, he or she will have a means of recording that the action was compromised on the basis of a concession and payment from the defamer.  I find it slightly obnoxious that a newspaper could seriously defame a person, lodge a sum of money in court and leave the person with nothing without even covering the fact that it had spent enough money to deter the person from suing, or that a newspaper chain could be directed to ignore the fact <Col N="1181"/>that &euro;250,000 was paid to frighten someone from suing it over a serious libel.  That is a worrying prospect and Senator Jim Walsh is on to something.</P>
        <P>I do not know exactly how to deal with the issue but in making an apology unreliable for the purposes of a case and also making a lodgment have this effect, we must remind ourselves that somebody who has been seriously defamed should be in a position to receive some sort of public vindication.  If a payment is made without liability, it should at least be acknowledged if the recipient so chooses.  It is not necessarily enough simply to lodge a payment and deny libel while leaving somebody with nothing besides a private accretion to his or her bank balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that the Minister is showing flexibility and am glad he is considering the issue of lodgments.  It seems very unfair that a person is in trouble if he or she does not accept a lodgment where the award turns out to be less than the amount lodged.  The Minister&rsquo;s argument was that the provision existed in other legislation but that does not make it any good.  Rather than reject the arguments made on both sides of the House on lodgments, other Acts which provide for this noxious practice should also be examined because it turns litigation into a gambling matter and is simply unfair.  I am against the provision and when the Minister says it exists in other legislation, I am against it in that case too.  I see no logical inconsistency in that.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister has also indicated a degree of flexibility on the question of apologies because I have made the point as vigorously as I could that it is like an uneven playing field if a newspaper is able to make an apology which can be taken as mitigation on its side but which the plaintiff cannot introduce.  The opinion that such a possibility is unfair is shared by conservatives and so-called pinkos alike.</P>
        <P>While I am on the subject of language, I compliment the Minister if, as I suspect, he is responsible for the term &ldquo;commentariat.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a real disappointment because I think it the most lovely coinage.  I suspect the Minister wishes he had coined the term.  The phrase &ldquo;an effete lefty pinko commentariat&rdquo; has such a magisterial ring to it that I wish the Minister had invented it.</P>
        <P>I would like to rub salt in the wound of my dear friend, Senator Maurice Hayes, in the most Christian way possible.  The Minister challenged him and, although he is a very gentlemanly and gallant knight, the Senator signally failed to rise to the challenge of producing one grovelling and generous apology.  Perhaps he will oblige later but, until he does, the record of the House should show there was such a failure.  Perhaps there is no such animal, at least certainly not one that springs <Col N="1182"/>automatically to the mind of someone so intimately connected with Grub Street.</P>
        <P>I must spring to the defence of Cuba because the Minister raised this hare and I would like to pursue it.  Cuba has sent 29,000 doctors all over the world.  That should be compared with the number of murderous villains trained in the US in the infamous College of the Americas, which is the reason death squads have emerged throughout South America.  That is a wonderful benefaction.  I do not know about the visas the Minister granted to Cubans to travel to Ireland for medical treatment but I would not doubt his word because I have always found him an honourable, direct and honest person.  However, I suspect that one of the reasons is the embargo placed on medical supplies to Cuba, which is most shameful and disgraceful.  It is as bad as the embargo that has been placed on the legitimate government of Palestine.</P>
        <P>I spit out the word &ldquo;multinationals&rdquo; as well and any decent, intelligent person would.</P>

	<P>Everybody can bask in the notion that the country is kept afloat by multinationals but, as I pointed out on the Order of Business recently, having taken the idea from Professor Anton Murphy of Trinity College, approximately half a dozen companies in our wonderful financial services centre &mdash; long may it continue to flourish &mdash; have only five employees but their turnover is twice the income of Luxembourg.  This is money laundering.  The State soaks them for 12.5% of their profit but those in charge should get out their wellies and souwesters because a storm will break and when another country offers a corporation tax rate of 12% or 11.5%, off they will go.  We had better be prepared for that.</P>
        <P>Multinationals, lamentably, have more power than national sovereign governments and they almost always behave despicably.  That is why I spit the word out and I am definitely effete even though I shout I like an enraged bull.  I am effete and proud of it.  I am also a lefty pinko.  I was told that by no less than our mutual friend, Kader Asmal, and coming from him, it was the greatest compliment I ever received in my life.  Myself and Deputy Michael D. Higgins are two old lefty pinkos.  I am an effete lefty pinko and I was part of the commentariat as well for a period.</P>

	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s tirade against multinationals is terribly dated and it is obvious his economic and political education has not progressed since the 1970s.  That is the thinking one would have expected at that time.  Multinationals have been an important but not the sole ingredient in the building of the Celtic tiger and our social and economic progress.  The issue is not simply about tax or wage rates.  For example, I came across a mushroom producer in County Tipperary a few days ago.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1183"/>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>He said the problem in Ireland is wages.  He pays the minimum agricultural wage of &euro;9.40 per hour while a good manager can be hired for &euro;2 an hour in Poland.  I asked him how he has remained in production and how he was able to expand.  He replied it was because of productivity.  He has bought a fine machine that composts the material, which previously took several people a week to do.  The issue, therefore, is not down to tax or wage rates.  Skills, productivity and management are also key factors.  While that is an indigenous company, we are in a good position to survive.  Much of the commentary over the past 20 years is that disaster is coming down the track but there is no reason that should happen if we manage to continue to box clever.  We have been on a roll for the past 20 years achieving prosperity that we never experienced previously.  That can be maintained but we must continue to be nimble, agile and clever.  I do not buy into the doom and gloom of commentators who say the end of our economic  world is nigh.</P>

	<P>Multinationals are profit driven, which is a great motivator, but they have added immeasurably to the growth of our economy in recent decades.  We have achieved full employment, which was an aspiration during most of my political life.  It was a prime objective of all political parties.  It is up to these Houses to provide the ethical and other frameworks so that they comply with appropriate standards.  It is our job to ensure that framework is in place.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to examine the issue of prominence in the section.  I also welcome his comments regarding the lodgement provision.  As a fellow republican, it would be anathema to me to see that go through.   Two scenarios, which conflict slightly, need to be addressed.  The odd individual will sue a publication for soft money even where he or she has not been defamed.  The other scenario concerns a person who has been seriously defamed and whose reputation is in tatters.  They will be faced with having to make a lodgment without receiving an apology.  We must err in the legislation on the side of such individuals.  If these scenarios conflict, we must err on the side of the genuine person who takes a case so that he or she is not prohibited from having his or her reputation restored because he or she dose not have the finance to take the case.  That would be totally anathema to republican philosophy.  I hope the Minister will address this.  I acknowledge the arguments for abolishing the lodgment completely but while a distinction is made in this regard for defamation and other civil cases, the <Col N="1184"/>lodgement should not stand without a commitment to an apology.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, subsection (2), line 27, to delete &ldquo;shall give directions&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may advise&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to the control a judge will have over the question of damages.  It is very bad principle to second-guess a jury.  Section 29(2) states that in a defamation action brought in the High Court, the judge shall give directions to the jury on the matter of damages.  That is not appropriate in all circumstances because it ties the judge&rsquo;s hands.  It states the judge shall give directions to the jury.  In other words, the Minister has such a low view of people&rsquo;s intelligence, he does not believe they are capable of coming to a reasonable conclusion about damages.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage, or perhaps during an earlier discussion on Committee Stage, the Minister pointed to a case where a large amount was awarded.  It was thrown out and went back to another jury which increased the amount, even though it had been told it was too much.  There is no question of doubt that is what the people wanted.  I do not like this type of authoritarianism.  In the above case, a jury was <Col N="1185"/>empanelled but the result was not liked and it was fired off to another jury which not only took the same view but provocatively increased the amount.</P>
        <P>It is like the Government&rsquo;s attitude to referenda on the European Union.  If it does not like the result, it will keep asking the question until it gets the right answer.  It is a variation of what, I believe, Mr. Bruton said in the D&aacute;il, that is, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask the right question&rdquo;.  The attitude here is that we will keep asking the question until we get the right answer and since juries are such a pain in the backside, we will ignore them, tie their hands, not let them decide and will make the judge decide.</P>
        <P>The Minister came up with a series of arguments.  He is always interesting to listen to and that is why I am happy to spend an afternoon here.  The Minister is not only delighting and entertaining me, he is also continuing my education.  Senator Mansergh was perfectly right but the situation is disastrously worse than he supposes.  My economic education did not commence in the 1970s; it has not yet commenced.  It is a subject about which I know absolutely nothing.  I am delighted to say I am totally unacquainted with the vulgarity of economics.  In fact, I am an economic virgin which is one of the few degrees of virginity to which I can legitimately and honourably lay claim.</P>
        <P>My amendment is one which the Minister should be tempted to accept.  I am not saying the judge can never give directions but that he or she may advise.  That is a more civilised way to deal with the matter rather than saying the judge shall say, in all circumstances, that the jury must give the person, say, &euro;16,506.  The judge can say a reasonable estimate is between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 or between &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000.  The words &ldquo;may advise&rdquo; take away this straightjacket element.  Since the Minister has indicated he will consider various issues, I hope he will consider this one while he is at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the lack of grounding in economics is showing in this amendment.</P>
        <P>I have great respect for the jury system in determining whether people are innocent or guilty but in regard to the awarding of damages, jury judgments have, to say the least, been erratic.  I come from the point of view that in a well-ordered society people have least possible recourse to the courts and that they not be encouraged by the system to have a punt on getting a large amount of damages from litigation.</P>
        <P>A jury is normally empanelled for one case and will probably have had very little experience of other cases as opposed to a judge who sits through many cases and, therefore, more than likely has a better idea of the proportion involved.  Damages are often inflated by the sheer<i> per diem</i> expense of my learned friends.  Sometimes one gets an entirely misleading impression of how much a person gets because once one <Col N="1186"/>deducts from the award the fees of solicitors and barristers, the figure may be much more modest than it appears at first sight.  The least possible recourse to the courts and encouragement of negotiation, settlement and reasonable behaviour by newspapers all point to the Minister&rsquo;s position rather than that of Senator Norris.</P>

The second time around the jury award in the High Court was actually higher.  That highlights much inefficiency and it is very costly to people.  There is a need to address that.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that in all such cases there must be an element of judicial discretion.  Questions may arise as to where one draws the line in specific instances.  However, we must also give discretion to the jury.  In a defamation action, it would not be correct for the jury to hear the case and make a decision, having debated all the circumstances and whether defamation has occurred, and for the judge to then direct it as to the damages.  However, I would have no objection to the judge setting parameters as to the damages.  In the case to which I referred, it would seem obvious that when the case was heard again in the High Court, the jury would have been informed of what had happened in the previous case.  At least it would have made a determination with the views of the Supreme Court in mind.  Could there be a meeting of the ways between the words &ldquo;may advise&rdquo; or &ldquo;set parameters&rdquo; rather than being absolutely prescriptive in regard to the damages which would be a serious deviation of jury discretion?</P>
        <P>In regard to what Senator Mansergh said, there may well be inconsistencies between juries but the same can be said of the Judiciary, of which we have recent evidence.  Leaving it to the Judiciary does not mean that when it comes to the damages issue there will be greater consistency.  There was a call for a debate on the consistency of sentencing on today&rsquo;s Order of Business, although I do not know the outcome of that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I genuinely believe a system should be in place whereby judicial decisions can be assessed.  I am not saying this should be done by outside people but perhaps by a judicial group.  Where serious inconsistencies appear to have taken place, a judge should have to make a case to that judicial group made up of members of the Judiciary.  If such a group thought the judge was wrong, at least other judges would learn from that and it would constitute a form of guidance within the judicial system.</P>
        <P>As for allowing damages, I was in business for many years and when personal injuries claims arose, one&rsquo;s legal advisers would suggest that were the case held before a particular judge, he or she would be more balanced in his or her approach.  On the other hand, were another judge <Col N="1187"/>to take the case, he or she would be completely biased towards the plaintiff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a judge would take the view the small man was getting money from a business or corporation.</P>
        <P>While this may have constituted a serious miscarriage of justice, this is how matters stood.  Anyone who was involved in legal matters pertaining to personal injuries took such a route.  I am unsure whether giving absolute discretion to judges is the correct route to take.  The Minister should consider this matter to ascertain whether he can come up with something less prescriptive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Judicial discretion has been much discussed, particularly in the past week.  However, I do not wish to discuss any case in particular.  Perhaps a quantum could be arrived at regarding the amount that could be given for libel.  If this is possible, the provision of some guidelines to that effect to a jury could be the solution.  However, I do not favour giving total discretion to judges in this instance.  In general, juries have done a fine job in the vast majority of cases and any discretion to be given should go to juries.  Perhaps judges could provide guidelines rather than directions to them.  Perhaps common ground can be reached and Members can attain their goal by finding a form of words.  However, in this instance I have grave difficulties regarding directions from judges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One must remember that jurors are judges of fact.  While it is true they take an oath and are obliged to act collectively, nonetheless they are judges of fact in a particular case.  Irish law gives jurors a function in assessing damages in certain cases such as assault, fraud and other related matters to avoid the scenario in which although one person establishes the facts of a case and disbelieves one side, another person is given the compensatory function.  The newspapers sought such a scenario.  They wanted the jury to establish whether there was a libel and the judge to be given the function of assessing damages thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course they did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In such circumstances, a judge might be quite sympathetic to a newspaper.  Although he or she might have disagreed with the jury&rsquo;s decision, as it decided there was a defamation the judge would proceed to award damages.  Such a judge might believe a matter to be comparatively trivial although the jury might have decided that in the circumstances, it was not trivial.  In a defamation action, it is generally preferable that whoever is responsible for the verdict on whether a person is lying or telling the truth, <Col N="1188"/>should also carry out the function of compensating the person whose reputation is at issue.</P>
        <P>Consequently, one of the policy considerations in respect of this legislation was to uphold the function of juries in awarding damages because strong pressure was exerted to take away that function from them.  This was my starting point.  On the other hand, juries should not be told they are on their own when it comes to damages but that they should be reasonable.  That adds up to nothing.  As one cannot imagine a judge asking a jury to be unreasonable, in the circumstances being reasonable means nothing and such guidance is of no use to a jury.   However, in this instance Members may have misunderstood the term &ldquo;directions&rdquo;.  In a criminal trial, a judge gives directions to the jury and tells jurors how to proceed with their function.  Directions given by a judge to a jury are not a usurpation of its function.  They constitute a legal statement to the jury of the basis on which it is to proceed and this is what is meant by the term &ldquo;directions&rdquo; in this section.</P>
        <P>For example, a judge&rsquo;s directions to a jury will include an explanation of proof beyond reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence.  Moreover, a judge is obliged to give directions to a jury regarding the manner in which accomplice evidence is to be treated.  It does not mean stating that a jury must find that Senator Norris is untruthful.  It means telling the jury that before relying on his evidence, it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his statements to it are true because he is the crucial witness in the case.  This would be the position in a criminal case.</P>
        <P>Consequently, a direction is not a usurpation of the jurors&rsquo; function.  It is a statement to them of the legal principles on which they are to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about damages?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, in this context, direction in respect of damages means the legal basis on which jurors are to proceed.  This is important because jurors must be told they cannot go mad and cannot simply choose any old figure, thereby bankrupting the newspaper and teaching it a lesson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hang on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Jurors cannot be so informed because a jury&rsquo;s function is not to bankrupt a newspaper but to compensate the plaintiff.  Jurors must have their function explained to them.  When juries assessed damages in personal injuries matters, a doctrine applied, and in so far as I am aware still applies, namely, there are certain sums of money for general damages that should not be exceeded in respect of personal injuries.  Therefore, if someone&rsquo;s back was broken in a car crash and he or she will spend the remainder of his or her life in a wheelchair, it is not open <Col N="1189"/>to a judge assessing damages in such cases to decide to award &euro;20 million.  The Supreme Court has ruled that in general terms in such cases, there is an upper limit to general damages and it is not open to an Irish jury to do what might be done by an American jury, namely, to award $50 million to a person in such circumstances.  It is not open to an Irish jury to so do and juries are given directions in respect of such matters.</P>
        <P>I have in mind the old rule whereby the judge simply said nothing of any substance to juries in defamation cases, except they were to be reasonable and not to go mad.  This should not be the case in defamation cases or in assault cases involving garda&iacute; and the like.  The judge should provide a clear view as to how jurors are to approach the assessment of damages in a case in which they find for the plaintiff.</P>
        <P>For example, Members should consider a case in which a jury decides that Senator Norris has been libelled.  It should be open to the judge to acknowledge the Senator was libelled, it was grossly defamatory, he has obviously suffered substantially and the case is not trivial.  However, it should also be open to the judge to tell the jurors who are considering damages to bear in mind that had the Senator been in a car crash and were the judge to assess damages for a leg amputated below the knee, he or she would give him no more than &euro;200,000 and that the jurors might consider that point in terms of deciding on compensatory damages.</P>
        <P>There is nothing wrong with making such statements to a jury.  Otherwise it will decide to give &euro;750,000, &euro;1 million or whatever and will pluck figures from the air.  It does not usurp a jury&rsquo;s function to state this is the kind of thing that will happen.  A recent case went through the courts twice and it would be absurd for the judge in that case to tell the jury to fix damages and not warn members if they go mad again the Supreme Court will knock down the damages.</P>
        <P>It is pointless to ask a jury to perform an important function but not give legal guidance, and it is a matter of significance.  The Supreme Court is entitled to reverse an award on the basis damages were excessive and it makes sense that a jury is told something at the court of first instance.  Otherwise members of the jury can state that if they were told they would not have made the mistake of awarding damages of that size.  Such a case would end in the High Court and never have to be appealed.</P>
        <P>If the Supreme Court is given the right to state as a matter of law that &euro;1 million is excessive having regard to the nature of the allegations made, one might as well give a High Court judge the same function to tell a jury an award of &euro;1 million in a case will be knocked and not to make such an award.  If a High Court judge is correct on such general guidance it is of significance.</P>
        <P>We are trying to bring a degree of rationality to this.  It is strange that juries are given detailed guidance on many functions but as a matter of <Col N="1190"/>tradition with regard to damages in defamation cases they were told that apart from being reasonable and not punitive they were at large to decide on the amount.  However, five people in the Supreme Court will state they were not at large to do so and they got it wrong and it will return to another jury to decide the case.</P>
        <P>There is no advantage in having a system where people seeking justice find their cases are brought to the Supreme Court and either sent back to the High Court or decided <i>de novo</i> in the Supreme Court on the issue of damages.  Nothing would be wrong with the judge telling the jury in the High Court that a case is significant but not major and providing instances of damages awarded.</P>
        <P>Sometimes people sue for defamation because they were stopped in a shop by a store detective and embarrassed and publically humiliated.  If the Supreme Court stated in a previous case that in such instances &euro;20,000 is enough compensation why should a jury about to make an award not be told this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this the type of guidance in question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am talking about general directions.  The judge will be able to bring the jury&rsquo;s mind to matters which will help members make a judgment which will not be overturned on appeal.  If an accusation that Senator Norris took a bribe appears in a newspaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am receiving a terrible walloping here.  I lost both legs and only got &euro;100,000 for each, I was libelled and what is the Minister doing to me now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If such an accusation that Senator Norris took a bribe is made seriously&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  Such an accusation must be dealt with more seriously than an idiot store detective challenging one in the wrong as one leaves a supermarket.  Different graduations of seriousness exist.  One may experience ten minutes of embarrassment and one&rsquo;s neighbours may state, &ldquo;Did you see Norris?  He was stopped coming out of such-and-such a shop.&rdquo;  That may be bad but it is completely different compared with an accusation on the front page of a newspaper stating one took a bribe.</P>
        <P>Many defamation actions used to be brought with regard to bounced cheques.  I do not know whether they still are.  It would involve a comparatively small group of people and is not the same as having an accusation of corruption printed on the front of a newspaper.  The list goes on and on.  In these circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable for a judge to tell a jury in approaching damages not to put a relatively small incident <Col N="1191"/>where a Visa card was improperly rejected with a loud voice in a restaurant at the top end at the level of an allegation of corruption or sexually interfering with a child.</P>
        <P>We must have some basis on which a court can tell a jury not to go mad when it comes to damages and provide examples of cases where the Supreme Court ruled awards were excessive.  Regarding compensatory damages, it would be helpful to many juries to know what would be the amount of damages awarded by the High Court to someone who lost an eye in a road traffic accident.  They could then place it in the same scale and consider whether ten minutes of embarrassment in a supermarket was of the same order or less or more.</P>
        <P>We can bring rationality and predictability to the area by allowing a judge to give directions.  Directions should be understood in this context and not in a context of being told, &ldquo;I direct you to award X thousand euro&rdquo;.  Directions to a jury set out the legal principles on which members should address these issues.  It is a fair concept to introduce into our law.  It does not devalue the function of a jury to provide it with instances and state they are the general parameters within which it should decide the case.</P>
        <P>If I were a juror I would feel cheated if I had sat in a jury box for two weeks listening to a case, had brought in a verdict and then read in the newspapers the matter was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court where it was stated the award was five or ten times what was appropriate.  The High Court judge could have told me on the day he charged me at the end of the case that &euro;400,000 was rejected on a number of occasions by the Supreme Court and the case was by no means towards the serious end of the spectrum.  I do not see what is wrong with this or how it makes a nonsense of a jury or interferes with its prerogative to determine damages to provide it with contextual material by reference to which it can make a fair decision.</P>
        <P>I was in a situation of going into a court with no idea of what the jury would decide.  Having worked on a number of defamation cases, I can tell the House when the jury comes back it is a bit like watching a slot machine.  One wonders whether it will award &euro;50,000, &euro;500,000, &euro;300,000 or &euro;10,000.  No one mentioned a figure to the jury or made a submission to the court at any stage during the case on this issue.  Suddenly, an amount is announced.</P>
        <P>It is all very well for us to have crossed wires.  We have extremely rich and successful newspapers.  However, we still have a dwindling band of smaller newspapers and publications which cannot take a hit of a couple of hundred thousand euro.  They cannot even take the expense of appealing such an award to the Supreme Court.  They are entitled to a system which is reasonably predictable with regard to what will happen.</P><Col N="1192"/>
        <P>It may be the phrase, &ldquo;directions to the jury in relation to the matter of damages&rdquo; seems to be a prescriptive instruction to tell a jury the level of damages to award.  This is not what is involved.  Directions to juries are an elaboration of the legal principles by which they approach the matter of damages and not a statement such as, &ldquo;I advise you to award &euro;50,000 in this case&rdquo;.  This would not be accepted by the Supreme Court or either side in the case.  It would be a matter for an appeal in itself if a judge stated, &ldquo;This is a &euro;50,000 case no more and no less&rdquo; because effectively the judge would have taken over the jury&rsquo;s function and this is not what the Bill envisages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  I understood a literal meaning of the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo;.  I would not be happy with a situation whereby a judge could tell a jury to award &euro;50,000.  Are we satisfied under this wording a judge cannot do this and be very prescriptive and direct a jury to award &euro;20,000.  What happens if the jury ignores a direction from the judge in such a circumstance or other general circumstances?</P>
        <P>I have a point relating to small newspapers or those with limited resources.  There was an incident before the Ryder Cup last year when the wife of one of the golfers was seriously defamed by a small newspaper.  They must run the risk in a very serious case such as that of being put out of business, if needs be.  I would not have any sympathy for them going out of business.</P>
        <P>As the T&aacute;naiste was speaking a question struck me of whether experts in the field could be called by defendant, plaintiff or judge to give some advice in general to a jury.  Perhaps a High Court judge is the correct person to do so.  A brief could be given to the jury, as it is a terrible waste of court time to have cases appealed because the award is off the wall, either too low or too high.  We should aim for consistency in damages that is proportionate to the seriousness of the defamation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a little tempted to say I would not trust one of those old judges as far as I could spit them.  If one looked sideways at one of them they would blow the head off a person, as we know since last week.  I will restrain myself from such utterances.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste is very open and clear when he states that the newspapers were lobbying for this.  I am not a bit surprised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, not this.  They were lobbying for the total abolition of the jury damages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste went a little bit of the way with them, or at least that is the way it looks to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I tried to be reasonable.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1193"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is eminently reasonable, which is why we in this House love him so much.</P>
        <P>I have been saying for a number of years that law should be written in accessible language.  I may not be a lawyer and I may be economically illiterate but I have a nodding acquaintance with the English language.  The term &ldquo;give directions&rdquo; means to give directions, and we cannot buck that.  If I give somebody direction I direct them to do something.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste and those of us who take this view are remarkably close but I do not believe it would be any harm to alter the term to &ldquo;may advise&rdquo;.  That places no restriction on the judge in making the ruling.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with awards being appealed to the Supreme Court as it is a very good idea.  There is a significant difference and I may be economically illiterate and arithmetically challenged, but I can tell the difference between one and five.  Even I can detect that.  The difference in the Supreme Court is that you have five very experienced judges, not just one.</P>
        <P>I would pose a question that is not entirely hypothetical, as I was involved in a case where a judge sued.  What happens when one judge sues in a court and then his fellow judge, his little buddy, is awarding the damages?  Do we not think there would be a little multiplier in that?  The judge might say &ldquo;Well, old Bloggs, I see him in the club every day, I will give him &euro;800,000&rdquo;.  That is perfectly possible and the issue should be obviated.</P>
        <P>I thought there was a patronising element in what Senator &ldquo;Mansewerage&rdquo; said.  There was an element of &ldquo;we cannot trust the peasants.&rdquo;  Who are they but eleven members of peasantry, and we cannot be trusting them with money.  It might be all right for them cutting the bog but we are not going to let them loose on the purse.  The Senator stated judges have more experience, but have they?  They have more experience of what?  What professional qualifications have they?  Are they chartered assessors?  They are not.</P>
        <P>Judges are capable of being eccentric, and the T&aacute;naiste will know there are plenty of examples of eccentric judges around this country.  Some of them were written about by the commentariat in <i>The Irish Times</i>, no less, a red-hot roaring pinko who was not all that effete, strangely enough.  That was Nell McCafferty, who used to write &ldquo;In the Eyes of the Law.&rdquo;  Some of the comments made by judges were remarkable.</P>
        <P>I would challenge the idea that giving directions is a general advising of the jury.  That may be the case in law.  Barristers are wily, as the T&aacute;naiste knows.  Supposing a barrister would stand up in court and say, &ldquo;My lord, do you not think it is time you gave directions to the jury?&rdquo;  Do we not think members of the jury would think they had better do what they are told?  The language is important.</P>
        <P>Everything the T&aacute;naiste has said is met by the phrase &ldquo;may advise&rdquo;.  If the judge, in his or her <Col N="1194"/>wisdom, decides to let the jury have free reign, I would have no problem with a jury doubling the damages, having been told they are too much.  The jury is indicating the judge to be wrong.  I do not at all like this idea of second guessing a judgment.</P>
        <P>To come back to Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s comments about judges having more experience and letting them have free reign on the question of costs, that is a very elegant argument for abolishing jurors altogether.  If judges have more experience why do we go the expense and nuisance of juries?  It is a bloody nuisance being on a jury, and I would know because I have been on one.  It is the most aggravating task on Earth.  I had achieved my alpha male status in the jury and I was winding myself up to award enormous damages, but I was baulked at the very last minute because the blackguards settled outside the court.  We had been incarcerated with tea and biscuits for a couple of days.  It was a dreary and awful case.</P>
        <P>Why do we have this suspicion of juries if they are good enough to find the facts?  For example, in many cases it is much more morally onerous to decide on facts when there are contending scenarios.  Imagine, for example, a jury in a murder case, where they must decide if somebody is guilty of the very serious and heinous crime of murder, which until recently carried the death penalty.  If we are prepared to charge juries with that task, I do not see why we are not prepared to let them decide, under advice from a judge, appropriate damages.</P>
        <P>As this is the section dealing with damages, it is appropriate for me to formally reiterate that I propose to put down an amendment on Report Stage which, if accepted, will leave the editor and proprietors of a newspaper liable for the damages, rather than the individual reporter.  That would be fair.</P>
        <P>I am astonished at this suspicion of juries, which is a bit dangerous.  I do not see why they should not be trusted with the decision.  The T&aacute;naiste has stated juries are trusted in this way, and this giving directions just means parameters are set out or advice is given.  What is wrong with the term &ldquo;may advise&rdquo;?  Is this another example of a specialised legal language which does not mean what these same words used in an ordinary context by ordinary people mean?</P>
        <P>I hope the T&aacute;naiste survives as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after the next election and perhaps he could embark on a new task, as he has been cleaning up all the statute law, which is a very interesting, exciting and delightful job.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, it has always been the rule, except in defamation cases, that juries should be given directions as to all of their functions, including the assessment of damages.  When personal injury cases were decided by juries, it was the case that they were given directions by the courts how they should approach the issue of awarding damages.</P>
        <P>I am trying to achieve rationality in this provision.  If it is possible for the Supreme Court to reverse a jury&rsquo;s verdict on the basis that it was excessive, it must be possible for a High Court judge to warn jurors in terms that will save them from having their award reversed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They could do that with the wording &ldquo;may advise&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The phrase &ldquo;directions to the jury&rdquo; is well understood and is not a term of arcane art.  If one inquires what stage a case has reached and the judge gives directions to the jury, it is clear what he or she is doing, namely, setting <Col N="1196"/>out the principles on which jurors are to approach the case.  The function of a judge in a jury trial is to instruct the jury as to the legal principles it must apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the directions be defined in respect of awarding damages?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a usurpation of the jury&rsquo;s function to say a case is worth &euro;45,000, not a penny more nor less, and to direct the jury to give that amount.  On occasion, the Court of Criminal Appeal has reversed directions by trial judges not to acquit someone because that is a jury function.  It is not the function of a judge to tell jurors to write &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; in a box on the jury paper.  We are dealing with a function I want to leave with juries, namely, to determine compensatory damages in defamation cases.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised a point, albeit in terms with which I would not like to associate myself.  He asked what would happen if a judge sues.  Is it not far more appropriate that 12 ordinary Joe and Josephine Soaps decide what a judge gets than another judge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting a judge should do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If public figures appear before courts suing for damages, it is far preferable as to their truthfulness and damages that 12 men and women should decide the issue than a single judge, who will immediately be accused of getting it wrong or will be attacked in a newspaper article by someone who does not agree with the outcome of the case.  To impugn the verdict, people will look through the judge&rsquo;s antecedents and determine what party was in office when he or she was appointed, what school he or she attended, to whom he or she is married and of which golf clubs he or she is a member.</P>
        <P>They do not act likewise in respect of a jury.  For example, they do not say the jurors all came from Donnybrook or wherever.  People accept juries&rsquo; verdicts.  When juries are under attack, we should always consider that no country with a jury system of trial, either civil or criminal, has ever succumbed to an internal tyranny whereas nearly every tyranny has emerged where no jury system exists.</P>
        <P>I have considerable time for juries and their functions, but I do not like leaving them in the dark when, because their awards are criticised on an appellate basis as being excessive and perverse, people who disagree with the presence of juries in the system say they should be got rid of.  In the United Kingdom, it has been suggested that juries should be excluded from lengthy fraud trials and criminal cases.  Under the Constitution, we could not do likewise.  Should someone be in jail because his or her case was too complicated for 12 people who took and oath and listened to it day after day to understand?  I do not believe so.</P><Col N="1197"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>I am a great jury man, if I may say so, but what I propose is a rational defence of the jury system and prevents juries awarding blindly and being told afterwards that they got it wrong, leading to the case being returned to the High Court, another jury making the same so-called error and the Supreme Court saying the jury got it wrong a second time.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked whether the Supreme Court is getting it wrong.  If the Supreme Court is vested as a matter of law with the jurisdiction to reverse a decision on the basis that the award of damages is excessive, we must accept its verdict.  Whether it is right in our private judgments, it is the ultimate system of arbitration in our constitutional order and we must abide by its verdict.  We cannot allow a situation to unfold in which two juries make a mistake in succession and the Supreme Court must say that it is not a mistake because they arrived at the same view.  I accept that if a succession of cases went to the Supreme Court over a long period and the court found that its jurisprudence on a question of quantum of damages seemed to be at variance with the ordinary juror&rsquo;s views, the penny might drop and the Supreme Court would realise it was wrong.</P>
        <P>This is a matter of legal culture.  For example, it was well known that when personal injury actions were decided in Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom before and after independence, Irish courts and juries were more generous than those on the other side of the Irish Sea.  In England, when personal injury cases relating to the loss of an eye or so on were determined by judges, people might have got a fraction or a third of what they would have got from an Irish juror.  There are cultural differences.  For example, juries on this side of the Atlantic are radically different compared with American juries, which award $50 million to people whose cars go up in flames and so forth.  We have a different approach.  The provision strikes a reasonable balance and<?oasys _jy ?>does not amount to a usurpation of the jury&rsquo;s function.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris is not happy with the provision and I do not know whether he intends to call a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel a vote coming on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to clarify my position.  Initially, I supported the amendment and took a literal interpretation of the word &ldquo;directions&rdquo;.  I believed the amendment had a great deal of merit, but the T&aacute;naiste has clearly put on the record that the interpretation leaves the awarding of damages as the prerogative of the jury, giving it strength.  Any interpretation of the legislation by judges would need to have regard to the record of the House and the intention of the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="1198"/>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s explanation satisfies me that the awarding of damages will remain with juries and that judges can only give general guidance.  Regarding the English language, I will look to Senator Norris as a greater expert in the field.  He has concerns with the wording.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to what Senator Walsh has said, I do not believe for a minute that judges read transcripts of Oireachtas debates.  They do not decide that certain things must be done because Members of the Oireachtas said they should be done.  I am perfectly certain that judges never bother to check what we say.  The measures which are passed into law are parsed and analysed by judges.  They do that in terms of the precedent set in previous judgments, etc.  They are interested in what the Minister referred to as the legal culture.  They are not interested in the political culture, by and large.  I cannot recall a single case in which a judge, having referred to what it says in section 3(6) of a Bill, for example, went on to emphasise what had been said during the Seanad debate on the matter.  I challenge the Minister, who challenged Senator Maurice Hayes earlier, to cite a case in which a judge decided that it was perfectly obvious what was meant in legislation, on the basis of what had been said in the Oireachtas.  I do not believe for a single second that there has been such an instance.  Maybe I am wrong; it is possible.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention one more thing.  I am a little confused, which is an uncomfortable state in which I frequently find myself.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that I am trying to tie the hands of juries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I see.  That is what I thought the Minister was saying.  I am certainly not trying to do that.  Nothing in what I have proposed would prevent a judge from saying that a certain precedent was set in a previous case.  There is nothing in my amendment to inhibit a judge from deciding that an appropriate award was given.  I am sorry that the Minister has seduced away my colleague on the Government side, Senator Jim Walsh, who has an acute political instinct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder whether the Senator should withdraw that unparliamentary remark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Which remark does the Chair consider to be unparliamentary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume he is talking about the reference to seducing one&rsquo;s colleague.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not unparliamentary at all.  I meant it in the nicest possible sense.  As we all know, the experience of seduction is very nice, in <Col N="1199"/>all senses, and immensely pleasurable.  I will try to stop my mind from going down that track.  Senator Jim Walsh was very acute in his perception because I felt a vote gathering in my waters, so to speak.  The Minister has been flexible up to now, but he seems to be quite inflexible in this instance.  I take it that there is no going back.  Is <Col N="1200"/>that the Minister&rsquo;s considered view?  The record will show the Minister has nodded.  I am afraid I can feel a vote solidifying.</P>

    <Title>National Climate Change Strategy 2000: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann condemns the abject failure of the Government to meet the targets set out in the National Climate Change Strategy 2000.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This motion seeks to address the issue of climate change in the context of the Government&rsquo;s stated policy established in 2000 when it set out a number of actions it would take over the succeeding decade specifically intended to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol which was not in force at that time.</P><Col N="1200"/>
        <P>Governments occasionally get things wrong and they occasionally do not progress matters as fast as they might and sometimes they have a change of mind, but there are very few examples of an area of policy where there has been such an abject failure to meet any of the targets the Government had set for itself or to take any of the actions it deemed necessary.</P>
        <P>The programme is a relatively slight document of only a dozen pages but it pushes most of the buttons that are still of relevance.  I will refer to a number of those measures to assess how much has been done in response to the programme.</P>
        <P>It begins by referring to cross-sectoral market-based instruments including taxation.  It states that appropriate tax measures prioritising CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will be introduced in 2002 on a phased incremental basis across a broad range of sectors.  This is an interesting example of how the Government has dealt with this issue.  In 2001 the Government announced it would introduce carbon taxes on a cross-sectoral basis with burden-sharing involved.  However, it added the important rider that it would not do so for at least another year.  I recall Charlie McCreevy standing <Col N="1201"/>up in the other House and announcing he intended to introduce carbon taxes but he felt it was appropriate to ask the tax strategy group and others to have a look at how it might be done.  Money was spent on consultancies and he consulted with the social partners.  A general election was held conveniently about three or four months later and it was a surprise that by the end of the year the then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, decided that rather than introduce cross-sectoral taxes on a phased basis, he decided to do nothing at all.  Nothing was done then nor since.</P>
        <P>The 2000 plan refers to EU emissions trading and this has become a central part of the Government strategy.  With reference to the energy sector it states that measures will be taken which will be supportive of the ceasing of coal use at Moneypoint by 2008 and fuel switching towards less carbon-intensive fuels.  The Government subsequently decided to do nothing of the sort.  Moneypoint is still using coal and, if we are to believe the recommendations of the energy White Paper published last week, the Government intends to use more rather than less coal in the generation of electricity in years to come.</P>
        <P>The plan refers to an expansion of renewable energy.  Some small progress has been made in this regard but only 4% of our electricity generation capacity is in renewable energy.  The Government produced a target of no less than 33% in the energy White Paper last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator proposing the closure of Moneypoint?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Government to measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Paschal Fitzgerald will be delighted to hear that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;seven years ago.  The Government committed to incentivise a move away from coal and it has since reversed that decision.  The plan refers to an expansion in renewable energy but it is still at 4%.  There is a proposal to bring it up to 33% by 2020 but I wonder how this will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The maximisation of CHP is proposed but CHP has hardly increased in terms of the contribution it makes towards the generation capacity.  The plan also refers to an enhanced demand energy programme managed by the Irish Energy Centre.  I will return later in my contribution to <Col N="1202"/>the issue of demand management.  With reference to the transport sector, the plan refers to fuel efficiency measures, further rebalancing of VRT and annual motor tax to favour more fuel-efficient cars.  A provision was made for hybrid cars but other than this there has been no rebalancing of VRT or motor tax in the past seven years in order to favour fuel-efficient cars.  Senators will be aware that it is a matter of only a few months since the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, announced precisely the same measure, except that this too will be subject to a year-long thought process which will also span the period of a general election.  One would not need to be an arch-cynic to realise where that is coming from or going to.  The plan refers to fuel economy labelling for all new cars but I do not know whether this is happening and the Minister may be able to clarify.  The plan refers to modal shift measures which effectively amounts to a shift from road transport to public transport.  It is a reality that 96% of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from transport usage come from road transport and there has been a significant incremental increase in the use of private transport in the ten-year period.  The strategy suggested that a modal shift could take place in seven years but this has not happened.</P>
        <P>The strategy refers to demand management and setting fuel taxes at appropriate levels but no effort has been made to achieve this target.  It refers to the development of an integrated traffic management system.  Anybody judging the way Dublin city works or does not work can make their own judgment on that.  The strategy refers to achieving higher residential densities.  This has been part of a number of different programmes the Department has produced, but it has not happened in any serious way.  It refers to restrictions on out-of-town retail units &mdash; we could ask IKEA about that.</P>
        <P>In terms of the industrial and commercial sector, it refers to market instruments, including targeted taxation measures and emissions trading.  We are getting emissions trading but not targeted taxation measures.  It refers to negotiated agreement with industry, with the option for firms to comply with agreements to reduce their tax burden.  A pilot study in this regard was undertaken five years ago but was discontinued.  It refers to the examination of investment support from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions.  I have no idea whether that happens but I doubt it.  It refers to specific measures to tackle industrial gases, including the use of alternatives.  There was a threefold increase in industrial gases from 1997 to 2004.</P>
        <P>It then goes on to refer to the agricultural sector and reducing the national herd.  The truth is the national herd has reduced in size and this has led to a significant reduction in the emissions of methane, but it will come as a surprise to the IFA and most farmers that this was a central plank of Government climate change strategy.</P><Col N="1203"/>
        <P>I hope the point is made.  We need to examine why Government has done so little and failed so abjectly in this regard because there are a few key messages in the strategy from which we can all learn, not just the Government.  The political commitment has not been evident across Government to do anything different.  The actions of the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, tell us a certain amount.  I have no doubt there are those in the Minister&rsquo;s Department &mdash; they may include the Minister and his predecessors &mdash; who firmly believe the climate change strategy is crucially important and who labour long and hard, and have done so over many years, to produce strategies, statements, endless speeches, press releases and so on.</P>
        <P>The problem is there is no joined-up thinking.  It is all very well for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to believe it is important we take measures to combat climate change, but if at the same time the Department of Transport and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which is responsible for energy, are doing things which pull in exactly the opposite direction, the end result is stasis and we get nowhere.</P>
        <P>Conflicting aims are at play.  There are conflicting aims within individual Departments and within Government.  It becomes a matter of which gains priority and it is crystal clear, considering the record of the past seven years, that tackling climate change does not take priority.  Last week, the White Paper on energy highlighted the fact that the aim of ensuring diverse forms of energy supply and electricity generation is clearly weighted much more heavily than any notion of tackling climate change.  It is all very well for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to suggest we want to move away from coal and towards cleaner, more efficient use of energy, and to reduce the use of energy.  If at the same time, however, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources suggests we need to diversify and ensure we continue to use coal, I am not sure we are going anywhere.</P>
        <P>We also need to make the point, because Government has been strong on this point, that we have not successfully decoupled the twin aims of economic growth and tackling climate change.  If one considers the two primary indicators of transport and energy usage, they have increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is reasonable to take out, for example, the agricultural sector and consider the transport and energy sectors.  Demand for energy and the use of transport and transport fuels has increased more or less in line with growth in gross domestic product.  In fact, it has increased at a <Col N="1204"/>higher rate, which is not surprising.  We should acknowledge this.  If we do, certain consequences flow from this which are not necessarily the sort of consequences that would make one popular publicly.</P>
        <P>This brings me to my final point about why nothing has happened in recent years.  This is because some of the measures that would be necessary in demand management are very unpopular.  We need only look to the United Kingdom where a few weeks ago David Cameron produced a policy that was intended to discourage people from using air transport.  He came up with the notion that if one was a frequent flyer, one would have to pay more and there would a surcharge on those who, by virtue of air transport, were high carbon users.  The reaction was very instructive.  It was all very well for David Cameron to be Mr. Green Boy in an airy-fairy sort of way, but once he began talking about hard and fast policies which could impact on people&rsquo;s lifestyles, the reaction was a good deal less positive.  We have all become hooked on, for example, relatively cheap air travel.  It will require quite a change in the public&rsquo;s perception of these issues before they are willing to accept the sort of lifestyle changes that are almost certainly necessary if we are seriously to tackle climate change.  This applies equally to the use of cars.</P>
        <P>To take a UK example again, Gordon Brown in the early part of this decade incrementally increased the tax on petrol so at present there is a substantial price differential between North and South on this island.  It is remarkable that it was probably the low point of the popularity of the Labour Government since it came into power in 1997 and led to a virtual blockade of the UK by truck drivers.</P>
        <P>I make that point because I believe we need a genuine public debate.  It is useless for politicians of all parties, including Government parties, to genuflect at the altar of climate change and say this is all terribly important and that we must do something about it.  People must understand it requires significant lifestyle changes and important choices to be made.  It requires a frankness from Government and politicians which we have not had and which we need if this issue is to be advanced.  Looking back, we have had seven years of abject failure.  We cannot afford to have that replicated in the immediate term.  Speaking for my party, we are happy to co-operate with other parties, as all parties must, in looking to deal with an issue which is of such huge importance to the nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to persist in the positive and non-confrontational tone of my colleague.  All of us now accept the reality of climate change.  Let us not ignore the extraordinarily intense rearguard action, which still continues and which was manifested on Channel 4 a few weeks back, of pseudo-science by pseudo-scientists and a pseudo-director who has a reputation for <Col N="1205"/>enjoying the fact he says the opposite of everybody else, regardless of whether it happens to be true.  Some of his comments to critics which I saw recorded today amount to four-letter words and no more.  When eminent scientists contacted him, the reply was a four-letter word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Followed by a three-letter word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Probably.  There is no doubt there are extraordinary vested interests in many areas.  I am concerned that unless the Government &mdash; any Government &mdash; has an absolute conviction that this is a reality and that it will have an overwhelmingly negative impact on how we and the planet live over the next 50 years, there will not be the political will to do what is necessary.</P>
        <P>What I hope was one of my more rational criticisms of the present Government is that when it landed in office in 1997, it was the first Opposition to have entered Government and inherited a boom on such a scale.  However, it sat there for approximately five years, unable to believe its luck as money flowed into the coffers through no major decision of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was doing well up to this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government deserves credit for anything, it is that it perhaps sustained the boom, but it did not create it because it was well under way, and that is a fact.  However, because it was a boom and did not represent the things Governments in Ireland used to have to worry about, the Government stopped worrying.  It did not look at the new issues and the new ideas, one of which, already well over the horizon, was the issue of climate change.</P>
        <P>Perhaps at that stage there was no overwhelming scientific consensus but it was growing and even ten years ago, the majority of scientists, perhaps 60%, claimed the most likely reason global temperatures were on an upward curve was because of human activity and that it was not caused by sunspots or any of the other causes that are still being floated around.  This is why the strategy of 2000, while belated, was welcome.  However, the failure to meet its own quite limited targets is troubling.</P>
        <P>I am unconvinced that the Government really believes climate change is perhaps the most important issue with which we are faced.  This is the first occasion outside instances of war on which any generation has been obliged to make sacrifices in order to ensure future generations will have a world in which it will be worth living.  This matter is continually discussed but nothing is ever done.  We deal in short-term solutions.  The market economy model to which we have become used is based on the idea that individuals operating in their own self-interests ultimately and accidentally create together the best possible outcome.  That is simply not true.  As the Stern <Col N="1206"/>report in the United Kingdom indicated, climate change is the greatest example of market failure the world has ever seen.  There are market mechanisms which can be used but the market will not rectify climate change.  Irreversible damage will have been done before any market force would begin to become evident.  The insurance companies are beginning to realise this fact but that realisation is not widespread.</P>
        <P>There is only one issue I wish to raise.  Transport, energy and agriculture are the three biggest contributors to carbon emissions in this country.  It is time we confronted the fact that agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the No. 1 contributor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.  Approximately 28% of our greenhouse gas emissions emanate from agriculture.  If we are determined to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the contributions of different sectors to both the economy and our greenhouse gas emissions, we must face up to and deal with the part played by agriculture.  There is a sense that agriculture is benign and that it involves green fields, etc.</P>
        <P>The second contributor to our greenhouse gas emissions about which I am concerned is transport.  One of the reasons for the growth in emissions in transport is the huge increase in the transport of goods by road.  The rail strategy group informed the Government that we ought to divert some of the goods transported by road to rail but that this would involve intervention by the State in terms of subsidies and supports.  I understand a significant number of agencies and private enterprises want to use the railways but that there is a problem with allowing them to do so.  The current operator of the rail service &mdash; Irish Rail &mdash; is deliberately and systematically running down its rail freight business.  The company wants to get out of this sector completely.  That is a profound contradiction of any national strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because one of the most effective ways in which such emissions could be reduced would be by moving large quantities of goods by rail and, in particular, at night.  From 10 p.m. to 5.30 a.m. or 6 a.m. our railways are virtually empty.  Considerable amounts of money were spent on upgrading the rail network and it remains empty for most of the night because many of the goods that used to be transported by rail are now delivered by road.</P>
        <P>If the fundamental argument is that it is more cost beneficial to industry and manufacturers to transport goods by road, we must consider the entire structure of taxation in the context of the overall common good, namely, the reduction of emissions.  We must ask whether we believe this is the most important issue with which our generation must deal and whether it will determine whether the planet will be capable of supporting life.  If the answer is yes, we must develop and <Col N="1207"/>create a consensus which will enable us to make the decisions that will make it more attractive economically, either by taxation or the imposition of charges, to send goods by rail rather than by road.  If we removed a huge number of trucks from our roads, the consequence would be a significant reduction in greenhouse emissions per tonne of freight.</P>
        <P>Private transport, energy, etc., are matters for another day.  I would love to hear a Government Minister explain why there is no evident strategy to transfer goods from road to rail transport, particularly in view of the fact that this would have an immediate and major impact on our greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;welcomes the progress made under the National Climate Change Strategy in decoupling greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I reserve my right to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kitt for allowing me to contribute at this stage.  I particularly want to participate in this debate but I am also obliged to go to the Lower House to deal with some business there.</P>
        <P>This is a timely debate.  I wish to take up a point raised by Senator Ryan.  There is a great denial that we face an extraordinary global challenge.  Every logical and sound-thinking person accepts that it will be the biggest challenge with which we will be obliged to deal in the years ahead.  The Senator is correct to state there are two contradictory lobbies, the first of which is the nuclear lobby which is trying to capture the climate change debate for its own purposes, while the second is the lobby that denies climate change.  The reality is that there is climate change.  Whether this is partly, predominantly or entirely due to human activity, there is no doubt that human activity is a large part of the problem and it is the only part that we can address.  It is, therefore, incumbent on every government to play its part and this Administration is certainly doing so.</P>
        <P>Our Kyoto Protocol target is to remove, on average, 15.2 million tonnes of carbon each year during the period from 2008 to 2012.  With respect to those who moved the motion, to suggest, ahead of the period, that we have failed abjectly to meet the target is, to put it mildly, somewhat odd.  Our aim is to achieve a position where our emissions will be 13% above 1990 levels.  We will achieve our targets by a combination of the emission reduction measures being implemented across the economy, including by our heaviest emitting installations &mdash; of which there are 109 &mdash; under the EU emissions trading scheme.</P><Col N="1208"/>
        <P>There is no silver bullet to help us deal with this problem.  The concept that the introduction of a carbon tax would address the matter in its entirety is undoubtedly sincere but it is also misguided.  It will take measures that will cut across a range of policy areas to achieve our targets.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s first national climate strategy was published in 2000.  It has, by any objective standard, been enormously successful.  The facts in this regard stand up to scrutiny.  Our greenhouse gas emissions had increased by approximately 25% over 1990 levels up to 2005.  It would be great if the figure in this regard was smaller but during the period in question the economy grew by 150%, the number of people in work and the number of cars on our roads both increased by almost 100% and the number of new houses being built went up dramatically.  As an economy expands, it is logical that the level of emissions will rise.  To create a situation where emissions in this country grew by only one sixth of the growth rate of the economy is a mark of a successful policy.  The success we have achieved will put us in a good position when we enter the post-2012 period.</P>
        <P>Tackling greenhouse gas emissions does not have to imperil economic growth.  If ever there was a country which exemplified that fact it is Ireland.  In his report Sir Nicholas Stern makes the point that we must recognise that dealing with greenhouse gas emissions is not in any way inimical to economic growth.  We should stop knocking ourselves.  Ireland has achieved more than any other country in the OECD group in this area.  We have grown the economy by 150% and our emissions have increased by 25%, an extraordinary example of decoupling.  The challenge we face is to maintain strong economic performance, while continuing to lower our emissions.  It is imperative that we should do that.  Doing so creates an economic advantage because if we achieve a carbon-lean or carbon-neutral economy at the same time as economic growth, we all will benefit.  It is a classic win-win scenario.  Policies proposed by the Opposition, in particular by Labour and the Green Party, might achieve a greenhouse gas reduction &mdash; I listened in particular in the other House &mdash; but the problem would be that they do not achieve the balance that will allow our economy to continue to grow.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy measures in place are projected to deliver 8 million tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions savings.  These measures include the following.  On the energy side, the European Union has set a target of generating 13.2% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  We will meet and surpass that target.  We have already set more ambitious targets of 15% by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  The White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, sets out precisely how that will be done.  It sets it out in a way which measures the carbon savings we will achieve by moving to sustainable energy.</P><Col N="1209"/>
        <P>Senator McDowell is quite correct to state that we use coal to produce a high proportion of our energy needs, but it is imperative that we, having decided not to go the nuclear route, use a mix of energy sources.  His colleagues in the other House criticised our move to turf, but one cannot have it every way.  One cannot rule out coal, turf and nuclear.  What would we be left with?  There is a need for a more balanced approach to this and one will find that in the White Paper.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan was quite correct that the role of agriculture has not been adequately recognised.  On the changes arising from the Common Agricultural Policy reform, the fact that 48,000 farmers are signing up for the REPS and that the farming organisations have signed up for the nitrates programme should be recognised.  The saving in emissions from both changes will amount to 2.4 million tonnes per year.  In addition, the forestry programme will deliver a further 2.08 million tonnes per year.  Agriculture is playing its part and this should be recognised and celebrated.</P>
        <P>On the residential side, by living in homes we generate heat and all our activity uses energy.  I have already announced a planned further increase of 40% in the energy efficiency standards for homes as part of the climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>The highly successful green homes grant scheme has persuaded at least 10,000 or 11,000 homes to switch to renewable energy sources.  The scheme was extended in the 2007 budget and a further &euro;20 million has been added to it.  Under that scheme we have already achieved a saving of 37.000 tonnes per annum in those homes that have switched.  This emphasises that there is no single silver bullet solution to this and that a multiplicity of approaches will resolve it.</P>
        <P>On the issue of encouraging people to switch, I have introduced planning exemptions for micro-renewables in domestic dwellings and also introduced the change which will encourage more homes to switch to solar energy by removing the planning costs concerned.</P>
        <P>Senator McDowell is quite correct that transport accounts for a considerable emissions tonnage.  The 140% growth in transport has arisen from economic growth and development and is owing to the fact that there are 2 million people at work whereas there were 1 million people at work 15 years ago.  It is a reality that people choose a particular lifestyle.</P>
        <P>On whether we are behind, today&rsquo;s British budget is interesting.  I read that one of the headline figures Gordon Brown introduced today is that the drivers of the most polluting vehicles are to see their car tax almost double to &pound;400.  Compare the top rates in Britain to those in Ireland and one will see who is serious about dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>On the transport initiatives, more than &euro;200 million was set aside in the 2006 budget for tax relief for bio-fuels, and Senator McDowell did <Col N="1210"/>not mention this.  That initiative will deliver a further 250,000 tonnes of emissions savings.  It is an important initiative that is doubly beneficial.  On the one hand, bio-fuels produce less emissions and on the other, they cut our import bills, as the Senator fully appreciates.  More importantly, however, they give a cash crop to farmers who were denied one because of the silly decisions taken by the sugar company.  Rather than suggest that there is no joined-up thinking, a complete holistic approach is being adopted.  In addition, a bio-fuels obligation will be introduced to ensure that bio-fuels represent 5.75% of Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel market by 2010 and 10% by 2020.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 is a document which Senator McDowell has not recognised.  Some &euro;16 billion of Transport 21 has been put aside specifically to improve public transport.  One cannot decide in a Stalinist way to impose on people a requirement that they travel by public transport without making public transport better.  For generations, we in this country failed to invest in public transport.  The first Government in the history of the State to invest significant funds in public transport is this one.  In fact, the modal shift from implementation of Transport 21 is calculated to save of the order of 500,000 tonnes of carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>The figures are impressive.  Luas, whatever one says about it, carried 26 million passengers in its first year of operation.  It now has capacity to handle 80,000 people per day.  The DART extension, which was achieved in the lifetime of this Government, can now carry 90,000 people per day.  As I use it occasionally, I can tell the House that it is packed and the extensions, which are long overdue, are welcome.</P>
        <P>A combination of tax concessions for lower emission cars and an updating of labelling for cars introducing, as Senator McDowell stated, the change for hybrid cars, fuel-efficient cars and dual-fuel cars will produce savings.  It is not true to state that nothing is being done.  I referred to British Government&rsquo;s budget today.  The British Government is light years behind Ireland, not just this Government but a series of Governments, in terms of the way we tax motor vehicles.</P>
        <P>One matter Senator McDowell did not mention, and which is left out of the debate from time to time, is waste management.  Waste management is one area where we can make phenomenal changes if only we are honest with ourselves.  I agree with Senator Ryan that there is a need to be honest and open in this debate.  He is quite right that the hard decisions must be made.  One of the major decisions that has been made in the lifetime of this Government in the past ten years is to divert phenomenally increased percentages away from landfill.  Only ten years ago approximately 10% of our waste was diverted from landfill.  This year the percentage diverted exceeds 35%.  We have passed the target set for 2013.  We must increase that percentage diverted and move ever more material away from landfill because landfill produces methane, which, as the House <Col N="1211"/>will be aware, is one of the worst forms of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>We have saved 1.2 million tonnes through waste management and waste diversion, and that is before we get into the area of incineration.  Combined heat and power, CHP, which Senator McDowell mentioned, is a matter about which we must be honest with the people.  We cannot argue for zero waste.  While in Toronto at the weekend, I asked about the Guelph method, as mentioned by the Greens from time to time, and people looked at me with mystification and pointed out that they have their own problems.  There are further domestic policies which we will announce as part of the climate change strategy document.</P>
        <P>I want to deal with the issue of emissions trading.  As the House will be aware, 109 Irish firms are in the EU emissions trading scheme, ETS.  Those firms will achieve a cut of 3 million tonnes because it pays them to achieve that.  They are well under way.  There are impressive examples of it being done.  It is a key element in the climate change strategy, not only here in Ireland but as part of the national allocations plans in every European country.</P>
        <P>Senator McDowell has not made the point in the Seanad, but it has been made from time to time in the D&aacute;il, that somehow the entire imposition should be placed on Irish industry.  I will deal with that tomorrow in any event.  If one looks at this issue of carbon trading, which is so misrepresented in this country, Sir. Nicholas Stern, the European Commission and progressive environmentalists from around the world are of the view that putting a cost on carbon through carbon trading is the way forward.  In fact, Stern has suggested that it should become part of a global response.</P>
        <P>There is a second part of carbon trading which is incredibly misrepresented in this country, that is, the issue of using the flexible mechanism under the Kyoto Agreement.  That agreement allows countries to buy a certain amount of carbon from other countries which have carbon to spare.</P>
        <P>In my view, the contributor to the recent Paris conference who stood out was the executive secretary of the UN Conference on Climate Change, Mr. Yvo de Boers.  He argued strongly that the purchase of carbon credits by member states allows developed countries such as Ireland to be progressive and demanding in terms of accepting ambitious targets for carbon attenuation and cutting greenhouse gas emissions while also supporting the developing world without fear of undermining economic growth.  Kofi Annan made the same point at the Nairobi conference.  Carbon trading has been misrepresented to an astonishing degree in this country.  Carbon trading allows a country such as Ireland to meet challenging and difficult targets.  I acknowledge that difficult and politically unpopular decisions will have to be made but if we explain the position honestly and truthfully, the people will accept that one of the <Col N="1212"/>ways to make the transition is by making use of carbon trading.</P>
        <P>We are to cut 15.2 million tonnes and have decided to purchase in the order of 3 million tonnes per year.  These purchases allow us to make the transition while assisting the developing world because the danger arises that the latter will be left behind.  To find examples of real poverty and challenges resulting from climate change, one only needs to consider what is happening in Sub-Saharan Africa, where people face desertification and women have to spend half their waking hours walking for miles to pick up bits of timber and deplete their forests to provide energy.  The great benefit of using the carbon trading mechanisms available under Kyoto, including in particular the mechanisms governed by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is that they allow us to be ambitious about cutting carbon emissions while also providing countries with support in meeting their energy needs in a way that prevents them from falling victim to second-hand technologies passed on by the developed world.  It is entirely virtuous and positive to operate in such a manner.  It is not a matter, as people in this country have claimed, of buying ourselves out of trouble or looking for the easy way out.  That is a fatuous approach to this issue.</P>
        <P>All the signatories to the Kyoto Agreement accepted this arrangement.  Mr. Nicholas Stern agrees with the arrangement and spoke about it at length.  The United Nations Secretary General spoke about it in his Nairobi initiative.  The UN commission speaks about it, as does the secretary to the UNFCCC and a variety of progressive environmentalists.  The positive benefits of the arrangement were even mentioned in the Al Gore documentary.  For some reason, however, it is not acceptable to people in this country.  Talk about the world being out of step with my Johnny.  We live in a world which faces the reality that we have very little time in which to act.  We have to be ambitious and impose penalties and strictures if we are to continue to enjoy our current standards.  Mr. Stern has pointed out with crystal clarity that if we do not deal with the problem now, we will pay a much higher price later.</P>
        <P>I take issue with Senator McDowell regarding the benefits of carbon taxes.  Over the past two years, the price of fuel spiked in this country and the cost of petrol and diesel went through the roof but there was no major reduction in consumption.  We need to consider that debate very carefully.</P>
        <P>We will be debating these issues at length tomorrow in the context of the Carbon Fund Bill 2006, but I wish to make a point regarding the post-2012 period.  We are currently discussing the Kyoto period, which runs from 2008 to 2012, but it is imperative for a variety of reasons that we start focussing our minds and policies on the period beyond 2012.  The decisions we have to make on energy will have long-term implications.</P><Col N="1213"/>
        <P>I have believed for many years with every fibre in my body that we as a people have made the right moral decision to reject the nuclear route.  Nuclear energy is an immoral answer to the problem.  However, we have to commit ourselves to the post-2012 period.  The White Paper on energy is a progressive document in that regard.  It explores areas where Ireland could make an impact, save ourselves and contribute a lot to the debate on climate change.</P>
        <P>We are sometimes excessively fearful in this country of making decisions.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is committing us to making decisions on issues such as wave and tidal energy and to ambitious targets for biofuels.  I would much prefer to be part of a Government that commits Ireland to ambition than one which snivels and looks the other way.  If we do not meet the target or only go three quarters of the way, at least we will have aimed high.  I believe we can meet our targets on biofuels and alternative energy.  We can achieve great results in areas such as tidal energy if we have the courage to commit.  We have a moral responsibility to argue the non-nuclear case because the powerful and sinister nuclear lobby is trying to take over this debate.  The other night, I listened to that well-known environmentalist, Mr. Bernard Ingham, argue the case for nuclear power and he convinced me more than ever that I was right all along.</P>
        <P>It is unfair to continuously castigate ourselves or say we have not achieved anything.  We can always do better or be more ambitious but it is not true to say that an economy which has grown by 150% since 1990 while keeping emissions growth to 25% is going nowhere.  I accept that hard work remains to be done.  We will have to work harder to reach our Kyoto target of 13% above 1990 levels but I believe we can be successful.  However, we will not meet the target by suggesting silver bullet solutions because these do not exist.</P>
        <P>I want to avoid making political points because too many political shots have already been fired in this debate.  Two years ago, I decided to act on waste electrical products, which are the most environmentally polluting of all products going to landfill.  Everybody said my initiative would fall flat on its face and quite a few people were hopeful that would be the case.  However, because we set an ambitious target, we have passed it.  Instead of meeting the EU target for 2008 of 4 kg per person of recycled products per year, we are already recycling 6.7 kg.  That demonstrates, as did the smoking and plastic bags initiatives, that when we set our minds to a problem, we can solve it.</P>
        <P>When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I do not refer to the Government of the day but to the people.  We are meeting the ambitious targets we have set ourselves for recycling.  It is not a political point to say we lack self-confidence in our capacity to deliver.  This Government has made the decision to sup<Col N="1214"/>port the EU in persuading the international community to sign up to ambitious reductions of 30% by the year 2020.  If this is not accepted, we have agreed that Europe should impose on itself a 20% cut.  That is the way to show leadership.</P>
        <P>Meeting the challenge of global climate change will be difficult, particularly for small countries such as Ireland.  I regularly listen to the demands of Members in the other House that we lead the world on this issue but if we closed our entire economy, switched off all the lights, destroyed our herds and returned to the time when we did not have fire, we would save 2.75 minutes in terms of global warming.  We could take the view that we are too small to have an effect but it would be immoral to do so.</P>
        <P>We are making change.  We can all be ambitious and impatient and they are good qualities whereas self-delusion is not.  It is wrong to suggest we have not done our bit in Ireland and it runs counter to the facts. We have achieved a great deal but we still have work to do.  I outlined a number of policies earlier and I will outline further policies tomorrow.  On 2 April, I will announce another set of ambitious policies under the climate change strategy.  I am prepared to listen because I am not one of those people who comes into the House and arrogantly believes all wisdom is on the Government side.  That is never the case, as there is wisdom on all sides in all debates.  If we listen more, we will find solutions.</P>
        <P>It is untrue, unfair and inaccurate to say we have achieved nothing.  We have achieved a great deal but we still face a major task.  Rather than spend time scoring silly points off each other, we should examine each other&rsquo;s policies honestly, give them a fair appraisal and support them.  If a good policy is put forward by the Opposition, I would be willing to take it on.  I was criticised elsewhere today about an announcement I made last week to eliminate the use of incandescent bulbs.  Somebody said I was shooting for the moon and that my proposal was &ldquo;a bit of a nonsense&rdquo;.  If this results in a 10% reduction in our energy output while, at the same time, saving every householder money, it will not be a bit of nonsense.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn knows plenty about a good long-term bargain.  Rather than scoring points off each others, if we examine policies honestly and openly and adopt a more holistic, cross party approach on  his issue, we will achieve our Kyoto targets in a way that will result in all of us winning because Ireland will become the most efficient and progressive country in terms of energy production.  We have achieved a huge amount but we still have challenges to meet, which will be met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the motion and I totally condemn the lack of action by the Government to tackle the issue of climate change, which is affecting the future viability not only of this country but of the entire globe.  Climate change and the <Col N="1215"/>emission of greenhouse gases is one of the major issues facing the world.  In light of increased evidence that man-made carbon dioxide and other gas emissions are having an effect on global temperatures.  This has been evident in many reports on television recently from various part of the world.  It is necessary that all countries play their part in reducing emissions and tackling climate change.</P>
        <P>In January 1996, James Hansen, director of NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies said, &ldquo;The climate system is being pushed hard enough, that change will become obvious to the man in the street in the next decade&rdquo;.  The man in the street is aware of climate changes that have taken place over the past decade, with the effects being apparent to most of us for some time.  Environmental issues are a high priority among the electorate, according to published polls over the past 12 months.  Public awareness recently received an emphatic boost courtesy of Al Gore&rsquo;s hard hitting movie, &ldquo;An Inconvenient Truth&rdquo;, which should be obligatory viewing for every school child and, especially, for every member of the Government, considering the appalling and frightening lack of awareness and lack of action on the issue of climate change.  Shock tactics, however, may fail to penetrate the sand in which they are hiding their heads.  That applies to several of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors as well.</P>
        <P>In the foreword to the National Climate Change Strategy 2000, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Business as usual is no longer an option for Ireland.  Our record economic growth means that even with flexibility to complete our development, against a low baseline in 1990, our strategy must be radically different in the coming decade.  We have already reached our Kyoto 13% growth limitation target.  Now we have to achieve the difficult task of dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions over this decade.  We intend to do so in a manner that protects our economy, that is equitable and that will place a premium on efficiency and on technical innovation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These were fine words, but like the empty promises of this Government, hollow and without substance.</P>
        <P>The Government promised an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse emissions, with more than 20 key measures, including promises to introduce carbon taxes, to introduce changes to the VRT car tax system so that it would be based on emissions and the conversion of Moneypoint power station from coal to a more environmentally efficient and friendly alternative.  Of these three promises, only the VRT proposal remains and this has not been implemented seven years later.  The Government&rsquo;s review of the national climate change strategy, Pathway to <Col N="1216"/>Kyoto Compliance: Review of the National Climate Change Strategy, projected that Ireland will miss its Kyoto target by an annual average of 7.174 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> equivalent.</P>
        <P>A plan for carbon taxes was not acted upon by the Government and Moneypoint still uses coal to produce electricity, which is not expected to change.  Fuel taxes have not increased in line with those in Northern Ireland so cross-Border fuel trade continues.  The review does not measure progress versus the target in the 2000 strategy.  However, by taking account of the target change in emissions from the national climate change strategy, we can examine the progress made up to 2005.  Carbon emissions were expected to be approximately 73,800 tonnes without implementing strategy measures and approximately 58,400 million tonnes with them implemented.   The emissions targets set in 1990 were revised upwards in 2000 but this should not affect the targeted percentage changes from the strategy.  Three years are left before the target date of the strategy is reached while the Kyoto protocol period begins in a year.  It is extremely unlikely that emissions can be reduced by enough to meet either target in such a short space of time.</P>
        <P>After ten years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats inactivity, which has produced the least environmentally friendly record in the history of the State, a quick review of the Government&rsquo;s performance shows that it has missed all our Kyoto targets.  Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions are twice the overall target and it is ranked 22 out of 27 countries regarding wind, wave and biomass energy generation.  Only 35% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy supply comes from renewables.  Seven environmental EU directives are still outstanding and the deadline for one was August 2004.  A total of 83% of Ireland&rsquo;s recyclable waste is exported according to the EPA and Ireland has consistently finished bottom of the EU league table on recycling.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The EU Commission took Ireland to the European Court of Justice over the appalling state of waste treatment facilities in this country.  Our transport emissions have increased by 140% since 1990 and the Government fudged the VRT labelling plan by providing gas guzzlers with a one year window.   The Government provided no additional buses to Dublin Bus over a five-year period and voted down a Fine Gael Bill that would have allowed for the compulsory blending of all motor fuels emissions, which have increased to 25.4% above 1990 levels whereas the Kyoto limit is 13%.  The Government has no option but to purchase carbon credits at a cost of a whopping &euro;270 million to the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Last month the EU forced the Government&rsquo;s hand with the introduction of an initiative to force car-makers to cut the amount of carbon dioxide produced by their cars to an average figure of 130 grams per kilometre.  This cut is only a step and it must be augmented in Ireland by Fine <Col N="1217"/>Gael&rsquo;s plan to charge heavy polluting vehicles a higher rate of VRT &mdash; a proposal Fianna F&aacute;il completely side-stepped.  In Europe, the Commission has taken a vital and welcome step in standing up to producers of big, heavy polluting cars.  However, that must be supported by Government action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate and the Minister.  I have already moved the amendment, which I support.  Climate change is recognised as the most serious and threatening global environmental problem.  Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Government has agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 13%, or 15 million tonnes per year, above the 1990 levels by the first commitment period of 2008-12.  The Minister referred to the Stern review talked about the economic impact of climate change predicting that a collective failure to address the world&rsquo;s rising greenhouse emissions will cost the equivalent of at least 5% of global GDP through the adverse impacts of climate change.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the national climate change strategy in 2000, the Government has put in place a variety of measures which will deliver a reduction of an average of 8 million tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions during the period 2008-12.  That is our compliance period for the Kyoto Protocol and the period during which the assessment will be made.</P>
        <P>We have strengthened the energy requirements in the building regulations and over the key period this will lead to a reduction of approximately 300,000 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per year.  The Minister has talked about the three-strand approach which includes measures to reduce emissions, emission reduction in the installations participating in the EU emissions trading scheme and, where it arises, the purchase of credits for carbon reductions elsewhere in the world.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has published a White Paper on Energy committed to delivering a sustainable energy future for Ireland.  The White Paper describes the actions and targets for the energy policy framework up to 2020, principally to support economic growth and to meet the needs of all consumers.  The paper sets a clear path for meeting the Government&rsquo;s goal to ensure safe and secure energy supplies, promoting a sustainable energy future and supporting competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The renewable energy directive, to which we are committed, will achieve a reduction of 1.3 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions annually.  Excess relief of more than &euro;200 million between 2006-10 will bring emission reductions of 250,000 tonnes annually, the equivalent of taking 76,000 cars off the road.</P>
        <P>I welcome the strategy and the other strategies announced by various Ministers.  I particularly welcome the greener homes renewable energy <Col N="1218"/>grant.  That scheme has been very successful and has had a tremendous take up.  It is encouraging to note the many new industries providing wood chips and wood pellets for that scheme.  It will deliver a reduction of approximately 200,000 tonnes in emissions.  The targets are ambitious but the Minister is right to try to meet them.  The target is to increase renewable use by 15% by 2010 and by 30% by 2020.</P>
        <P>The power of one campaign is aimed at supporting consumers in changing their energy practices and choices and is very worthwhile.  This campaign reflects the suggestion that, along with the Government, every member of society must play a part in the changes.  This very well broadcast campaign highlights the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P>An issue which probably needs more promotion is the Government&rsquo;s forestry programme.  From the figures I have seen, it will contribute to the removal of more than 2 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per annum.  Government policy is to increase the current level of afforestation by up to 17% by 2030.  In most cases, farmers will do the planting.  Annual premium payments are available as are planting grants to cover the establishment cost.  In the 2007 budget, more than &euro;15 million over three years was provided to encourage farmers to grow bio-energy crops.  We are all familiar with the recent announcements by the Minister, particularly in regard to the growing of willow.</P>
        <P>I should also mentioned that we have had great success in the area of recycling.  Contrary to what Senator Bannon said, the figures in this regard have increased.  In schools, in particular, there is great emphasis among young people on the benefits of recycling.  The green flag, for example, is now available.  A programme is in place and it is very well supported.  An Taisce is involved in this, and a number of green flags have been awarded to schools.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 also provided a scheme of tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects which was extended from the end of 2006 to the end of 2011.  The national development plan includes a range of major investments which will result in the lowering of greenhouse gases.  Under Transport 21 public transport will benefit greatly in the next seven years.  In the west, we were very fortunate to have the western rail corridor included in that &euro;34 billion package.  Many people were opposed to the reopening of the line from Sligo to Limerick, or Killooney to Claremorris, the two ends of that scheme.  It took a very brave decision by the then Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, to have consultants examine this project.  Unbelievably, it was not included initially.  Everyone knew a rail service to Galway city was required.  The roads need upgrading and there are terrible traffic jams in Claregalway which are mentioned in traffic reports every morning.  That development was welcome.</P><Col N="1219"/>
        <P>The national development plan provided funding for the purchase of carbon allowances as part of our strategy and funding of &euro;93 million for environmental research.  The Government is very aware of what can be done in regard to environmental protection.  The farm plastics scheme led to traffic jams in Galway when it was first introduced at the marts.  Galway was one of the first counties to be included as was County Offaly.  Some 18 more counties are now included which is a great improvement.  The plastic bags scheme and the tax on white goods, about which the Minister spoke, have been very successful.  These are very commendable measures.</P>
        <P>I refer to EU directives on water quality.  I was disappointed to state on today&rsquo;s Order of Business that Galway still has some problems in regard to a parasite but 90% compliance with EU directives in other areas is a good achievement.  However, as I said this morning, we must do a little more in regard to water.  I congratulate the Minister on what he has done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion.  The original Labour Party motion was one in Irish about the education system and I thought to myself &ldquo;What fools&rdquo;.  They have missed the obvious issue which is climate change.  I had decided to table a motion and I got my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, to second it.  However, the issue is what is important rather than the personalities involved.  I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling this important motion.</P>
        <P>I note at the outset that the evidence for climate change is now both overwhelming and incontrovertible.  It is not simply confined to the apparently short historical records of scientific accuracy in our possession, because we also possess tools such as core samples and geological evidence.  We can go back hundreds of thousands of years to ascertain the prevailing conditions.  We know a highly significant change is taking place and that we are responsible for it.  Even those who have no altruistic concern for the planet or for future generations have been jolted by the report of Sir Nicholas Stern, of which mention has been made.  Effectively, he rattled the money box in the face of international capitalism.  Demonstrating that the unchecked emission of carbon gases would lead to a 20% drop in global production has at last caught the attention of erstwhile blas&eacute; political leaders.  This was followed by the report of the findings of a committee of more than 2,000 internationally reputable scientists, which pointed in the same direction.</P>
        <P>However, there are still those who would deny it.  A few voices, either eccentric or representing vested interests, have attempted to challenge the facts.  Channel 4 broadcast a disreputable film along these lines that purported to represent a reasonable scientific viewpoint.  However it is clear that the quotations from the few scientists whose views could be manipulated to these ends <Col N="1220"/>were selectively employed and even these scientists have, in large part, protested against the abuse of their names.  One would not expect anything else from Channel 4, which has sunk from being a reputable station of strong investigative and progressive bent to being a mere vehicle for the recycling of the American situation comedies, vulgar so-called reality shows and similar rubbish.  Just as in the past one had the disgraceful example of Holocaust deniers, one now has the unappetising spectacle, even among some Irish shock-jock journalists, of climate change deniers.  Such people remind me of Mrs. Noah in the medieval miracle play &ldquo;Noye&rsquo;s Fludde&rdquo; who, drunk and irresponsible, had to be hauled on board the Ark by her unfortunate husband at the very last moment before the waters covered the earth, even as she continued to pretend that nothing was happening.</P>
        <P>How is it possible for even the meanest intelligence to deny the clear evidence of climate change and human involvement in such change?  All available evidence points in this direction.  I saw it myself last year when I travelled to Svalbard in Spitsbergen because I heard an invitation over the airwaves from the Norwegian foreign minister.  He stated that everyone who was interested in the subject should go there to see what is happening.  This was not a sponsored trip and I was obliged to fork out myself for hotels in Norway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Senator cycled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not cycle.  I flew, thus adding to my carbon footprint.  However, the Norwegian ambassador was extremely helpful in making the arrangements and I saw the impact of climate change on the glaciers.  All Members are aware that lumps have been falling off the Matterhorn and villages are threatened by the collapse, not simply of the ice formations, but also of the rock formations behind them.  Significant rises in temperature have been recorded and have become so noticeable that even ordinary citizens, let alone scientists, across the planet are aware of this fact.</P>
        <P>Animal, bird and insect species are disappearing at an ever-increasing rate and there have been changes in fruit and flower growing patterns.  Last week, I heard people from County Wexford discuss the matter.  It has affected the industry there and people in County Wexford have been obliged to change their economic patterns.  At least one Pacific island has already disappeared under the ocean.  Perhaps the doubting Thomas&rsquo;s will be convinced only when the planet explodes.  By that time it will be too late and self-indulgence and stupidity will have triumphed.  Members should remember the words of Chief Seattle, who said that if one spits upon the earth one is spitting on oneself.  One cannot damage the environment without damaging oneself.</P><Col N="1221"/>
        <P>At the root of this problem lies the untrammelled capitalism of the world in which we live.  This is predicated upon the unsustainable principle of an infinitely expanding market.  However, this is an impossible and self-defeating idea because we live in a world of finite resources, as has been seen clearly in respect of fossil fuels.  Nevertheless, in the past 40 years business has implemented the notion of planned obsolescence.  In other words, decay is built into merchandise.</P>
        <P>I recently came across a good example of this phenomenon.  My washing machine flooded the kitchen and I summoned a plumber.  When he asked me how long I had it, I replied that I had it for only 20 years.  He nearly fainted and had to be given active resuscitation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Poor man.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He told me that washing machines last for only five years, after which they are expected to conk out.  I saw a programme recently in which it was stated that television sets provide good value for only approximately two years.  I have sets going back to the 1960s, including a black and white 12-inch set in the kitchen, which still adequately receives the RTE television news while I am washing the dishes.</P>
        <P>I am a prudent old Protestant and am old enough to remember when, on fashionable Nassau Street, there was a very good umbrella shop called Johnsons.  It also re-covered them and replaced their spokes.  However, that has gone, as have all similar enterprises.  While I am lucky enough to have found a decent cobbler in my neighbourhood, most cobblers have vanished.  Many of them have gone out of business because of increasing rents.  I managed to get my old Roberts radio repaired last week in a shop in Aungier Street or Camden Street.  It was almost the last radio repair shop in Dublin and it closed down last Friday.  This disposable culture is a mistake.</P>
        <P>I had a slight difficulty with the mobile telephone that the taxpayer kindly gave to me.  It is a beautiful Nokia telephone about which I know nothing and I took it to a major retailer on Grafton Street.  The assistant informed me that it could not be repaired and that even if it could, it would cost &euro;450.  The retailer gave me an upgrade at the cheap rate of &euro;150.  When I asked what would happen to my old telephone he replied that he would shove it in the bin.  Luckily, I told my friend Tevfik and he was outraged.  He pointed out that the telephone I had was the best on the market and told me to return immediately to the shop and retrieve it from the wastepaper basket, which I did.  He told me it was the best telephone available and that it was being withdrawn because it was so good.  Such telephones did not get damaged, enjoyed roaming facilities and so on.  After fishing it out we found a Congolese shop.  While such people may be poor and live on the margins, they knew what to do and managed to <Col N="1222"/>repair it for &euro;20, which was fantastic.  This issue of wastefulness lies behind the damage being done to the environment.</P>
        <P>The Kyoto limits on carbon emissions have already been considerably exceeded by Ireland, which has been described as a delinquent.  The European Environment Agency has stated that our transport emissions, excluding marine and aviation, grew by a staggering 140%.  This is nothing to boast about and Ireland is among the worst polluters.  However, like a drunk driver who breaks a red light, totals his car and perhaps fatally injures a pedestrian, we seem to be taking the view that as we have paid the fine, it is all right.  However, this is not the case and we have made a mess.  In terms of climate change,  it is not simply the polluter who will pay as the entire planet will be forced to pay the price for the irresponsibility of world industry and world leaders.</P>
        <P>Behind this issue there is not just an elephant in the room, but a tyrannosaurus rex in the middle of the floor.  I refer to the population explosion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I sat the leaving certificate examination, the population of this planet has doubled and this cannot go on.  However, I look in vain for a single political or religious leader who relates to this obvious fact.  I have no patience for those who bemoan the decline in population in countries such as Italy and France.  As we live in a global environment, I am delighted to hear of such declines.</P>

	<P>Our ecological footprint is far worse than that of those living in the deprived parts of the world.  I do not say this for myself as I am growing old, have no offspring and am unlikely to ever have.  However, despite the depredations of mankind, there is a strong likelihood that this old planet will last my time.  However, unless we change our attitudes, there is every chance that other Members&rsquo; children will inherit a world that has been very significantly damaged and in which the struggle for survival will lead to ever more internecine conflicts and a situation where life itself will be barely worth the effort.  As the Minister noted, we are still in time to amend our ways but only just. If we do not heed the warnings, there are stormy waters ahead.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter.  At the outset I congratulate the Minister and his Department on their achievements to date.  A great deal has been achieved in the past ten years.  In 2000, we were finally in a <Col N="1223"/>position to afford to have a strategy and invest serious finances in tackling an issue which no one denies is a major challenge not only globally but for us as a country and individuals.  We have made steps forward.  We will remove 8 million tonnes of greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012, the term of the Kyoto Protocol.  This will not be achieved by sitting back and waiting for things to happen or by not taking on the challenge or not having policies to tackle the issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>We will debate the Carbon Fund Bill tomorrow and the point of the strategy and thrust of the policy is to minimise the buying of credits under the Kyoto Protocol.  As a Government we recognise in the long term it is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest to reduce and minimise the amount of credits we must buy.  This is about getting the balance right between our competitiveness as a country and our ability to reduce our emissions.  As previous speakers stated we must compete globally and any advantage we can gain is in the interest of maintaining growth and continuing to provide jobs and futures for our children and young people.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out, we have maintained this balance.  Our economy grew by 150% between 1990 and 2004 and our emissions increased by only 25%.  This is a major achievement in itself and it did not happen by accident.  The balance between our rate of population and economic growth and our responsibilities with regard to emissions is delicate.  We must consider our achievements.</P>
        <P>The issue of traffic was raised and traffic measures, improved roads and infrastructure such as the Port tunnel mean we have shorter journey times.  This morning, one side of the tunnel was closed for a short period of time and it caused chaos on the roads in Dublin.  People sat in their cars with the engines running and emissions went shooting through the roof.  People slated the tunnel when it was first suggested and stated it would never happen or make a difference.  It has made a major difference, particularly to the centre of Dublin.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 is being rolled out and the majority of new roads are on time and under budget.  We have new train stations and DART extensions.  Investment in public transport is up.  The reality of life is that we cannot all cycle everywhere and this is a fact.  We must consider alternatives and examine issues such as transport emissions which increased by 140%.  The reason they increased is that we have twice as many people getting up in the morning to go to work and twice as many cars on the road.  One quarter of all our diesel fuel is used up in fleets, a substantial amount of which is used abroad on transport and other areas.  We must consider all of these areas and how to tackle issues such as SUVs.  We have made strides in this regard.</P><Col N="1224"/>
        <P>Senator Kitt mentioned the greener home schemes and encouraging individuals and family groups to take on the responsibility of change through grants and other incentives.   The Minister pointed out that the number of applications for the scheme surprised everybody.  We can always do more, both collectively and individually.  Much of it comes down to individual choice.</P>
        <P>I wish to take issue with a particular point, namely, the argument on per capita emissions which are the emissions a country produces per head of population.  When one considers it logically, if every country was judged on a per capita emissions basis all of the parties signed up to the Kyoto Protocol including China and India would be considered as not having as much of an effect as they actually do.  When it comes to judging Ireland, these issues must be taken into consideration.  As a country, one must consider our increase in population and economic success when one deals with how we as a country are seen throughout the world.</P>
        <P>The global warming debate is centre-stage with films, the Internet and all types of television programmes about it.  It is up to us to take responsibility, particularly as a Government.  We must have a steady but firm course and maintain the progress we made so far.  We must continue to research and develop renewable sources.  The Minister and the Government have taken this issue extremely seriously.  We must modernise our energy networks, which we are doing.  We must encourage and finance our industries to continue to find ways to reduce emissions.  The 109 most prolific industries are now signed up and major progress has been made in this area.</P>
        <P>We had major successes in agriculture and forestry through CAP reform, the nitrates policies and continuing to encourage afforestation.  The Building Control Bill went through the House today and will ensure all new housing and public buildings will conserve energy and reduce emissions.  The Minister steadfastly pursued, studied and approached this Bill in such a way that it is fair but firm.  This is what we need to do when considering an area such as emissions.  Transport will continue to play a key role in reductions and biofuels play a major role.  The more public and private companies make the change to alternative fuels, the quicker these changes will have an effect.  It is about encouraging people to do so.</P>
        <P>We have been successful to date in making progress towards meeting the Kyoto targets.  As the Minister stated, we should not talk down ourselves.  We need only look at some of our EU neighbours to see how successful we have been.  We cannot afford to slow the progress.  However, availing of whatever mechanisms are in place under the Protocol, including trading allowances, not only helps us achieve our aims.  It also allows developing countries invest in their infrastructures to improve their contributions towards improving the global climate.  We as a country have made a major contribution and taken major <Col N="1225"/>steps forward through many of the policies we pursued over the years.  I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I had an interesting day yesterday.  I spent the day in Brussels at a meeting of 40 or 50 supermarket operators and retailers with Mr. Vinois who heads the unit implementing Angela<?oasys _jy ?>Merkel&rsquo;s proposals.  He reminded me of<?oasys _jy ?>Roosevelt who stated, &ldquo;Speak softly but carry a big stick&rdquo;.  Mr. Vinois stated what he wanted to achieve and we stated we would do our best to achieve it for him.  However, it was clear if we do not do our best and achieve it he has a big stick which he will use.</P>
        <P>The reason I support the motion is that I do not believe we implemented the plan we have.  I was interested to hear the Minister report what was achieved.  However, we are failing in many ways.  One can twist statistics and measure it in other ways.  We have not met anything like the targets we must.  We set out a strategy and plan and we have the economics to work at the same time.  However, the Minister is in danger of making a mistake because the challenge is far greater than we think.  The Government made a cynical calculation about public attitudes to private change.  I believe it decided the majority of people did not really care about it.  It believed the general public was incensed about many other issues, such as those mentioned by Senator Brady.  The public is annoyed about traffic congestion and the price of houses and child care, but the Government made a cold calculation that not many people would care very much about climate change.</P>
        <P>This is the reason the strategy does not get implemented, as the Government believes the people do not require real action to be taken with this problem.  It believes people will be satisfied there is a plan in place, and they will not look beyond this to see if action is flowing from the plan.  The Government may be correct in its calculation of how the public thinks, but although it may be correct, it is certainly not right.</P>
        <P>It is not the job of Government simply to satisfy the short-term needs and desires of the public.  Many would argue that the Government&rsquo;s most important job is to look into the future and prepare the country for the eventualities beyond the horizon.  It is not a matter of responding to publicity expressing immediate needs, but one of identifying long-term threats and opportunities to prepare the country to meet them in the best possible way.  That is the fundamental role of Government and a Government failing to live up to the challenge will be harshly judged in the cold, unforgiving light of history.</P>
        <P>One of the most important issues arising from the very interesting meeting yesterday was the discussion about energy in Europe.  We are in danger of relying on energy coming from outside Europe and Ireland is most at risk of all the Euro<Col N="1226"/>pean countries because we produce very little of our own energy.  What happens if Russia decides to cut off its energy supply, as it did to the Ukraine earlier this year?  We would find ourselves without sources of oil, yet we have not developed anything to solve the problem that may arise.  There is a danger the lights could go out.</P>
        <P>We had to install generators in the company I ran for many years because we had a memory of 20 or 30 years ago when on a number of occasions the power went out, usually due to ESB power failures or strikes.  We have forgotten that blackouts occur.  We have been very fortunate that they have not happened in recent years and I offer congratulations to all who have managed to maintain that record.</P>
        <P>We read of what happened in Italy some years ago, as well as in the United States and Canada three or four years ago.  We realise there is a danger we could lose our power and we therefore must take significant steps to prevent that happening.  The reason we would do this does not relate solely to climate change but because there is not enough energy being produced.  Every time we ignore that threat we are in danger of being placed in that scenario.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan spoke of how the transportation of goods around the country should be moved from road to rail.  That is an interesting challenge of which I have not thought previously.  I have been on the M50 and other motorways recently and was amazed at the number of trucks on the road.  Does the Minister realise half of these trucks are empty?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a challenge that surely can be solved.  From a commercial point of view, it would make more sense to have trucks full on both journeys.  This may necessitate a different use of trucks and I am not sure how this would happen.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to note the move by Europe to energy-efficient lightbulbs, which was mentioned by the Minister.  I commented on this when I heard it had occurred in Australia a month or two ago.  This is achievable although, as the Minister said, it is an investment that will incur costs.  The EU and Government can make this a reality and we will benefit on that basis.</P>
        <P>I was reminded of another issue at approximately 6.30 a.m. this morning.  I could not believe it was bright at that time. Why do we not move to central European time for the whole year and gain the benefit at this hour of the night.  We could have another hour of daylight if we did so.</P><Col N="1227"/>
        <P>We can take steps in the right direction.  I have a daughter who is anxious to use biofuels but is afraid that if she uses them in her car she will be unable to buy them in service stations.  Where can they be bought in Dublin?  I gather it is nearly impossible to do so, although I understand CIE and in particular Bus &Eacute;ireann have the benefit of such biofuels.  They are certainly not advertised as being available, and somebody told me one would have to go to the Minister&rsquo;s constituency to get biofuels in a service station.</P>
        <P>The targets set by Europe include having renewable energies providing 20% of the supply and improving energy efficiency by 20%.  From what I understand, if we can convince the rest of the world to join in we could have up to 30% savings.  The United States, India and China have not joined in.  We must convince them, as the moral power of Europe may be able to do something, although it may be wishful thinking.</P>
        <P>I understand the plans, targets, objectives and ambitions, but I do not understand how they will be implemented.  We can take both small and big steps.  As the Minister stated, we have achieved significantly.  I remember some years ago a Swiss man in my home who could not believe we were burning coal that was not smokeless.  He told me they had not burned that type of coal for years in Switzerland.  Deputy Harney as a Minister of State grabbed hold of that target, Deputy Martin as Minister for Health and Children grabbed hold of the target on the smoking ban and Deputy Noel Dempsey as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government grabbed hold of target on the levy on plastic bags, although the Minister before us was also involved.</P>
        <P>We have seen the light.  When we believe we can achieve something, we can do it.  What we need is for the Minister to state that this is something that can be done.  I met a Japanese businessman some years ago who spoke of how he had achieved so much.  I asked him what helped him in his achievements and he gave me a lovely quote.  He was in his 70s, which is quite young nowadays and I believe he was a tennis player.  He told me when he went to play a game of tennis, if he thought he had no chance of winning he would be right.  If he went in thinking he had a chance of beating the other fellow, he knew he could do it.  His quote was &ldquo;Whether you believe you can or whether you believe you cannot, you are right.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I believe we can do this and set our hearts to it.  I touched on three or four minor actions that we can take.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place and that the strategy and plans exist.  However, I have not seen any implementation.  I urge the Minister to convince the people of Ireland that he has the ability to do this because he wants to do it.  If that is so, he will achieve his target.</P>

	<P>When this side of the House puts down a motion we praise the Government and when the Opposition puts down a motion it condemns the Government.  This is an important motion because it concerns not just a part of Dublin, Leinster or Ireland, but the whole world.  In one way I am glad the motion has been put down because it will contribute in some way to what Senator McDowell called for, a genuine public debate.  The issue is important because it affects the lives of everybody throughout the world.</P>
        <P>It has been said that we have not decoupled growth from emissions, but Ireland has successfully decoupled greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth.  From 1990 to 2004 emissions increased by 23%, whereas our economy increased by almost 150%.  This is reflected in the emissions intensity of the Irish economy.  In 2004, emissions per unit of GDP were 48% of the 1990 level and the equivalent figure for the EU 15 was 78%.</P>
        <P>We will meet our Kyoto Protocol target of cutting emissions by 15 million tonnes per year, 13% above the 1990 limits.  This will be achieved by a number of measures.  For example, action by Irish firms, some 109 installations in total, already participating in the EU emissions trading scheme amounts to 3 million tonnes per annum.  Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the rest of the economy, including agriculture, forestry and transport amounts to 8 million tonnes per annum.</P>
        <P>Investment in clean technology to ensure emission reductions in developing countries in return for carbon credits to offset against our emissions is explicitly provided for in the Kyoto Protocol and was supported in the Stern report.  That amounts to a saving of 3.6 million tonnes.  The purchase of carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol is very important for developing countries in terms of access to clean energy technology.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="7" />
        <P>Climate change is a global problem and a tonne of emissions saved in the developing world is the same as a tonne of emissions saved in Ireland.  This approach has been supported by the Stern report and the UN and the Government is prepared to purchase up to 3.6 million carbon allowances per year during the 2008-12 period.  Our approach will help Ireland achieve its Kyoto target on a cost efficient basis, protect competitiveness and jobs and support developing and emerging nations.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a high level of greenhouse gas emissions <i>per capita</i>.  In 2004, the figure was at 17 tonnes compared to the EU average of 11 tonnes.  Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg had higher <i>per capita</i> CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions than Ireland.  There are reasons for Ireland&rsquo;s figure, such as our heavy reliance on fossil fuels for power generation.  In 2004, renewable energy met only 5.2% of electricity needs.  The energy Green Paper commits us to reach 30% by 2020, which we will do in our fourth term of office.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>The scale and nature of the agricultural sector are problems.  Our livestock numbers are large compared to our population and agriculture accounts for 29% of greenhouse gas emissions here compared to an average of 10% for the EU-15.  Only Mongolia has more agriculture in this respect.</P>
        <P>The high level of cement production <i>per capita</i> due to considerable construction activity is another problem.  Ireland&rsquo;s cement production accounted for approximately 5.5% of emissions in 2004.  Also that year, an estimated 10% of petrol and 25% of diesel sold in Ireland was consumed outside the State, comprising 18% of our road transport emissions.  It is not often understood that a significant portion of Ireland&rsquo;s purchasing requirements arises not from the Government&rsquo;s failure to reduce emissions, but from so-called fuel tourism.  Due to UN greenhouse gas counting rules, the fuel purchased in the State by motorists and hauliers and consumed elsewhere must be recorded in our greenhouse gas inventory.  In 2005, this was estimated to have accounted for 2.4 million tonnes of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions, two thirds of the Government&rsquo;s annual purchasing requirement.  However, the revenue raised from excise and VAT on the sale of the fuel amounts to approximately &euro;317 million, which more than offsets the cost of purchasing the allowances.</P>
        <P>Other measures have been taken.  The roll-out of Transport 21 in the period ending 2015 will see investment of almost &euro;16 billion in public transport projects, encouraging more people to use public transport.  Senator Ryan had a great idea, that is, to encourage greater heavy goods transport by rail.  Unfortunately, the railways do not encourage increased transport and those who use  rail services for heavy goods transport say they are slow.  I will address that matter later.</P>
        <P>The alignment of the investment with the national spatial strategy and the development of integrated land use and transportation strategies at gateway-city level will help to constrain growth in transport emissions by ensuring that future residential and commercial developments will be concentrated as close as possible to current and future public transport systems, thus maximising the investment&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s announcement of a new target for the use of biofuels of 5.75% by 2009 is calculated to achieve CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of up to 700,000 tonnes, the equivalent of removing almost 200,000 cars from the road.  A more ambitious target of 10% by 2020 has been set by the Government.  The Government has approved the establishment of a ministerial task force on climate change, which is working on the new national climate change strategy.  A priority, the strategy will be published before Easter.</P>
        <P>I am a believer in the adaptability of humans.  We have shown that we can exist in and adapt to any environment.  I am also a believer in human <Col N="1230"/>ingenuity and enterprise.  People will not give up driving cars or lorries.  We have become used to a lifestyle and will not abandon it overnight, but we will develop other forms of fuel and styles of transport.  We will not let the world go downhill.  It is good that we have called a halt and highlighted the issue.  It is also good that motions such as this are tabled because they accentuate our concern for the problem.  Like other Governments, our Government knew the problem existed for some time and came to accept it gradually.  We are now tackling it.</P>
        <P>Humans have been always able to adapt to any environment in which they found themselves and I do not doubt we will be able to do likewise in this regard.  We will change, use other fuels and methods of transport and prevent the world from being destroyed gradually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion, which I support, and commend the Labour Party on tabling the subject for debate.  I also want to acknowledge the contributions of all Members.  I listened to three or four speeches.</P>
        <P>This is a topic on which every Member across the political divide wishes to promote and secure progress.  If any party placed a motion re climate change or broader environmental issues on the Order Paper ten or 15 years ago, most Members would have wondered about what the motion was concerned.  The rightful success of the environmental movement since then has resulted in every citizen of the world recognising the fact that environmental issues are of considerable concern and must be addressed.  We need only reflect on the success of Al Gore&rsquo;s film, &ldquo;An Inconvenient Truth&rdquo;, a year ago to appreciate that the debate on environmental protection concerns every political party and group in society, not just one.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House refers to the Government&rsquo;s performance in recent years, our response to climate change, our plans and how we are adapting to deal with the current situation.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s slogan at the last election &mdash; &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo; &mdash; could apply to this issue.  While progress has been made, more work must be done.</P>
        <P>I will comment on some of the issues raised in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  He referred to waste management and the contribution of recycling, etc.  It is an area in which local authorities have probably moved in the wrong direction in the past ten or 15 years.  Only recently have they taken on board the issue of recycling and provided suitable recycling centres and sufficient recycling facilities.</P>
        <P>In my county and parish, we have spent tens of millions of euro on developing a large landfill site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A dump.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  That is no longer the politically correct word, but the site at Bottlehill is a dump.  It caused significant grief among the local <Col N="1231"/>community and local politicians, including me.  It seems to be out of step with current thinking on waste management policy, but pouring all of County Cork&rsquo;s waste into a landfill is Cork County Council&rsquo;s solution to waste management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Good countries turn it into energy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as most local authorities are concerned, that is phase 4, but we have not moved to phase 2 yet.  It is disappointing that there is no national waste management strategy.  What is occurring in County Cork is not occurring in County Limerick and what is occurring in County Limerick is not occurring in County Donegal.  This is not the largest country in the world.  We need to put in place a national system.  It seems that one local authority is developing a substantial landfill site, while other local authorities, such as Galway County Council, are trying to put in place the ultimate green system of waste management and disposal, involving recycling, etc.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, and his Department have to ensure there is a single national waste management strategy.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned in passing the issue of biofuels, which I am concerned about as a representative of the Mallow area of north Cork.  He participated in the broad political debate on the closure of the Mallow sugar factory and the winding up of the Irish sugar industry.  Such events must give us an opportunity to develop a proper biofuels strategy.  While we are all in favour of biofuels, some Senators pointed out that if one travels in a car that has been converted to run on biofuels, one cannot be sure where the next fuel supply station will be.  The Government needs to give more support to biofuels.  It seems that an opportunity was lost when the plants in Mallow and Carlow were closed.  Anyone with a basic knowledge of science will be aware that sugar beet and other crops such as wheat can be used to produce biofuels.  While that process is not as simple as we sometimes pretend it is, we should examine its potential.  We can help the ailing agriculture industry &mdash; farmers do not know what to do next to make a living &mdash; by investing significantly in alternative crop production.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to speak to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, about the rural environment protection scheme.  I fully endorse the scheme because it supports those involved in the industry.  However, I understand farmers participating in the scheme will not be allowed to participate in the environmentally friendly scheme whereby crops will be grown for use in the production of biofuels.  It seems politically and economically bizarre that a person who is involved in one environmental support measure &mdash; the REP scheme &mdash; will not be allowed to take advantage of the grants which are made available under another scheme for the production of biofuels.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, should consult his Cabinet colleague, <Col N="1232"/>Deputy Coughlan, to ensure this little anomaly is resolved.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the House could discuss this subject for a long time.  The challenge we face is to respond to the wishes of the public, which was not interested in environmental issues ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  There was a time when people did not appreciate the scale of the crisis, but they do now.  They are demanding answers from us and it is important we respond fully.  The Government has much more to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think I will get a chance to say everything I would like to say.  A great deal of it has been said earlier in the debate.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on his knowledge.  He has spearheaded the Government&rsquo;s climate change strategy, which I welcome.  I will speak about the great deal of progress that has been made to date.  I do not doubt that much more can be done over the next couple of years.  There is not enough public awareness of the climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on the publication of the White Paper on Energy.  The Government set in the White Paper an ambitious target of ensuring that by 2020, one third of the energy that will be consumed will come from renewable sources.  Such ambition is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I will highlight some of the many things which have been done.  The greener homes grant scheme for renewable energy in domestic homes has been a great success.  Our VRT and motor tax systems are heavily biased in favour of cars with smaller engines, which produce fewer emissions.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight a certain point for the Minister, Deputy Roche.  I wonder whether the industry is taking advantage of the current system.  If a garage owner can sell a car, he or she will choose to sell a petrol car and then give the discount, whatever it is.  He or she will not choose to sell a biofuel car because certain discrepancies would mean he or she would not gain in such circumstances.  I would like the Minister to examine such matters.  I could give many other examples if I had the time.</P>
        <P>A huge strategy needs to be developed if we are to ensure Ireland is energy-efficient. Our <Col N="1233"/>schools have a major role to play in this regard.  The public does not know enough about energy efficiency.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to provide &euro;200 million in the budget for relief on biofuels.  That is to be welcomed.  Where will we go in the future, however?  We all have a role to play in discussing this technical issue.  More non-technical information needs to be made available if the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to work.</P>
        <P>A great deal can be said about this matter in the future, but I will not say any more for now.  I wish the Minister luck with his work in this area.  I look forward to further discussions on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ormonde and other Members for giving me an opportunity to speak for a minute on this issue.  I would like to draw the attention of Senators to a document that was recently published by the Minister and his Department.  This simple and readable document, which contains a good and clear message, should be sent to every school in the country.  It outlines under eight categories what is being done, what needs to be done and what direction we are taking.  I was in the Loop Head area of County Clare at the weekend.  I assure the House I had other purposes in mind as well.  One would have had to witness the power of the Atlantic Ocean at the weekend to understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a source of huge energy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to lobby the Minister to invest more resources in wave energy.  I understand that some work is ongoing in Galway.  A number of sites have been identified on foot of work that was done by the University of Limerick, but the process is not moving fast enough.  I direct the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the electricity generation possibilities offered by wave energy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government and the ESB are investing hundreds of millions of euro in Moneypoint, which was mentioned at the start of the debate, to install the equipment that is needed to ensure the plant&rsquo;s emissions are reduced.  Germany and France have been working for a number of years on clean coal technology processes to help to reduce substantially the emissions caused by the use of coal, which is in plentiful supply throughout the world.  I am glad the ESB is working to reduce Moneypoint&rsquo;s emissions, thereby ensuring it will continue to play a major part in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements.  I am pleased the recent Government White Paper proposes that coal will continue to be used to generate power.  The technologies which are being developed will ensure coal will continue to be an important commodity.  As there is such a large global supply of coal, it is important we include it in energy policy for the years ahead.  I am happy to support Moneypoint, which I hope will continue to generate electricity for many years to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start by commenting on what Senator Daly has just said about Moneypoint.  There has never been any suggestion from this side of the House that Moneypoint should be closed.  I commented earlier on the commitment given in the 2000 plan that Moneypoint be incentivised to use some fuel other than coal to generate electricity.  A number of options are available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>One of them is the closure of Moneypoint.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Clean coal technology, which was mentioned by Senator Daly, is not sufficiently well developed for us to be reasonably secure in using it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Daly is aware that the use of such technology continues to be quite expensive.  We are spending hundreds of millions of euro to install certain facilities in Moneypoint which really should have been there in the first place.  While such facilities will help to reduce emissions, we will continue to use coal, which is essentially a dirty fuel.  If we do not do something soon, we will have lost our opportunity to develop cofiring, which is the use of a mix of fuels.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been talking about cofiring as a means of electricity generation for a number of years.  It could involve a mix of peat and biomass, or a mix of coal and biomass.  An opportunity still exists in Moneypoint to do something along those lines and I hope we will take it.  This illustrates the essential conflict between the aims of seeking to tackle climate change and seeking to ensure we have a diversity of fuels available for generating electricity in the future.  We have not resolved that and as long we do not do so, we will continue to emit far too high a level of carbon emissions in the energy sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, the White Paper outlines an ambitious project to move from turf burning to cofiring.  What the Deputy said is right.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that is the case.  If one considers this issue from the point of view of purely climate change, there is an overwhelming case for closing all the peat stations.  They have been effectively closed and three new ones have been recommissioned.  Peat is an enormous emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for approximately 10% of the greenhouse gases emitted by the electricity sector.  That level of emissions is far too high.  If one was considering this issue purely in terms of a climate change strategy, one would close them all in the morning, regardless of how efficient the new stations are compared with the old ones.  Peat is still a very dirty fuel.  One would not have to be a total cynic not to think that some <Col N="1235"/>political considerations have come into play in terms of that debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt mentioned the area of afforestation, which is an interesting one.  In a sense this is the other side of the coin &mdash; the positive side.  Afforestation is a positive step and it acts as a carbon sink.  There are two reasons we should develop our forests, the first is that they gobble up carbon and the second is that we need to invest in biomass and forestry if we are serious about increasing the renewable usage up to the levels we mentioned.  The Government needs to seriously examine the afforestation programme.  We have been growing more forests in recent years but that follows a period of prolonged deforestation.  Our forestry coverage here is still extremely low by comparison to the European average.  It is approximately 10% of the total land coverage of the country in comparison to an EU average, which I consider a high figure, of 30% or more.  We need to invest in the afforestation programme and to encourage and incentivise the sector in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>Much mention has been made of the emissions trading, with which I do not have a problem in principle.  The arguments made by Stern and others in its favour are persuasive but there is no doubt equally that it is very much the easy option in the current context of trying to get anywhere near our Kyoto targets.  Approximately half of the shortfall will be made up by carbon trading.  We are doing that simply because we have no other option, and we may as well be honest about it.   By all means we should continue to use the <Col N="1236"/>emissions trading system but we also need to do enough at home.  We need to make our own contribution, otherwise the moral and persuasive political argument the Minister made will fall flat on its face.  We are basically saying we will buy ourselves out of a problem if we need to do that.</P>
        <P>Senator Brady said the stabilisation of emissions in the past three or four years did not happen by accident, but in a sense it did.  We have dealt with two policies well in the last while, which we were not doing previously.  One is the change in the CAP, which has resulted in a reduction in the size of the national herd, and the other is the recycling policy.  Both have resulted in the reduction in emissions but that was not the primary purpose of either policy.  Therefore, it has happened almost by accident.  Let us take it as a gift.</P>
        <P>The purpose of tabling this motion was to stimulate a debate, the commencement of which we have had this evening.  That is a good development.  I also tabled the motion in the terms outlined, referring back to the 2000 strategy, in the knowledge that the Government is about to publish a new strategy.  I wish the Government well in setting ambitious targets.  They are, I hope, not only the Government&rsquo;s targets but will become national targets in the years ahead.  I regret that if we reflect on the experience of the past seven years, one would have to be somewhat sceptical about our capacity to deliver it.</P>

        <P LI="1">Bill entitled an Act to make provision, consequent on the conclusion of the ten-year framework social partnership agreement 2006-2015 known as &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;, for the establishment of a redundancy panel and the reference to it of certain proposed collective redundancies and for related action by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the obtaining from the Labour Court of opinions on the nature of proposed collective redundancies; to remove the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments; to make consequential amendments of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 and the Employment Equality Act 1998; and to make further amendments of those Acts to update penalties and for purposes of statute-law revision.</P>

    <Title>Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to deal with this important Bill in the Seanad.  As a result of the recent partnership talks, Towards 2016, it was agreed that this Bill should be enacted to provide for the establishment of a redundancy panel, for the reference to it of certain proposed collective redundancies and for related action by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Members will recall this arose from the Irish Ferries case and other matters.  The Bill provides for the removal of the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments.  It will also give effect to the judgement of the European Court of Justice in the Junk <i>v</i>. Kuhnel case regarding consultation with employees as required under Directive 98/59/EC being completed before notice of dis<Col N="1238"/>missal is given.  The Bill makes consequential amendments of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 and the Employment Equality Act 1998 and makes further amendments of those Acts to update penalties and in other formal respects.</P>
        <P>The opening up of the Irish labour market arising from the decision to permit direct access by citizens of the new EU member states has given rise to concerns about the possibility of the collective compulsory replacement of workers by lower paid workers from these states or elsewhere, either directly or through the use of other replacement workers within the jurisdiction.  The parties to Towards 2016 are agreed that this has the potential in certain circumstances to be harmful to the maintenance of good industrial relations in this country.  At the same time, the parties are fully agreed on the need for co-operation with ongoing change in response to competitive pressures, as well as the need for adaptation and flexibility when market conditions require, since this will underpin sustainable employment and conditions in enterprises.  The parties recognise and fully accept that each side carries a responsibility to ensure their conduct is reasonable and that they act in good faith in dealing with the timely development, processing and implementation of competitive measures that may arise, as a consequence of which the best possible levels of employment and conditions can be ensured.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will arrange for the provision to the redundancy panel of all secretarial and other services necessary for its efficient operation.  The fees and expenses of the redundancy panel are expected to be minimal.  This is provided for in section 5.  The costs to the social insurance fund of bringing in those over 66 under the Redundancy Payments Acts is estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.4 million per annum.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline some of the main provisions of the Bill to the House.  Section 1 is a standard provision which provides for the Short Title of the Act and the collective citation of Acts affected by it.  Section 2 provides definitions of terms used in the Act.  The definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; combines the content of the definition of &ldquo;strike&rdquo; in section 8 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and that of &ldquo;lock-out&rdquo; in section 6 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for the duration of the redundancy panel and related matters.  Under this section, the redundancy panel has effect only for the period of three years from the commencement of this Act.  The Minister may, by order made before the expiration of that period or any extension of it, extend that period for a further <Col N="1239"/>period of three years if both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation have requested the extension and the Minister is satisfied that the continued operation of the redundancy panel would be conducive to the continued orderly conduct of industrial relations.</P>
        <P>Section 4 sets out what constitutes exceptional collective redundancies for the purposes of this Act by reference to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  Section 5 provides for the establishment of the redundancy panel, procedures to be followed in appointing members to the redundancy panel and their reappointment.  The conditions of membership are also set out in this section.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for referral of cases to the redundancy panel by employee representatives or the employer concerned by notice given in writing.  The panel will inform the Minister of the fact and invite affected parties to make submissions to it in relation to the proposal.  The panel will give notice in writing to the Minister that either requests the Minister to seek an opinion from the Labour Court on whether the proposal is a proposal to create so-called exceptional collective redundancies, or else states that the panel is of the view that the conditions for the making of such a request have not been satisfied.  The panel must give a copy of that notice to the party from which the reference was received and other affected parties.</P>
        <P>The redundancy panel may not make a request to the Minister unless it appears to it that the proposed collective redundancies are so-called exceptional collective redundancies and the panel is satisfied that, in regard to the proposal, the party from which the reference was received has unsuccessfully sought to resolve the matter through local engagement.  The panel must also be satisfied that the party from which the reference was received has acted reasonably and not in a manner which has frustrated the possibility of agreement to restructuring or other changes necessary to secure the viability of the business of the employer, and has not had recourse to industrial action since the proposal was referred to the panel.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister may, within seven days of receiving a request from the redundancy panel to do so, request the Labour Court to issue an opinion as to whether collective redundancies proposed by an employer constitute exceptional collective redundancies.  The Minister may also make a request to the Labour Court on his own initiative if it appears to him that the proposed collective redundancies are exceptional collective redundancies.  The time limit in the latter case varies depending on whether the matter has been referred to the redundancy panel.</P><Col N="1240"/>
        <P>Section 8 provides for a hearing and the giving of an opinion by the Labour Court.  The court shall, within 16 days of receiving a request, hold a hearing into the matter, and either issue to the Minister its opinion whether the proposed collective redundancies are exceptional collective redundancies or report to the Minister that it is unable to issue an opinion.  The Labour Court may not issue an opinion unless it is satisfied that the party from which the reference was received was unable to resolve the matter through local engagement and has not frustrated the possibility of agreement to restructuring, and that no industrial action on the part of that party is current.  No appeal shall lie from an opinion given by the Labour Court under this section.  However, the Employment Appeals Tribunal can make a decision on any question referred to it under section 39 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  The Minister shall, within seven working days of receiving an opinion from the Labour Court, notify affected parties by such means as he considers appropriate.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that, where the Labour Court issues an opinion that collective redundancies proposed by an employer are exceptional collective redundancies and, having proceeded with the dismissals on the same basis as in the relevant proposal, the employer applies to the Minister for a rebate under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Minister shall have regard to the opinion of the Labour Court when considering the employer&rsquo;s application for the rebate.  If the Minister refuses to pay the rebate on the basis of the opinion of the Labour Court, the exemption from income tax provided by section 203 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 does not apply in respect of lump sum payments made by the employer to employees dismissed.  Section 7 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 has effect, with modifications, in respect of a dismissal that is one of a number of dismissals included in a collective redundancy that is determined by the Labour Court to be an exceptional collective redundancy.  The compensation payable is such amount as is just and equitable but may not exceed pay for 208 weeks for an employee who had not more than 20 years&rsquo; continuous service or, in the case of an employee who had more that 20 years continuous service, pay for more than 260 weeks.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for time limits before which dismissals may not take effect.  An employer who effects a dismissal before the expiration of the period specified in section 10(1) or in section 9(3) or 12(1) of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, as the case requires, will be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to a fine up to &euro;250,000.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for the amendment of section 2 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to update the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  Section 12 provides for the amendment of section <Col N="1241"/>9(3) of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to reflect the decision of the European Court of Justice in the case of Junk <i>v</i>. Kuhnel.  Section 13 provides for the updating of penalties in the Protection of Employment Act 1977.   Section 14 provides for the amendment of section 2 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to update the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  Section 15 provides for the amendment of section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to entitle employees who have attained the age of 66 years to statutory redundancy payments.  I am sure Senator White will be pleased about the latter.</P>
        <P>Section 16 provides for the amendment of section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  Subsection (2A) is being inserted into section 7 to ensure that the dismissal of employees is not to be taken to be a dismissal by reason of redundancy if the dismissals are collective and are effected on a compulsory basis and if the dismissed employees are to be replaced at the same location or elsewhere in the State by other employees who are directly employed by the employer or other persons whose services are to be provided to that employer in pursuance of other arrangements where those other persons perform, or are to perform, essentially the same functions as the dismissed employees, and where the terms and conditions of employment of those other persons are to be materially inferior to those of the dismissed employees.</P>
        <P>Section 17 provides for amendment of section 38 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to delete reference to powers no longer required to be exercised in the former paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) and to authorise deciding officers to make decisions under sections 29 and 32 in respect of certain payments from the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>Section 18 provides for amendment of section 39(16) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to eliminate the requirement that the reference of appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal by deciding officers be made in a particular prescribed manner.  Section 19 provides for the updating of penalties under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  Section 20 provides for the repeal of section 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, which imposes an upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments.  Section 21 provides for the updating of penalties under the Redundancy Payments Act 1971.  Section 22 provides for the amendment of section 1 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979 to update the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  Section 23 provides for the repeal of section 5 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, which amended section 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, now being repealed by section 20 of the Bill.  Section 24 provides for the amendment of section 1 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 to update the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1242"/>
        <P>Section 25 provides for a technical amendment of section 2 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  It remakes a proviso inserted into subsection (2) by the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 as new subsections (2A) and (2B).  The proviso relates to exceptions in certain circumstances to the general non-applicability of the Unfair Dismissal Acts 1977 to 2005 to fixed-term specified-purpose contracts.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that the exception stated in the proviso covers all the types of fixed-term specified-purpose contracts described in section 2(2) and not simply those referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</P>
        <P>Section 26 provides for the amendment of section 5 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 by providing that in cases where all the employees who are involved in a lock-out, strike or industrial action situation are dismissed, the reasonableness or otherwise of the actions of the parties is to be taken into account in determining whether the dismissals were unfair.</P>
        <P>Section 27 provides for the amendment of section 17 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  Subsection (1) is a technical provision to overcome the misdescription of an amendment made in 2004 and subsection (2) substitutes a new subsection (4) reflecting the abolition of the upper age limit for redundancy payments.</P>
        <P>I wish to acknowledge the work that was done by the social partners in addressing the problems that arise in exceptional collective redundancy situations.  The ability of the social partners to reach consensus shows the strength of the social partnership process.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the House.  I hope that we will be able to progress it through the House in a expeditious manner.  I would invite Senators to provide constructive criticism of the proposals it contains and to put forward any observations they may wish to offer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I thank him for introducing the Bill and for providing an outline of its contents.  Following the disgraceful series of events at Irish Ferries, the Government was forced to act.  I am disappointed, however, that the workers at Irish Ferries had to suffer before the Minister and his colleagues were alerted to this shady practice.  Lest there be any doubt, this shady practice involved Irish Ferries receiving &euro;4.3 million towards the cost of statutory redundancy payments to more than 400 Irish staff who were then replaced by eastern European workers on lower pay.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, a redundancy panel drawn from the social partners will be established which may request the Minister to refer dismissals to the Labour Court to determine whether they are genuine redundancies.  Based on that opinion, the Minister may refuse to pay a redundancy rebate. <Col N="1243"/> That is entirely correct and it is a shame that such a system is not already in place.  The Bill is a reflection of the new challenges that face a new Ireland.  Where once we were struggling to keep our workers from leaving, we are now struggling to stop jobs that we have in abundance from being devalued.</P>
        <P>My party watched the unfolding events at Irish Ferries with a growing sense of disgust and horror.  The actions of the company have been an example of the worst type of Dickensian exploitation ever seen in this country.  A number of points should have been borne in mind in respect of this matter.  Paramount among these is the fact that Irish Ferries is an Irish company based in Ireland and, as such, should be subject to the laws of this country including legislation that provides for a minimum wage, employee protection and health and safety.  It was as a result of a legal nonsense that the company was allowed to get away with industrial murder.  The Bill is the result of the actions of a greedy, grubby company, intent on maximising profits that is not just seeking a cheaper labour force but that is actually seeking a criminally cheap labour force.</P>
        <P>We have established in this country an industrial relations infrastructure that at the very least ensures that workers from new countries are not exploited and are paid a decent wage.  That legislation has protected Irish workers from being replaced in their jobs by new arrivals to our shores.  Irish Ferries, for no good reason whatsoever, other than that it runs ships as opposed to, for example, busses or trains, is not obliged to obey those laws.  It has run roughshod over 40 years of industrial diplomacy that helped create the Celtic tiger from which everyone, including Irish Ferries, benefited.</P>
        <P>The management of Irish Ferries should have been loyal to the social partnership process.  It should also have been loyal to the people who helped the company to become profitable.  I wonder if the company will be able to count on the loyalty of Irish people in the future.  I also wonder if it will be able to depend on the loyalty of exporters, importers and tourists who were so badly treated and so hugely inconvenienced during this sorry drama.</P>
        <P>The Second Stage of this debate allows me the opportunity to raise the issue of immigration and job displacement.  My party, backed by our colleagues in Labour, has sought to begin a dialogue on immigration to Ireland to ensure that the seeds of resentment and racism are not sown in this country.  What happened at Irish Ferries can only contribute to this.</P>
        <P>The recent dramatic growth in the rate of immigration into Ireland is resulting in what is arguably the greatest economic and social transformation of our country since independence.  My party believes that this transformation presents <Col N="1244"/>Ireland with both a significant challenge and considerable opportunity.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s history of emigration and migration, the country has a special responsibility to address the challenge of immigration.</P>
        <P>As my party leader stated earlier this year, as a people, we understand better than most the special challenges of immigration and integrating new communities.  Now is the time for a real national debate on these issues so that we can make the necessary changes to meet these new challenges.  We have a chance to get this response right and to avoid the mistakes that were made elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Immigration and multiculturalism can be good for Ireland but the current system is not being managed well.  We need a system that is good for the Irish and good for the immigrants.  As of now, we have a system that is not serving the interests of either.</P>
        <P>My party has three priorities to make immigration work for Ireland.  First, immigrants have rights and responsibilities.  They should have the right to be free of discrimination and have their contribution to the country recognised, but they have the responsibility to integrate into our community, comply with our laws and respect our cultural traditions.  We do not want to see a situation developing in which our immigrant population live separate lives.  We have a responsibility to facilitate and encourage this integration.</P>
        <P>Second, immigration must be managed in a way that keeps Ireland safe.  We must ensure that Irish laws are understood by and adhered to by immigrants.  We also need to send a strong message that people who want to come to this country to commit serious crime are not welcome and will be dealt with severely.</P>
        <P>Critically, and most importantly in the context of this Bill, immigration must be a force for improving, not threatening, living standards.<b> </b> We must protect Irish jobs and the rights of those who come to work here.  Companies that pay below the minimum wage should pay severe fines, and immigration levels from non-EU countries must be explicitly linked to economic conditions and the needs of the labour market.</P>
        <P>As we are discussing the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill, it would be remiss not to address the issue of job losses and costs.  Ireland has managed to sustain significant economic growth by attracting foreign investment, but the sequence of high profile job losses in various multinational companies is a worrying trend.  It has become common practice for many high profile companies to engage in global rationalisation as a code word for moving jobs from Ireland&rsquo;s high cost base.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, the Government has been warned at the highest level by the National Competitiveness Council of the dangerous direction that <Col N="1245"/>policy on business costs was taking.  Nothing has been done to address the problems of energy, broadband, telecommunications and other infrastructural difficulties to ensure that the Irish economy is well equipped to tackle fierce competition.</P>
        <P>Since this Government came to power it has imposed at least 50 stealth taxes and charges on businesses and consumers.  Compared with the UK, electricity is 50% more expensive, landfill costs are 350% higher, insurance is 20% more expensive and broadband is 10% more expensive.  Meanwhile, inflation continues to rise and now stands at 4.9%.</P>
        <P>Competition from eastern Europe, India and China is still in its infancy and is likely to intensify significantly in years to come.  The Government cannot afford to bury its head in the sand any longer.  We urgently need an all-party debate on how best to cope with the enormous competition faced from overseas in light of the burgeoning cost base in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Companies have been liquidated and my colleague, Senator Finucane, before he left earlier for another engagement, informed me of one such company of which the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, might well be aware.  The companies concerned pay the statutory two-weeks&rsquo; redundancy but on liquidation, as I understand it, refund 40% of that to the State.  Would the Minister of State consider using such refunds to the State to benefit workers, particularly in the case of the company Senator Finucane has in mind and perhaps one or two others the Minister of State might have had in mind when we discussed the matter earlier, especially where they are only paid the bare minimum?  These people have suffered the sad trauma of redundancy.  The Minister of State might have a view on that.  Perhaps there is something that could be done in the context of this Bill to help alleviate the situation further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and his senior officials to the House and commend him and the Department on introducing the Bill.  I welcome this legislation which establishes a redundancy panel to make decisions, when required, on what are termed exceptional collective redundancies.</P>
        <P>The Bill will provide for certain proposed collective redundancies to be referred to the panel and allows for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take appropriate action.  The Bill also amends previous legislation to update penalties and other aspects of the legislation.  I commend the procedure for the appointment of members of the redundancy panel and the representation of the Government, IBEC and the ICTU on this panel.</P>
        <P>This Bill is important because it closes the door on occurrences such as that which arose with Irish Ferries.  In that case, the company was able to rely upon a rebate from the State of &euro;4.3 million as a <Col N="1246"/>result of the dismissal of its staff and the employment of lower paid workers.  The company benefitted greatly from this particular decision and that is why this Bill is so timely and appropriate.  The Minister and his officials have taken quick action in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is clear that a situation such as the Irish Ferries dismissals is different from smaller-scale or individual dismissals.  Therefore, these dismissals should be resolved in a different way and this Bill provides for a resolution along these lines.  It lays down the procedures for this and makes clear that a case will be referred to the panel only after other avenues have been explored.</P>
        <P>I welcome the representation of different bodies on the redundancy panel.  I feel strongly that this will provide a balanced overall view of each case on its own terms.</P>
        <P>I also commend the Minister on other reforms on the upper age limit which he has included in this Bill which will remove ageism from the redundancy scheme.  The Minister of State might outline the amount of funds available in the redundancy fund and indicate the condition of the fund at present.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Coghlan, we all are concerned about the recent decisions to close successful industries and relocate them to Third World countries such as China, India and Singapore.  Today Poland is gloating over the fact that it has secured some jobs which were successfully in our country.  It is discouraging to think that new member states, which successfully applied for membership of the European Union which was voted on in the Nice treaty by ourselves, now exploit the fact they pay lower wages, charge lower taxes and attract companies which have been successful here and which have provided good employment for many in urban and rural areas.  The day will come when they will rise to the level of the rest of the European Union and will find other countries pulling jobs from them.</P>
        <P>The location of jobs is fluid.  In this regard the Minister and the Department have a role to monitor companies to ensure there is no danger  they will make with such decisions.  This Bill particularly will discourage companies from trying to take advantage of the redundancy laws to date.  It is galling that Irish Ferries benefited to an extent from its decision to employ workers on much lower wages and to exploit workers in that company which carries an Irish flag.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is anxious to get this Bill through the House and I certainly will not delay it.  It is timely legislation and I commend him and his staff on putting it together.  It includes many important provisions which are relevant to employees, employers, the Department and the State.  It also includes the flexibility to extend the redundancy panel beyond a three-year period.</P><Col N="1247"/>
        <P>I note local authority members have not been excluded.  I commend the Minister of State on that because, while it is normal practice to exclude Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, many local authority members are well qualified to serve on this panel and they should not be precluded from doing so by virtue of their representative functions.  Far too often, Bills have excluded the people who have given great service to public life.  It is welcome that those who wish to make further contributions to the public are not excluded.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has played an important role with regard to the minimum wage.  Workers should be pleased with the actions he has taken since his appointment and he has made another wise decision on this Bill.  I wish him continued success and hope it will not be long before he returns to a future ministerial role after the general election.</P>

	<P>Like others, I acknowledge the genesis of this Bill in the Irish Ferries dispute of a few months ago, the outcome of which was particularly galling on a number of levels.  It was galling in the first instance because what most of us thought of as an Irish company effectively dismissed several hundred Irish workers who had given many years of loyal service.  It was also galling because the same company sought to employ foreign workers on levels of pay and conditions that were clearly exploitative and unacceptable to any Irish person accustomed to the standards of employment and pay offered in this country.  It was all the more galling when the State, after a legal assessment, ended up subsidising the whole miserable affair by more than &euro;4 million.  That situation was calling out for reform.  I am aware this Bill has been the subject of discussions among the social partners and it goes a considerable distance towards providing us with a blueprint for dealing with these issues.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat bemused by the complicated nature of the process being put in place.  One first sends a request to the Secretary General of the Department, who notifies the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who refers to the redundancy panel, which returns to the Minister and suggests that he or she might like to refer the request to the Labour Court, which makes a recommendation which can then be appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Do we really need something as complicated as that?  For that matter, do we really need the panel at all?  It would have been sufficient if the Minister could simply form a judgment and consult the Labour Court in the first instance.  I do not understand why we need to go through what appears to be an excessively convoluted process to reach the same end point.  I thank the Minister of State for making his officials available to us <Col N="1248"/>this afternoon and thank the officials for the comprehensive briefing they gave us.  I gather the process is intended as a sort of clearing house to sift out cases which do not merit the attention of the Labour Court but it seems an excessively complicated way to achieve that end.</P>
        <P>The process has been put in place for a pilot or experimental three-year period.  I do not see why that has to be the case.  A shift in the law is clearly needed and the Part 2 provisions are likely to be required in the future.  It is excessively cumbersome to deprive the Minister of the right to continue the Part on his or her own initiative.  We are in effect giving a veto to the social partners, which no doubt arose from the partnership talks.  I am not sure, however, that it makes objective sense.  If the Minister thinks it beneficial to have this process in place, he or she should have the discretion to continue the procedure irrespective of whether the social partners like it.  It is not difficult, however, to see why some social partners might have problems with the provision in three years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>The central point of the Bill is important in terms of clarifying that an exceptional collective redundancy is a dismissal rather than a redundancy.  Among the many insertions and amendments of past Acts, I am not completely clear whether an exceptional collective redundancy is also defined as an unfair dismissal.  The Bill will make sense only if it establishes that the dismissal is <i>ipso facto</i> unfair and brings into play the entitlements to compensation set out in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that matter in his response.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the age limit on redundancies.  I have had an experience of this a couple of years ago with a constituent who was unfortunate enough to remain in her job a few months beyond her 66th birthday.  The company for which she worked closed and she was denied statutory redundancy, notwithstanding her 30 years of service or the fact that others who had worked there for much shorter periods were entitled to statutory redundancy.  Understandably, the matter caused enormous hurt and considerable hardship to the woman.  The age limit is clearly a disincentive for anybody in similar circumstances to continue working beyond his or her 66th birthday.  I am surprised that a constitutional challenge has not yet been made to that provision, which is now redundant, if I can be excused the phrase.  I am glad the opportunity was taken to make the amendment.</P>
        <P>It is our experience of social partnership legislation such as this Bill that the role of these Houses is to apply our collective rubber stamp.  That process has served us well.  I hope the Minister of State finds the time to pass this Bill through the other House before its dissolution.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and support the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007, the long title of which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Bill entitled an Act to make provision, consequent on the conclusion of the ten-year framework social partnership agreement 2006-2015 known as &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;, for the establishment of a redundancy panel and the reference to it of certain proposed collective redundancies and for related action by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the obtaining from the Labour Court of opinions on the nature of proposed collective redundancies; to remove the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments; to make consequential amendments of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 and the Employment Equality Act 1998; and to make further amendments of those Acts to update penalties and for purposes of statute-law revision.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Social partnership has served this country well.  It is not for nothing that we are internationally regarded as a leading light or that <i>The Economist</i>, a highly respected publication with a weekly circulation of more than 2 million, has rated Ireland as the best place to live for the past two years.  Our neighbours in Europe look to Ireland as an example of what should and could be done.  This Bill is part of this because the partnership was responsible for drafting it and every partner played a role in it.  Certain groups may not have been happy with aspects of the legislation, such as employers who may have believed there would be too many protections, but the process has stood the test of time and is now in its 20th year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Since 1987 social partnership has helped to maintain a strategic focus on key national priorities and create and sustain the conditions for remarkable employment, fiscal stability and a dramatic improvement in living standards which have benefited the people.  The challenges facing us are no less complex or important than in 1987.  Towards 2016 develops a new strategic framework to address key social challenges and focuses on the needs of all in our society.  This approach will take time.  The agreement sets out how we propose to measure and review progress over a ten-year framework period.  It sets out the terms of the pay increases for the private sector and the public service over a 27-month period.  While the total increase is significant, the benefits will be reaped by all sections of the community, which should be welcomed.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Social partnership has served us well in the past 20 years.  It is a problem solving process which <Col N="1250"/>has evolved on the basis of the Government providing an arena within which the social partners, as stakeholders, engage in a flexible process of addressing immediate problems, while attending to long-term development.  In this, the Government is firmly in the tradition of the European social model which values engagement with the social partners as an important contribution to better policy making and more legitimate policy outcomes.  The results are there for all to see.</P>
        <P>The dramatic transformation of Irish economic and employment fortunes in the past decade has reflected, in the judgment of the NESC reports, three main factors: a national policy and institutional framework which was consistent, highly focused on competitiveness and employment creation, innovation and problem solving; an export sector that was greatly expanded and increasingly concentrated in high value, high growth market segments; and the European Union, because it increased market access, created a level playing field through re-regulation, provided a relatively stable monetary environment and supported Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructural and social development.  The most dramatic impact has been in the rapid growth in employment, drawing not only on those who were unemployed, especially long-term unemployed, but also women and others who had previously little expectation of finding meaningful, well paid work in the economy.  Among them were many Irish emigrants who had returned and others who have enriched society by coming to make their career and home in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have done this in a way that has produced significant rewards for ordinary people.  Easing tax burdens which had increased inordinately on the average worker has produced an outcome where, as the OECD has recently shown, the average worker with two children pays no net tax, while child benefit and other payments add almost 1% to earnings.  Only in Iceland is a better deal on offer and only in Mexico and Korea do workers on two thirds of average earnings pay less tax after benefits.  The social balance of our approach is reflected in the fact that single parents do better than anywhere else.  Therefore, not only have we increased dramatically the numbers at work, their living standards have also increased at a striking rate.</P>
        <P>The strategy we have pursued with the social partners has resulted in a very substantial increase in the revenue base of the State, facilitating a dramatic increase in public spending on a wide range of services and infrastructure in recent years.  It is a remarkable feature of the economy that we  have low taxes in tandem with significant social services.  Long may that continue.  Social partnership has played an important part in this.</P>
        <P>We must address the problems of rapid growth in the economy which are all too familiar in the <Col N="1251"/>form of infrastructural and other bottlenecks.  The Government has gone about this.  If we react in the wrong way, the consequences will be immediate and severe. The pre-partnership era was almost unenlightened compared to our current experience but it was all we knew at the time.  However, now that we have reached this stage, I hope the partnership process will continue and workers will continue to be protected through legislation.  I am proud to be the representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the Labour Panel for Fianna F&aacute;il in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and commend the Bill before us.  Both the Minister of State and my colleagues have commented on the many good aspects of the legislation but I would like to focus on section 15 which provides for the amendment of section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to entitle employees who have attained the age of 66 years to statutory redundancy payments.  The section changes the lamentable <i>status quo</i>, whereby employees aged 66 and above are refused statutory redundancy payments.  It is yet another example of age discrimination codified in law.  It refused to appreciate the valuable work and contribution that older people made in the economy.  Until now, however, these valued workers were not entitled to any statutory redundancy payments on being made redundant.  The reasoning behind this could only have been faulty and ageist.  Perhaps it was thought that these older employees would be happy enough to draw the pension and withdraw from working life, but why was this attitude held?  Surely, it was obvious that the people concerned were working beyond the usual retirement age of 65 years because they wanted or needed to do so.  It was wrong, therefore, for the legislation to deny them their deserved statutory redundancy payment and assume that they did not merit it.  Can one imagine the heartbreak for an employee treated in such as way to see their cherished job being taken away through no fault of their own, and, furthermore, to find that, unlike their younger colleagues &mdash; perhaps even colleagues they helped train in &mdash; the Government does not see fit to recognise that they too have suffered a loss, just because they can draw a pension?</P>
        <P>I am, therefore, delighted that the Bill proposes to increase the upper age limit for employees to receive statutory redundancy payments.  This move is not before time.  At least now workers who have toiled loyally for their employers for decades can receive recognition of that dedication and contribution should their positions cease to exist.  The former position was ludicrous in that a 65 year old working for 40 years for a company would receive compensation, but a 66 year old who may have worked for the company <Col N="1252"/>for a longer period would not.  The legislation is a step in the right direction.  I look forward to further legislative change in the future to help erase the remaining vestiges of entrenched ageism in our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am driving for change and the abolition of the mandatory retirement age in both the public and private sectors.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials who gave us a tremendous briefing on this complex Bill earlier.  They told us how they had toiled over it at weekends with officials and the representatives of the social partners.  It is a great compliment to both sides.  The legislation is heavy going and complicated.  It is not scintillating and sexy and required serious detailed attention to make sure its provision were correct.  I compliment the Minister of State and everybody else involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.  I thank Senators for their supportive comments on the legislation and reiterate the points raised about the Irish Ferries dispute and other similar scenarios.  The Bill will achieve what we have set out and give an enhanced measure of protection to workers who are compulsorily made redundant in circumstances where they are replaced by workers on lower pay or worse terms and conditions of employment.  When enacted, the legislation will provide for the establishment of a redundancy panel for the reference to it of certain proposed collective redundancies and related action by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in line with what was agreed during the talks on Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan pointed out that redundancy payments were made to Irish Ferries staff on the basis of existing legislation.  He is concerned about the devaluation of jobs, emigration and job displacement.  He also referred to integration issues which will be hugely important in the long term.  He made specific reference to the workers at the Castlemahon plant in County Limerick at the request of his colleague, Senator Finucane.  The Minister is one of those who hope to receive a payment as part of a preferential claim following the winding up of the company.  He has no discretion regarding the 40% due to the social insurance fund and, therefore, has no legal power to divert any of the money to the employees concerned if funds are recovered.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden asked how much was in the social insurance fund.  I have some figures which indicate that approximately &euro;165 million was paid out of the fund last year.  It is a very large fund of several billion euro.  I will get the Senator the exact amount as I am not quite sure how much it is at this stage.</P>

	<P>It is in a particularly healthy state, which is the way we like it to be.  The Senator&rsquo;s point about local authority members was well made and I am pleased that is the case on<?oasys _jy ?>this occasion.  It is not always the case, as he knows.</P>
        <P>Senator McDowell also referred to the Irish Ferries case and the need for reform.  He was somewhat unhappy with the three year time limit.  It is fair to say that, in many respects, people will have to wait to see how this operates in terms of whether it is able to address the difficulties it is designed to address.  The Minister has the power to extend it for a period of time.  The Senator made the point that the social partners have a very strong say in regard to it.  They have put a considerable amount of work into the preparation of this Bill as have the officials in the Department.  A very difficult job has been done in a very short period of time.  In the circumstances, this is probably the appropriate way to deal with it.</P>
        <P>Senator McDowell also referred to the situation of a 66 year old.  I am very pleased we have been able to take the opportunity on this occasion to rectify that.  The Senator referred to the clarification of exceptional collective redundancy being defined as &ldquo;a dismissal&rdquo;.  He raised the question of whether that was automatically an unfair dismissal.  He referred to section 9(3) of the Bill as it affects section 7 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 in that if a dismissal which is the subject of a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Acts has already been the subject of a determination of the Labour Court that it is an exceptional collective redundancy, then in a separate process, if a rights commissioner of the Employment Appeals Tribunal finds that it is also an unfair dismissal for the purpose of the Unfair Dismissal Act and if the remedy is compensation rather than re-engagement or re-employment, then an employee with fewer than 20 years&rsquo; service will be eligible for up to four years&rsquo; salary in compensation.  An employee with more than 20 years&rsquo; service will be eligible for up to five years&rsquo; compensation.  Also in these situations, the employee will not be required to show mitigation of loss.  The only reductions which can be made to the compensation award are where the amounts have been paid in redundancy or severance by the employer.  These agreements were also agreed in Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>It is a very substantial improvement in the situation as it pertains.  It is up to a rights commissioner of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to decide if the dismissal is unfair.  There are potentially two processes in addressing the question Senator McDowell asked.</P><Col N="1254"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin spoke eloquently about the value of social partnership and I thank him for the points he made in that regard.  I am sure Senator White is very pleased about section 15.  She has campaigned very strongly in this regard.  I would not have dared come into the House with this Bill without that provision.  I very much agree with her that we need people to stay working much longer in the current economic climate and that in justice, we should make provision for people to remain at work if they are able and willing to do so.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for remaining in the House to take this matter.  I wish to put forward the case of St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school in Rochfordbridge, County Westmeath.  This school is unique.  Rochfordbridge is a small village and the school has been built up over the years to the point where it now has 700 post-primary pupils, which is an amazing feat.  It was built up by the work of the Sisters of Mercy who were there originally, and the parents who wanted it to succeed.  The school accommodation report, which is the bible of planning in education, has stated that the school must accommodate 850 pupils in three years&rsquo; time.  Planning permission has been granted for a further 500 houses in the village and the sewerage scheme is being upgraded.  Consequently, building will commence, which will increase further the demand for school places.</P>
        <P>Although the school is supposed to take 850 pupils in three years&rsquo; time, it cannot cope with the 700 pupils it already has.  This modern secondary school is using two prefabs that are more than 20 years old.  It is also using six classrooms in a converted boarding school, which was only intended as a temporary measure.  The rooms are <Col N="1256"/>poorly ventilated and access to two of them can only be gained by walking through a third.  Moreover, one of the rooms has very poor natural light.</P>
        <P>A number of students require resource teaching and while the school wishes to acknowledge the provision of teaching hours for such students, its space is highly restricted.  The same is true for the leaving certificate vocational programme, the leaving certificate applied, the transition year programme and of course the normal junior certificate and leaving certificate examination programmes.  Each programme puts additional pressure on accommodation and on specialist rooms such as the computer room in particular.</P>
        <P>As with all towns and villages in Ireland, the school&rsquo;s intake of non-national students, who require additional language classes, is increasing.  The school wishes to emphasise that it is receiving the requisite teaching resources.  However, it is not receiving the accommodation to go with them.  For example, the art room is too small and storage space is necessary for project work.  However, the school cannot extend the room as it cannot afford the space.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister for Education and Science.  However, he is well able to so do, as was demonstrated by the passage of his legislation.  This is a modern, interesting and good school that has served Rochfordbridge and the midlands in general.  The school accommodation report published approximately two years ago stated that it should take 860 pupils by 2010.  It now has 700 pupils and can barely accommodate them.  How the school will manage to fit 850 students is a midlands mystery.  I hope the answer to the mystery will be contained in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>

Senator O&rsquo;Rourke has outlined a wonderful story of development regarding this school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the outset I wish to state that modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>The Government has increased dramatically investment in the school building programme from slightly more than &euro;90 million when it came into office, to &euro;550 million this year.  During the lifetime of the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment, which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>This year, more than &euro;300 million will be invested in large-scale building projects, concentrated mainly in the provision of school accommodation in rapidly developing areas.  This level of funding will facilitate construction work on more than 150 large-scale projects, which will deliver more than 15,000 additional permanent places in new schools and the extension and modernisation of facilities in existing schools for more than 45,000 pupils.</P>
        <P>It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.  The balance will be used to fund the other elements of the school building programme such as the summer works scheme, the small schools scheme, the permanent accommodation scheme and so on.</P>
        <P>In total, more than 1,500 school building projects will be delivered in 2007.  The Department of Education and Science is anxious to ensure they are proactive in planning for the needs of rapidly developing areas.  Senator O&rsquo;Rourke will be aware of the recently published area development plan for the M4-N4 corridor.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The school&rsquo;s management authority has made an application to the school planning section of the Department for extensive refurbishment works and for an extension to replace three prefabs, to provide canteen facilities, additional toilets for pupils and staff, a home economics kitchen, a science laboratory and ICT facilities.</P>
        <P>The application has been assessed in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s criteria for prioritising large-scale projects and has been assigned a band rating of 2.3.  An examination of the school&rsquo;s long-term projected enrolments is currently being carried out by officials in the school planning section of the Department.</P>
        <P>Once the long-term projected enrolment is established and agreed with the school, the Department will draw up a schedule of overall accommodation outlining the extent of new build and refurbishment required at the school.  The application will then be considered for progress in the context of the multiannual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senator O&rsquo;Rourke for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the application for new accommodation for St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, Rochfordbridge, County Westmeath.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House this evening to discuss the need to prioritise Granard, County Longford, as a location for a new factory to advance its development and meet the needs of the increasing population.</P>
        <P>It is crucial to site a new factory in the town to advance its development, to ensure a more balanced distribution of job opportunities and to encourage the establishment of foreign investment in both the midlands as a whole and in this town, which is in the heart of northern County Longford.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that progress in this regard is being achieved nationally and regionally, the challenge for a town such as Granard remains tough in an increasingly competitive market.  Compliments must be paid to the existing family-run businesses in Granard, which have been the backbone of the community for many years.  I will not mention specific names.</P>
        <P>Investment in Ireland tends to favour the larger urban centres that are close to universities and institutes of technology.  Combining the strengths of the midland gateway will be essential to boosting the region&rsquo;s overall economic development and Granard, as well as other towns and villages, has a complementary role within that structure in achieving the aim of balanced regional development.  However, in the rush to achieve definitive regional autonomy, demands for local industry for economic sustainability in towns such as Granard, in which there is a growing population, must not be overlooked.  It is important that the Government does not overlook Granard.  It is the second largest town in County Longford and lies on the N55 route from the midlands region to the northern counties and as such is ideally placed as a location for a new enterprise, particularly in terms of North-South co-operation, given its geographical positioning.</P>
        <P>Recent changes in the political and economic climate, both in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, have opened up a range of new opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.  The potential gains from working together across the Border to achieve common goals are now being highlighted and could bring a necessary boost to Granard.  Granard Town Council has made repeated representations to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland requesting that they prioritise the town.  I compliment my colleagues, Councillors Maura Kilbride-Harkin and John Maguire, for their wholehearted support for advancing infrastructural development in and around Granard during recent years to make it even more <Col N="1260"/>attractive.  However, the town suffers from the Government&rsquo;s inability to tackle Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  Stealth taxes and charges imposed on companies price them out of the market.  The Government must get its act together as a matter of urgency to remedy this threat to the economic strength of towns such as Granard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Granard is a CL&Aacute;R programme designated region and I do not have to outline to the Minister of State the implications of this for all those living in the town in terms of disadvantaged status and their overall needs.  I ask the Minister of State to give priority to Granard and other towns in counties Longford and Westmeath.  They are situated in the BMW region with all the problems associated with this group of counties and urgently  need to be hoisted up the economic ladder.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State ensured it was top of the list with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>On numerous occasions I called on the Government to open the purse strings on BMW funding as the massive underspend of this allocation is a scandal.  I have raised this issue time and again but the scandal of the retention of this valuable funding continues.  I am sure there is also an underspend in the Minister of State&rsquo;s part of the country.  How any Government can justify withholding moneys legitimately due to a region badly in need of support is certainly a matter for the electorate to consider.  I find it shameful that such practices are allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>Since I submitted this motion three weeks ago I have received a huge number of positive responses.  I have played my part in encouraging industry to the town and I am confident something will come shortly but we need more than one industry.  We need a series of industries for towns in counties Longford and Westmeath.  Little was announced or delivered during the term of office of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  State support for enterprise development is channelled through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the industrial development agencies, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  However, the Minister of the day is specifically precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives to the agencies regarding individual undertakings or preference to one area over another.  It is open to the Minister to give general policy directives to the agencies.  In this regard a key requirement of Government is that the enterprise development agencies work towards achieving a balanced regional spread of investment and jobs.  The policy framework put in place to achieve this objective is the national spatial strategy which must be actively embraced and followed by all <Col N="1261"/>economic and social parties.  Granard is well positioned in the midlands region, being within commuting distance of Longford town.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the development agencies is to win and grow the best in investment for Ireland.  To achieve this locations with a critical mass of suitably qualified talent, supporting infrastructure and sophisticated business services are needed.  For most of the mobile international investment for which we compete the competition is from city regions with a population base of more than 1 million.  In Ireland only Dublin has a population of this size.  For this reason, every location in Ireland must think and act regionally rather than locally if it wishes to succeed, in line with the national spatial strategy and the new national development plan.</P>
        <P>Granard is part of the growing midlands region strategically located in the centre of the country.  A key objective of the national development plan is to build on current trends and maintain strong and sustainable growth in each of the gateways.  A total of 14,158 people were employed in enterprise agency-assisted companies in the region at the end of 2006.  The future of Granard and the other smaller towns in the region is a fundamental part of the development of the midlands region as a whole and national investment is focused at this level.  It is also vital that this national investment is partnered with local vision and leadership and that private investment also plays a role.</P>
        <P>Each of the development agencies plays its part in the development of the midlands region.  IDA Ireland is committed to ensuring a more balanced distribution of job opportunities and encouraging the establishment of foreign investment in the region.  The agency markets the gateway locations of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar through its network of overseas offices.  It also engages with local government, industry bodies and representatives, educational bodies and infrastructure, utility and service providers in the region in an effort to create and develop the conditions for winning and growing business.  Progress has been achieved but challenges remain.  Combining the strengths of the midlands gateway towns is essential to boost the region&rsquo;s overall economic strength.  The other towns, villages and rural areas all have complementary roles to play.</P>
        <P>Recent successes of the IDA in the area include providing ten acres of industrial zoned lands in January 2005 to assist in the OPW&rsquo;s decentralisation of the prison support services at the IDA industrial estate at Templemichael in Longford town.  This project will employ approximately 200 people on completion.  The lands were transferred to Longford County Council to facilitate this decentralisation initiative.</P>
        <P>A total of eight acres of industrial zoned lands was released to Longford County Council in <Col N="1262"/>March 2005 at Templemichael to assist demand from local enterprise and employment start-up businesses.  Abbott Ireland was established in Longford town, with an investment of approximately &euro;70 million and 600 jobs, 80% of which are for third level graduates, over a four to five year period.  This project is now operational and recruitment is ongoing.  Cameron Ireland in Longford town is now the corporation&rsquo;s global centre of excellence for certain technological advanced products, with growing employment figures.</P>
        <P>These investments and jobs are in County Longford and within a reasonable commute time of Granard.  The IDA will continue to work in the interests of promoting the midlands for further additional foreign investment and job creation.  In this regard, a commitment in the NDP requires that the agency develop a large-scale utility intensive site as part of its strategic sites initiative.  The agency will address this issue and keep its entire property programme within the region under constant review.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also has a regional focus and works with existing companies such as Pat the Baker, one of Longford&rsquo;s leading indigenous employers with 245 employees.  Other Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Granard include Enplast and Kiernan Milling.  With the county enterprise boards, they encourage the creation of new start-up companies and provide the necessary enterprise infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In January 2006 my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, announced the extension of the Enterprise Ireland community enterprise centre scheme which will provide &euro;7 million of capital funding in the period from 2006 to 2008.  In June 2006 it was announced that Granard Area Development Company was successful in its application for funding and received approval for &euro;300,000 towards the development of a new community enterprise centre which will be located in Granard town and built on land donated by Longford County Council.  It is expected the centre will be fully occupied upon completion.</P>
        <P>Longford County Enterprise Board was established in 1993 to provide a source of support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer.  The function of the board is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity throughout County Longford, inclusive of Granard.  The board provides a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, enterprises may qualify for support from the county enterprise board primarily in the form of capital and feasibility grants.</P>
        <P>During 2006 Longford County Enterprise Board paid &euro;257,345 in grant aid to 41 projects and assisted in the creation of 37 net jobs in <Col N="1263"/>grant-aided companies in the county.  The board also trained more than 470 people in small business skills and provided professional mentoring for 91 clients.  Overall, I am confident that the policies and strategies in place for the development of the midlands region are the most appropriate and will result in sustainable investment and jobs for the growing population of the region, including the people of Granard.</P>

	<P>I had hoped for a more positive response.  This motion came from Granard Town <Col N="1264"/>Council which requested that Oireachtas Members for the area highlight the issue.  I have done so and would have welcomed a more positive response and greater involvement by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  I acknowledge the major contribution made by the Longford County Enterprise Board.  It does a fine job but needs more support from national agencies and the Government.  I hope it will not be overlooked.  I look forward to more positive news in the coming months.</P>
