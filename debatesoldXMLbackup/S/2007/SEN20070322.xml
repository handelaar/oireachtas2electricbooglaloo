	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude no later than 12.30 p.m.; No. 2, Pharmacy Bill 2007 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 12.30 p.m. until 3 p.m., to resume at 5 p.m. and conclude no later than 7 p.m.; No. 3, Carbon Fund Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 3 p.m. and conclude no later than 5 p.m., with spokespersons contributing for 12 minutes and other Senators for eight, and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a query about No. 7 on the Order Paper, the Defamation Bill 2006.  I have been watching progress of the Bill in recent days and weeks from my office and wish to know if there is an organised filibuster to talk the Bill out to ensure it will never reach the Statute Book.  I make this comment because there was a very genuine call in the House yesterday from a member of the Leader&rsquo;s party, Senator Cox, for a debate on a very important issue on which we would all have something to say.  Time could be set aside to discuss current issues such as this rather than talking out a Bill if the intention of the Government is that it will never see the light of day.  Will the Leader of the House indicate if it is the intention of the Government to progress the legislation by the end of the session?  Even if it progresses in this House by then, it will never see the light of day in the other House.</P>

	<P>A bloody good thing too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That may be so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Senator in favour of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We should stop the sham and say it as it is.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is to be removed, we will have that debate but we should not waste time with a literary or debating club, or a very bad literary and historical society debate, when we could be discussing other issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that matter not come within the aegis of the Chair?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair would handle the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be typical of The Hist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I would genuinely make the point to the Leader of the House that if it is not the intention of the Government to progress the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is jealousy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we should remove it from the Order Paper altogether.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We could allocate time for genuine debates on issues such as those raised yesterday by Senator Cox and others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be very easy to disagree with Senator Brian Hayes but yesterday afternoon, while doing some work, I tuned into the debate on a number of occasions to hear discussions on what I believed were related to the Defamation Bill but instead concerned mushrooms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That was James Joyce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I heard discussions on the commentariat and pinko extremist commentators and various other issues which I felt had very little to do with the business at hand.  There is, therefore, some element of truth in the point made.  Apart from the great entertainment provided by Senator Norris and the T&aacute;naiste, who seemed to be enjoying themselves with very little else to do, the discussion seemed to have very little to do with the Bill.</P>
        <P>Speaking of issues which should have our attention, I would have thought the idea of having on a regular basis an Adjournment debate, in which general matters would be discussed in Parliament, would be considered.  I have raised this issue before.  Such a debate allows Members to make a statement or express a point of view on matters.  This might be considered towards the end of the session.</P>
        <P>Related to this, we might look at the question of regional debates.  I recently considered how the regions develop.  On a number of occasions we have discussed the position on the western edge <Col N="1267"/>of Ireland but we should look at such matters in more detail.  Let us take County Kerry as an example.  The Leader of House is smiling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Take, for example, County Kerry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are issues to be considered.  We discuss important matters such as the hospital in Monaghan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed the position in Dingle or Daingean.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two community hospitals, one in Dingle and one in Kenmare, which are on the books and have been promised, talked about, proposed, dealt with, built and built again.  Where do we stand on the issue?  I would like to be able to talk to somebody about what exactly is happening there.  They are also taking over half of another hospital in Killarney, St. Finan&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Portmagee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is part of it.  What happened to the ferry services between Dingle, Portmagee and Valentia or the Dingle walkway?  Dingle is just one example, but we could discuss Offaly or elsewhere in the same way.  We should examine and have a discussion on regions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We should go there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are running out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, I recommended that all committees should go outside the Houses, but the only committee that travels on a regular basis is the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which visits a number of areas around the country.  It is chaired by Deputy Cassidy, who is from the Leader&rsquo;s constituency and shares her thinking in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is fun.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Filibustering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not organised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues must be examined.  Would it be possible to have an Adjournment debate and a discussion on the regions to examine each county or area, such as the south west, and determine what needs to be done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could visit the midlands.  We would love to have him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The midlands is getting a railway between Mullingar and Athlone, but we are concerned about the railway between Killarney and <Col N="1268"/>Tralee which has not been upgraded to the same extent.  We would like to discuss these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The DART to Dingle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about the Defamation Bill enduring a <i>de facto</i> filibuster with Government complicity, no one could accuse the Government of delaying on the Pharmacy Bill.  It is the fault of no one in this House or the building &mdash; I am not criticising any staff &mdash; that the final list of amendments in yellow form arrived in the House between 9 a.m. and 9.45 a.m.  It was the first time Senators had a full ordered list of the amendments.  It is not the fault of the staff of the House who have been working virtually 24 hours per day owing to the pressure, but this is not the way to deal with the business of the House.  It is grossly offensive to order this Bill for the other House for tomorrow morning before it has passed through this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an institutional abuse.  Will the Leader raise the matter with the Ceann Comhairle?  The other House should be informed that it has no right to order business before this House has disposed of it.  We do not do so as a matter of practice.</P>
        <P>This morning&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> has as harrowing a front page as I have ever seen.  It is a half-page reproduction of the last note of a young man who committed suicide, published by his mother.  She raises a number of reasonable issues, including matters of underfunding.</P>
        <P>In a country that has never offered so many opportunities, choices, possibilities and freedom to young people, there is a need for a debate on the underlying reasons for the increasing number of young people committing suicide.  I do not have a solution, but it is concerning that bullying is becoming a national sport.  A television programme takes its entertainment value from the fact that certain prominent figures go through a process of ritually humiliating young people who do not meet their standards as entertainers.  While the young people choose to be there, a large number of us watch the programme for the gratification that comes from ritualised bullying.  We should wonder about our society&rsquo;s value system, such as the sexualisation of young people and the unmitigated bombardment of children of ten years of age with imagery that forces them to develop more rapidly than many of them are able for.  The degree to which alcohol penetrates their culture is also a concern.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of an unresolved conflict.  The most competitive area in terms of radio listenership is the 15 to 25 age group, which is regarded as a single category.  Contrast how a 15 year old and a 25 year old see the world.  We are forcing the images and experiences of the latter on the former, including alcohol advertising.  We <Col N="1269"/>are creating an adult world in which 15 year olds must cope.  I do not know whether this causes anything, but it is time to have a serious debate on the way in which we have forced our young people to grow into emotional adulthood when they are physically children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I asked the Leader to try to facilitate a debate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I understand that through no fault of the Leader, she was unable to do so.  I also understand the T&aacute;naiste will address the issue in the D&aacute;il today under the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 and is unavailable to us.  For that reason, I do not intend to table an amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business, but it is important for the House to make a statement.  The last time there was an emergency issue &mdash; the statutory rape situation &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste was happy to appear before this House and use its offices when it suited him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>For the manner in which we have dealt with issues under the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s portfolio, he owes it to the House to discuss this serious matter.  I am not calling, as Senator Norris stated yesterday, for a debate on mandatory sentencing or any particular solution.  I am just calling for a debate.</P>
        <P>Some women believe the message sent by the judge two weeks ago means they cannot report rapes to the police or, if they do, their cases will be brought to court where, due to circumstances we do not understand, there is a likelihood that the defendants will be released free as birds to walk the same streets as them or to communicate with them.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader for her support on this issue.  If the T&aacute;naiste does not see fit to accept our invitation to debate this issue next week in whatever format is acceptable &mdash; I understand he cannot discuss individual cases &mdash; there must be a forum in which to debate it.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to discuss it next week before our Easter recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes was correct in his comments on the Defamation Bill.  Whatever the reasons, it is going nowhere and is not intended to reach the other House this side of the recess.  I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s explanation.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, especially in respect of his comments on Dingle and Kenmare Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Dingle-An Daingean.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s statements on the neglect of the south west.  It <Col N="1270"/>would be good to hold a regional debate, especially on the south west, because the neglect of major infrastructural projects there is unbelievable.  Take the roads, for example.  The bypass of Farranfore on the Killarney-Tralee route is not proceeding, the Castleisland bypass has been pushed back, and the Killarney-Cork and Killarney-Mallow-Mitchelstown projects are not happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to keep the tourists in Killarney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be done after the general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need better lines of communication with the National Roads Authority on these matters.  On 5 December, I had an Adjournment debate on the 14-bed extension of Kenmare Hospital promised ten or 12 years ago, which has since fallen off the list and has not been prioritised since.  According to a response from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on 6 February, my query had been passed to the Health Service Executive.  On 21 February, it responded to the effect that the project was still going nowhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>It could be raised on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, a Minister announced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Which Minister was it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not the Minister for Health and Children.  It was one of the Ministers of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There are so many of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hayes&rsquo;s party started that racket.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nice to see that it has been well-continued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like somebody to clarify &mdash; perhaps the Leader can do so &mdash; the current status of the proposed 14-bed extension to Kenmare Community Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it proceeding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This argument has been going on for a long time.  Will the extension be included in this year&rsquo;s list of capital projects?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1271"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>He is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I just want my question to be answered.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>He wants an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the answer to the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise the rather extraordinary and Kafkaesque situation whereby people who were abused in schools are being denied compensation on the basis that the State is not responsible for primary schools.  It is quite extraordinary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I raised in the House previously the case of Ms Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe, who appears to feel threatened that her house might be taken from her because she cannot meet the costs arising from a legal action she took.  There appears to be an instinct on the part of the authorities to punish and frighten people to discourage them from taking legal actions.  It is quite wrong.  By trying to deny its responsibilities, the State is acting in a cowardly manner.  If it does not own the schools or have responsibility for them, why is it simultaneously paying for them?  It is about time the State took over the schools, particularly in the context of the evidence of the Ferns Report, which I have mentioned many times.  When the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, was introducing the equality legislation, Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I fought tooth and nail in this House to prevent the legislation from providing for certain exemptions.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole yesterday organised a meeting with representatives of the INTO to discuss this matter, which is of real concern for teachers.</P>
        <P>This problem can be linked to what Senator Ryan said about bullying.  We know a disproportionate amount of bullying contains a homophobic element.  Very few teachers address this problem because they are frightened to do so.  They know  legally they could be fired on the basis of their lifestyles.  A recent report, which found that this country&rsquo;s sex education is completely inadequate, stated that no such education is offered in approximately 40% of schools.  The response of students to these matters is much more intelligent than the hysterical response of some of the authorities and groups which try to apply pressure in this regard.  Can the House have a discussion on this aspect of the educational system?  If we do not own the schools, why are we paying for them?  Why does the State not take over responsibility for the schools?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not inimical to religion, in fact, I am a regular churchgoer.  However, I do not think it is <Col N="1272"/>right that schools should be denominational in this way.  I am happy for religious instruction to be offered in schools.  I go to church not as a result of anything I was ever taught in school, but because of the way I was brought up.  In our family, it was a positive pleasure to go to church.  If I did something naughty, my mother would tell me that if I did it again I would not be allowed to go to church that afternoon.  That is the way to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must have been naughty all the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he keep on being naughty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we extend that system to the Seanad?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The funding of community hospitals is organised in a haphazard manner.   Many community hospitals depend on voluntary collections, such as church gate collections, to keep their doors open.  Some of them are given small national lottery grants so they can install community facilities.  I am not familiar with the community hospitals in An Daingean and Kenmare.  Kilrush Community Hospital, with which I am familiar, has 66 patients.  It is run by a voluntary committee and survives on the voluntary subscriptions it receives from patients and other members of the community.  It is necessary to amend the budgetary system in order that community hospitals are funded in a regular and systematic manner.  They should not have to depend on the haphazard payment of funds from the national lottery or the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I would welcome an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was suggested some months ago that subvention payments would be increased from 1 January 2007, but very little, if anything, has been done in that regard at administrative level.  Many people in institutions and hospitals have to depend on their families and others to meet the cost of their accommodation because the level of subvention they are paid is quite low.  While a promise has been made to increase such payments, the technicalities of that process are slow, tedious and boring.  Some people are very distraught about what is happening.  Can the Minister for Health and Children be invited to the House to indicate when the Health Service Executive will deal with the administration of the subvention scheme?  When will payments be made to ensure family members can stay in care institutions?  There is a great deal of concern in the community hospital sector about the severe burden that is falling on families.  The recent price increases have made it difficult for many people to make ends meet.  The HSE is not dealing with the problem.  It seems it does not have the staff or the facilities it needs to deal with these issues.  Payments have been due to many <Col N="1273"/>people since 1 January but very little, if anything, is happening in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Daly&rsquo;s call for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children on the shambles that is the Health Service Executive.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Harney, will be in the House tomorrow to deal with the Health Bill 2006.  When I heard Senator O&rsquo;Toole speaking about mushrooms, I was reminded of the approach taken by the HSE to the people it is supposed to serve.  Like mushrooms, we are kept in the dark and fed lots of you-know-what.</P>
        <P>I would like to give two examples of the problems I would like to raise with the Minister.  A 42 year old man from County Tipperary who was discharged from Cappagh Hospital after a serious spinal operation was referred for rehabilitation to &ldquo;Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital&rdquo; in Thurles, even though there is no such hospital.  When he travelled by ambulance from Dublin to a hospital in County Tipperary, he discovered that the hospital knew nothing about him and did not have a bed for him.  If it had not been for the intervention of a local health services manager, who used common sense and a great deal of effort to try to sort out the problem, there would have been nowhere for the man in question to go.  People living in rural Ireland have to tolerate difficulties like those encountered in this case, which has not yet been sorted out.  Similar problems are a feature of the out-of-hours doctor service.  I know some people who were minding a child of four or five years of age as a favour to their neighbour.  When the child became sick, they contacted the Shannondoc service, which refused to treat the child or issue a prescription without knowing the child&rsquo;s medical card number.  There is an urgent need for a debate on the treatment of this nature that we are now expected to tolerate.  I call for such a discussion of these matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to comment on the various agricultural schemes for which farmers now have to apply.  Can we ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House before the end of this session for a debate on the issue of compliance?  I refer in particular to a 166-page document, including 1,450 boxes which have to be ticked, that has been issued to farmers.  Given that many parts of the country do not even have broadband, it is wrong of the high-tech Department of Agriculture and Food to think about people making applications by e-mail.  The Government, which promised under Agenda 2000 that it would make farming free and easy, seems to have gone totally and absolutely crazy.</P>

	<P>When I had the pleasure of having a meal in Paris on Monday night, I discovered that the menu specified that all the meat served in the restaurant is Irish.  I was very impressed by this discovery, which should remind us of some of this country&rsquo;s success stories.</P>

	<P>I mention my experience in Paris to emphasise that this country has some very solid success stories.  Bord Bia is to be complimented for the work it has done in this area.  When the British budget was announced yesterday, it was interesting to note that Britain is following our lead in many ways.  During an interesting debate on the national development plan in the House a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Finance defended himself openly and explicitly against any criticism of the plan.  The budget announced in Britain yesterday signals that things are beginning to change.  The British identified that tax competitiveness is an essential element and they have introduced a minor reduction in corporation tax because of the threats to competition posed by Ireland but they have invested heavily in science and technology and have identified the importance of research and development.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We must examine this area on an ongoing basis.  I accept we will not do this immediately but we must have a debate on inflation and the danger posed by an increase in inflation here and the lack of competitiveness.  We need to have such a debate on a much more regular basis than we have had in the past.  I urge to Leader of the House to arrange for a time slot for such a debate on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>It is worrying that the EU Commission will issue a final legal warning to the Government today over its failure to comply with EU law to provide clean water to its citizens.  It also threatens the Government with a fine of a multimillion sum over two previous rulings by the European Court of Justice.  I request the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House today to explain the position.  This is a first world <Col N="1275"/>economy but people in parts of the country have to boil drinking water.  Despite the funding that has been invested in various water schemes, it is worrying that many of them throughout the country do not provide clean water.  The Minister should come to the House to explain this serious problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Pharmacy Bill will be taken today.  If Committee Stage is completed, will it be possible to have a break to enable us to submit amendments for Report and Final Stages?  It is unusual to deal with all those Stages together and normally it does not happen in this House.  This is a important Bill and involves many serious issues.  It is also unusual that the Government has tabled 50 or 60 amendments to the Bill, which we only received at 8.30 p.m. last night.  In saying that I am not being critical of the Bills Office but of the Government.  It published the Bill, announced straightaway that it would bring forward amendments on it and only published them at the last minute, which does not give the Opposition and other interested parties time to study them in detail.  If we complete Committee Stage, I request the Leader to provide time for a short break to enable us to submit amendments for Report and Final Stages and thereby do the Bill and our job in this House some justice.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s point on the Department of Education and Science and the ownership of schools.  What he said was news to me, I having been a primary school teacher.  I was concerned to hear on radio this morning that the Department of Education and Science is writing to potential claimants and people who claim to be victims of abuse in schools threatening that unless they retract their claims they will face financial ruin similar to the case mentioned by Senator Norris.  This is unusual.  I have never heard of anyone behaving in this manner and one would not expect a Department to behave like that.  The Leader might investigate the matter.  It also raises a serious question about the ownership of schools.  The fact that the church owns such a large number of schools leaves us vulnerable, given that the church body has become elderly and, unfortunately, many of them are selling schools, which have become valuable.</P>
        <P>The scenario painted by Senator White about the petrol stations might well and perhaps is being replicated in terms of schools.  The religious orders realise their property is valuable and they may decide to sell it, which would leave parents and students in a difficult position.  It is an issue we must address and have clarified by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

I warn against discussing any specific case at this stage, as I would be fear<Col N="1276"/>ful that we may prejudice an appeal that the Director of Public Prosecutions may make on a case, which nobody in this House would want to see happen.  We should be careful about talking about specific cases and rather we should deal with the generality of sentencing and consistency or lack of it.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority was established by legislation put through this and the other House.  It is generally accepted that it is doing an excellent job in terms of supervising employers, helping to eliminate workplace accidents and so on.  Two years ago the Health and Safety Authority decided that it would use its supervisory powers to inspect roadworks being carried out by local authorities, a development that was urgently needed.  It carried out 100 inspectors and as a result enforcement orders were issued to a raft to local authorities.  Two local authorities, Clare County Council and Donegal County Council, are now challenging the right of the Health and Safety Authority to be involved in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What about Mayo County Council?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not be surprised if Mayo County Council was doing likewise, given that there is also a case that has arisen in County Mayo.  The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s statutory right is being challenged by several local authorities throughout the country.  A tragic accident occurred in County Donegal where resurfacing work on a road, which I can only describe as having been scandalously neglected, was abandoned by the local authority workers at 2 p.m. on the day in question and that led to the death of a young widow.  In regard to that case, Donegal County Council is challenging, through the courts, the right of the Health and Safety Authority to exercise its statutory rights.  The case is not <i>sub judice</i> yet but it will be and I am aware of the advice that has been given.</P>
        <P>What happened in that instance was a scandal.  The Minister for Transport, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government hold the purse strings and if one holds the purse strings, one should be entitled to call the tune.  They should instruct all local authorities to back off challenging the Health and Safety Authority which is only doing its job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Leader to contact the Minister for Health and Children on an issue related to the danger smoking poses to people&rsquo;s health.  We all recognise the great effort made by the Government to stop the sale of packets of ten cigarettes, many of which were bought by young people.  The system was changed and people can now only buy packets of 20 cigarettes.  However, cigarette companies are selling two packets of ten cigarettes together and selling them as a packet of 20 cigarettes.  Young people are buying a packet of 20 cigarettes which consist of two packets of ten cigarettes.  That is not good enough and the Government must review this practice.  Cigarettes should not be sold in packets of fewer than 20 cigarettes.  Some people want to continue smoking, but the way cigarettes are sold should not make it easier for young people to get into the habit of buying cigarettes and smoking</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Opposition, asked if we were filibustering on the Defamation Bill.  I have followed the debate on the monitor in my office and have been enlivened and educated about various matters, about which I did not know, from listening to Senator Norris, occasionally other Senators who tabled amendments, and the Minister.  If Senator Brian Hayes is asking me if I know anything about a filibuster on this Bill, I do not.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Ryan complained that the final list of amendments to the Pharmacy Bill has only been <Col N="1279"/>circulated today although he does not blame anyone in the House for the delay.  He asked me to speak to the Ceann Comhairle on the matter of the D&aacute;il announcing that the Pharmacy Bill is on its agenda for tomorrow even though it has not concluded in this House.  I will speak to the Ceann Comhairle about this because it is a little presumptuous, if nothing else, to make such an announcement.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan also referred to the front page article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> about the young boy.  He spoke about bullying and the brandishing of images which bring children into adulthood almost overnight by bombarding them with images which make them want to perform older than their years.</P>
        <P>Senator Cox referred to the Criminal Justice Bill.  I support her wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss the matter of sentencing although I agree with Senator Norris that we cannot discuss a particular case because it has been sent on appeal to the Director of Public Prosecutions and we do not wish to prejudice the outcome.  Senator Cox has requested a general debate.  She made the point that rape victims will now be unwilling to go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because they fear how their case may be dealt with and whether it would even be entertained.  This is a salient point resulting from the matter.</P>
        <P>I am now proposing to do what this House has been lambasting the D&aacute;il for doing.  The House hopes to deal with the Criminal Justice Bill in the week after next.  I add the rider that this is on the presumption it will pass through the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan supports the point made by Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Toole.  I note an unholy alliance between Senators Coghlan and O&rsquo;Toole.  The word &ldquo;Kerry&rdquo; has only to be raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Norris asked for a debate on the abuse of children in primary schools.  He raised the issue of the ownership of schools and whether the Church is handcuffing various measures which could be introduced.  He <Col N="1280"/>referred to sex education as being completely inadequate.  He questioned the ownership of schools.  This is an emerging debate in modern times but I remind the House there would have been no schools in the past only for the school authorities who set them up and they cannot now be discarded.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of the haphazard nature of funding for community hospitals.  Kilrush hospital has to rely on funding as well as voluntary fund-raising.  He said the subvention was to be increased from January 2007 but this has not happened and the HSE is not dealing with the situation.  We will endeavour to have the Minister come to the House to answer that question.  The concept of a community hospital is excellent but the funding has to be on a statutory basis or else it is all for naught.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coonan referred to various cases in County Tipperary with which he is involved and spoke of the need to address those issues.  He referred to the 165-page document which farmers  must fill out.  I have met with the farming organisations on this matter.  European funding demands accountability and compliance but there should be some way to streamline the process while not sacrificing accountability.  The questions on the form seem to be a repetition of other questions farmers are asked all the time.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn has been in a restaurant in Paris which serves only Irish beef.  That is wonderful.  He suggested we should build on this success.  He also referred to the British budget.</P>
        <P>Senator Feighan asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to discuss the EU directive on clean water.  Senator Browne asked a pertinent question regarding the timetable for the taking of the Stages of the Pharmacy Bill.  It may be possible to arrange a delay of half an hour between Committee and Report Stages.  He referred to the Church&rsquo;s ownership of schools.  He raised this matter in the House last year.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins supports Senator Cox&rsquo;s request, as do we all.  He cautioned care in dealing with individual cases and the possibility of prejudicing an appeal.  We cannot keep standing up and commenting on the way in which judges deal with cases.  Another case this week also excited comment although it had nothing to do with the other matter.  These are sensitive issues which need to be treated properly when being discussed in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Higgins stated that individual county councils are attempting to circumvent the health and safety regulations for the inspection of road works.  We are all familiar with cases where people have been injured by road works which have been neglected or abandoned by county councils.  A case in County Westmeath is being hotly contested.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moylan raised the issue of packets of cigarettes whereby packets of 20 are available and can be shared.  Everybody should stop smok<Col N="1281"/>ing or should never start smoking but that is my personal belief and I do not wish to impose it on everybody.  I thank the Senator for making the point.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 28, to delete &ldquo;relevant.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;relevant, and where an appeals committee finds that a school has acted&mdash;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister to the House.  There is concern among boards of management and VECs about the situation that potentially exists regarding the appeals mechanism.  There is also a concern about the power of the Secretary General of the Department, based on previous overturns of appeals.  In all those appeals, there was no indication that the Department was taking responsibility for anything.  That is most unusual.  In all eight cases that were overturned, the Department had palmed off responsibility onto other boards of management or VECs.  That worries many people and I hope the Minister can deal with it.</P>
        <P>In many of these cases, it was simply an administrative difficulty that was overlooked.  The boards of management proceeded in the appeals with fairness and due consideration, but they are only human and they make errors.  If the error is simply procedural, it is very unfair that an appeal would be upheld in favour of the disciplining <Col N="1282"/>child on those grounds, and against the boards of management and VECs.</P>
        <P>In the vocational educational sector, a student or a parent has a right to an appeal in the first instance through a subcommittee of the local vocational educational committee and thereafter to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  Once the appeal is made to the Secretary General, it is administered by an appeals administration section of the Department, which in turn establishes a three-person appeals committee to hear and decide on the case. This committee is serviced by an official of the appeals administrative section of the Department.  The experience of VECs around the country in the operation of this scheme has been very negative.  The biggest concern among VEC members is the willingness of members of the appeals committee and officials of the Department to apply strictly procedural requirements to members of the boards of management and VECs, who are respondents in the appeals cases, while patently failing to apply the same strictures to themselves.</P>
        <P>I wish to give an example of this.  The appeals administrative section of the Department gave advice to a VEC that it was in order for it to hold over a particular decision for a single day for a meeting of the committee.  Subsequently, officials from this same section of the Department decided that this advice was in error.  It used this very fact, that the VEC had delayed by one day to admit an appeal against it, to decide in favour of the appellant parent and against the VEC.  The possibility of this scenario being repeated is what is causing concern.</P>
        <P>There is a concern about a conflict of interest within the Department due to the make-up of the committee.  Can the Minister say that the three people on the appeals committee have the necessary training and requirements to make those decisions?  I do not wish to cast aspersions on the professionalism or otherwise of the members who are involved.  It is of the utmost importance that the Minister can confirm this.  It is a very serious situation because the smallest human error can have great consequences down the line.  I am conscious of the fact that many of them may not yet have the proper training in crisis management and so on.</P>
        <P>To allay some of the concerns that I have, the Minister should consider the establishment of an absolutely independent appeals board.  The Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 could be amended to provide this facility and to ensure that independence would have to be seen to be in operation.  That would provide an indication of independence in this instance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another matter about which I am concerned is the entitlement of the Secretary General to extend the period.  In certain instances it may be necessary to request a report from a particular agency regarding the difficulties identified in respect of a pupil.  The Minister will acknowledge <Col N="1283"/>that if a child is expelled from school today on foot of serious disciplinary problems relating to questionable behaviour aimed at his or her fellow students, teachers or other members of staff or school property, the likelihood is that because of the forthcoming Easter and summer holidays &mdash; and despite the 44-day rule &mdash; a final decision on the matter will not be handed down until next Christmas.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials are shaking their heads to indicate that this would not be the case.  However, the likelihood is that it could happen.  The Minister is a former teacher.  Is she in a position to visualise what would happen if a child were obliged to remain outside of school for the period to which I refer before being reinstated following an appeal?  Can she imagine the humiliation that might be visited upon the teacher involved in dealing with the initial incident, the board of management or the school principal who would be obliged to deal with the child&rsquo;s reinstatement?</P>
        <P>Six months ago there were media reports regarding a child who had been suspended or expelled from school and who met a group of his peers in the local town.  He was clearly overheard expressing his delight at the fact that he would be rehabilitated and back at school within 30 days and that his intention was to make life miserable for a particular teacher.</P>
        <P>This is an extremely serious matter.  Amendment No. 1 in my name suggests the inclusion of the following in the Bill:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;relevant, and where an appeals committee finds that a school has acted&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) properly, in terms of notifying the student and his or her parent or parents at each step of the process towards sanction,</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) reasonably, in terms of taking the final decision to sanction the student, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) in accordance with its policy or policies and where&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(I) the policy or policies were well communicated to the student and his or her parent or parents, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(II) the school had made reasonable efforts to communicate the policy or policies to the student and his or her parent or parents,</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is1p8- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the appeals committee shall not overturn the decision of the school save in exceptional and extraordinary circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Unfortunately, the exceptional and extraordinary circumstances to which the amendment refers do occur.  It is important that the Minister should confirm that the Department will not overturn decisions simply for procedural reasons.</P>
        <P el="5">Amendment No. 2 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4A) Where a student has been&mdash;</P><Col N="1284"/>
        <P LI="2">(a) suspended, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) expelled,</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>for the use, or threat, of violence against&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) another student,</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) a teacher or any other member of the staff of the school, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) property, whether held by the school or a person referred to in paragraph (i) or (ii),</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>the appeals committee shall have particular regard to that fact, and shall not overturn the decision of the school save in exceptional and extraordinary circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Both amendments are reasonable and provide safeguards.  I hope the Minister will consider amending the Ombudsman for Children Act in order to provide a mechanism that can clearly be seen to be independent.  In addition, the power of the Secretary General to extend the time period should be clearly outlined in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept these amendments because they would destroy what we set out to do in the Bill, namely, provide balance.  Schools are of the opinion that at present there is a lack of balance regarding the consideration of appeals because criteria are not set down.  The amendment of section 29 of the 1998 Act seeks to provide an appeals committee with criteria it can consider in order to ensure that the rights of an individual child who has been expelled from school will be recognised and then balanced against those of the remainder of the student population and teachers and that cognisance will also be taken of the health, safety and welfare of the latter groups.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 automatically favour schools and would ensure that the balance to which I refer would not be put in place.  This matter was debated at length on Second Stage.  Bearing in mind that a student who has been expelled has a constitutional right to an education, it is important that a school can show that it has done everything possible for that student and that it has made reasonable efforts to ensure that his or her needs have been met.  Equally, however, this must be balanced against the other elements to which I refer such as the safety, health and welfare of teachers, etc.</P>
        <P>The balance we are seeking to achieve by way of amending section 29 of the 1998 Act is crucially important.  In the past, school authorities were of the opinion that matters were balanced in favour of the individual.  Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s amendments would balance it in favour of the school, which would not be fair to either party.</P>
        <P>The way matters are set out in the Bill means that a range of issues must be taken into consideration.  In addition, it deals with the type of incidents to which Senator Ulick Burke referred.  For <Col N="1285"/>example, it refers to the &ldquo;nature, scale and persistence&rdquo; any behaviour on the part of a student.  This will allow an appeals committee to give serious consideration to one-off incidents or a succession of incidents.  A committee will also be obliged to consider what a school has done for a child, how this impacted on the other students and the rest of the school and how both of these fit into the overall context of the policies of the school.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to procedural issues.  Such issues are, in fact, legislative requirements.  Under the Education Act, schools are obliged to have policies on behaviour, bullying, health and safety and equality.  Such policies are important in the context of the running of schools and they provide great security not just to teachers and principals but also to students and their parents.</P>
        <P>It is critically important that even before children are enrolled in schools, they and their parents should be aware of the exact nature of both the procedures that will be employed if the rules are broken and the code of sanction.  Students will, therefore, before they even enter their schools, be fully aware of what is likely to happen if there is a breach of the rules.  This will provide great protection for schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If schools have in place proper policies and follow the correct procedures, they will be on to a winner.  There is not, therefore, a need &mdash; as is the case in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment &mdash; to favour them.  Equally, they must ensure that if they go to the extreme of expelling a student, they must follow the legal requirements set out regarding the relevant procedures to be used.  A timescale is set down and schools must provide students and their families with notice of expulsion sufficiently far in advance to allow them to made alternative arrangements.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the example to which Senator Ulick Burke referred, namely, the fact that the case of a student being expelled today would not be finally decided upon until next Christmas.  He is completely wrong in that regard.  If an incident happens today in a school and the authorities there decide to expel the student, 20 days notice must be given and the National Educational Welfare Board must be notified.  That enables the board to work with the family and the student to find an alternative placement, if such is required, or at least to support the student.  The student can remain in the school for that period.  However, if the school is of the view that the student remaining would be a danger or would put at risk or affect the health and safety of other students within the school, the school can suspend that student for that time.  There is no question of putting anybody at risk during that period.</P>
        <P>The appeal, should the person take one to the Department of Education and Science, must be heard within 30 days.  Even if the extension of time were given, which it would not be at this time of the year and only if it were to interfere <Col N="1286"/>with the likes of summer holidays, to ensure that sufficient allowance would be made for schools and parents to provide information, the appeal would be determined within a period of 30 days according to the legislation.  Then there would be the hearing of the appeal and notification of it.  Were an incident to occur today, there would be 20 days to allow the student, parents and the National Educational Welfare Board to act on it, and then 30 days until the appeal would be heard.  Even if one allows for a week or two for the appeal to be heard, all that would be well sorted by the end of May.  Meanwhile, the National Educational Welfare Board would work with the child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Secretary General not have the privilege of extending it if he or she so requests?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The period of that extension may not exceed 14 days.  There would be no question of continuing it.  That is to protect everybody, which is fair enough because we must ensure a child is not too long out of school in the event that he or she must return to it.</P>
        <P>The appeals board comprises the most eminent people who have vast experience in education.  We are conscious that people involved in appeals such as this would have the necessary experience.  I assure Senator Ulick Burke that as with all appointments which I have made and which have been recognised in the other House by Fine Gael as being of persons of eminence, we would ensure people on appeals boards such as this would ensure they balance the rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The core of this amending legislation is the introduction of criteria which bring a balance into the considerations appeals boards must undertake and which they have not had to date.  I genuinely fear Senator Ulick Burke would shift the balance from what people believe is in favour of the individual towards the school and would not reflect what is happening.  I know they believe these particular considerations that must be taken into account by the appeals board balance the right of that individual and the right of the school.  It puts it up to the school to ensure it has such policies, and these are clearly enunciated and the parents and students are well aware of them, but the school must do that anyway under the legislation.  That is part of good administration.  It will lead to better running of the school, but it also protects the individual child and his or her family by giving time to ensure the child gets an education.  In the past people might have felt it was weighted against the school, but this at least helps an appeals board to be able to state the matters it must consider, and it is fair and open.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister has said it all and I would have made the same points.  The following <Col N="1287"/>questions occurred to me, however.  Where would the hearings of the appeals board take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>They need not be held in Dublin.  They are held in independent local areas.  For example, I was going through Athlone one day and met the appeals board in a hotel.  It was an independent, neutral but local area convenient to everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>This is good legislation.  It has been welcomed by all the educational partners.  It certainly has tidied up the appeals area because when appeals were made to a board of management, there was no tight procedure for dealing with them.  This legislation will make it clear to education administrators in schools how to handle such matters.  If there is a code of behaviour, the policies are in place therefore, and the key to it, as the Minister stated, is to get that balance right.  This legislation has done that.  I welcome it and, from having spoken to other teachers, I know they do as well.  It is clear.  The procedures are laid out and all children in a school will know exactly where they stand in the case of policies and what will happens when they break the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister may have forgotten to deal with one matter.  I welcome her comments on the question of an independent appeals board not comprising personnel within the Department.  I accept fully the professionalism of the people chosen, the high esteem in which are held and their capacity to do the job, but as representatives of the Department of Education and Science, they obviously would have a conflict of interest in terms of their independence and that is why I suggested a mechanism whereby the Minister could amend the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to provide this role to him or her, who would be seen as clearly independent in this instance.</P>
        <P>While the Minister states that, for instance, if the school has all of its policies, it will be on a winner, the reality is that every school had to possess those policies long before this Bill or before these matters began to arise.  Every school that has thought educationally in the context of the prevailing environment possesses all of these policies and I suggest they have been crying out to the Department of Education and Science to give the lead, the indications and the framework on which these policies should be brought forward.  There has been delay by respective Ministers down the years.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is to be commended on bringing forward the proposals.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that I want to place the balance on the side of the schools, but that is not so.  On Second Stage, I clearly welcomed the balance within the legislation.  However, the record of the decisions given clearly shows that <Col N="1288"/>the only reason that could be found and has been expressed and documented for the Department giving its decisions was non-compliance with procedures, and that has caused concern.  I instanced one case of a vocational education committee where it was delayed for one day on the Department&rsquo;s advice and the Department returned the following day upholding the appeal of the child and stating that the VEC had broken the rules on the basis of delaying by that day.  When the Department&rsquo;s advice given one day is turned on its head the next and the Department makes the opposite decision, how can there be general acceptance of fairness or balance?  It is such cases that cause the problems and concern.  One would want to legislate against the like of that ever arising again where mistakes were made, not by the school authorities, boards of management or VEC, but by the Department and accepted as an error on its part.</P>
        <P>I hope it would be clear that where schools have abided correctly by each of the procedural steps, taken account of all of the ones highlighted in the legislation under the various headings listed such as reasonableness, nature and scale of persistence, educational interest to other students, safety, health and welfare of teachers, students, etc., and have taken out the relevant policies, the Department would not perform a somersault and make a decision such as that to which I referred.  That is the only mechanism.  It does not favour school boards of management, teachers and the main body of students.  The Minister was very selective in saying that in so far as we were speaking of the students.  It was very selective with regard to students.  The majority of students in every school want to be educated in a tolerant environment and in co-operation with teachers and management.  I want to make it clear that my amendment will affect only the individual students who cause disruption.  I do not want to tilt the law on the side of teachers or boards of management because, as I stated on Second Stage, a balance is required.  However, a balance will not be achieved if one individual causes disruption among his or her fellow students.  I hope the Minister will incorporate my amendments and provide for the independence of appeals boards.  I do not see them as independent at present and, despite their capabilities and capacities for fairness, many of those involved in the education sector will never be able to completely discharge their duties if an element of unfairness remains or the Department is seen as having a vested interest.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything has been taken into account.  Reasonableness is required and the interests of the offending child will be considered in light of his or her background and the school setting.  What more does the Senator want?  These provisions are in black and white.  All factors will be reasonably considered in the procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be.</P>

	<P>It is there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The very reason we are introducing this legislation is that schools believed the criteria set out were insufficient to enable them to look after the health, safety and welfare of other students.  The issues to which Senator Ulick Burke referred arose prior to the introduction of this Bill, when there were no criteria or guidelines and no issues for the appeals board to consider.  This legislation requires the board to consider other students.  If an individual student has offended in a persistent, serious or dangerous manner, an appeals board must take into consideration the issues raised by the Senator, namely, the other children in the school and their teachers.</P>
        <P>The appeals board comprises two independent people and an independent but full-time inspector of the Department of Education and Science.  None of the three will be a full-time official of the Department.  The Department does not have a vested interested in any school in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We recently discovered that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not a teachers&rsquo; union or a managers&rsquo; representative body.  However, it has to uphold the constitutional right of young people to an education.  I share that duty as Minister for Education and Science.  Each three-person board will include an inspector who has an overview of schools through visiting them regularly and who will have an understanding of the situation.  The other two independent people will have the knowledge and experience they need to make valuable contributions to the appeals board.</P>
        <P>In regard to the VEC mentioned by the Senator, I have been legally advised that the admittedly erroneous advice offered by the appeals administration unit about the requirement for the VEC to issue its findings within 30 days was not given as a reason by the section 29 appeals committee for upholding the appeal.  The days issue related only to the timing of issuing the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the basis of my amendments.  Situations like that would never arise again.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1290"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, both the VEC and the Department upheld the appeal, and it made no difference at all.  The issue raised by the parent pertained to the conditions attached to the appeal at the VEC level, which the student won.  The parent did not like the conditions and went to the Department.  In both cases, the appeal was upheld.</P>
        <P>Not all schools have the required policies in place.  They certainly did not have them prior to a couple of years ago, which was the reason we did as the Senator asked and posted templates on our website for schools.  All the schools have to do is personalise the templates and agree them with students, staff and parents.  In this day and age, students need to know and sign up to policies on bullying and behaviour for the sake of protecting both schools and students.  If schools set out such policies, everybody is protected.  In the event of a serious incident leading to an expulsion and appeal, this legislation provides for fair and balanced criteria which will ensure the rights of all the students are protected.  The issues of the past to which the Senator referred will no longer arise because these criteria are set out in the Bill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister on introducing this fine Bill to facilitate school authorities in dealing with today&rsquo;s problems.  It is clear she has real empathy with this matter.  She has clarified her position on Second Stage and in response to the amendments brought today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and her officials for introducing this Bill, which has been widely acknowledged as important.  I hope it will give balance to the situations which arise within schools.  The Minister has stated her wish to introduce root and branch reform.  Some roots have been certainly  established through this Bill.  Other roots will also have to be planted in the future, as will branches.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the resources necessary for implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions are made available at national level and not only in respect of the 50 schools already identified.  Most schools in the country have been given the opportunity to make a submission.  Schools that have not done so should be <Col N="1291"/>requested to make a submission.  Every school must be involved to ensure the legislation is implemented successfully because the procedures and policies must be in place in every school.  Few school principals can say they do not have problems with individual students now and again but it would be terrible if the schools that have come forward were identified as experiencing serious problems and placed at a disadvantage with competing schools in their areas.</P>
        <P>The resources provided for schools in Ireland pale into insignificance when compared with those provided in other countries.  I outlined examples earlier.  I hope this issue will be addressed.  Where children fall victim to situations such as this, there should be adequate staff and facilities to permit them to remain within the education system, even if it is outside the formal structure.  They should receive continuing education and we should not be wanting on resources.  For instance, court decisions are handed down regarding juveniles but no places are available to detain them.  However, under this legislation, all those who cannot be accommodated within regular school structures will be assisted to continue their education.  That is why I asked the Minister to consider carefully the outreach mechanism to address this issue.  They should be provided with resources where such cases arise.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation and hope it will lead to an environment where children can be taught without being disrupted by other students, teachers can get on with their job in the best interests of pupils and school management will not have to devote most of its time to procedural letters in response to this legislation.  A number of schools are in crisis because of the difficulties associated with educational disadvantage and other issues which cause children to lose out.  I hope the legislation will respond positively and quickly to these problems in order that it can be viewed as a flagship from here on.</P>

	<P>I have great respect and affection for the Minister for Health and Children but to be presented with 97 amendments at 9.30 a.m. today is not fair.  Again, I do not blame anyone in particular; it is simply the way it is being done.  To be presented with the groups of amendments at 12.30 p.m. today is not fair either.  This House does its best to deal with legislation, particularly that introduced in it.  This is not the way to do business.

Yesterday I telephoned the Bills Office numerous times and was told the amendments would be ready at 4 p.m. but they eventually arrived at 8.30 p.m.  I am not being critical of the Bills Office but of the Government and the way it has handled this.  It is very unfair that so many amendments have been tabled at the last minute and that they are all to be taken on the one day.  I hope we can debate the amendments and that we get proper explanations.  The Department of Health and Children tends to bamboozle us with amendments at times.

	<P>I accept this is not the normal way we do business.  This Bill has been in gestation for a considerable length of time.  The amendments we propose have been informed by the response of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and by the debate in the House on Second Stage.  Some of the amendments are technical, some change the manner in which members of the society will be elected and the types of persons the bodies identified in the legislation will nominate to the position and some deal with conflict of interest situations, and many Senators were anxious that would be dealt with.  As I said on Second Stage, we had intended to deal with it in a different way but on the legal advice of the Attorney General, we have had to deal with it by way of conflict of interest provisions.  </P>
        <P>I accept the timeframe is short.  I can assure Senators it is short for me too.  I only saw the amendments late yesterday and the small group of officials working on this Bill have been working all night preparing for this debate.  I apologise to the House but the overriding concern is to have this legislation implemented as quickly as possible because of the length of time it has been gestation and the fact we, effectively, have no fitness to practice regime for pharmacists or pharmacies in Ireland.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1, 9, 29 to 31, inclusive, 38, 44, 45, <Col N="1293"/>61, 62 and 103 are related and may be discussed together.  Is that agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the amendments that are at the core of what the Minister just mentioned when she very graciously dealt with our complaints, which I will not pursue any further, are hugely significant.  I am not sure this is the wisest way to discuss amendments Nos. 61 and 62, in particular, both of which are two pages long.  We will ramble all over the place with all these amendments being discussed together.  However, I will not object if the House wishes to take them together.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 makes passing references to amendments Nos. 61 and 62.  It is simply a technical necessity to deal with the others.  However, amendments Nos. 61 and 62 are hugely significant amendments and are very welcome.  I am not happy that we will suddenly launch into a discussion on what is the nub of the Government&rsquo;s amendments and group them all together.  To a degree, I am alerting the House that we are either going to discuss the whole issue of conflict of interest now or not at all.  I am not very happy with this grouping.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator is not happy, we will deal with amendments Nos. 61 and 62 separately.  We will take amendments Nos. 1, 9, 29 to 31, inclusive, 38, 44, 45 and 103 together.  The Senator expressed doubt in regard to amendments Nos. 61 and 62.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am uneasy about it, I will agree that the group of amendments be taken together.  Taking those two amendments separate from the others is impossible as well.  We need to be careful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it agreed that we take amendments Nos.  1, 9, 29 to 31, inclusive, 38, 44, 45, 61, 62 and 103 together?  Agreed.</P>
        </Speaker><P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(4) <i>Subsection (3) </i>shall not apply to sections 63 and 64.&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Ryan has acknowledged, this group of amendments effectively relates to amendments Nos. 61 and 62.  Amendment No. 1 is necessitated by the new provisions we are including in respect of conflict of interest.  Amendment No. 61 deals with the prohibition of certain economic relationships between pharmacists and medical practitioners, namely, either party having a beneficial interest in the other&rsquo;s practice, including company or corporate relationships and a relationship by way of preferential leasing or tenancy arrangements.</P><Col N="1294"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 62 deals with pharmacy and medical practices using shared premises, the type of economic relationships it is considered necessary to prohibit and also the situation where the prescriber or dispenser recommends the other&rsquo;s practice to a patient.  We are giving powers to the society and the Medical Council to deal with conflict of interest situations which arise by way of fitness to practice.</P>
        <P>Essentially, a pharmacist can be charged only the normal market rent for a pharmacy.  If true, the extraordinary stories one hears will be brought to an end under the provisions provided for the society, as well as those pertaining to the Medical Council.</P>
        <P>Doctors cannot recommend a particular pharmacy.  Obviously, a doctor may inform patients about the opening hours of pharmacies in a particular location and a pharmacist may inform a patient of a doctor&rsquo;s opening hours or location.  However, they are not entitled to recommend each other and where there is co-location, there will be an obligation to have separate entrances to the individual facilities.  Another issue brought to my attention recently concerned a clinic that was faxing prescriptions to a particular pharmacist.  All such practices will be prohibited under the strong conflict of interest provisions I have introduced.</P>
        <P>As I noted in my Second Stage debate, I had sought to deal with this issue in a different manner.  However, the Attorney General strongly advised that this was not possible and that the proposal under discussion was the appropriate route to take.  I have taken this advice, which explains why the substantial amendments are being made now rather than being included in the original Bill.  I had envisaged doing this somewhat differently.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Medical Council is also being given substantial powers regarding conflicts of interest that might arise in respect of medical practitioners.  In the first instance, all of this is being done to ensure appropriate behaviour on the part of professionals and that economic interests will not influence what is asked of patients or the manner in which they are dealt with.  This would not and cannot be acceptable.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 is simply a technical amendment to facilitate amendments Nos. 61 and 62.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will restate some points I made during the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  A prescription is valid nationwide; a prescription written by a doctor can be used in any pharmacy in Ireland.  Is the HSE planning to have this stated clearly on prescriptions in the near future?  I am aware it is drawing up guidelines in this regard.  However, so doing would help remove any misconception or perception of misconduct.</P>
        <P>Conflicts of interest are difficult.  Previously, I made a point about the prospect of duty free pharmacies to the effect that patients should not <Col N="1295"/>be obliged to walk through a pharmacy to either enter or leave a primary care centre.  This would be highly intimidating and would not offer choice to patients.  There should be no beneficial or economic link between a general practitioner and a pharmacy based in the same premises.  However, Members also live in the real world and it is next to impossible for a non-local arriving in Carlow to get an appointment to see a doctor.  Moreover, there is a major problem regarding the number of patients per GP in north County Dublin, which I understand to be double the national average.  It has been brought to my attention that the high cost of finding a building is a factor in this regard.  Although I take the Minister&rsquo;s point, I am also aware that doctors are being told to expand their services, while pharmacists are being urged to have more consultation rooms, etc.  While it is all well and good for Members to make such statements in the Chamber, they are not providing any help in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister could announce the introduction of a grants package to enable general practitioners to set up in areas that currently lack them or to enable pharmacists to set up in an area or assist them in renovating their premises.</P>
        <P>In some respects, Members are throwing out the baby with the bath water.  Undoubtedly, there are some dodgy practices, with which no one is satisfied.  However, patients should have access to doctors and pharmacists.  In certain locations such as Cork city there are problems associated with the high cost of buildings and the increase in population.  While one option is being ruled out, it does not appear that an alternative is being provided to incentivise people to become involved in either GP services or the pharmaceutical industry in areas that are crying out for them.  In other sectors such as the hotel industry major tax breaks are given.  However, nothing similar happens in this case.</P>
        <P>Primary care are buzz words.  Everyone is being told primary care is the future and that it is not desirable to have people in hospital beds or nursing homes.  Although the option of remaining in one&rsquo;s home and community is being advocated, support to so do is not being provided.  Although I have no difficulty in supporting the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I do not see how she is backing them up with alternatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has gone a long way towards addressing the concerns expressed by many Members during the Second Stage debate regarding both the enormous profits that can be made by individuals and public safety.  As the Minister has recognised, it is essential to have a division between the prescriber and the dispenser.  I am concerned as to whether the legislation will be retrospective, as a significant number of premises have already been built.  For example, amendment No. 62 refers to &ldquo;premises <Col N="1296"/>which, although separate ... are such that public access to the one is available only by way of the other, or ... share a common public entrance with each other&rdquo;.  I know of several such arrangements.  Will this provision cover them?</P>
        <P>Key money, that is, money given to get close to health care centres in the first place, appears to have been a major issue.  While it may be included in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, I have not yet managed to pick it out.  Key money appears to have cost between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million.  This would constitute a good start.</P>
        <P>I was alarmed by a comment I read in an interview given by a former adviser to the chief executive of the Health Service Executive regarding the Touchstone project in Carlow, which Senator Browne has mentioned.  He stated that in respect of the project, he was faced with the opportunity of being able to buy suites at a cost of 20% of their value.  As an investment opportunity, it could not be matched by doing things privately.  Who is paying the other 80%?  Why are such suites being sold off so cheaply?  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  Such a development alarms me and I do not know whether the legislation covers it.</P>
        <P>I am not being picky with the Minister regarding the lateness of the amendments.  However, they are vitally important and at the nub of the issue.  However, I cannot find a mention of either issue in them.  Moreover, is it necessary to specify who will describe what constitutes reasonable rent in an area?  Reasonable rent for a newsagent would not be the same as for a pharmacy, in which one stocks goods of a much higher value and so on and for which greater security is needed.  This is of some concern to me.</P>
        <P>The Minister has attempted to cover, to the best of her ability, the juxtaposition of pharmacists and doctors by getting their respective professional bodies to deal with them.  However, I am concerned that the issue of key money does not appear to be covered and I am worried about the retrospective position.  Who is paying for the suites being sold at such a cheap price?  How will the issue of reasonable rent be worked out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As for Senator Browne&rsquo;s query, I mentioned during the Second Stage debate that the HSE was preparing to ensure prescriptions would include a reference one&rsquo;s ability to go to any pharmacist.  It is important for patients to have such information.  </P>
        <P>In respect of grants to doctors and pharmacies, there are special arrangements in disadvantaged areas for general practitioners.  However, in both cases, these are professional entrepreneurs.  In the case of pharmacy, approximately 80% of the business, sometimes more, is paid for by the taxpayer.  The manner in which the State pays for the contract of service must be made attractive as otherwise, people would not be involved in the business in the first place.  I certainly do not envisage grants.</P><Col N="1297"/>
        <P>Rising property values raise issues for health care facilities in terms of being able to compete in a market where it is lucrative to invest in residential, commercial or even industrial property.  Recently, I spoke to a local authority on the need to designate by way of zoning particular portions of land for health related facilities, especially residential care.  It is increasingly difficult in major urban centres for anybody who wants to provide private residential care to be able to purchase a property and make a reasonable return when the obvious temptation is to invest in residential apartments or housing or commercial activity.  It is a major issue.</P>
        <P>In the centre of Dublin it is difficult to encourage new entrants into the long-term care market.  Most of the facilities built are on the fringe of the city where land values are cheaper.  It raises issues and I would like to see it dealt with by way of specific zoning.  The same may apply to other health facilities.  Ultimately, patients and the health system must pay for the higher costs in attracting people into the business.</P>
        <P>Regarding the points made by Senator Henry, the Bill cannot be retrospective in the context of what is already in place.  Under the Bill the Medical Council and society will have specific powers to deal with ongoing behaviour.  If a blatant economic attraction does not meet with market requirements, it will be a matter for the society to establish whether a normal relationship exists.</P>
        <P>We will not prohibit doctors from owning pharmacy buildings or <i>vice versa</i>.  We will not prohibit people&rsquo;s rights to own properties.  We seek to deal with conflicts of interest where economic misbehaviour takes place which affects the professionalism of either the pharmacist or the doctor.  As Senator Henry stated, patient safety is put at risk in such a situation.  To survive, a pharmacist requires a doctor to prescribe.  If a patient who does not require a prescription receives one, it is a patient safety issue which is why it is dealt with through fitness to practice provisions, and this is the appropriate route.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has my sympathies if she received the list of amendments as late as the rest of us.  It will be possible to have a pharmacy in the same premises as a medical practice but not with the same entrance.  I am concerned not about medical aspects but about competition aspects.  If one has a medical centre with a pharmacy in a country town, does its sheer accessibility not immediately threaten in terms of competition any other community pharmacies in the same town?</P>
        <P>It is difficult to separate the belief in some type of competition.  It may not be market-based competition.  It may be quality of service or the fact people feel comfortable with one pharmacist more than another.  It may be that women feel happier dealing with a female pharmacist about an issue and men feel more comfortable dealing with a male pharmacist.  Is the Minister happy she <Col N="1298"/>will not introduce a major distortion in proper competition if functioning pharmacies are next door to a medical centre?</P>
        <P>In country towns, an increasing tendency exists to have a single medical centre where all the GPs work.  It is an improvement because it provides people with a range of services.  However, a single pharmacy next door to it or beside it will have a negative effect on people&rsquo;s willingness to choose.  If the number of other pharmacies declines, the long-term effect will be to create a quasi-monopoly.  I do not need to tell the present Minister about the evils of monopolies.  She made a good political career out of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not like political monopolies either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must stop one at the next general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome what the Minister said and urge that prescription validity be written on prescriptions immediately.  No reason exists to delay it.  The sooner it is done the better and the matter can be solved quickly.</P>
        <P>People are unhappy about the key money aspect and I cannot blame them.  Perhaps the actions of the private sector are a reflection of the void which exists at present.  During my 30 years on the planet, doctors have changed a great deal.  We used to have one doctor in a surgery working on his or her own.  Now they work in groups and have expanded services.  Nationally, we encourage them to introduce other services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy to have a one-stop shop.  It is important we provide incentives and assistance.</P>
        <P>The value of property has gone through the roof.  In Carlow, even a basic small unit costs &euro;500,000 if not more.  A general practitioner starting off will have major costs and will pass these on to the patients.  The advantage of a primary care team is that if three or four people go in together, it will lessen the financial burden which will be reflected in patients&rsquo; fees.</P>
        <P>Regarding the matter raised by Senator Henry, it is important to state the GPs planning to go into the Touchstone centre will have no economic link with the pharmacy.  As far as I understand it, Touchstone will obtain the money directly from the pharmacy and other services in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Senator Browne&rsquo;s final point I did not think an economic link would exist between the doctor and the pharmacist.  I want to know why such generosity is shown by selling the suites at 20% of the market value.  Somehow the other 80% will be paid.  I support the Minister with regard to generic drugs.  Senator Ryan is correct to state this may reduce competition enormously.  From what the Minister stated, I feel she is not in a position to stop a pharmacy <Col N="1299"/>opening in the same building as a medical centre so that is that and there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the fact that many medical centres are built on the fringes of towns because property is not so expensive there.  We will have a situation whereby a pharmacy within a desirable medical centre will receive far more business due to convenience.  The matter of allowing key money is very important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up on a point made by Senator Browne on prescription validity and the point raised by Senator Henry.  When a doctor prescribes a certain brand of drug, he or she should also write a note on the prescription to state if the particular brand is not available, another brand is to be used, possibly a generic drug.  It would make it more economical, not for the pharmacist but certainly for the patient and for the State from the point of view of the General Medical Service.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I welcome the amendments on where a pharmacy can be situated, whether in a health centre or outside it.  This is ground-breaking legislation and is new to all of us.  It will settle down when it is implemented and we see it up and running.  The ethical area will come into play.  Pharmacists will be governed by their own ethical guide, as will doctors.  If they are in breach of this ethical guide, they will face the rigours of a fitness to practise regime and, possibly, be found guilty of professional misconduct.  Matters will settle down.  Although I can understand the frustrations and worries expressed, when this new legislation pans out and is implemented, matters may not be as bad as we believe.</P>
        <P>We have all heard the frightening stories of prescriptions being passed down a chute from a doctor&rsquo;s surgery to a pharmacy below.  We have heard stories about patients being intimidated by being told that if they do not go to a certain pharmacy within a health unit, the doctor will not be able to get them a bed in a certain nursing home.  These incidents occur but we do not condone them for one moment.  They will be faced up to by doctors and pharmacists with their own regulatory authorities when such fitness to practise provisions are put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not deal with a particular company because this legislation is not about a particular set of circumstances.  We are not prohibiting co-location.  For as long as I can remember, doctors and pharmacists have been in close proximity to each other.  What we are seeking to ensure is that a doctor cannot have an interest in the pharmacy business and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are also ensuring any rent paid must be at the normal rate.  This may differ in areas, as it would perhaps be more expensive in the centre of Dublin than in Carlow or elsewhere.  We are giving both regulat<Col N="1300"/>ory bodies very strong powers in these matters.  It will be professional misconduct to enter into an agreement where above normal market rent is being charged for a premises.  For example, if it were the case that a doctor&rsquo;s rent was subsidised and a pharmacist&rsquo;s rent was hiked, I would have a significant number of concerns.  The primary concern would be for the taxpayer, because as the purchaser of 80% of drugs, we would be paying for this.  Nobody will do it on the basis of charity.</P>
        <P>I have no philosophical or other objection to people making profits.  As I stated the other evening, if people could not make profits, they would not be in business and if we did not have profit, we would not have much innovation in the provision of drugs, therapies and health care treatment.  Most are funded by private providers rather than governments worldwide.  We are looking to ensure patient safety will not be put at risk and that vulnerable cases will not be exploited using economic measures to blatantly discriminate against or favour one set of circumstances over another.  That is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>When I brought the Bill to the Cabinet, we sought to deal with the matter in a different fashion but we were strongly advised that we could not do so for constitutional and other legal reasons.  The Attorney General advised us that this was the appropriate route and, on reflection, it is a good one because we are now giving powers not just to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland but the Irish Medical Council also.  I have written to the council about some of these matters, as under its existing powers, it is not in a position to deal with these issues.  We are amending the Medical Practitioners Act 1978 through a new Bill before the other House which will be presented in this House shortly.  We are including both bodies in these amendments, which is good.</P>
        <P>I am a strong fan of competition which drives innovation and delivers better value for money for consumers.  It has been argued that as the State pays every pharmacist in the country the same price for the same products, this may not be very competitive.  Competition is not perfect by any means.  My good friend Senator Minihan keeps me well informed about developments in the pharmacy business and tells me how difficult things are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not look hungry to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They could be much more difficult if we had a different system in place.  I know a new contract with pharmacists is about to be negotiated and hope we will get even better value from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, given the strong legislation we are introducing.  I am sure we will get value.</P>
        <P>In so far as I, or any Minister, can in legislation such as this, we are using the powers available to us in what I hope is an appropriate manner.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Medical Council will have powers to deal with <Col N="1301"/>these issues under the fitness to practise provisions.  We are not being too prescriptive, indicating that certain elements are out.  Clearly, each case will be considered on its own merits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It will happen when the Bill is signed into law.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We must bring forward regulations.  I am informed that we will consult the organisations, but it will happen as quickly as possible.  The Bill will be signed into law but, as with other primary legislation, will be implemented by way of regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask about the need to review the matter because it may not work out as we envisage.  What will happen if a doctor and pharmacist are husband and wife?  How will the Bill affect this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The same provisions apply, whether people are related.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The matter is covered.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is allowed for.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is covered in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Senator mean by &ldquo;it is allowed for&rdquo;?  We are certainly not prohibiting doctors from marrying pharmacists or <i>vice versa</i>.  The provisions apply in all situations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious that it can be difficult to trace companies.  People may own property in the name of a company.  Therefore, it could be difficult to trace who owns such a building.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, we are providing that a pharmacist has to be in charge of the corporate entity.  A supervising pharmacist must be in charge of each retail community pharmacy.  A person must also have overall responsibility for the chain for the reasons mentioned by the Senator such as the difficulties encountered in accessing corporate entities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we move from this amendment, I look for clarification.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments on commercial rent, but can the provision be evaded by an arrangement prior to taking up occupancy via key money?  The going rate for rent will be charged.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1302"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is difficult enough, but can the provision be got around with a demand for a substantial key money payment in advance of taking over the premises?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The society will have the power to deal with the issue.</P>

	<P>Are there any plans to review the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I could say yes; the standard answer is that there will be constant reviews.  The legislation has been awaited since 1875 and I know there were amendments in 1962.  We should be realistic, as these are significant new powers and we must allow them to take their course.  They will be broadly welcomed by both professions and certainly by the regulatory bodies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to discuss the definition of a retail pharmacy business.  Am I clear in understanding a retail pharmacy business will cover hospitals?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No.  We are not making hospitals retail pharmacy businesses.  What we are covering is a situation where hospitals supply drugs to outpatients, as happens with certain drugs.  A person has to come back to hospital for a certain anti-depressant drug called Clozaril, which requires the taking of a blood test every two weeks because it can be highly dangerous.  This can only be done in a hospital environment.  There are issues surrounding premises and the pharmacy in a hospital for which we are not legislating.  It will be a major task, probably to be dealt with in the next Bill or perhaps through the licensing regime we hope to introduce for hospitals.  A pharmacist practising anywhere is covered by the provisions of this legislation but we are not making hospital pharmacies into retail community pharmacies.  Somebody asked me the other evening if that was the case; we have had the issue clarified and it is definitely not the case.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to clarify that hospitals have two types of pharmacies.  For example, in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, there is a public&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The retail pharmacy will be covered in the normal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, but what of the hospital pharmacy?  Pharmacists who work for hospitals are concerned and it is important to allay their fears regarding matters of fitness to practise and the creation of the public pharmacy as a separate identity, as arranged by the hospital.  For example, it could be called St. James&rsquo;s Pharmacy and could be a limited company.  Is it the recommendation of the Minister to public hospitals that they should register their pharmacies separately?  There is a simple way to address the matter and to take hospital pharmacists&rsquo; concerns into account.</P>
        <P>I received a detailed submission that I will give to the Minister&rsquo;s officials.  The concerns put forward about fitness to practise and buildings in which to work are sincere and genuine and I want to ensure pharmacists are satisfied in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be honest.  I have a good and useful note and, rather than reading it, I will circulate it to Members.  It is our latest clarification.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that hospital pharmacists comprise an important group of professionals in the health care system.  They are highly qualified and, while I do not want to offend anyone, they earn much less than their retail counterparts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not deal with that this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have met most of their concerns about the legislation, but there are issues relating to premises.  Some of the hospital pharmacies I have seen are in pokey little places.  If there were basements, that is where they would be.  We are not addressing that issue in this legislation, but the jury is out on whether it should be dealt with in the second Bill or through the licensing regime for hospitals.  Everyone should have appropriate facilities.</P>
        <P>In terms of fitness to practise, the registration of the pharmacies and so on are required under this legislation.  I understand that the majority of pharmacists notify the society, but they must register with the society from now on.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1304"/>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to voice my concern to the Minister.  I welcome that these issues are being addressed by the Bill and that the Minister will deal further with hospital pharmacies and pharmacists in the second Bill.  She was right to say those pharmacists comprise an important group of professionals.  I can empathise with their belief that they have been forgotten in this debate because they are not the front or sexy end of the market.  Rather, they are behind closed doors.  If there were a basement in every hospital, the pharmacies would probably be found there instead of on the high street in big, shiny shops.  However, they do an important job in acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>Currently, 49 hospitals are registered.  Like Senator Henry, I ask the Minister to keep pressure on the Health Service Executive to ensure those hospitals are registered.  This must be done to ensure hospital pharmacists work within the remit of the Bill and within a safe parameter for everyone involved.  All pharmacists will be covered by this Bill, but I look forward to the second Bill.  Am I to understand that hospital pharmacists will be dealt with in this Bill in terms of fitness to practise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  As they supply drugs, they also fall under the same supply provisions as retail community pharmacies.  From now on, all hospital pharmacies must be registered.  I do not know how many of our 53 acute hospitals have pharmacy departments.  While 49 of the 53 hospitals are registered and there are other settings with pharmacy departments, all such places must be registered under the Bill.  I understand that the legal advice made available to us by hospital pharmacists in respect of these issues is the same as ours.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are taking a majority of amendments.  Will the Minister clarify whether there is a need for hospital pharmacists to register as retail pharmacy businesses and whether three years&rsquo; retail pharmacy experience is necessary for a hospital pharmacist?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It is important to have a career structure in the hospital pharmacy sector.  I understand that there are three levels.  One must have three years of experience to go from the basic level to the next level and five years to go from the basic level of the supervisory level.  I do not propose changing that good career structure.  Instead of 70 graduates, there will be 160.  This <Col N="1305"/>year, many pharmacists will qualify in Ireland and be available to the hospital sector and the pharmacy sector in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Are pharmacists in industry covered?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the matter of hospital pharmacists because there is a valid question to be raised.  On this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To address Senator Browne, spouses are specifically mentioned in the amendment.  In case the Senator is worried, we are not preventing them from marrying one another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to clarify something in the definitions in section 2(2), which states: &ldquo;References in this Act to the sale and supply or the sale or supply of a medicinal product include references to the keeping, preparing, compounding or dispensing of the medicinal product.&rdquo;  I have no difficulty with the provision in respect of preparing, compounding and dispensing, but what of carers who give medicines to people who do not have their whole faculties?  They are keeping medicines.  I am not trying to be awkward.  We are trying to maximise home help services.  Home helpers ensure that medicines are kept out of the reach of elderly persons, for example.</P>

	<P>No more than a parent would for a child.</P>

	<P>The word is &ldquo;keeping&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is storage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the context of pharmacists.  We are not regulating home carers through the pharmacy society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting that, but I have enough experience to know events that are never the intention of those who draft legislation can occur.  Before this legislation reaches the far end of the other House, I ask that the drafter be sure that he or she has not introduced a regulation to make life impossible for carers, home helpers and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I misunderstood.  I believed the Senator was suggesting that we should include those people.  Someone must be conducting a business within the meaning of the Act to fall under these provisions.  The people referred to by the Senator, whose opinion I share, would not be in that position.</P>
        <P>Recently, I was told by a medical officer in my Department that half the people on blood press<Col N="1306"/>ure tablets should not be and half of the people who should be on them are not.   It is a crazy statistic, but not just an Irish one.  We have a great deal to learn about medication.</P>

We have always looked for consistency in the naming of new bodies.  They should have an official title in Irish.  This is not a question of play-acting.  In cases of conflict, the authoritative version of the basic document of this nation, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, is the Irish language version.  A good case can be made for including the Irish language in legislation in this way.  When uncertainty exists, the Supreme Court is bound by the Irish language version of the Constitution.  A thick document that describes the anomalies between the English and Irish versions of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann has been published.  I have suggested that the official title of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland under this legislation should be Cumann C&oacute;gaiseoir&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.  Similar provisions have been <Col N="1307"/>made when many other agencies have been established.  I will not argue the point with the Minister.  If she wants to refer it to the official translators, she can do so.  I have outlined the principle that underpins this amendment.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 10, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 34, after &ldquo;promote&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and ensure&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is probably a quibble, but I am good at them.  Section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill states that one of the principal functions of the society will be &ldquo;to promote a high standard of education and training for persons seeking to become pharmacists&rdquo;.  I think the society will have to do more than that.  It will not simply promote high standards in the education of pharmacists; it will have a regulatory function to ensure that standards are maintained.  I propose that the society will have &ldquo;to promote and ensure a high standard of education&rdquo;.  In the case of engineering, which is my own profession, the role of Engineers Ireland in the accreditation of engineering degrees is not just to try to encourage people to be accredited, but also to choose a standard which people must meet before they can say they have been recognised as an engineer in this State.  It is a question of ensuring that standards are upheld, as well as promoting those standards.  I will not argue about the word, but I think the point needs to be made.</P>

	<P>When somebody told me an organisation intended to make me an honorary fellow, I thought I should get rid of its power to do so as quickly as possible.  That is a joke.  The society no longer wants to have that power.  I did not have a problem with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Minister&rsquo;s wariness about allowing a body with such an important regulatory function to confer honorary fellowships.  It would be a good idea only if the fellowships amounted to no more than titles.  I have heard stories over the years about people finding back doors into various bodies.  It is obvious that none of the stories is entirely verifiable.  It seems to me that a good case can be made for clarifying precisely what honorary fellowships might mean if they are to be allowed.  They should not allow people to practise as pharmacists or imply that such people have some experience in the pharmacy sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>All right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I would be very happy to accept such an award if it entitled me to work in this area.  I do not think it would bestow such benefits on me, however.  I will speak to the representatives of the society.  I have been informed that a major amendment would be required.  If that is the case, we might not be able to include a provision of this nature.  I will return to the matter on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is quite right in the way she uses her honorary doctorates.  Some people include them in their references to their qualifications.  There was a time when doctors of philosophy, for example, did not use the title of &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; other than when they were working in academia or something like that.  There are doctors and professors in many spheres.  I would not like people to start calling themselves &ldquo;fellows&rdquo; for the sake of aggrandisement.  I am aware that the society has given honorary fellowships as accolades to those who have helped the pharmacy sector.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)(a)(ii)</i>, the Society&rsquo;s duty under that provision shall include determining and applying criteria for registration which require compliance with any codes of conduct drawn up for pharmacists and undertakings to comply with such codes.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I think there is a need for a clearer and more explicit statement of the need for codes of conduct to apply to the profession.  I accept that such codes are mentioned earlier in this section, but the reference should be somewhat more explicit.  The determination of codes of conduct should be a clear part of the functions of the society.  Section 7(2)(<i>a</i>)(iii) states that one of the duties of the society will be to &ldquo;draw up codes of conduct for pharmacists&rdquo;.  I propose not only that such codes be &ldquo;drawn up for pharmacists and undertakings&rdquo; but also that those who will be bound by them will have to &ldquo;comply&rdquo; with them.  I am somewhat wary of voluntary codes of conduct.  I am well aware of the glorious joys of the operation of the drinks industry&rsquo;s voluntary code of conduct in relation to the advertising of alcoholic drinks.  I do not suggest that there are any similarities between the two industries.  Codes of conduct should be enforceable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The codes will not be voluntary.  Section 12 outlines the manner in which codes of conduct will be given effect.

Is it consistent with natural justice to be able to punish a person without the holding of an inquiry?  That is the only question I have on this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised it is in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>For what it is worth, I record that I do not believe it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person knowingly contravenes a provision of a code or makes a declaration or disclosure to the society that is false and is proven subsequently to be false or misleading, what sanctions are in place to address that, or will such a contravention be deemed an offence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an offence under the Act to give false or misleading information.  It is probably dealt with under failure to comply with regulations under section 18.  </P>
        <P>I wish to seek clarification on the point made by Senator Ryan about it being possible to strike a person off the register without the holding of an inquiry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the point raised by Senator Ryan, from my experience of having been a member of the Medical Council, in regard to mediation or in the case of the Medical Council where there is a health committee, such a practitioner would not go before a fitness to practise committee but yet there would be genuine concerns about his or her practice which would render restrictions being imposed.  In the case of a pharmacist, that might also follow suit.  Is there provision for the establishment of a health committee for pharmacists?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case I would agree with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1312"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides for this in a case where, for example, a pharmacist would agree to a different process such as mediation rather than going before the fitness to practise committee.  It provides for this as a result of the outcome of such a process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The section provides that &ldquo;The Minister may, by order (<i>a</i>) confer on the Society such additional functions, connected with those which it has, (<i>b</i>) make such provision ...&rdquo;.  There is no suggestion of consultation with the public or with the society.  Perhaps I missed such a provision but as the section stands it provides that the Minister may by order confer additional functions.  Much of this legislation is about transparency and providing for major improvement in that respect.  Given that the attitude of the profession has been positive about the need for transparency, it seems extraordinary there would not be some process of consultation with the society and with the public in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is understood.  I note it is not explicitly stated and perhaps I can consider that for Report Stage.  It is clearly understood that one would not send the society notice of a set of additional functions without having consulted and spoken to its members, checking if there is the necessary capacity and other related issues. </P>

There is a great deal of learning by doing and problem-based learning which seems, for a profession such as pharmacy or many other professions, an ideal and better way of learning.  If we want to try new ways, we should not let legislation stand in the way of it.  If that is what this provision means, I would welcome it.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

	<P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, and 18 are related to amendment No. 10 and amendment No. 14 is an alternative to amendments Nos. 13 and 15.  Therefore, amendments No. 10 to 15, inclusive and 18 may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 10:   </P>
	<P Just="Left" LI="1">In page 12, subsection (2), lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or elected as set out in <i>subsection (3)</i>&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1314"/>
	<P FLI="0">We are discussing a number of amendments together. The Labour Party is unhappy with the fact that it is the Minister who appoints the council. The council should be appointed by following the legislation. That is the reason we suggest in amendment No. 10 that the council shall consist of 21 persons appointed or elected as set out in subsection (3). It is a self-governing profession to a considerable extent and I invite the Minister to examine another way of establishing the council other than the Minister being the appointer of the members. I believe that was included by accident. Some other people who have read the Bill, although they are not in the profession, see this as a sinister attempt to take over but I do not believe that is the case. The Minister has enough to do without taking over the pharmaceutical profession. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not like the idea of the members of the council being appointed by the Minister and I would like her to examine the suggestion in our amendment.</P>
        <P>Our other amendment concerns the members of the society.  It must be clear that the nine members must be elected and not selected by the council.  The section provides that the council shall consist of nine members of the society who have been selected by its members but it ought to state who have been elected by its members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the nine members, if that needs to be clarified, we must clarify it.  It is the intention that they will be elected.  In the event of only nine people putting themselves forward, obviously there would not be an election but I envisage more than nine will come forward.  There is a good deal of interest in being involved with the society.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue of appointment by the Minister, that issue arose with the medical practitioners.  We have a consistent approach whereby all regulatory bodies are appointed by the Minister.  It is not the intention that the Minister would not accept the nine candidates put forward.  I have given an undertaking that I will make that clear in the Medical Council legislation because some people were saying that if the Minister does not like the doctors elected, she will pick her own.  That is not the case.  It is automatic.  Everybody will be appointed on the same basis and hopefully on the same day.  It is to be consistent with all other regulatory bodies that we are doing it in this way.  If there is any concern that the Minister would not appoint the people put forward by the society, I am happy to clarify that is not the intention.</P>
        <P>On the question of  the election of members, we will bring forward an amendment to clarify that it will be by election rather than selection.  If only nine candidates come forward, I suppose it would still be an election.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1315"/>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make two points.  It is unfortunate the legislation does not specify that representatives of patient advocacy groups will be included on the council.  I have been involved with the group MRSA and Families which has done great work in promoting awareness of MRSA.  It is important to acknowledge the role of the public and the patient advocacy groups and this could be specified in the legislation.</P>
        <P>Members of the Oireachtas are debarred from being on such councils and this is the worst form of inequality but it does not appear to arise in this case.  I am not suggesting Members should be on the council but neither should we be automatically debarred.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether Members are entitled to be members of the council.  I reiterate that I am not seeking to be nominated to the body.  At times it appears to be an offence to be a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Serving Members of the Oireachtas may not be members of the council of the society.  I have strong opinions on this issue because I regard it as a conflict for a Member of the Oireachtas to be a member of a society.  The first duty of a member of a society is to that society, whether that is the Medical Council or any other regulatory body and therefore the Schedule of the Act precludes Members of the Oireachtas from being members.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to define patient groups as there are many of them and there is not a single group known as the patients&rsquo; organisation which could then be written into legislation.  The many different groups include Patient Focus, the Patients&rsquo; Association, the group referred to by the Senator and a number of other groups including that focusing on organ retention.  Those representing the wider public interest as opposed to the professional or educational interest have a role to play in these regulatory bodies.  It would be the intention to appoint people with a particular perspective which they could bring to regulation which is being done in the public interest.  This legislation is a regulation in the public interest and to protect patients and it is also to support the profession by having good and appropriate regulation and high standards of professionalism which is underlined in everything we seek to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Knowing that the Minister desired to have lay majorities on all the professional councils, I wish to inform her that the Medical Practitioners Bill does not have a provision for a lay majority on the Medical Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was an oversight on my part which I knew the Senator would notice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge it has been rapidly rectified.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with a lay majority.  However, during the passage of the<b> </b>Veterinary <Col N="1316"/>Practice Bill it was discussed that one can run short of professionals to put on each of a number of committees.  Even if committee membership is reduced to five members, which is a minimum number for any committee, a body will have run out of professionals by the time four committees have been set up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify the position for the Senator, it is the case with both this Bill and the Medical Practitioners Bill that a person does not need to be a member of the council to be on a committee.  Members may be recruited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wished to have that clarified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The burden on members of a council such as this and the Medical Council, of which Senator Feeney has experience, is such that it is almost impossible to find either professional or lay people to participate.  It was stated to me recently that no private sector employer would grant an employee time off to participate in some of these regulatory bodies because a fitness to practise hearing can run for quite a length of time.  The power is being given to the society to recruit to committees people who are not on the council and this affords the kind of flexibility to fulfil their functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the issue.  It is a pity pharmacists who may have doctoral and bachelor of science degrees could be appointed but those with the qualification of MPSI cannot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On this council?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They could be appointed by one of the nominees but they are not specified in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not specified but I think they could be appointed.  The Minister might have more pharmacists appointed than she thinks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I may have misunderstood the Senator.  I thought the Senator was suggesting that the Bill should specify a medical practitioner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The Bill states that a medical practitioner may be appointed to the health committee but I had not seen that one could appoint pharmacists to other committees, but it is obvious one can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator mean appointed to the Medical Council?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I mean the proposals in this Bill.  I was concerned that with there being only nine pharmacists, unless pharmacists with bach<Col N="1317"/>elor of science degrees or doctoral degrees were appointed who were nominated by the various groups&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They can be recruited onto the committees by the society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am clear about that proposal now. </P>
        <P>I was unenthusiastic about the nine members being selected.  My amendment No. 18 is a thoughtful contribution and helped by the Bills Office is a transposition of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan&rsquo;s and my methods of getting people elected to the first and subsequent veterinary councils and it has been considered by the vets as being successful.  She and I put a lot of time and thought into that proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reflect on the Senator&rsquo;s amendment No. 18 and introduce a Government amendment to specify all those points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear that.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan will be pleased.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been informed by the Senator&rsquo;s very good amendment and we just need to clear it legally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to make it clear that such members are elected even if there are only nine because the word &ldquo;selected&rdquo; is not the ideal word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stated she is of the opinion that Oireachtas Members should be debarred from membership.  I do not like a blanket ban and would prefer if people were considered on an individual basis.  Senator Henry has a wealth of experience in the medical world which is not matched by any of us and Senator Feeney has a wealth of experience from the Medical Council.  I am always concerned by these rules of general exclusion because the House likes to see equality observed.  If an existing member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland were elected in a future election to either House, would he or she be required to step down?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a member in the other House and he is a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>But what if he or she is already a member of the council?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>He or she would be required to vacate the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be a case of declaring an interest and continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point made by Senator Browne, I am such a person in so far as I was not <Col N="1318"/>a Senator when I was appointed to the Medical Council in 1999.  I was elected to the Seanad in 2002.  My position was unique in that I was on the fitness to practise inquiry hearing into Dr. Michael Neary.  This was an ongoing inquiry which had been running for 18 months.  For practical and financial reasons and to accommodate both Dr. Neary and the patients involved, it was decided that I would remain on the council until the end of that inquiry.  I agree with the Minister that there were times when as a Member of the Oireachtas I felt a little unwelcome in Lynn House, particularly during discussion of the Medical Practitioners Bill and I would have hand, act and part in the passing of that legislation.  No one person in particular made me feel uncomfortable but it was a communal effort that made me feel a little uncomfortable at times.</P>
        <P>To refer to Senator Browne&rsquo;s point, I am glad neither this legislation nor the Medical Practitioners Bill prohibits members of a local authority from being members.  People from a community who have been elected to a local council have something to offer.  From my own experience I do not believe it would work out successfully to have a Member of the Oireachtas as a member.  I was perceived as being very close to the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin and whether that was a right or a wrong perception, I felt a little uncomfortable at times as a result.</P>

        <P FLI="0">All I have ever asked for is consistency on the issue of a gender balance.  I do not have an enormous issue with it, but governments insist on it in some places but not in others.  The teaching staff in my place of work at CIT elect two members to the board of governors.  We are instructed that one of them must be female.  When this was first mooted, about 85% of the staff were male and it was difficult to find a woman who wanted to do it.  However, it was public policy.  If we believe it is appropriate, we should either make it universal or drop it.  The suggestion in the amendment is that not less than 40% of the members of a body should be men and not less than 40% should be women, the joke being about what to do with the other 20%.</P><Col N="1320"/>
        <P>There should be an attempt made at striking a gender balance.  Many of these professions are dominated by men.  About 80% of the INTO membership are female, but not the executive.  I am not sure it is enough to say women who are able will rise to the top.  Conflicting demands impose more on women than on men.  If institutional space is not created for them, these conflicting demands will not be met.  If 40% of a body&rsquo;s membership are women, it will have a willingness to respond to the extra demands placed on women owing to domestic circumstances and so on.  If there is no significant presence of women on the board of a body, the minority of women will have to put up with the male way of doing things.</P>

	<P>This amendment is worthwhile.  It is worthwhile promoting the involvement of women in their professional bodies.  Sometimes they can be easier to deal with than men.  I saw the figures for the political parties which have put forward candidates for the election to the D&aacute;il and the Minister&rsquo;s party has done very well, as has the Labour Party.  However, other parties have not done as well.  It is worthwhile promoting the involvement of women.  They will not get there, unless there is encouragement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a strong fan of encouraging women to take up decision-making positions.  If this was a council onto which the Minister was appointing all the members, I would probably accept the amendment.  However, the members of the society will elect nine persons and it would be very prescriptive to tell them that four of them should be women.  There are six Senators in this House representing the universities, only one of whom is female.</P>

	<P>If we were to say to the universities that 40% of their candidates for seats in the Seanad had to be women, I do not know which of the male Senators here would have to give way.  Half of the D&aacute;il Deputies in my party are female.</P>
        <P>I attend many health care conferences and there has been a complete transformation from my last job when I would look across the room to see if any woman was in the place.  The opposite is now often the case because the health profession is dominated by women.  I recently visited UCD where about 80% of the members of the medical society are female.  That is the future.  I do not know what is happening in pharmacy.</P>

	<P>Much of it has to do with the points system.  We all acknowledge that women are brighter than men.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be pragmatic and sensible.  The argument was made when I brought forward the HIQA Bill that 70% of the members of the board would end up being female by virtue of the positions they held.  Being over-prescriptive is not the way to go.  I was in Norway last week.  Eight of the 17 Ministers are female owing to the quota system.  Therefore, a woman in the Norwegian Parliament has a great chance of becoming a Minister, as there is almost always a position in the Cabinet.  There are wider cultural and societal issues as to why trade union representatives are often male in professions dominated by women.  I am sure Mr. Liam Doran will not mind me mentioning the fact that he is secretary general of the Irish Nurses Organisation.  Mr. Des Kavanagh is general  secretary of the Irish Psychiatric Nursing Association.  Women are in the majority in the electorate for these roles.  In appointing members it would be my intention to strike a good gender balance in so far as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Minister a question about section 10 that also relates to the Schedule.  The duty of confidentiality of council members is clear.  As an advocate of freedom of information, I am not happy about the idea that anything declared to be confidential must be confidential.  Having said that, there is a clear obligation in respect of confidentiality.  Will the Minister clarify that the person nominated by the Irish Medicines Board and the person nominated by the HSE will be bound by the same confidentiality clause and will not be able to report back to the Irish Medicines Board or the HSE on their activities?  I asked this question on a previous occasion about another Bill and the relevant Minister said they could so report.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Civil servants are appointed to boards of public bodies which apply a confidentiality clause.  Does that clause apply to them?  There should be no exceptions.  If we are to have a lay majority, it must be clear that their first commitment is to the success and proper running of the council.  I would welcome it if the Minister would state those two people will be bound by the same confidentiality regulations as everyone else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Ryan.  However, it was normally the non-professional person on the board of which I was a member who insisted on maintaining confidentiality.  The <Col N="1322"/>tendency to leak information always gives rise to problems.  It is normally the professionals on boards, rather than lay members or those representing particular interest groups, who are most guilty of leaking information.  I agree with the Senator that confidentiality is extremely important, particularly in the case of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland or the Irish Medical Council.  However, I do not know what we can do to ensure the confidentiality provisions will be so tight that leaks will not emerge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>When things began to go wrong for the former blood transfusion board, the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s representative on it was severely criticised because, as far as I recall, she maintained confidentiality.  People on various boards and those at the HSE have a difficult task at times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Henry is correct.  During some of the inquiries under company law, great criticism was also levelled when members of the Central Bank did not report to Revenue.  The confidentiality clause will apply to everyone.  As stated in the section, however, it will not prohibit the making of reports to Ministers or whatever body to which the council might agree to make such a report.  Confidentiality is paramount.  Those on the council will not be present to represent the bodies of which they are members; they will be there because of the wider perspective they can bring.  If a members believes there is anything untoward happening which should be brought to public attention, he or she would either be obliged to obtain the agreement of the council to release information in respect of it or resign.</P>
        <P>As I stated on Second Stage, many asked me about the recent practitioners inquiry.  When I informed them that I did not have a clue about what was happening, they were astonished.  I have no right to know what is going on because confidentiality applies.</P>
        <P>There have been breaches of confidentiality across a host of areas in recent years.  The essence of a professional &mdash; be he or she a doctor, pharmacist, lawyer, politician or Minister &mdash; is that he or she should be able to maintain confidentiality.  When I am asked to address schoolchildren, I am occasionally asked what advice I would give them.  My reply is often that it is important to be somebody who can be trusted.  I provide them with the example that if one tells one&rsquo;s best friend something and he or she betrays one&rsquo;s confidence, one will never trust him or her again.  The same applies in respect of professionals.  If one went to a doctor and discovered later that he or she had told someone else about one&rsquo;s health, one would naturally be furious as a result of this major breach of the doctor-patient relationship and the lapse in his or her professionalism.  One would never return to that doctor&rsquo;s surgery.  The same applies to many other professionals.</P><Col N="1323"/>
        <P>Those who will sit on the council will be bound by the same confidentiality rules, regardless of whether they are nominated by the HSE or the Irish Medicines Board or elected by the society.  Their duty will be to the society in the first instance.  The only opportunity they will have to bring matters to the attention of others will be through formal reports or a decision to be communicated by letter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe in blanket confidentiality clauses.  I am of the view that the basic principle regarding the exemptions which apply to freedom of information is that people should do their business in public, except where it needs to be done in private.  This would enable those who have legitimate professional concerns of the type to which Senator Henry referred in respect of the blood transfusion board to raise them with the body by which they were appointed.  Blanket confidentiality is an attempt to silence lay people.  Many public servants on boards to a degree feel entitled to discuss with their managements matters about which the other members are unaware.  On previous occasions when discussing similar confidentiality clauses with other Ministers, I was informed that civil servants must be in a position to inform their Departments about what they are doing on particular boards.  My view is that the law states they cannot do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are different situations.  I am not providing in the legislation or in the Medical Practitioners Bill that there will be a representative of the Minister on the council.  I gave consideration to that matter but ruled it out because, as is the case with other bodies, he or she would be there to represent the Minister.  In my previous job the Minister had representatives on different boards and they reported to the Minister.  The situation to which I refer is different from that which applies in this instance.  The members of the council will not be representing the HSE or the IMB; they will be there in their own right by virtue of either their election, if they are members of the society, or their nomination.  Their duty will be to the society.</P>
        <P>At the press conference to launch the Bill I was asked why the council&rsquo;s meetings could not be held in public.  Journalists would love everything to be held in public in order that they might report on matters of this nature.  However, we must be pragmatic and sensible.  Organisations must be able to do business in private.  Could anyone run a business if all meetings involving boards of directors had to be held in public?  Would it be possible to run political parties in such circumstances?  We must be sensible in the way we legislate in these areas.  We are discussing a regulatory body with enormous powers which will be in a position to effectively end people&rsquo;s careers and withdraw from them their livelihoods.  The society must be able to operate in a pro<Col N="1324"/>fessional way.  We must be able to trust it and have confidence in those who will serve on it.  I have no reason not to trust those individuals.</P>
        <P>The society was handicapped because it was obliged to operate under extremely archaic legislation.  As stated on a number of occasions, effectively there was no fitness to practise regime in place for pharmacists in Ireland.  The Bill will provide the society with a modern regulatory framework and greatly enhance its authority and power to be able to intervene and initiate proceedings in the interests of both patients and the profession.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Minister is concerned about in this section and agree with her.  I refer to the idea that a body such as the council might use its powers to restrict entry to the profession.  We are aware of at least one, if not two professions, that have done a remarkable job for 80 or 90 years.  I look forward to the day when legislation stating the membership of the Bar Council will be appointed by the Minister will be introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

	<P>If the Competition Authority is dissatisfied with the code of conduct, will the matter <Col N="1325"/>ultimately be resolved by the council noting that fact and publicising it or do the authority&rsquo;s powers extend to being able to pursue the matter further?  Will the authority be in a position to use its powers to change the code of conduct?  Will there merely be a procedure that will involve the issuing of a notification to the effect that the authority is not satisfied with some aspect of the code of conduct?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>I am wary of the Competition Authority.  Some of its recent rulings have been quite daft.  For instance, that the Health Service Executive cannot negotiate with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is daft.  It will place an enormous burden on the HSE and will not achieve anything in terms of value for money, either for the State or for consumers.  However, that is a separate day&rsquo;s discussion.</P>
        <P>Is there a residual power?  What will happen afterwards?  Will the Competition Authority effectively be able to pursue the council to change these?  They can still publish and operate them.  I take it the Minister understands my point.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate an earlier point about the need to review.  The council will publish the code of conduct and lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas, but I wonder could we insert a review on the operation of it on a two or three-year basis.  Like much legislation which comes before this House, we all get enthusiastic and think it will work brilliantly and, unfortunately, a few months or years later, it may not work out exactly as planned.  It would be helpful if a review was built into the legislation to allow all interested parties monitor and learn whether it is working as we and other bodies planned initially.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On reviews, I stated earlier that I have an ambition, following the general election when I hope to return to the Department of Health and Children, to establish in this Department &mdash; my officials are probably having heart attacks behind me &mdash; what we did in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment where we put a group together to examine company law and report every other year stating the need to modernise in certain areas, to do the work and, therefore, make the legislation easy.</P>
        <P>On regulation, when we get the nurses and midwives modern legislation in place &mdash; the relevant legislation is 20 years old &mdash; and the dentists legislation, it would be no harm to have a group representing the different regulatory bodies who would look at it from time to time so that we do not wait.  In the case of the Medical Practitioners Act, the legislation dates from 1978.  In this case, the Acts date from 1875 and 1962, which is crazy.  The nurses legislation is 20 years old, which is not so bad, but still a great deal has changed.  We must have a more frequent way of being able to change and modernise legislation, and that would be a good day&rsquo;s work.</P><Col N="1326"/>
        <P>The code of conduct must have the consent of the Minister.  The Minister must have the view of the Competition Authority and, therefore, it would be open to the Minister to state that he or she would not consent if he or she felt what was being suggested was not reasonable.</P>
        <P>For clarity and accuracy, I say to Senator Ryan that when the negotiations were under way, it was the legal representative of the IPU who brought to the attention of the negotiators their legal advice that stated that the wholesalers cannot negotiate with us because it affects them as a third party.  It was not the Competition Authority who highlighted that we must stop here.  It was the lawyers for the IPU.  When the Attorney General and the HSE&rsquo;s lawyers got it &mdash; I remember getting the advice of the Attorney General &mdash; they all agreed that the IPU was correct.  That is what happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was because of previous activity by the Competition Authority <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> actors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to competition law and is about price fixing.  Clearly, we can negotiate the contract, what is included in the contract, the level of service, etc. and then there must be an objective adjudication of the price.  I believe the mechanism being put in place can resolve the issue.  It is a matter of being pragmatic and sensible, but clearly we cannot be in breach of the law.</P>
        <P>The intention obviously would be that the code would be examined by the Competition Authority.  The views of the Competition Authority, if it has views, would be attached when the Minister was consenting or, obviously, not consenting.  The only reason the Minister would not consent is if there were something in the Competition Authority&rsquo;s view which the Minister felt was reasonable and which would lead to a period of discussion, or whatever, with the society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="1327"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is open to any Member of this House, including a Member of the Opposition, to table a Bill to amend any law if there is a deficiency in legislation.  It rarely happens because generally legislation is made by Government for the good reason that it has available expertise and assistance and it has the majority to get legislation through.  However, I do not want to be so prescriptive as to write into the Bill that every three years we will review this, that and the other merely for the sake of it, and have endless meetings of individuals and professionals going through a process that could be meaningless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to the Minister, following the previous general election, and no doubt the same will be the case following the next general election, there was a turnover of over one third of the Houses of the Oireachtas between Members retiring, Members who, unfortunately, will not get re-elected and new Members being elected.  I speak not of a review every few years but that we agree to even one review.  The Minister has admitted this is major legislation involving major changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Browne speaking of a review of the code or a review of the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>A review of the Bill and, I suppose, the code of conduct is linked into it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The code could be reviewed every year.  There is nothing in this Bill that prevents the society from changing or reviewing its code on an ongoing basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I make is that the Minister has admitted that it has taken many years for this Bill to come about in the first place, and no doubt her intentions are honourable in so far as she would, if she were re-elected and reappointed Minister for Health and Children, do as she stated.  The danger is that she might not be reappointed as Minister and there could be a new Minister in place.  In life, change is guaranteed.  The danger is that a review could be lost in the process and not take place by 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt it.  There is an advantage in providing on Report Stage an option of reviewing the entire procedure approximately three years from the date of enactment of the Bill.  As it is major legislation, we would do everyone a service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how workable Senator Browne&rsquo;s proposal would be.  From the Medical Council&rsquo;s point of view, every time there was a query over something, the 27 year old legislation concerned would be taken out and read, and one was working continually on the legis<Col N="1328"/>lation in place.  It would be almost negative to provide in the Bill for a review in three years&rsquo; time because one would not have determined all the workings of the Bill in that period.

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, lines 27 to 32, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Council shall publish each register within 12 months of the setting up of the register and thereafter at intervals of not more than 12 months.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister has addressed this in amendment No. 21.  She must have decided to share my anxieties.  There is a vast trade in illegally prescribed drugs and it is depressing to learn of the amount of legalised drugs traded between drug addicts &mdash; analgesics, various anziolectics, steroids and the like.  My concern was putting too much information on the Internet.  Security lapses occur all too easily and such substances could be found too easily if a person were a keyholder for a pharmacy, for example.  There would be a security risk for the person involved and also a risk to the security of the drugs.</P>
        <P>I note that the Minister has provided, in amendment 21, that the duty should not extend to the home addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, etc.  I would be grateful if I knew she had asked the Garda Commissioner about this because he gave a speech the other day about draft advice on security in pharmacies because it is a significant problem.  I do not know that people really need that information on the Internet.  It can be published somewhere but one would like to know who was looking at the information.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider my point about the Internet.  It is that which concerns me because it provides easy access to anyone to get a fair bit of information about someone who is in a position in which he or she has the security of supplies and the security of himself or herself and his or her family, to consider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Henry&rsquo;s concerns on that and especially her last point.  They are in a position where they are housing drugs and cash.  We live in a security conscious era.  Even from a lesser point of view, Senators Henry, Browne and I have been receiving mail over the past two <Col N="1329"/>weeks from a certain Irish lobby group regarding the Medical Practitioners Bill 2007.  I am glad the mail is being sent to my business address because when I was on the Medical Council, that kind of correspondence was sent to my home, along with nasty telephone calls, and it was not nice.  There was no risk to my life at the time but the life of a pharmacist could be put at risk in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the views expressed by the Senators.  The amendment seeks to ensure that home and e-mail addresses and telephone numbers will not be included.  That is important.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Medical Council, I am apparently going to overrule the Constitution with the Medical Practitioners Bill, such is the power I am giving myself.  I have seen some of the correspondence to which Senator Feeney referred and there is no doubt that in the modern era, even without the Internet, people can dispense products such as drugs which can be very dangerous if taken in the wrong circumstances.  They are vulnerable and we must ensure that open and transparent processes are in place for the council while not going so far that we aid and abet people in activities which are not helpful.  My amendment gives the society the power to protect the security and privacy of individuals when deciding what is to be disclosed.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(3) The duties imposed by <i>subsections (1)(e) </i>and <i>(2)</i> do not extend to the home addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of individuals and to such other similar information about them as the Council considers should, in the interests of the security and privacy of those individuals, not be disclosed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister on the potential threat to the safety of pharmacists where too much information is disclosed and on the related issue of Internet sales of drugs.  We have given the Garda and the Minister the right to oblige all companies to retain their records of traffic for three years.  Every piece of spam concerning the Internet sale of drugs that lands in my in-box is in the possession of the authorities.  The tedious job that is now required is tracking the sources of spam and demanding that whoever is making the offers be prosecuted by the authorities of the country in which he or she resides.  There is no simple solution other than to pursue those who offer me God knows what medications at bargain prices.  Our authorities should demand that either the ISP being used to send the e-mail or the auth<Col N="1330"/>orities of the relevant jurisdiction deal with the offers.</P>
        <P>The ability to purchase cheap drugs of dangerously bad quality over the Internet is going to become a significant threat to public health.  It is already a major issue in countries less enlightened than our own, where people must pay large sums for necessary drugs.  The fact that we have a fairly sensible drug payment assistance scheme is probably a guarantee that we will not follow that route.  People in other countries are not buying these drugs for reasons of addiction but because they cannot afford the drugs prescribed for them.  More vigour is needed on the part of our authorities in terms of finding out where the offers of cheap drugs are being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The sale of drugs by mail order is prohibited in Ireland.  The issue arises with regard to procuring products over the Internet from sites outside the country.  The Irish Medicines Board has reported to agencies and authorities in other countries and some sites have been closed down.  The board has considerable powers, in so far as modern communications networks allow power in any single jurisdiction, and can communicate with enforcement agencies in other places with a view to having them take action on sites which sell in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Controlling the Internet is a global challenge.  People in certain places in the world do not care who locates there.  The challenge arises not only in respect of medicine and drug sales but also in several other areas.  I commend, for example, the wonderful work that has been done by enforcement agencies on child protection issues.  It is encouraging that authorities in Europe and the United States have worked together to bring successful prosecutions, but we have a long way to go to ensure the Internet is used in a positive manner.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(ii), line 26, after &ldquo;state&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in the State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I tabled this amendment because it appeared that if a person from outside the State was convicted in another State of an offence, the nature of which in the opinion of the council had a bearing on the person&rsquo;s fitness to practice, he or she would not be allowed to practice.  However, it appears that a person is not excluded if he or she commits a crime in this State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised by the Senator is addressed by section 14(1)(<i>d</i>), which is all-encompassing.  The paragraph states: &ldquo;satisfies the <Col N="1331"/>Council that the person is fit to be a registered pharmacist.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>As long as it is all right.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I may have worded incorrectly a question I asked yesterday on existing pharmacists who lack the requisite qualifications.  Section 14 requires that a pharmacist hold a qualification appropriate for his or her practice.  I may have inadvertently claimed that hospital pharmacists are not qualified, which I certainly did not mean to imply, and I apologise for that mistake.  I was trying to point out that the hospital and retail pharmacy sectors may employ people who have practised for many years and possess good records but who may hold different qualifications from modern pharmacists.  How will such people be dealt with under the legislation?  I presume they will be allowed to continue practising for as long as they wish.  In her conclusion to yesterday&rsquo;s debate,  the Minister acknowledged their role in the pharmaceutical trade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the conditions set out in section 14 is that a person must satisfy the council that he or she is fit to be a registered pharmacist.  That condition is additional to the requirements on qualifications.  Does the council have to observe the tenets of the Equal Status Act 2000 in its determination of whether a person is fit to practise?  I am simply trying to understand the meaning of this provision.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service will not accept blood donations from gay men simply because of their sexual orientation, which is of considerable annoyance to many gay men who know they are in perfect health.  What is to prevent the council from deciding that having gay men working as pharmacists is too great a risk to take?  Does the Equal Status Act apply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  I did not understand the point the Deputy was making.  Clearly, the role of the society is to make sure the person who registers has the qualifications to practise pharmacy but their sexual orientation, marital status or political or religious beliefs are irrelevant.  The Equal Status Act 2000 applies across the board in this State and one cannot be discriminated against.</P>
        <P>The Senator raised a valid issue relating to blood, which Senator Norris asked me to examine two weeks ago.  I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with the Blood Transfusion Service <Col N="1332"/>Board.  The quality of the blood is paramount, as was highlighted by members of the hemochromatosis group.  I recently met four sufferers, even though it is a very rare disease.  They receive the highest quality blood and that is not accepted.  Recently, I appointed a member of the voluntary group that represents them on the BTSB.  She has come together with a group of patients who have a blood-related issue and given that the service is about blood, I appointed this lady to see if she could use her powers of persuasion on the board.  This is a not a matter for the Minister because the board is an independent body and it is appropriate that its members make decisions based on expertise.  However, the quality of the blood is paramount and I intend to examine this issue in consultation with my Department and the BTSB.  Senator Norris attended a function recently during when he announced that of the 100 people present, 15 were gay.  I was told by somebody in attendance that everybody was looking at each other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He does worse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the law of averages, some pharmacists are gay but their sexual orientation does not matter.  If they are able to do the job, the only concern is their qualifications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As it should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Their sexual orientation cannot be an issue.  They would have a great case if it was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the section, the linguistic competence of nationals of other states is mentioned.  Who will decide whether they are competent because there is no question of an examination being undertaken?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The society decides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Linguistic competence is an increasing problem in our health service.  For example, the linguistic ability of many nurses is not quite what it should be.  I was asked by a nursing home, which had a problem recruiting staff from the Philippines, if I could try to point out to the recruits that they would be dealing with people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s.  However, Poles who spoke no English had grave trouble communicating with patients who had serious trouble understanding anything.  While the society will make decisions in this regard, will it be given guidance?  Filling drug prescriptions and explaining how they should be taken is a serious business.  This is again a public safety issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the section, a citizen of the State or another EU member state does not have to satisfy the linguistic test.  Only non-EEA citizens will have to satisfy the council they have the linguistic competence.  Does that mean, for example, somebody from Nigeria who speaks <Col N="1333"/>reasonably good English would have to undertake a linguistic test while somebody from Hungary, which is an accession state, would not?  Is there a provision to preclude a citizen of Hungary, for example, who has the relevant qualifications and experience from working as a pharmacist in this State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne referred to the qualifications issue.  Anyone who is registered under the current legislation can continue to practise and I am advised there is no issue regarding their qualifications.</P>
        <P>The society, not the Minister, will decide the linguistic competency of an individual.  I am sure the society will learn from the experience of other organisations such as An Bord Altranais and so on.  International standards apply and our standard is higher than in many other countries.</P>
        <P>Citizens of EU member states and EEA countries who are pharmacists must register and they will have a period within which they must fulfil the language competency.  Citizens of non-EEA countries will only be registered when they fulfil both the language and qualifications requirements.  That will be a matter for the society.  I have not discussed this issue with the society but I presume it will inform itself regarding what happens in other organisations such as An Bord Altranais.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry made a valid point about how distressing it is to try to establish what is wrong with a loved one when they have lost the power of speech following a stroke and so on.  A number of years ago I visited a patient in a Dublin hospital and a Chinese woman was also a patient on the ward.  Nobody spoke Chinese and she was clearly very distressed.  It was an awful experience to observe this, although the nurses were very helpful and doctors were called but it was impossible.  Aside from the need for health care professionals to be competent in English, given that the State is reliant on foreign nurses, more and more patients are from outside the State and some of them cannot communicate in English.  This is a major issue and we are trying to be as practical as possible.  The HSE provides translation services in certain situations, which is important.</P>
        <P>With regard to the dispensing of drugs, I am always amazed pharmacists can read a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.  I have not had a clue how to read any prescription I have ever seen.  I suspect training will have to be provided to pharmacists on how to read a doctor&rsquo;s handwriting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are related and both may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
        </Speaker><P>Government amendment No. 23:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 18, lines 21 to 25, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(5) The third of those requirements is that the person&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) holds a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification as a pharmacist granted by a competent authority of a third country, and the diploma, certificate or other evidence has been recognised by a relevant state for the purpose of being a pharmacist in that state, and</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) has experience, of at least three years, of practising as a pharmacist in that state certified in accordance with Article 3.3 of the Professional Qualifications Directive.&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment will further clarify the qualifications required.  The section sets out the conditions which must be met to allow a person&rsquo;s qualifications be considered appropriate for practising pharmacy in the State.  It deals with Irish, EU, EEA and non-EU qualifications.  It gives the council the power to satisfy itself as to the appropriateness of any qualification and, if deemed necessary, to require the person to sit an examination or undergo such training as it may specify.  These provisions do not interfere with the right of Irish and EU-EEA citizens to have their qualifications recognised under EU directives on qualifications and the free movement of professionals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to a little bugbear of mine on Second Stage.  If EU directives are referred to in a section, they should be listed on the same page in the legislation.  They are a major part of the legislative process and they should not be hidden in enabling legislation unless that is made clear.  It is a minor issue, which could be addressed through a proper search.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified who is entitled to work as a pharmacist in the State.  However, many of us asked on Second Stage why there is no sign of a reciprocation in this regard by other states.  The IPU told me a person who had qualified in the North could open a pharmacy in Dundalk but a person operating a pharmacy in Dundalk could not open one in Newry.  Are other countries holding things up or is there an unwillingness on the part of the Commission to require countries to implement the directive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To be frank, the answer is yes.  Many EU countries use qualifications as a barrier to entry.  That is why we have not achieved to <Col N="1335"/>create the single market.  There is a derogation.  It is a matter for member states to decide but that others do not do it is not a reason we should not.  What motivates me mostly is the position of Irish people who graduated abroad.  Under Irish law, one cannot distinguish between EU citizens.  This is to help them.  There was a time when the number of places in pharmacy was very restricted.  Thankfully, we have moved from a figure of 70 to 160.  Despite this, many more wish to become pharmacists.  We will, however, have an adequate supply from the indigenous population.  Other EU countries have not followed suit.  As in the case of the smoking ban, it is no harm to be the trailblazer occasionally in matters which are good and worthwhile.  The three year post-qualification requirement, before one can open a pharmacy, is reasonable.  Many believed it was unreasonable but it is reasonable that one cannot open a pharmacy on the day one completes one&rsquo;s education.  The requirement that one should have three years&rsquo; experience is a good one.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, prior to making any such regulations, consult with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and with the Society, and with any other person or body the Minister considers, in his or her discretion, it would be desirable to consult in advance of making any regulations under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Out of the blue in the middle of legislation dealing with the profession, with outside assistance, regulating itself, section 18 states: &ldquo;The Minister may, for the proposes of the health, safety and convenience of the public, make regulations about all or any of the following matters in respect of retail pharmacy businesses&rdquo;.  Nobody would dispute the significance of this but there is no reference to the pharmaceutical society.  The Minister will say there is no intention of producing regulations without consultation and I believe her because she is a reasonable woman most of the time.  However, the amendment reads: &ldquo;The Minister shall, prior to making any such regulations, consult with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and with the Society, and with any other person or body the Minister considers, in his or her discretion, it would be desirable to consult in advance of making any regulations under this <Col N="1336"/>section&rdquo;.  It seems rather bald to suddenly decide the Minister will do all this in isolation.  There should be a formal consultation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree there should be consultation and give an undertaking that there will be.  However, one should not prescribe that there should be consultation by way of legislation.  That is overly prescriptive and unnecessary.  I have probably met representatives of the pharmacy profession more often than any other group in the past two and a half years and I am always happy to do so because I have been well informed by the union and the society and it is my intention to consult both.  I had this debate yesterday in regard to the Medical Practitioners Bill.  The psychiatric training committee was mentioned and Deputies said they had never heard of it.  It is the training body for psychiatrists.  I was giving myself a transitional power because there was talk of a merger of the committee and the college in order that we would not have had to change the legislation when the body went out of existence and merged with another.  I am not suggesting the IPU will go out of existence but it could well decide to become known by another name.  One is overly prescriptive when one writes such provisions into legislation.  It is my intention and, no doubt, that of my officials to consult widely before regulations are introduced.  We need to consult because we do not have expertise.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the format of section 18 that enforcement of the regulations will be a matter for the Minister exclusively, not the pharmaceutical society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not enforce the regulations.  They will be enforced by the society.  I do not yet have an enforcement wing at my disposal in my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see where it is stated in the section that the society will enforce the regulations but I take the Minister&rsquo;s word in that regard.  I find it peculiar that a body would be required to enforce regulations which it did not draft.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister informed us that half the people on blood pressure tablets should not be taking them and that half the people who were not on them, should be.  She has spoken at length about the overuse of antibiotics, particularly at a time when she is in trouble over MRSA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have liked to have brought Senator Browne to Scandinavia last week.  If I had thought of it, I would have.</P>

	<P>It would have been money well spent by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister told me she would bring me to the Progressive Democrats party conference in Wexford too but she did not.  I have received all these invitations after the event.</P>
        <P>The Minister has talked a lot about the overuse of antibiotics, rightly so.  I agree with her on the rise in the incidence of MRSA.  However, I do not see any action being taken by her to combat it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this relevant to section 18?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because the section refers to the disposal of medicinal products and the manner in which such products must be sold or supplied.  Is there scope in the section to include guidelines on the appropriate use of antibiotics which the Minister has said on numerous occasions are overprescribed and overused and a factor in the rise in the incidence of MRSA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this issue on Second Stage.  I refer to subsection (1)(<i>k</i>) on physical characteristics.  A pharmacist must make arrangements in order that he or she can talk to patients in private, if necessary.  This could be very onerous on those who run small pharmacies.  I hope there will not be retrospective retribution against those who do not have a special section in which to people in private.  In general, pharmacists do the very best they can to talk to people in private.  I would not like to see those who run small shops and perhaps have inadequate facilities getting into trouble under this subsection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke about this matter on Second Stage.  I had hoped those with pharmacies would not be penalised, unless they undertook refurbishment works or created space.  Many family pharmacists work from small premises and give advice in private in a corner.  I would be reassured if the Minister said they would not be compelled to implement the provisions of this subsection if they did not have the required space.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne raised the issue of MRSA but we are not including provisions in that regard.  As he knows, this is about empowering a regulatory body to regulate a profession.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Ryan, in section 19&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Henry has pointed this out to me.  I apologise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulations made by the Minister will be enforced by the society under section 19.  Clearly, it is not the intention to close down anyone&rsquo;s business.  I am the last person who would wish to so do as I am a strong believer in <Col N="1338"/>supporting those who take risks and open businesses.  There will be transitional arrangements and there will be widespread consultations before regulations are made regarding private space.  I believe that during the Second Stage debate, I mentioned the pharmacy my parents used while I was growing up.  It was a very small establishment in which one handed in one&rsquo;s prescription, did one&rsquo;s shopping and returned to collect the medicine because the pharmacy could not accommodate more than three or four patients at any one time.  The man in question provided  a great service.  I believe I noted that his County Galway roots were the main reason my parents went to him.  It is as good a reason as any other, as he was qualified and so on.</P>
        <P>Many excellent pharmacists practice in relatively small premises and one must be pragmatic and sensible.  Consequently there will be widespread consultation and no one will be closed down.  A distinction must be made between what exists at present and what will be required in future.  The phrase, &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo;, is often used in legislation.  While I am unsure exactly how this will pan out, there will be much consultation and, hopefully, agreement in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will this measure be phased in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  There will be one set of circumstances for new pharmacists and presumably there will be time for others to meet the requirements.  It may be that in some locations this will be extremely difficult.  One must be pragmatic and sensible in the manner in which one seeks to apply this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not receive a proper reply to my question.  In the case of a pharmacy being aware of a doctor&rsquo;s over-prescription of antibiotics, is the onus on the pharmacists to inform on the doctor?  Am I correct to assume there is no link between pharmacists and the Medical Council, which regulates doctors?  Whenever the issue of MRSA is raised in this House, the abuse of antibiotics is discussed.  However, I do not discern any joined-up thinking in this regard.  It is more than likely that a pharmacist would spot over-prescription of antibiotics sooner than anyone else by virtue of observing the number of patients coming from a particular doctor.  What should a pharmacist do in such a scenario?  Should a report be made to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland or is a mechanism in place to make a direct report to the Medical Council, which governs the general practitioners concerned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point is interesting.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland will regulate pharmacists rather than doctors.  Consequently, there would be no point in reporting the activities of a doctor to the society.  It would be <Col N="1339"/>an appropriate matter for the Medical Council and any citizen, pharmacists included, is free to make a complaint.  There will be stronger powers in this regard under the new legislation.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of conflicts of interest that I dealt with earlier.  I forgot to make the point that the legislation will require anyone who is aware of economic or financial arrangements that are not in line with market trends to report it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>To whom?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be reported to the society in the case of a pharmacist.  The requirement under the law as amended will be that those who are aware of such financial arrangements will have a duty to report them.  It is important that this will not be simply voluntary; one will have a duty to do so in order that it can be investigated.</P>
        <P>Doctors and pharmacists must work more closely together and the issue of MRSA and over-prescription is simply one such area.  It will take considerable time to change the culture, habit and practice of patients in the first instance, as well as doctors and others.  The public awareness campaign that began recently will include training, seminars and information for general practitioners and  patients.  It will take some time for it to sink in that looking for antibiotics for virtually all ailments is not a good thing.  In fact it is both a bad and dangerous practice.</P>
        <P>I held discussions last week in Scandinavia and it has never been the experience there that people sought antibiotics in the manner in which people in Ireland do.  This is the main reason they have such a terrific record and they do not understand how Ireland has arrived at the point it has reached.  Some people to whom I spoke suggested that it will probably take a long time to change practices in Ireland.  This issue pertains to education and awareness.  While calling it a module might sound over-prescriptive, this issue should be included in the training and education of doctors, particularly those who will work in general practice.  Doctors have a major role in helping to inform patients, as do pharmacists.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a significant point.  Patients find it quite intimidating to query a decision by a doctor.  In general they are glad to receive advice from doctors and tend to assume that the latter are acting in their best interests.  I refer to patients with the courage to question such matters and bring them to the attention of a pharmacist who then brings them to the attention of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  It appears that such an action will come to a complete dead end and no joined-up thinking is discernible.  What should the society do in such a case?  It has no jurisdiction over GPs but a complaint has been <Col N="1340"/>received regarding the misuse of drugs.  There should be some mechanism in place whereby the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland can pass on such concerns to the Medical Council.  This issue must be raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s suggestions regarding education of the medical profession, patients and pharmacists must be followed in this instance.  There is no standard dictating that one definitely prescribes penicillin in one instance and a different antibiotic in another.  Pharmacists cannot state that a medical practitioner is doing something appalling by taking a particular course of action, or something good by taking another.  It would take gross abuse of the use of antibiotics before any pharmacist would consider making a report.  The route suggested by the Minister is the only one to take.  There must be education for the profession and the public and we will continue from there.  I agree with the Minister that this will take ages.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take advice on this amendment.  I have made provision that the preliminary disciplinary proceedings committee can require a complainant to supply information by way of an affidavit.  This is a good idea, if it believes it to be necessary rather than spending a lot of time on an issue that may not stand up or may be vexatious.  Consequently, giving the committee the power to do this is appropriate. Somebody could genuine believe he or she has cause for complaint.  I would like to take advice on the particular word used in the amendment.  The same applies to medical practitioners and any professional body.  Every profession takes complaints seriously.  While we want people to complain when there is cause for complaint and to properly investigate those complaints we do not want people trying to destroy somebody&rsquo;s reputation, profession and livelihood by making vexatious or unwarranted complaints.  It is a difficult issue.</P>
        <P>If one wants to have an open and transparent mechanism by which complaints made are properly investigated by the regulatory body one cannot be too restrictive.  Through preliminary proceedings, the health committee and mediation we have provided a range of mechanisms other than a full fitness to practice investigation which will deal with more serious issues.</P>
        <P>When the Medical Practitioners Bill was discussed yesterday, the question was asked whether one could make a complaint if one did not like the doctor next door or had a problem with his or her planning permission or house.  Those complaints cannot be dealt with by a regulatory body which will only deal with professional conduct.</P>

    <Title>Carbon Fund Bill 2006: Second Stage</Title>
	<P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be back in the House for Second Stage of the Carbon Fund Bill.  I am here so often I am more frequently before the House than I was when I was a Member.  I hope it is not a portent of things to come.</P><Col N="1342"/>
        <P>Second Stage of the Carbon Fund Bill will provide an opportunity to develop issues raised in yesterday&rsquo;s debate in Private Members&rsquo; time.  The Bill was amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, and benefited from a detailed examination and debate in that House.  As I stated in my contribution to the Private Members&rsquo; debate, the Government is committed to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol commitments, and we will do so on a basis which is both transparent and fully consistent with the principles underpinning the protocol.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Ireland will reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 15.2 million tonnes each year during the protocol compliance period from 2008 to 2012.  This will be achieved by means of a combination of emission reduction measures which have been implemented across the economy, including participation by approximately 109 of our heaviest-emitting installations in the EU emissions trading scheme.  These measures will be supplemented as necessary through use of the three flexible mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol to purchase allowances arising from emission reductions in other countries.</P>
        <P>For the benefit of the House, I will reiterate the fundamental international acceptability of purchasing carbon allowances on the international market.  The purchase of allowances is a legitimate, practical and logical option which is explicitly provided for in the Kyoto Protocol.  As well as being part of the Kyoto arrangements, carbon trading is endorsed in the recent report by Sir Nicholas Stern on the economics of climate change and by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Within the European Union, it is central to virtually every member state&rsquo;s response to its Kyoto commitments.  It is also supported by the former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and by Al Gore whose film &ldquo;An Inconvenient Truth&rdquo; contributed so much to the increasing awareness of global warming.  Our policy on the purchase of carbon allowances to supplement domestic actions is not unique.  At least ten other EU member states, namely, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Slovenia are expected to purchase up to 550 million units to meet their commitments.  To date budgetary commitments of &euro;2.8 billion have been made by these member states.</P>
        <P>An important point often overlooked is that the importance of the flexible mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol, particularly the clean development mechanism, are not confined to parties who wish to purchase carbon allowances to supplement domestic emission reductions.  They are also hugely important to developing countries in terms of attracting investment in modern clean technology.   At the meeting of the parties to the protocol in Nairobi last December, there was much discussion about the value of this invest<Col N="1343"/>ment for development and the reality it might not otherwise occur.</P>
        <P>Why commentators in Ireland put themselves outside this debate and seek to deny the advantages to Ireland of using the mechanism and its evident advantages to the developing world is difficult to understand.  It seems to be a classic example of ideology clouding out logic.  An interesting comment on this matter was made by Mr. Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at the recent Paris meeting.  He spoke of the purchase of carbon credits as a device which allows developed states to be ambitious about the carbon burden they carry and supports developing countries, particularly those who wish to use and develop clean technologies.</P>
        <P>To illustrate the major importance of the mechanism to developing countries, the point can be made that it is the only way many of them will be able to fund a move to clean technologies.  Examples of clean development mechanism projects include an energy conservation and greenhouse gas emissions reductions project in Moldova; a low-cost urban housing energy upgrade project in Cape Town; a hydroelectric project in Honduras; a hydropower plant in Bhutan and a biogas support programme in Nepal.</P>
        <P>Regarding economic competitiveness, we must face up to the full economic and social consequences of not buying credits to supplement domestic action to meet our Kyoto commitments.  Often, this is not done by people who make commentary in this country.  The alternative for Ireland is that industry would be forced to carry the full burden, the consequences of which could be very severe.  In other debates, I mentioned high-energy users such as Aughinish Alumina would face bills which would close them down.<?oasys _jy ?>If the ESB were made bear the full cost of the credits it has, which is suggested by other parties, it would face an additional bill of &euro;750 million.  This is ignored and brushed aside in discussions.</P>
        <P>Existing Irish industries would have to carry huge economic burdens.  Ireland would become an even more costly place to locate business and jobs.  The cost base of all industries would rise, electricity prices would be inflated and domestic producers would face undercutting from imports.  The significant point about this is that global warming is a global problem and wherever in the world a tonne is saved it will have the same effect in terms of the overall project.</P>
        <P>I heard arguments that Ireland should not use the protocol flexible mechanism to purchase carbon allowances, even when it is the most cost-effective way to do so.  At an estimate price of &euro;15 per unit over the Kyoto period, the Government would have to add an additional burden of at least &euro;270 million on to the companies in the EU emissions trading scheme.  The question arises of why we should impose this when a variety of measures can deal with our Kyoto targets?</P><Col N="1344"/>
        <P>Should there be any misunderstanding about the Government&rsquo;s position, let me set it out very clearly.  Ireland will comply fully with its Kyoto Protocol target sensibly and honestly, without compromising economic growth or jobs.  In short, we will take a responsible and effective approach that is fully consistent with the Kyoto Protocol.  In the process, we will also put Ireland on a firm footing in anticipation of more challenging emission reduction targets in the longer term.</P>
        <P>The Government has capped the State&rsquo;s purchasing requirement at 3.6 million allowances per annum, or 18 million allowances in total over the five-year period.  The announcement in the budget that &euro;270 million will be provided between now and 2013 establishes a definite financial basis for the purchasing requirement and builds on &euro;20 million provided by the Minister for Finance in 2006 to begin the process.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing financial resources, it is essential to put in place appropriate institutional arrangements.  In his 2006 budget statement, the Minister for Finance initiated the process of developing these arrangements by announcing the establishment of a carbon fund through which the necessary financial resources will be managed, and he designated the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as the purchasing agent for the State.  The provisions of the Bill will, <i>inter alia</i>, give a statutory basis to both the carbon fund and to designation of the NTMA as purchasing agent for the State.  It is therefore a piece of framework legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been drafted in close consultation with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure the legislation provides for robust checks and balances in the expenditure of public funds.  I will briefly outline its main provisions.</P>
        <P>Section 1 provides for the definitions, which are generally quite straightforward in nature.  The Bill introduces the term &ldquo;Kyoto units&rdquo; to capture the different types of carbon credits and allowances available under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  Section 2 addresses the main functions of the Bill, establishing the carbon fund, leaving control and management of the fund with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and delegating management of the fund to the NTMA.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for the funding required for the acquisition of Kyoto units.  My Department engaged in extensive consultation with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective means of providing for the acquisition of Kyoto units.  This provision in the Bill enables the NTMA to draw down funds directly from the central fund on an ongoing basis as needs arise.</P>
        <P>I am conscious the NTMA should not carry out the acquisition of Kyoto units without Oireachtas scrutiny, and therefore the Bill provides that <Col N="1345"/>moneys drawn down from the central fund for this purpose must be repaid in subsequent years through moneys voted to me by the Oireachtas.  This will enable an appropriate level of oversight by the Oireachtas on expenditure of State funds by the NTMA and the policy issues underpinning the use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms.</P>
        <P>Section 4<b> </b>stipulates that the carbon fund cannot be used for any other purpose.  Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, provide for the provision of proper accounts by the NTMA in managing the carbon fund, audit of the accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accountability of the NTMA to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The NTMA will also be required to provide to the Minister an annual report of its activities in managing the fund, which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides that the activities of the NTMA will be guided by direction from the Minister for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I intend that the purchase of Kyoto Units by the National Treasury Management Agency will be guided by the following principles.  These are that the units contribute to the ultimate objective of the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change, the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  In addition, there will be no investment in projects related to nuclear power; investment risk will be minimised, particularly with the timely delivery of credits; and good value for money will be obtained.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that the Minister may revoke some or all of the functions assigned under the Bill to the NTMA following consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The House will be aware that the European Commission recently made a decision on Ireland&rsquo;s national allocation plan, the so-called NAPS II, for the emissions trading period 2008-12.  This plan provides the framework for participation by 109 Irish installations in the EU emissions trading scheme in the relevant five-year period.</P>
        <P>Although it accepted many aspects of our plan, the Commission took a certain view which is interesting in light of some of the commentary we heard in the other House.  It indicated that we have not yet shown sufficient progress on the purchase of Kyoto units to supplement domestic emission reductions.  I do not agree with the Commission and I have challenged its view in a detailed response.  For the purpose of confirming Ireland&rsquo;s determination to meet our Kyoto commitments, I have already finalised arrangements to invest &euro;20 million in a carbon fund operated by European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a further &euro;20 million in a fund operated by the World Bank.</P><Col N="1346"/>
        <P>These investments are a significant step in demonstrating progress towards meeting our Kyoto commitments and enactment of the Carbon Fund Bill is an essential next step.  In addition to designating the NTMA as purchasing agent, enactment of the Bill will enable the agency to complete the full purchasing programme for the 2008-12 period.  Finalising our compliance arrangements will also provide essential support for the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives.</P>
        <P>This is important legislation for Kyoto compliance purposes but also to ensure the future competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s business sectors.  I trust it will be supported by all parties as its logic is clear.  The provisions this Bill underpins are set out in the Kyoto Protocol and all the states which have signed up to it accept those principles.  The principles we are using in this country have been underpinned by the United Nations, and the then Secretary General, Kofi Annan, spoke about them.  Others, including Stern, Gore and Yvo de Boer, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, spoke in favour of them.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat mystified that so many commentators are taking the opposite view.  It seems to be a classic example of the whole world is out of step with my Johnny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In thinking about the Carbon Fund Bill I have a mental picture of the Government as a large, disgruntled ostrich with ruffled feathers reluctantly removing its head from the sand because of an assault to its exposed rear end.  By this I mean no disrespect to the ostrich.</P>
        <P>This is exactly the position of the beleaguered Government, facing continuous assault on its very exposed position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> carbon emissions.  What exactly is its response to the criticisms and outcries but to throw money at the problem, of course.  This is the Government that has had more money at its disposal than any other in the history of the State and its knee-jerk answer to most problems has been to throw taxpayers&rsquo; hard-earned money at them.</P>
        <P>I believe Rupert Murdoch stated that the person who holds the cheque book calls the tune.  The Bill before us is calling the tune and asking us to dance to it.  It is telling us to endorse the cheque to buy the Government out of the mess it has made with regard to carbon emissions and to save it from failing to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>There should be no mistake, this Bill is not a solution to our appalling record on carbon emissions but is rather the forcing of our hand to rescue the Government from a major mess of its own making.  It is testament to the total lack of action taken by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as well as the Government as a whole, over the last decade on carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>The behaviour of the Government and the contempt in which it holds this House by scheduling <Col N="1347"/>this legislation in the dying days of this Oireachtas term is appalling.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, have trumpeted this Bill as bold, radical and, amazingly, &ldquo;best for the environment and best for the economy&rdquo;.  They forgot to say it is best for the dying Government.</P>
        <P>In his press release at budget time, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government welcomed the budget&rsquo;s commitment to long-term funding of &euro;270 million for Ireland&rsquo;s planned purchase of carbon allowances.  He continued by stating, &ldquo;This budgetary commitment underlines Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Kyoto Protocol and to developing countries.  It provides us with the means to meet our Kyoto target, without damaging the Irish economy.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The public is being deceived, as it is wrong to say the Bill is of economic benefit to the people or the economy.  It is the product of an economic and environmental systems failure in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  We are paying for the failure to tackle carbon emissions during the past ten years.  Nowhere is that failure made clearer than in the report from Sustainable Energy Ireland, which showed CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from energy production increasing at a higher rate than energy growth.  The recoupling of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions to energy growth is phenomenally worrying and shows that the Government&rsquo;s approach to climate change is wrong and that a new aggressive approach is needed.</P>
        <P>In 2005, Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 70 million tonnes, representing a rise of 26.3% since 1990 and seven tonnes above our annual Kyoto target for the period 2008-12.  The European Commission believes Ireland will not meet its target.  As such, Ireland will need to use the Kyoto mechanisms to meet the overspill.  The Government has committed to purchasing 3.6 million tonnes of carbon credits annually in the period 2008-12.  Even with these carbon credits, Ireland is not expected to meet its target without further measures.  Ireland is one of seven EU-27 countries not projected to meet their targets.  The others are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Portugal.  Even with the use of Kyoto mechanisms and carbon sinks &mdash; planting permanent forests &mdash; the European Commission expects the gap to be approximately 3.6 million tonnes per annum.</P>
        <P>This month, the EU committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 20% below their 1990 level by 2020.  If other developed countries agree, this target could be increased to 30% and more than 60% by 2050.  It is unclear at this stage what this means for Ireland in terms of a national target, but it should mean that Ireland will need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by 2020 and further after that time.</P>
        <P>Currently, Ireland has one of the highest greenhouse gas emissions <i>per capita</i> in Europe.  If these <Col N="1348"/>levels continue, Ireland will continue to need to buy carbon credits from lower emission countries.  While the current cost of carbon is low, partially due to overly generous allocations within the European trading system, the price may rise and, without emission reductions, the cost of purchasing carbon credits will be an ongoing burden on the taxpayer.  According to the Government, the difference between Ireland&rsquo;s level of emissions <i>per capita</i> and the EU-25 level can be attributed to, among other factors, a high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation, high <i>per capita</i> cement production and a relatively high level of international fuel storage.</P>
        <P>Late last year, the European Commission criticised the Government&rsquo;s climate change plan for its heavy reliance on purchasing carbon credits, but the Government&rsquo;s response was to place further reliance on this policy in the budget.  Its failure to tackle vehicle emissions is unforgivable and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s botched adoption of Fine Gael&rsquo;s VRT plan has provided a 12-month window for a significant increase in sales of vehicles that emit considerable amounts of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>.  Most damningly, Ireland&rsquo;s over-reliance on oil and the lack of emphasis Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have put on alternative energy in the past decade has resulted in today&rsquo;s figures.</P>
        <P>A brand new approach is needed, with aggressive policies focusing on reaching local targets to reduce overall emissions.  Fine Gael in government will give significant new responsibilities to local government in respect of climate change and energy conservation.  We will put in place a comprehensive strategy that will make local government integral in all green policies and will see every planning application vetted for carbon proofing and energy conservation.  Each local authority will be compelled to conduct a full inventory of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and produce a plan of action to reduce them.  Targets will be set in each local authority area requiring a percentage of each new home to come from renewable sources and there will be a serious drive on green procurement.</P>
        <P>I wish to put on record the facts regarding the cost of carbon trading.  The national allocation plan of carbon allowances published by the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of the Government has allocated 3 million tonnes of excess emissions to the non-traded sector and 2 million tonnes to the traded sector.  This means that, in practice, the Exchequer &mdash; effectively, the people of Ireland &mdash; will buy 3 million tonnes of credits annually and the electricity consumer, those same people, will pay for two million tonnes.  At &euro;15 per tonne of carbon, the annual bill would be &euro;75 million between the taxpayer and the consumer.   However, the NAP is hoping for unspecified savings of 1.5 million tonnes in the years to come.  If those savings are not achieved, they will need to be offset by the purchasing of <Col N="1349"/>more carbon credits.  If the price of carbon were to increase to &euro;30 per tonne, which is not an unreasonable suggestion, the national bill would be a staggering &euro;213 million per annum.  That is the cost of failure.  During the five years of the NAP, the total bill would come to more than &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>Last December&rsquo;s budget paid lip-service to the need to end Ireland&rsquo;s unsustainable dependence on foreign oil and will do little or nothing to help Ireland meet its Kyoto commitments.  Thanks to the lack of any political will from the Government, Ireland&rsquo;s CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions have risen by almost twice the allowable level under the Kyoto Protocol since 1990.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;through a system of energy efficiency labelling for vehicles, but why is the Minister for Finance delaying the implementation of this reform until 2008?  The structures in place to promote the growth of bio-fuels are minimal and the Government has failed to exploit our potential for renewable energy to make the blending of fuels compulsory.  If the Government was serious about renewables, it would have put in place legislation to ensure that bio-fuel is blended into petrol, diesel and home-heating oil.  Had the Minister implemented Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals, as contained in our Energy for the Future document, real progress could have been made.</P>
        <P>Among our proposals are those to legislate to compel all fuel retailers to blend bio-fuel into fuels such as petrol, diesel and home-heating oil and to remove all excise duty on bio-fuels produced from renewable energy crops.  In practice, this would mean producers would not need to pay excise duty on the bio-fuels they produce, with the knock-on effect of consumers enjoying cheaper fuel at the pump.  An open public competition should be organised for those who wish to avail of capital start-up grants, or to establish and operate bio-fuel processing plants.  The Government should require all public transport and public service vehicles to convert, where practical and feasible, to forms of bio-fuel in its pure or a blended form.  The Minister&rsquo;s refusal to adopt our proposals means the environment and the economy will suffer for another year.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not good news for Ireland, the environment, the Exchequer, the developing world or anyone else.  It is the end result of the Government&rsquo;s refusal to take the environment seriously.  It is the product of ministerial thinking that sees anyone with an interest in protecting the environment as extremist, anti-progress and utopian.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself, his record and the record of the Government.</P>

	<P>Would it dismiss the other experts who have agreed that this mechanism, as it is structured, represents one of the most effective ways of dealing with this global problem and challenge?  Ireland is no different from any other country.  We have to take responsibility for the carbon emissions we produce as a country and as individuals.  That is exactly what we are doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ten years late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I pointed out during last night&rsquo;s debate that a great deal of progress has been made in this area in recent years.  It is great that this country is able to afford to have a strategy for dealing with this issue.  We could not have afforded to have such a strategy until approximately ten years ago.</P>
        <P>Numerous attempts were made in the past to improve the environment.  The Government oversaw the introduction of smokeless fuel, for example.  We have progressed enormously in recent years by putting a levy on plastic bags, for example.  The steps we have taken will ensure we continue to reduce our emissions.  The economy grew by 150% between 1990 and 2004, but our emissions increased by just 25%.  It is extremely difficult to achieve and maintain such a balancing act.  The strategy and policies pursued by the Minister and the Government will ensure we will continue the progress we have made.</P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  We have been speaking about this issue for many years.  The joint committee has discussed the matter on numerous occasions, as Senator Bannon is aware.  We have talked around the subject.</P>
        <P>The steps we are taking to ensure Ireland remains competitive in the global market do not seem to be acceptable to those in the Opposition who often slate us for our supposed failure to maintain this country&rsquo;s competitiveness.  As I said last night, &ldquo;the reality of life is that we cannot all <Col N="1351"/>cycle everywhere&rdquo;.  We have to take responsibility for the use of cars, electricity and various sources of energy.  We are taking concrete steps in these respects.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the National Treasury Management Agency is being given responsibility as the State&rsquo;s purchasing agent.  The agency has proven over the years that its talented and committed staff can pursue extremely successful policies and strategies.  The agency&rsquo;s role in this regard will ensure we get value for money and continue to work to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>This legislation has been framed following a long period of consultation with many interests, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It will prove to be very effective.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government commented on the various sections of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to last night&rsquo;s discussion on the improvements which have been made.  I spoke about competitiveness during that debate.  We need to strike a balance between continuing to provide jobs and improve the economy for the people, and allowing ordinary citizens to enjoy their lives in the same way as their counterparts throughout the world.  We can hold our heads high in this respect.  Our prudent policies have helped us to avoid many of the problems which are being experienced by our European neighbours.</P>
        <P>We have to compete globally.  We are moving away from manufacturing and agriculture, to a certain extent.  We are now concentrating on high-end technology and pharmaceuticals.  We have to safeguard such jobs, protect the environment and respect the way these companies do business.  We have to maintain our growth and continue to provide for growth.</P>
        <P>I will comment on what has been achieved in recent times.  Last night, we discussed many of the developments which will help to reduce emissions from traffic.  Many projects are being rolled out under Transport 21.  We have not heard a squeak about the success of the Dublin Port tunnel, which is up and running.  The only reaction we got resulted from a slight malfunction yesterday.  As a direct result of those problems, everybody now recognises the value of the tunnel, about which we have been speaking for ten years.  We also spent ten years trying to introduce the Luas system, which is now a massive success.  We do not hear a dicky-bird about the fact that it is used by millions of people every year.</P>
        <P>Projects like those I have mentioned form part of the Government&rsquo;s long-term strategy.  We are showing foresight by acknowledging what will have to be done in the future.  The Government and its predecessor have a proven track record in planning for the future.  We are making sure we fulfil all our obligations, particularly in relation to <Col N="1352"/>the environment.  We have made huge strides in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Port tunnel has made a huge difference to people in parts of my constituency like East Wall and North Wall.  Before the tunnel opened, there was a constant flow of heavy trucks through the area from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. each day.  The opening of the tunnel has reduced the number of hours that drivers spend stuck in traffic.  It has also improved the quality of the air in many parts of Dublin.  Schools which had huge problems with fumes, etc., from heavy traffic have been transformed.  When one considers such basic matters, one sees how effective the Government&rsquo;s achievements have been.</P>
        <P>We will continue to invest in public transport to encourage as many people as possible to use it.  We have made a great deal of progress in that respect.  That work will continue.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the greener homes scheme, which encourages individuals and families to take responsibility.  Grants and other incentives are provided under the scheme.  Anything that can be done in this area should be encouraged.  The Government has proven its willingness to support people to make certain choices.  We will have to continue to assist groups and individuals who want to make an effort in this regard.  There has been a major change in the attitude to environmental issues of young people on leaving school.  The green flag scheme operated in many schools has proved to be a great success.  It is an educational tool which students carry into adult life.  It has brought about change and we must encourage such initiatives.</P>
        <P>We now accept that the generation of emissions and the way we treat our environment is a matter of individual responsibility.  Probably the most effective campaign to date has been the Power of One.  It comes down to the individual and requesting individuals to switch off lights, turn off taps, put controls on heating systems, etc.  That is the way forward.  We have to bring down this issue to an individual&rsquo;s responsibility.  We must all take responsibility for our actions.  The Power of One campaign in particular will prove to be very successful in the long run.</P>
        <P>The more we continue to educate young people in schools and make them aware of environmental issues, the better.  Films and television programmes on global warming have been produced and there is also the Internet, which are resources into which young people tap.  We must ensure the right information and as much information as possible is disseminated to people.  It is easy to scaremonger about such issues.  People sometimes pick up wrong information because some individuals and groups have a vested interested in disseminating misinformation.  We must be aware of that, particularly in the case of young people.  As is the case with other issues, young people can be susceptible and easily led in terms of information disseminated.</P><Col N="1353"/>
        <P>We will continue to research and develop renewable resources.  We are concentrating heavily on the provision of renewal sources of energy.  A great deal of money is being invested in such research and development, which is necessary.  We need to modernise our energy networks.  I wholeheartedly agree with the decision not to go down the nuclear road.  I had the dubious honour of visiting Sellafield last year and it brought back memories of the threat posed by that plant given that it is still dealing with the result of what they did in the 1950s and they will continue to deal with that waste for the next 50 years.  They have materials that will be in the ground for 1,000 years and nobody is sure what to do about that, yet they continue to go down the nuclear road.</P>
        <P>We have to examine the question of alternatives and sustainable renewable sources of energy.  The Government and the previous Minister for the Environment have made huge strides forward in this area and will continue to do so.  We have talked and danced around the subject of this legislation for a long time.  The legislation is very welcome.  It is great that at last we are getting to the point where we, as a country, are taking responsibility for what we produce and the emissions we produce.  This Bill together with a  framework of legislation and policy will ensure we continue the good work.  I wish the Minister well with the passage of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the legislation.  I want to put a few matters straight.  I was one of the people who was critical in my contribution on the budget debate about the &euro;270 million allocation but that did not mean I am opposed to emissions trading.  I was one of the people who criticised the Power of One campaign but that does not mean I am opposed to any of the measures suggested in that campaign.  It is the imbalance that bothered me.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to team development mechanisms in various places around the world and he gave an example of a housing estate somewhere in South Africa.  I lay a bet with him that the installation requirements in those houses are closer to Gerard McCaughey's view than to the views of his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not put all his faith in a lobbyist.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not depend on lobbyists.  They might give me an interest in something but I do not depend on what I get from them.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome but minimalist.  It does not deal with the issues.  I regret the Bill was not introduced in this House, as I would have made a number of amendments to it with which I believe the Minister would be in agreement.</P>
        <P>In regard to section 8, the Minister said, &ldquo;I intend that the purchase of Kyoto units by the National Treasury Management Agency will be guided by the following principles...&rdquo; and so on. <Col N="1354"/> If I thought there was a chance of it being accepted, I would table an amendment to include that section of the Minister&rsquo;s speech to a relevant section of the Bill.  That is necessary.  There is a gap in the Bill in that respect and that part of the Minister&rsquo;s speech should be included in it.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the Kyoto units, which I consider is also minimalist.  I am amazed that the Parliamentary Counsel  did not develop that aspect further.  To my certain knowledge, there are four kinds of Kyoto units.  The better known ones are the certified emission reductions, CERs, the emission reduction units for the sink units that would be put in place, and the European Union allowances.</P>
        <P>I criticised the budget in terms of the money being put aside for this area, as it is the only action being taken.  In reply to a point raised by Senator Brady, I say that purely on the basis that it was not being balanced with other aspects.  If the Minister said to me that he intended to introduce legislation in this area, I would advise him it should deal with the following measures and the Minister might indicate with which ones he disagrees.  It should provide that from now on every local authority will have no choice but to charge for waste on the basis of per unit, per volume, per weight or per lift, rather than the position that still prevails in some county councils which charge householders for the year and allow people to put out barrowfuls of waste every weekend.  Why could that not be done?  Why would we not insist that every new house being built would have triple glazing and solar panels, which has been included in new houses in two areas of Spain?  In moving forward matters, why would we not insist that old fashioned light bulbs would be phased out and banned within 18 months?  None of those measures would cost money or pose a charge on the Exchequer.  It could be argued that they might add a minor cost to the price of houses but it would not add 1% to the price of them.  Why could that not be done?  I would love to be in the Minister&rsquo;s position for one week and I would put in place four or five of those measures and I would not hear of any arguments being made against them.  No lobbyist approached me to convince me of that; that is my view.</P>
        <P>I will take the Minister further in terms of why I support this Bill.  I decided in January that my election campaign would be carbon neutral.  As Padraig Flynn, one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, said long ago, &ldquo;You should try it some time&rdquo;.  He should try to be carbon neutral, get his emissions audited, obtain an authorised certificate to indicate it is balanced and be able to prove that.  It cannot be done.  At what price does the Minister think one CER is currently running?  I checked it in January when a carbon credit, 1 metric tonne of carbon, was &euro;25.  If the Minister multiplies that figure by whatever number of million he mentioned in his speech, he will find that the sum works out at &euro;450 million.</P>

	<P>Some 18 million allowances multiplied by &euro;25 works out at &euro;450 million but the Minister has allowed for a figure of only &euro;270 million.  I am not making a big issue of this.  </P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not talking about government to government trading.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will talk about government to government trading.  Let me go through it.  In the Kyoto agreement, that would have been done through an IT transference system.  I do not know where in Ireland the international transaction log of those is being kept.  I cannot find that out.  It should be there but it is not mentioned in the Bill.  It is required to be registered for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol.  I presume the registration body is the Environmental Protection Agency, but I am not certain and it is not written down in the Bill.  I have listed two items that should be written in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I refer to the different units used to measure emissions and the trading of emissions.  The European Union allowances are already being traded even though they do not exist.  Ireland cannot trade the allowances.  I note from last year&rsquo;s departmental accounts that &euro;5,000 worth of CERs were purchased and I wonder how this was done and by means of what broker.  I will send the Minister a note on that information and I will double-check that it was his Department&rsquo;s accounts.</P>
        <P>It seems that the EPA will operate the scheme and I agree with Senator Brady that it has a proven record.  However I question how these units will be audited and this is not explained in the Bill nor does the Bill state that they are required to be audited.  However, the Bill correctly states that the Minister may give directions or guidelines to the agency and this should be done.  Is it possible to purchase emission units in Ireland?  I ask the Minister to answer that question.</P>
        <P>Certified emission reductions, CERs, are produced in the five examples given in the Minister&rsquo;s opening contribution &mdash; the hydropower plant in Bhutan, the other projects in Honduras, Nepal, Cape Town and Moldova.  They are all clean development mechanisms which produce units tallied in CERs.  Another element of the Kyoto Protocol are the joint implementation projects which will be undertaken in non-developing countries, non-Third World countries, where pro<Col N="1356"/>jects are put in place to create certified emission reductions.  Each unit is the same; one CER equals one emission reduction unit which also equals &euro;1 union allowance.  They are also equal to one carbon tonne or one tonne of carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>I have a suggestion to be considered by the Minister and by Senator Brady and it explains why I am critical.  A third unit of the Kyoto Protocol is called a removal unit, an RMU.  All these units are equal.  The RMU is for dealing with sink projects, meaning that if something is creating a problem because of emissions, it is taken away and credit can be earned.  I suggest this could be done in Ireland by putting in place a project to solve the problem when it is identified.  If the Minister took this decision tomorrow morning, he would put a plastic sheet over every sewage treatment plant in Ireland and this would capture the methane.  This methane is worth 20 times carbon emissions as it is 20 times more powerful and more dense.  The capture of one cubic tonne of methane is the same as 20 cubic tonnes of carbon and this is being produced with our landfills and our sewage treatment plants.  Once the methane is captured we will not need to buy the carbon credits and we can use the methane so it is a winner both ways.  I am not talking about tweeds and green wellies but rather about a serious commercial proposition.  The problem could be dealt with from start to finish, emissions would be removed, the Kyoto Protocol commitments would be met, carbon emissions would be reduced and it would be a win in every way.  I would like to see this achieved.</P>
        <P>I am concerned when I see a reference to Kyoto units because I am not certain if there is any unit called a Kyoto unit as it is a term used to describe the various units to which I have referred.  They are all equal to each other and they are all tradeable and are being traded somewhere in the world.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow for European trading and I note there is a trading in Chicago.  If I came to the Minister with a project and proposed putting a roof over a huge landfill site in north Dublin in order to capture all the methane escaping from that site and this will be measurable by volume, this would help the country under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol.  This would be an RMU, a removal unit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s contribution is fascinating for which I compliment him.  Without being patronising it is by far and away the best contribution in either House.  The steps we have taken in waste management alone will save 700,000 tonnes.  The capping of waste is illustrated by the point made by the Senator.  He has illustrated in a most eloquent way that this is a very serious topic that requires serious rather than fatuous analysis and I compliment him on his analysis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  This is an issue of interest to me.  There is much nonsense spoken on this topic.  I am putting forward practical proposals for dealing with this issue and I suggest every step should be a practical one and no step should be over the limit of stupidity while at the same time the balance must be maintained.  </P>
        <P>When the Minister directs the agency, the NTMA, I ask him to request a mix which will include removal units, CERs and the others so that they would all be included.  We would then do three things, namely, involve ourselves in the clean development mechanisms in Third World countries to undertake superb projects as outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution; agree joint initiatives in other countries where Ireland would undertake similar projects in order to create and gain; and rid ourselves of some of the emissions through the elimination of what are generally referred to as sink units, if that is the correct term.</P>

	<P>There is much we could do.  </P>
        <P>I will tell the Minister a story.  Last week the energy regulator attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  I was embarrassed with the lack of knowledge shown by the officials.  They were not aware that Sustainable Energy Ireland offers grants for solar panels but not for wind generators.  This is a basic piece of information in their line of country.</P>
        <P>The ESB must wait for smart meters which can judge the time of the day at which a consumer uses electricity and charge accordingly.  However, in most of Europe, if a consumer creates more electricity than he or she uses, for instance, by using a wind generator, this energy is given back into the grid and the consumer is paid for it.  This is not rocket science and it is happening 60 miles up the road in Northern Ireland and in the UK.  It is only small money but it is a clear incentive.  Rather than wait for smart metering I would allow consumers install a smart meter.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Energy conservation is being portrayed as being out of reach of people.  A passive house is portrayed on television as being almost impossible but 75% of the effort is very easy if a house is being constructed by direct labour.  I spoke to a young teacher who is building a house near Kinvara.  I met him in Senator Daly&rsquo;s constituency but he <Col N="1358"/>was building his house over the border in County Galway.  He is putting in geothermal heating.  He has triple glazing with Pilkington glass.  He has got sheep&rsquo;s wool insulation.  Every piece of sheep&rsquo;s wool in Ireland is exported.  It used to be exported to Bradford and now it is exported to India.  The spin offs in these areas are superb.  Creating a whole new industry for sheep&rsquo;s wool insulation would be very welcome in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us broaden its market by making this an essential part of what we are doing.  These are just simple things that can be done.</P>
        <P>I have not seen Al Gore&rsquo;s film, but I believe it is very good.  There was a big debate on Channel 4 about whether global warming was based on nonsense.  We should tell those people they should go into a corner and continue their debate.  Whatever about the arguments about global warming, taking action on it stops waste, makes us more efficient, productive and prudent.  The important people can discuss the connection between carbon emissions and temperature increase.  In the meantime, we should do what we think is practicable and sensible.</P>
        <P>I do not have a problem with the Bill, but it should deal with the question of audit and the instructions that the Minister might generally give.  It should also deal with the various different types of Kyoto units.  It does not help ordinary people like myself.  If I want to stamp my election campaign as being carbon neutral, and I plan to do so, I will have to invent a way of doing it myself.  I may get some commercial value out of it afterwards.  This Bill is important and we need it, but my problem is with how we move forward from there and use it in balance with other things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to intervene for long in this debate.  I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  As far as it goes, it is meeting the public demand to deal with these issues.  Not that many years ago, the big issue was the ozone layer.  If the ozone layer was not going to de dealt with, then we were going to be wiped out by cancer and God knows what.  Has anybody heard about the ozone layer lately?  Is it still around?  Has it vanished into the solar galaxies?  There was doom and gloom about it at the time because there were gaps in it, but all these gaps have vanished.  In some respects&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, the Senator&rsquo;s own Government took measures to deal with Chlorofluorocarbons in order to stop the things that were creating the problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

	<P>The point is that measures were taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>A measure was taken to deal with it.  Certain measures need to be taken now to deal with this, but we should not lose the run of ourselves.  There needs to be a certain balance and the dire predictions about global warming are disputed by others.  It is a bit like going to the Supreme Court.  One will find an equally valid argument put forward by other experts that there is no serious problem and if a certain amount is done, the worst effects can be averted.</P>
        <P>There are certain controls over what the Minister can do with the funds in Section 3.  I have not studied the Bill in great detail, because we have seen it only recently.  There was a proposal a few years ago for a wave station in Kilkee.  A licence was granted to connect it to the national grid and a company was interested in doing it, but due to a lack of &pound;1 million, a decision was made on whether it was a research and development project or an economic project.  As there were no funds in the research and development fund, the project collapsed.  This was an internationally recognised company that had located a site, had done research work with the University of Limerick and had identified the prospects of getting this wave station put in place.  It had obtained a licence from the ESB to connect to the national grid.  The issue that arose when EU funding was being decided was whether it was an economical proposition to build the station, or whether it was a research and development project.  While money existed in the economic fund, there was no money in the research and development fund.  It collapsed for lack of money.</P>
        <P>In such a situation, can the Minister draw down the necessary funding to put that station in place? Another company from Scotland was involved, but is no longer interested as it went off and did it somewhere else.  I presume it received funding under EU regulations.  Due to the technicalities that arose here, we lost that project.  From what I can see at present, these wave stations can generate a great amount of electricity.  Can the wave station be put back in place with funding from this fund?  If it cannot be done, then we need to have an amendment to that section.</P>
        <P>Clean coal technology has worked in Europe.  A huge investment has been made by the German and French authorities, as well as the British to some extent.  The British are building large coal burning stations in the knowledge that clean coal technology, which is expensive, will be coming into play as there is a plentiful supply of coal.  If there were a proposal to operate clean coal technology in this country, for which coal supplies would have to come in from abroad, could funding be drawn down from this fund to deal with that?  In that situation, the Minister might go a different way about meeting some of the requirements raised.</P><Col N="1360"/>
        <P>It is important to raise these issues when we are putting down the framework for a number of years.  It is important that we do not find in a year&rsquo;s time that we are losing a viable project to Scotland or elsewhere due to technicalities, as has previously happened.  We should be able to deal with that under this fund and get such projects underway.</P>
        <P>Work was done at the Marine Institute in Galway to identify a site for a wave station.  I am particularly interested in wave power because I am surrounded by enormous waves which could drive all of Europe if it could be properly harnessed.  It seems to me to be an opportune time to raise these issues.  I hope the Minister can deal with them now or on Committee Stage.</P>

It is a stunning example of the paucity of thought in our Opposition.

        <P>I have a certain sympathy with Senator Bannon who was obviously handed a script by the person who writes them for Fine Gael.  I intend no comment on the Senator&rsquo;s character but I felt sorry for him having to read it into the record of the House.  His contribution was a reiteration of the same old nonsense, half truths and innuendo.  In short, it was derisory.  I intend no disrespect to the Senator and, to be fair, the same script was read into the record elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon stated that the European Commission stated that Ireland would not meet its Kyoto target.  That is simply not the case.  No such statement was made by the Commission.  The Senator also stated that the Commission had criticised Ireland&rsquo;s open reliance on carbon credit purchases.  Again, that is untrue.  In its response under the national allocation programme &mdash; NAPS II &mdash; the European Commission criticised Ireland for not making provision in this regard.  It is not the Senator&rsquo;s fault that he was given a script to read but what he said was appalling.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon referred to bold decisions being made on bio-fuels.  It is interesting that mandatory addition levels relating to bio-fuels were in place in Ireland from the 1930s to the 1970s but that these were struck down by our joining the then European Economic Community.  Such addition levels were a very good idea.</P>
        <P>I point out to Senator O&rsquo;Toole that this is a framework Bill designed to deal with the purchase of carbon credits on the international stage.  The climate change strategy document I will pub<Col N="1361"/>lish on 2 April will deal with the specific issues raised by the Senator.  The latter is, in effect, a synthesis document which draws together all of the other documents and policy statements that were published recently.  The Bill before the House is framework legislation and does not set out the policy.  The latter will be set out in the climate change strategy document.  The Bill deals with specifics and is meant to give control of the carbon fund to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, to purchase credits on the international market.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s and Senator Daly&rsquo;s commonsense observation on incentivising.  If we all subscribed to the Henny-Penny or Chicken Little school of public policy discussion, we would make no progress on this matter.  There are good, solid and practical things that should be done, irrespective of the side we take in the global warming argument.  I am of the view that the science regarding global warming is clear and that the economic imperative was dealt with and outlined in the Stern report.  The logical and moral arguments have all been made.  There are those who take the view that carbon emissions are not the big issue and that sunspot activity is responsible for global warming.  This argument was put forward on the recent Channel 4 television programme.</P>
        <P>We should not become involved in what is a sterile debate because we will not know who is right and who is wrong for 100 years.  However, Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct.  We should take these steps because that is the correct way to proceed.  For example, it is the right thing to do to insulate our homes, replace incandescent bulbs with CFL bulbs and attenuate the methane that comes from cattle and waste disposal.  Those things should be done because they are intrinsically correct and they make economic and environmental sense.  Moreover, by doing those things, we put ourselves into a win-win situation.  By replacing incandescent bulbs with CFL bulbs, we will make a stunning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Let us impose a date in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should be patient and wait for the launch of the strategy on 2 April.  I have already made an announcement in this regard.  Ireland was one of the first countries to examine this issue.  This is one of the areas in respect of which we were considering taking action but the problem is that it is not possible to take action which could be regarded as restraint of trade within the EU.  We must wait until the EU makes its move before we can act.  The Senator will see my response in detail on 2 April.</P>
        <P>I disagree with the lobbyist to whom Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred several times because insulation standards here are among the highest in the world.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1362"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us not go there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us not do so, but the reality is that we have already committed to increasing those standards by 40%.  We are doing so not necessarily on foot of climate change but because it is the correct thing to do.  The Senator is correct about the need to build in efficiencies, particularly in light of the rate at which houses are being built here.</P>
        <P>We have taken specific measures in respect of climate change.  For example, the afforestation grants will make a significant contribution.  Forests are very efficient carbon sinks.  The afforestation programme will remove the equivalent of 2.8 million tonnes of emissions.  How will this be paid for?  The State is providing grant assistance in respect of forestry and the payback will be that we will not be obliged to buy carbon credits or impose a further penalty on industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister.  However, is an account being kept of what is happening in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The schemes in Ireland are overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency.  There are also international standards.  One might ask how the calculation relating to transport is made.  Carbon emission figures for transport are calculated on the basis of the country&rsquo;s throughput of diesel and petrol.  The intriguing thing in this regard is that in Ireland, a significant proportion of diesel is sold to out-of-State fleets by means of so-called fuel tourism.  This is never factored into the debate.  In the Lower House yesterday, the Labour Party made the extraordinary and ludicrous proposition that we should increase our tax rates on petrol and diesel to match those in the North of Ireland to prevent drivers from that jurisdiction from purchasing fuel here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We could change our audit system.  One cannot pursue a degree in this country in, for example, environmental economics.  We are not dealing with these matters at academic level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.  Why does the audit system relating to transport not take into account all of the issues?  The point is that the system in place was established by the United Nations and applies equally across the globe.  I am of the opinion that aviation fuel should be included under this system.  It is anomalous that such fuel is not included.  Ireland pays a penalty because fuel tourism increases the size of our carbon footprint.  The other country that pays a penalty as a result of its low-tax economy is Luxembourg.  The spike in transport emission levels outlined in the recent EEA, EPA and SEI reports came about because there are huge sales of fuel to non-domestic customers in both Ireland and Luxembourg.</P><Col N="1363"/>
        <P>We could do what the Labour Party wants and increase the tax on fuels but that is not an attractive proposition.  We are obliged to buy the equivalent of 2 million tonnes of carbon credits to deal with out-of-State sales of fuel.  However, this cost is infinitely offset by money we accrue from excise duties imposed on out-of-State sales.  We receive of the order of &euro;350 million to &euro;370 million from such sales.  The total cost of purchasing carbon credits over the entire Kyoto period will be &euro;270 million.  We are, therefore, in profit every year.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole inquired about other actions that might be taken.  The nitrates action programme and the Common Agricultural Policy reform programme will contribute carbon savings to this country of 2.4 million tonnes.  From where will the payback come in this regard?  The State is providing support for farmers who are moving into schemes which deal with it environmentally.  It illustrates the point the Senator made, that the debate is at a wrong level in Ireland.  We are focusing too much on one aspect of the debate rather than focusing on all of the aspects of it.</P>
        <P>For example, the changes in the building regulations are worth 300,000 tonnes per annum and also are relatively cost free.  In the transport area, as Senator Brady pointed out, Luas is making a phenomenal contribution to us in this regard.  In the first 12 months of operation Luas carried 26 million passengers.  The DART has been upgraded by Government through significant investment to the point where it now carries 90,000 per day.  The 80,000 passengers per day from the Luas together with the 90,000 per day of the DART amounts to a significant saving.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon&rsquo;s point about transport was quite correct.  If one looks at the statistics for carbon emissions, one will find that transport has generated a phenomenal increase in carbon emissions.  In fact, in 1990 the carbon emissions from transport amounted to 9% of our total carbon emissions.  This figure had risen to 18% by 2004.  There is a simple enough reason for this: the fleet has more than doubled.  Our employment has doubled.  There are 2 million employed in Ireland now and there was 1 million employed in 1987.  There are more people travelling to work every day and they all cannot be expected to use public transport because the public transport system in this country still needs much investment.</P>
        <P>One cannot decide, as Stalin might have, to interfere with those people&rsquo;s rights to use whatever mode they need.  What one must do, as the Government is doing, is invest heavily in public transport.  One could make the valid criticism that over the history of State, there has not been enough investment in public transport, and that would be true, but one cannot change the past whereas one can change the future.  A sum of &euro;16 billion is being provided for public transport in Transport 21 and that will produce phenomenal <Col N="1364"/>savings, as well as improvements in the quality of life.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon did not take the extremist view taken by other parties that we should not be buying carbon credits, although I noted he was careful not to answer Senator Brady&rsquo;s question on this.  His party spokesman, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, indicated that he did not oppose this in principle.  I can well understand why that would be the case.  It is logical and makes sense because cement production, which is important in Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s constituency, contributes significantly to carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>If we were to go the route proposed by the Green Party and the Labour Party, we would impose a vast carbon penalty directly on all the emitters and would force them to bear the full cost of all emissions.  On the question of who would be the beneficiaries of such a route, the best example to take is the aluminium plant at Aughinish in Senator Daly&rsquo;s constituency, about which he has spoken to me on several occasions.  If we were to force Aughinish Alumina to carry the full cost of all carbon, one would add approximately &euro;50 million over the indicative period to the company&rsquo;s costs, close the company down, put 500 in the plant out of work and put at least another 500 elsewhere out of work.  The worst aspect about it, however, is that one would gain nothing.  Fine Gael does not propose this, but Labour and the Green Party do.  One would gain nothing because one would simply move the production of that material to another country, as has happened in some parts of Europe where cement companies have transferred their production offshore to north Africa with the result that the cement is imported, is produced in a less environmentally friendly way and adds to global emissions, because it is a global problem.</P>
        <P>This is why I am so taken by Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s analysis because it is the first analysis in the debate in either House that I have heard which looks at this issue in a holistic way.  One must remember that if one drives industry out of the European Union and especially out of Ireland, not only does one impose the penalty on the workers in those industries, one imposes a further penalty on the world because one drives industry to countries where there are lower standards and which are not signed up.  The reason so much industry is going offshore to China is because it still has a regime which allows irresponsible forms of production and China, to be fair to it, will make the argument that those in the western world caused the problem to date and will ask that it be given a few years to catch up with us.  It is a complex issue and it was well illustrated by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>The Senator also asked about the determination of the price.  It was independent international consultants who established the price at &euro;15 for government-to-government trading.  It was mentioned by Senator Bannon that it could be double, treble or quadruple that figure.  The <Col N="1365"/>reality is that the cost of carbon credits has come down.</P>
        <P>On the purchasing arrangements which we have made to date, to answer another question by Senator O&rsquo;Toole on who certifies the validity of the schemes into which one is making the investment raised, because we have bought through the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction, EBDR, and through the World Bank, we have certification by those agencies as to the validity.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is quite correct.  One of the big dangers in this area is that one will get a grey market.  If Senators will excuse the pun, there is a so-called hot-air market coming out of Kazakhstan or Belarus due to collapsing economies rather than carbon saving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three levels of certification and they are not equally reliable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The international schemes in which we are involved are certified by the agencies through which we will make the purchase.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point is well made.  It would be a matter of policy, which would be established by the Minister, to do that and the arrangements made already are through the EBDR and through the World Bank.  Those are very good schemes.</P>
        <P>To illustrate again one of the reasons we need this framework legislation, we got the opportunity just before Christmas to make a bid for &euro;20 million in carbon credits from the World Bank.  It was a superb scheme and it was difficult to take that opportunity because of our current inflexibility.  I was fortunate to get a period of time in the D&aacute;il where I could get its agreement to purchase the &euro;20 million in credits.  We need the arrangements set up in this framework to allow the NTMA, within the public policy parameters which will be determined by the Minister, to purchase carbon credits.  Although long, that is the answer to a most interesting question.  It is the first time the question had been asked and I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for giving me the opportunity.</P>
        <P>I mentioned that the EPA runs the registry here in Ireland where the units are operated on and the NTMA will register the units with the EPA.  That is where one will find the registration.</P>
        <P>The international transactions are all logged with the UNFCCC.  That is why I am so struck by how perverse the debate in Ireland is.  The executive secretary of the UNFCCC, Dr. Yvo de Boer, spoke about carbon credit purchases at the recent conference in Paris when the scientific report was published.  His contribution was amazing and I wish people from Ireland had paid attention to it.  He stated that carbon credit purchasing was a way that developed countries could be ambitious about their targets to remove carbon from the atmosphere in a way which was not inimical or damaging to their industry and which would meet <Col N="1366"/>the best of all worlds and be positive from the point of view of the developed world.</P>
        <P>The House should remember what I stated in the other House, which sadly was not listened to, that one of the big losers in this entire debate is the developing world.  There is a moral imperative on us in the developed world to remember that in Africa, the issue is not concerns about the nature of the generation station but the reality that they have no energy system.  There is a real danger that the developed world will decant some of its dirty technology into the developing world at this stage because it will be getting away from the older, dirtier technologies.  Instead of tying the developing world to buying second-hand technology which the rest of us have got rid of because it is obsolete, the benefit of the clean development mechanism, CDM, is that it gives the developing world the opportunity to buy into clean technologies without a cost to them.  They have spare carbon because they are at a particular point in their development and that allows us to make the necessary transition from high dependence on carbon to a low-carbon economy.</P>
        <P>For Senators who have not had the opportunity to read it, I wish to plug the White Paper, Developing a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, which outlines hundreds of specific actions.  The White Paper has not yet been discussed in the Seanad but a debate on the measures it proposes may be worthwhile. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, deserves congratulations for producing the document.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly made a valid point in respect of nuclear power.  As every Member of this House knows, I have often bored people by saying that nuclear power is the worst way forward.  It is madness and will inflict the problems of this generation on the generations to come over the next thousand years.  If a nuclear power station was operating in Jerusalem at the time of Christ, we would still be dealing with the dirt it produced.  Nuclear power is not a solution.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole touched on the major problem of the vested interests which try to capture the debate, the best example of which is the influence of the nuclear industry on parts of the UK and elsewhere.  However, the nuclear lobby is not capturing the debate here.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly was correct to point out that the biggest clean energy source in the world is off the west coast of Ireland.  The White Paper on sustainable energy makes a significant and courageous commitment to constructing a quarter scale station off the west coast by 2011 and to scale it up to full production by 2015.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole in particular, for their contributions and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Ryan raised this because this was why I asked about the reference to a retail pharmacy business when the first list of definitions was discussed earlier.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be concerned if that were the case because I do not wish to preclude anyone from starting his or her own business, but I am advised the dispensing role of a hospital pharmacist will count towards the three-year experience requirement.</P>
        <P>Earlier this afternoon, I referred to legal advice the IPU had received regarding the contract negotiations, but I was in error.  I am sorry if that caused to distress to the IPU officials in the Visitors Gallery.  I do not know how I came to the view the advice was from the IPU&rsquo;s lawyers because it was the legal advice of the PDF, the wholesale group, that brought this to the attention of all concerned.  I hope that clarifies the matter and that I am not accused of misleading the House.  I also hope the IPU members who were very upset earlier will forgive me.</P>

	<P>I will not accuse the Minister of misleading the House.  However, I raised the definition of &ldquo;retail pharmacy business&rdquo; earlier because of the reference to it in this section.  The Minister said the definition did not include hospital work.</P>

	<P>I asked if the definition of &ldquo;retail pharmacy business&rdquo; on page 8 included hospital practices because that is vital under this section.  The Minister replied that such practices were not included.  Nobody would set up a hospital pharmacy business if they were not covered under this definition because they would not obtain credit for opening the business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a little confusion.  They are included in the context of their dispensing role to outpatients.  The bulk of their work relates to patients in hospitals.  However, earlier I listed a number of drugs dispensed by hospital pharmacists to outpatients and that is effectively the same as a retail pharmacy business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be ensured these hospital pharmacies provide an outpatient service.</P>

	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 50 hospitals are registered for that purpose currently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister has a few more bites of this cherry before the Bill is passed, will she review whether we need to be more specific and explicit about hospital pharmacies?  There is a considerable amount of unease about it.  As the Minister said, one does not want to push people into a blind alley career-wise against their wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly ensure such people are covered because I would not want a situation to arise where somebody who has worked for 20 years in a hospital pharmacy is not able to open his or her own pharmacy if he or she chooses to do so.  I will ensure that is certain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that section 34 does not state that membership of the committees is confined to members of the council.  However, I would have preferred a more explicit statement that recruitment to the two committees in question was open to those who are not council members.  Earlier the Minister commented on the burden of work that could be involved in respect of a preliminary professional conduct committee and a health committee.  Moreover, given the prerequisite that a majority of the members of each committee should be registered pharmacists, resources may be overstretched.  I understood the Minister to have stated that there would be an entitlement to have people on such committees other than members of the council.  I would have preferred this to have been made explicit in the legislation.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 30, subsection (2), lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;or, if not, in a form acceptable to the Council&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is quite important and pertains to the form of a complaint.  At present, section 35(2) states: &ldquo;A complaint must be in writing or, if not, in a form acceptable to the Council.&rdquo;  I do not like the idea of the first half of a sentence using the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; when it is followed by the phrase &ldquo;or, if not&rdquo;.  It should be obligatory for a complaint of this nature to be in writing.  While I am prepared to entertain arguments concerning those with disabilities and similar issues, the complaint must be in writing.  This amendment suggests the deletion of &ldquo;or, if not, in a form acceptable to the Council&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to listen if a good reason can be put forward.  In principle however, if a complaint is being made which could lead to anything from a reprimand to being struck off from the register of pharmacists, the least one can expect is a written record.  The great advantage of written records is there is a clear record as to the nature of the complaint.  This is not the case with either verbal or e-mailed complaints.  E-mail is still an insufficiently secure or reliable method.  I want to hear a reason for an exception because I cannot think of one.</P>
        <P>For example, in the GAA one can do little in terms of appealing or complaining about anyone except in a written and prescribed form.  Organisations recognise that without a written record, <Col N="1375"/>one enters dodgy territory.  If there is a good reason, I am prepared to listen.</P>

	<P>It is hard to argue against the Senators&rsquo; points.  Much of this was done with a view to making it easy for people who wish to make a complaint from a patient safety perspective.  However, I accept the need to be fair.  Even a complaint that never ends up in a fitness to practice inquiry or that simply goes to a preliminary hearings committee can cause much upset.

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a minor question in respect of section 35.  While I do not wish to be awkward, this matter arose in a different context.  I refer to section 35(3), which states: &ldquo;A complaint may be made on behalf of any person or by the registrar.&rdquo;  I am not being picky when I say this means that a person cannot make a complaint himself or herself.  It can be made on behalf of any person or by the council.  I suggest that a complaint can be made by, or on behalf or any person, or by the registrar.  I ask the Minister to consider this.  As it stands, it appears&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator referring to the wording or to a substantive issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to wording.  Given the subsection&rsquo;s current wording, if I wished to complain about a pharmacist, such a complaint would have to be made on my behalf.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

        <P>Question proposed, &ldquo;That section 42 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of us received representations from people in the profession and one argument put to me was that this is soft in terms of preference for all hearings to be in public.  Section 42 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) A hearing before the professional conduct committee shall be held in public [This is a great start].</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) But it shall be held in private if&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the registered pharmacist or pharmacy owner or the complainant so requests, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the committee is satisfied that it would be appropriate to agree to that request.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I accept on occasion business must be conducted in private.  Even the Houses of the Oireachtas have reserved the right to meet in private under certain circumstances.  I do not think it has ever happened.  The word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; is a bit weak.  A stronger term such as &ldquo;the greater good or public interest demands it&rdquo; would be better.  Bodies such as this should meet in public and complaints should be heard in public.  The bodies are quasi-judicial and we have a strong tradition that all of our judicial activities take place in public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I know we have a great desire to hold everything in public.  However, I worry about the complainant far more than the professional when hearings are held in public.  I frequently see court cases where patients have justi<Col N="1378"/>fied complaints against doctors but when they consider what would come out in court, the case falls apart.  I would not like too much insistence on it being in public.</P>
        <P>The professional would come out of it perfectly all right and he or she would almost certainly have the advice of the professional body and moral support.  Frequently, a complainant is not used to publicity and is horrified to discover what may come out.  While I understand the desire to hold everything in public, and it should be if everyone wants it, I have seen people dismayed.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister saw in the High Court recently where a doctor tried to insist cases involving the most serious sexual abuse of adult patients were held in public.  He knew the women would not continue with them if they were held in public.  It took great courage on their part to go forward anonymously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have certain concerns.  It is not unheard of for people to make baseless accusations against professional people, including pharmacists.  The problem would be with the complainant.  If it were held in public, we would have the old concept of no smoke without fire.  It is covered sufficiently and a certain amount of reserved wisdom must apply in this case.  I am concerned for any professional person.  The merits of each case would have to be studied carefully and the legislation should provide for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel strongly about this issue.  Senator Henry made valid points about the complainant and she is correct.  Most people are terrified of authority, especially the courts.  It is one of the reasons so few people come forward in rape and sexual offence cases.  The few I met who did go forward stated the trial, court and adversarial system were terrifying and wondered whether they would go through it again.  I do not state a fitness to practise inquiry is at the same level.  However, we must make it easy for people to make legitimate complaints.  The committee which will make the decision will have a non-pharmacy majority.  It will not be a committee composed of pharmacists who will state it will be heard in private.</P>
        <P>On the point made by Senator Glynn, I hope that with the new procedure, the preliminary hearings committee, dealing with mediation and health issues being dealt with by the health committee, this will mean only complaints of substance will go before a fitness to practise inquiry.  These reasons include time and money and the fact that one does not want vexatious complaints getting past the preliminary inquiry.  With all the good things happening in Ireland, I sometimes feel we have full-time complainers and whingers who love to complain about everybody and anything.  I hope this legislation will not make it easy for vexatious complaints to be made about phar<Col N="1379"/>macists, doctors or other health care professionals.</P>
        <P>I believe we have the balance right.  With regard to including the phrase &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo;, if the complainant has a wish to hold the hearing in private, it should be taken into account.  Without the complainant we would not have a complaint and the matter would not arise in the first instance.  Many people like to remain anonymous.  The midwives in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda eventually blew the whistle there and to the credit of the health board, it took the matter seriously.  The person most responsible is now involved in the Pharmaceutical Society.  Those people do not want to become public figures.  Giving the decision to the committee is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a comment on section 48(2), just to prove I read all this stuff.  It states &ldquo;The Council may not cancel the registration of a pharmacist or retail pharmacy business on the grounds of a conviction for an offence&rdquo;.  I take it that is an offence unrelated to the nature of this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Senator is reading from subsection (2), which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Council may not cancel the registration of a pharmacist or retail pharmacy business on the grounds of a conviction for an offence unless in the Council&rsquo;s opinion, the nature of the offence or the circumstances in which it was committed are such that, were the pharmacist or pharmacy owner applying for registration, the Council would refuse the registration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am at least happy about the consistency that must apply the same test to cancelling as it would to refusing registration.  Should there not be a little legislative guidance regarding the offences under consideration?  It is undefined.  Are we speaking about a drink-driving conviction or murder or rape?  I presume we are speaking about serious offences.</P>
        <P>This is only a thought but it may be the subject of enormous and lengthy discussion by the council before it would agree on what it is because it is so vague.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1382"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clearly concerned with fitness to practise.  The council&rsquo;s role relates to the capacity of the individual to practise as a pharmacist.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is a breach of planning laws or some other road traffic incident, for example, it is not a reason for the council to act.  It is in the context of the Bill and must be relevant, as the functions of the council would not allow it consider other issues.  It must be in the context of professional conduct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

	<P>No, there is no reason to go over that again.  I believe it was a valid question but the Minister answered it satisfactorily and I am sorry for interrupting her.  There is a clear statement here that people convicted of some undefined offences are not fit to practise.  The matter could do with a little teasing out.  It is only an opinion but the area could end up with enormous arguments.  There is either a minimum penalty or an offence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

	<P>I am unsure whether it is the temerity or caution of the drafters but section 52(3) states &ldquo;The High Court may but need not confirm the Council&rsquo;s decision.&rdquo;  I am absolutely certain there was never any need to put into legislation that the High Court had the power to say no to anything.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made notes about sections 56 and 57 and decided to wait for the debate on section 57.  When in God&rsquo;s name could it ever not be in the public interest to give public notice of any of the issues listed?  What is the point of cancelling the registration of a pharmacist and not giving public notice?  The same applies to restoration, suspension, expiry or attachment of con<Col N="1384"/>ditions etc.  These should clearly always be a public matter and it is entirely pointless to suggest there would ever be a reason not to give public notice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would agree with the Senator.  We will consider the matter.  We could otherwise use &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The point concerns a public notice but will a sign go up in a pharmacy itself if, for example, a pharmacy was to be closed down?  Would there be a newspaper advertisement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is closed down a sign will go up indicating so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is if a pharmacy was to be closed down for a reason, the public might not be aware why it happened.  It may have been closed for other reasons.  Will a sign be clearly displayed in the pharmacy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is closed down, the pharmacy will be closed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not certain there would be a sign.  If we do what Senator Ryan is suggesting it would be a matter of public knowledge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

He or she cannot be struck off a register he or she is not on, but who will investigate the complaint?  In such an instance, could the person apply to be re-registered two years later?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

	<P>As a perennial late payer, I want to protest.  There are complicated procedures to go through to cancel a registration if a complaint is made against that person, but the Bill makes no reference to any court in the case of someone who loses his or her registration for failing to pay a retention fee.  I would appeal to the council, if not to the Minister, to work out a procedure involving a few steps along the way to address such cases.  A person&rsquo;s registration could be lost in the same way and with the same impact as is the case of someone accused of selling drugs to half of the city&rsquo;s addicts.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is important to ensure the term &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is broadly defined.  My definition is from the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>There is a considerable problem with the smuggling of counterfeit drugs, a matter on which Senator Glynn has spoken frequently at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It is important for the authorised officers to be in a position to examine any drug brought into the country and being sold here.  For example, I saw pharmaceutical drugs being sold at a car boot sale in England, for which reason the word &ldquo;stall&rdquo; is relevant.  I hope the Minister accepts my amendment.</P>

        <P>I will refer to a new way to do something on the Internet that has developed in the past three or four years.  Google is an example.  Instead of having documents on a computer, there are Google documents, Google spreadsheets, etc.  Google <Col N="1391"/>guarantees privacy and presents a server through which one can work.  Microsoft will do likewise.  For further consideration, I suggest that this way of storing records is not covered by the Bill.  I am not certain it would be covered by our amendment.  The records would not be stored on the premises.  Before being passed by the other House, it would be worthwhile to examine a definition encompassing new ways of storing data without a physical record on the premises or in the possession of the owner.  The material is probably stored on a Google server in California.</P>

	<P>This section outlines the penalties for all the offences under this legislation.  It provides that they will all be subject to the same <Col N="1397"/>spectrum of penalties.  Are we sure that all the offences that could be committed under this Bill are of equivalent gravity, or has this section been drafted in this way as a convenient catch-all device?  I do not want to delay the House, although we are doing reasonably well for time.  It seems strange to me that every offence under this legislation will attract a penalty from the same spectrum.</P>

	<P>I will be coming back to the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of what the Minister has said and she accepted a great deal of our concerns, it would be very difficult for her officials to study them now, would it be agreeable to accept the Bill to go forward in that way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister plans to make changes to the Bill in the D&aacute;il and will she return to this House then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Many reasonable and useful points were made in this House which informed me and maybe my officials on some issues.  We will discuss the points over the next day and it will be necessary to return to this House with further amendments.  If the Bill is amended in the D&aacute;il, I intend to take up some of the issues I mentioned here today and we will have to come back here with the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will agree to this arrangement but it is not the ideal way to do business.  It is a bit presumptuous to have the Bill in the D&aacute;il tomorrow in an incomplete form.  The Minister is <Col N="1405"/>proposing changes to the Bill even before it goes before the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept it is not ideal but there are constraints of time.</P>
        <P>I thank the Members for a very constructive and informative Committee Stage debate today.  It is clear that Members did a considerable amount of work in a short period of time.  I was impressed and we had a good debate.  There is clearly much interest from the pharmacy profession in this Bill which has been sought for many years.  Due to time constraints I am unable to return at this stage with the amendments I have agreed to consider but I will do so in due course.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader of the House for facilitating all Stages of the Bill this week.  I thank my officials who are a small group of people sitting behind me.  They have been up all night finalising the amendments because I placed a very short timeframe on the work.  It is normal to have a longer period of time between Second and Committee Stages but because of time considerations and events that will happen in the summer of this year, time was not available to us.</P>
        <P>I also thank the two parliamentary draftsmen who have been involved with this legislation and who will be involved in considering some of the very good amendments put forward.  We have already accepted a number of them and the Bill is the stronger for that.</P>
        <P>I will check the issue of brother and sister to ensure we are reasonable in what we do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and her officials.  We support the Bill in general and we welcome the fitness to practise aspect of the Bill which we hope will ensure patient safety.  Fine Gael is very keen to have a patient safety authority to cover all areas of medicine as there is a need for such a body.  I do not envy the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland because it will have a lot of work to do when it is reformed and the legislation is somewhat vague in some areas.  It will be its responsibility to decide on rules and codes of conduct.  Pharmacies have changed in many ways and this Bill will enable them to change further and to meet the needs of patients.  It is important that we follow the New Zealand and Northern Ireland example where pharmacies dispense drugs but will also ensure the patient is taking medication correctly.</P>
        <P>I repeat my call that the pharmacists from the South would be permitted to work in the North and this is an issue which the Minister could take up with her European and Northern Ireland counterparts.  The biggest threat we face is the growing sale of drugs on the Internet to which there is no easy solution but we must redouble our efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and her officials and the Members on all sides of the <Col N="1406"/>House who have contributed in a positive way to bringing forward this legislation which consigns the previous older legislation.  I commend the IPU and the IPS and the hospital pharmacists, who are often forgotten, on their input.  They have made a very positive contribution and lobbied in a realistic and responsible manner.  I accept what the Minister has said.  She has been forthcoming and accommodating.</P>
        <P>When the Bill passes into law, the pharmaceutical profession and the general public will be the beneficiaries.  I welcome what has been done.  I am looking forward to seeing the Bill back in the House to endorse the amendments made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a much needed Bill.  I hope that when it is passed, it will last for 30 years.  With the changes in pharmacy, we need something on which we can rely.  It is a pity everything had to be rushed.  We could have had a great time for weeks, just like when we dealt with the Bill relating to the Veterinary Council when we had really good sessions.</P>
        <P>There is much interest in the House in legislation such as this.  I am very grateful to the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, hospital pharmacists and individuals who all provided us with support and information.  I look forward to seeing the Bill back in the House.  I am sure the Minister will address all of our concerns when she brings it before the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister and her officials on bringing the Bill before the House.  It was a long time coming, but the Minister made a commitment which has been honoured.  The Bill is for the betterment of the profession and patients.  The pharmaceutical profession and society can now move forward.  The profession has been recognised as an integral part of the health service.  Pharmacists can enter the profession and deal with patients on a sound legislative footing.  I thank Members for their contributions and look forward to the early passage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il before it is brought back before this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister deserves compliments.  This is a good Bill which is dreadfully overdue.  It takes political will and clout to get the job done.  There is limited political kudos for either the Minister or the Opposition in dealing with a Bill such as this.  It is not the stuff that persuades the colourful writers in the Sunday newspapers to talk about it.  If they do, they will state we spent a lot of time talking about it and will think that funny too.</P>
        <P>It was a worthwhile debate.  I thank the Leader of the House for allocating extra time which enabled us to go take Committee Stage in a reasonably civilised fashion.  I thank the Minister for her responsiveness to the various amendments tabled by this side of the House.  It was <Col N="1407"/>a positive engagement, as it usually is when the Minister comes before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment the representatives of the pharmaceutical profession who have shown a capacity to respond to rapidly changing events, given that the Bill and the amendments to it were quickly produced.  I also thank them for their maturity.  There is a campaign which suggests that a lay majority on a regulatory body marks the end of civilisation as we know it.  It does not.  It is one way of winning over the public to the belief that a self-regulating profession is also accountable to it and that it is there to serve it, not the self-interest of the profession.  I hope other bodies will begin to listen and learn that a lay majority does not pose a threat, but is a way of advancing the cause of a profession.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister and I look forward to seeing the long list of amendments that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will have to deal with because of the diligence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend the Minister.  It is always a pleasure to have her in the House.  She gives of herself and engages with Senators.  This is a fine Bill and the pharmaceutical profession will be well served by it.  It is historic because it took so long to be brought forward, but the Minister did it, for which I congratulate her.  We have been sitting after the D&aacute;il adjourned.  This is a legislative Chamber in which Bills are subject to great scrutiny.  The Bill was subjected to terrific scrutiny, but the D&aacute;il adjourned three hours ago.</P>
