	<P>I have notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to raise the level of funding for group sewerage schemes to that of group water schemes to encourage more environmentally sound rural planning.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ivana Bacik of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to clarify the reason the rights of children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child were not considered when the Government introduced the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No.1, motion on the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, statements on education, to be taken at the conclusion of No.1 and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, the Minister to called upon for the final five minutes of the debate, and on which Senators may share time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On Tuesday the House debated with the Minister for Health and Children for two hours.  In that time many Members expressed their concerns about the state of the health services, with a particular focus <Col N="1658"/>on cancer services.  Unfortunately since then, two more women who believed they had the all-clear from Portlaoise Hospital have been diagnosed with breast cancer.  This a personal tragedy for them.</P>
        <P>Given the clinical excellence of the doctor appointed to review the cases, no woman should have any concerns.  However, she has been placed in an invidious position, having been on the interview board for the doctor at Portlaoise Hospital and now conducting the inquiry into the same doctor&rsquo;s diagnoses.  This is an arrangement the Government should have avoided.</P>
        <P>The Leader must ask the Department of Health and Children how women who have had mammograms outside the BreastCheck service, which has an excellent record, can continue to have confidence in services provided by private and public hospitals.  Given the devastating results from Portlaoise, is the same review going to be necessary?  Dr. Naughton wrote two years ago to the Department on the matter.  It then sent on his correspondence to the Health Service Executive but yet there has been this scandal in Portlaoise.</P>
        <P>Although the House debated health services for two hours on Tuesday, two more women who attended Portlaoise Hospital have been confirmed with breast cancer.  Women&rsquo;s confidence in hospital services must be at an all-time low.  I remind the Leader in the past ten years two Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, Deputies Martin and Cowen, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, have run the health services at a time of unprecedented national wealth.  This must be the largest disappointment to patients &mdash; the consumers.</P>
        <P>What other questions arise about services, especially given the ten-year delay in the roll-out of breast cancer screening?  It was promised for every part of the country many years ago but it is still not widely available.  Our problems continue in this area of the health service, which is a disgrace.  It is an ongoing issue despite our wealth and investment in the sector.  Members on all sides will agree that it will need ongoing scrutiny from the Seanad over the coming months.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, an extraordinary situation emerged in the UK where the private details of 25 million citizens were lost in the UK post.  The Data Protection Commissioner, Mr. Billy Hawkes, spoke yesterday of similar data risks in Ireland and how we need to be careful on how private data are held.  He said what happened in the UK was a wake-up call for the Irish authorities.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, several Members have raised the matter of leaks from the Department of Social and Family Affairs where private data on individuals held by the Department were passed on to insurance companies and others.  It would be appropriate for the Leader to bring this to the Government&rsquo;s attention.  It would also be worthwhile for the Data Protection Commissioner to attend an Oireachtas committee to outline what <Col N="1659"/>is lacking in Government policy in data protection and the managing of sensitive data which it holds on citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister for Health and Children on the pharmacists matter.  It has been raised twice on the Order of Business by Senators Doherty and Ross.  While I understand and approve of what the Minister is attempting to achieve, I do not understand what the row is about.  It would be helpful for a debate on the issue to clarify certain matters.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Union is not entitled to represent its members to discuss dispensing costs with the Health Service Executive because it would be in breach of competition laws.  As I see it, the Competition Authority will sit down with the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children, both of whom have a consumer interest and are required to give fair value.  This would protect the consumer.  If a discussion among a Department, a State body and the pharmaceutical union about getting the best price for consumers is in breach of the competition legislation then the legislation is an ass and should be changed quickly.  If that is the case, the consumer is losing out.  I am not putting the case for the pharmacists, as I share the Minister&rsquo;s point of view on this issue.  </P>
        <P>I have discovered that pharmaceuticals, like cars in the European market, are placed at different wholesale prices from country to country.  This continues almost 50 years after we began to establish the so-called common market.  The EU Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market, Mr. Charlie McCreevy should examine this issue.  We are being hammered at least in part because of the high wholesale cost of pharmaceuticals based on a price determined by the pharmaceutical companies.  I believe it breaches European legislation and it is certainly in breach of the Treaty of Rome.  I would like us to consider whether the competition authority legislation protects the consumer and examine the European competition legislation which seems to go against the principles of the common market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been significant changes in the country since the Planning and Development Act 2000 was passed.  Most Senators have received a report from the Irish Planning Institute which shows a threefold increase in the number of planning applications in the past decade.  Planners are being swamped by the increasing volume and complexity of applications.</P>
        <P>It may be time for us to review the Planning and Development Act 2000, specifically Part 6, which deals with the role and responsibilities of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I refer not only to this week&rsquo;s decision on incineration but also to the concerns that organisations such as the Irish Rural Dwellers Association have about the make-up of the board.</P><Col N="1660"/>
        <P>Part 5, dealing with social and affordable housing should be also reviewed.  I was disappointed to learn this morning that the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is attacking Clare County Council because it is using the Act to ensure that 20% of housing in the county is social and affordable.  The CIF is concerned that other houses will fail to sell but we should commend Clare County Council and other councils that use the Act to realise more social and affordable housing.  We could send them a message that we support these endeavours by calling for a review of the Act to tighten the legislation.  Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss a review of the Planning and Development Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hannigan may be surprised to know that I support his call for such a debate.  The programme for Government includes the need for a review and updating of planning legislation.  The process would cover several of the areas he mentioned.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Give us the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of today&rsquo;s decision, another commitment in the programme for Government should be instigated instantly, namely, a review of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the legislation that will follow that review.  Senators have recently discussed an ongoing process of derogating political responsibility to stand-alone bodies that has diminished political decision making and democratic accountability.  Today&rsquo;s decision to grant a draft waste licence, which will go to a public consultation process in which the EPA will decide whether it was right to grant the licence in the first instance, is another example of this perversion of democratic principles and the need for the political process to reclaim responsibility in this area.  The House should be united in ensuring this review, as proposed in the programme for Government, happens. </P>
        <P>This is an instance of bullying by institution.  Independent bodies are making decisions for political reasons because powers have been derogated in legislation.  As participants in the political process we cannot stand over that behaviour as exemplified by An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decisions this week.  The inspector&rsquo;s report acknowledges that the policy on waste management incineration is changing but because this has not been put in writing neither the planning inspector nor An Bord Plean&aacute;la will recognise it.  I suspect that the EPA&rsquo;s move today was based on a similar decision.  Policy formation in this area is changing but an attempt is being made to reach decisions in advance of that change.  We all should be concerned about such a process.</P>

	<P>Let us see some action. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, commissioned a report from Patrick Gageby, Senior Counsel, on the death of an infant in Dalkey in 1973, generally referred to as the Dalkey baby case.  At the Coroner&rsquo;s inquest earlier this year Cynthia Owen was deemed to be the mother of the child.  Subsequently the Minister asked Patrick Gageby to review all the files and report on whether further investigation was required.  That report was delivered on time on 1 October last.  Will the Leader ask the present Minister if he intends to take any action on foot of the report?  If the report is to be published will the Minister make copies available to the interested parties before publication?  It is a very disturbing case on which all the parties involved would like closure. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, are on a collision course that would have a detrimental impact on the supply of medication.  I understand Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for clarity and debate on the issue.  The Government has agreed complex pricing structures, with the Pharmaceutical Distributors Federation of Ireland, PDF, the manufacturing side, the wholesalers, and retailers.  Will the Leader arrange for a factsheet to be drawn up for Members of the House, setting out the position regarding the HSE and the IPU?  I have endeavoured to obtain such a sheet for the past few days and have been unable to do so. </P>
        <P>The issue has been raised in other fora at which the Minister appears, asking her to resolve this issue by responding to the dictate issued by the HSE on 17 September that will take effect on 1 December and could have a detrimental effect on patients.  Time is running out &mdash; 1 December is just a few days away.  I ask, therefore, that this House agree a motion without debate that Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls for an independent person to be appointed to help resolve the problems between the HSE and the IPU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald touched on a matter of great importance regarding the interviews which our Data Protection Commissioner, Mr. Billy Hawkes, gave yesterday about the loss of two discs in Britain.  He is concerned about our jurisdiction.   The protection of Irish citizens&rsquo; data is of paramount importance and we are all concerned by the management of confidential data.  Unfortunately, there was a case of such data being handled inappropriately by a civil servant in a particular Department and there may have been other instances.  Given what was said on this topic yesterday, I ask the Leader to arrange an appropriate joint committee to hear <Col N="1662"/>Mr. Billy Hawkes on the subject as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I could sing my contribution but the Leader might not approve.</P>
        <P>Could the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, to come to the House?  An arts Bill was recently passed in both Houses from which came a sub-committee on the traditional arts and great support for traditional arts has emanated from that sub-committee.  A sub-committee was subsequently set up to examine arts in education and I believe its report has been finalised.  I ask that the Minister give Members an indication of the content of the report and the implications of the roll-out of the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>At 4 a.m. today a ship sank at the rocks off Howth and I live nearby.  Within ten minutes a lifeboat was launched and the four men on the rocks were rescued.  I mention this because we tend to forget the amount of active citizenship that exists in this country thanks to people who give their time and effort to be available for work such as lifeboat rescues.  Those of us who heard Mr. Rupert Jeffare on the radio this morning could not help but hang on every word detailing what happened.</P>
        <P>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, receives State support.  I do not know how much, but I raise this matter to draw attention to the fact that it seeks voluntary contributions from us and those of us who use ships rely on the active citizenship its members show.  I asked for a debate on active citizenship some months ago in the previous Seanad and it has not yet happened.  The Taoiseach launched the debate on active citizenship last year with a great deal of encouragement for the practice and it would be useful to have a debate to remind us of the great work being done voluntarily by many people throughout the country.  We do not realise how much we depend on these people but when we really need them they are there to help.  I would like to see a debate in the House on active citizenship soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully concur with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s remarks and I appreciate the <Col N="1663"/>Leader allowing a debate yesterday on the Cawley report which covered the future of fishing in the country.  I come from a coastal community and it a source of serious concern to me that, this year alone, at least eight vessels have sunk.  It gave me no satisfaction last January to visit the widows of two victims of the cruel sea, and the incidents off the Waterford and Wexford coastline occurred owing to a type of perfect storm which saw appalling weather on the night in question.</P>
        <P>Some vessels have experienced difficulties in relatively calm waters and, thankfully, many lives have been saved by the RNLI, helicopter rescue and so on.  I do not seek another debate on the Cawley report but as Dr. Noel Cawley has agreed to oversee the implementation of the report on the future of fishing, perhaps he could also examine the issue of safety at sea.  There are justifiably strict controls in this area and the annual and bi-annual checks on even small ferries travelling to the islands carrying eight or ten passengers are stringent.  Millions of euro have been spent on new vessels and improving boats in Ireland, and the fishing industry, the Department and the Minister must re-examine the issue of safety at sea.  Eight vessels have sunk off our coastline with the loss of seven lives, many other people have been saved, some at the last moment, and there is something radically wrong in 2007 if this must be the case.</P>
        <P>I am not being judgmental regarding what happened last night because I do not have the facts.  In this day and age vessels are obliged to carry radios, flares and other equipment so, following what Senator Quinn said, this is an area that should be examined in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Quinn as Senator Harris and I raised the issue of civility in recent weeks and I think a debate on active citizenship would be appropriate.</P>
        <P>A couple of weeks ago Senator Kelly and I, along with other Senators, raised the issue of the impending crisis facing the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, and the Gaelic Players&rsquo; Association, GPA.  In light of this morning&rsquo;s revelation that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, perceives a problem in allocating the money promised and may have difficulty sourcing it, can the Leader inform the House if we can have a debate in this House with the Minister?  This is an important matter and it behoves the Members of this House to become active because there is a crisis looming, not because of the GAA and GPA but because the Government may renege on a financial commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently received a letter from a local man asking me to raise a sensitive issue in this House pertaining to organ donation.  He has spoken to me eloquently on the <Col N="1664"/>matter since and describes the situation as, in many cases, burying life with death.  Organ donation is a sensitive area, especially for those who have lost loved ones, but it is, nonetheless, an issue that must be dealt with.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has been very generous with her time in this House but another visit to discuss this matter in an in-depth fashion could be very worthwhile.  Proposals could come from all sides of the House and this would make for a pragmatic way of addressing the subject because the situation at the moment is unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>I strongly support Senator Hannigan in his call for a debate on An Bord Plean&aacute;la because the only way in which it is consistent is in its inconsistency.  I was born, bred and reared in the country and we cannot all live in towns and cities.  Rural areas must be taken into account because otherwise a nonsense is made of the concept of rural development which is driven by people.  Without people there will be no schools.  The Leader referred to a situation some years ago on Westmeath County Council that saw three parishes trying to create a team.  This issue is not all about sport but the case given implies some of the difficulties that exist in the area of planning.  Some of the decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent years were nonsense and have been addressed in a sensible way by the Rural Dwellers Association.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of housing estate management previously in this House and it must be revisited because it is not working.  People are being driven out of their houses and are being advised by the Garda to leave.  The offenders remain while those offended against must leave and this does not make for a good situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Very often matters raised on the Order of Business involve a degree of criticism and negativity and, in that context, I was very pleased to hear the contributions of Senator Quinn and others on the heroic example of active citizenship shown during the night.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am pleased to raise another good news story.  Reports in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers outlined the great progress being made in stem cell research.  Latest developments mean it is possible to obtain flexible stem cells from skin cells.  The great medical hope is that it will be possible to develop cures for various diseases through the use of these cells.  Many people rightly had ethical concerns about research involving the destruction of embryos.  However, the latest Japanese research indicates that highly flexible stem cells can be obtained by reprogramming skin cells.</P>
        <P>There remains a need for debate in this area, particularly in regard to the activities of the European Union and the performance of the Government in deliberating on such issues at EU level.  In the debate on EU funding for embryo destructive research, Ireland adopted a shamefully com<Col N="1665"/>pliant position, considering our constitutional principles.  We did not support those countries advocating ethical research, although that argument now seems to be in the ascendant.  In advance of the referendum on the EU reform treaty, there should be a debate in this House on how decisions are made at EU level and the steps being taken by the Government to ensure those decisions are correct.  I heard on the radio yesterday of the terrible treatment of children with disabilities in Bulgarian institutions.  In the negotiations leading to Bulgaria&rsquo;s accession to the EU, the European Commission showed little interest in obliging the Bulgarian Government to ensure its institutions were up to scratch.  Hidden governance is bad governance.  We must discuss how we can have greater scrutiny of the case made by the Government when these types of decisions are made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for a debate on active citizenship.  I concur with his compliments to the Irish Coastguard.  I understand the trawler that sank this morning was out of Wexford.  The points made by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan are also apt.  A debate on this issue would be constructive and useful.</P>
        <P>I fully support the call by Senator Mullen for a debate on stem cell research.  In the lead up to the referendum on the EU reform treaty, it is important that we have several debates in this House on issues relevant to the referendum campaign.  We in this House can take the lead by facilitating those debates.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on abolishing self-regulation within the legal profession and establishing an independent regulatory commission.  I hope this will apply not only to the Law Society but also to the Bar Council.  Exorbitant legal fees and recent revelations cast aspersions on the legal profession in general.  This is unfair because there are many fine people serving within the legal fraternity.  However, it is time that self-regulation came to an end.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ascertain the status of the report of the Competition Authority on curtailing excessive and exorbitant legal fees?  The authority deserves considerable criticism for being so dilatory in coming forward with this report.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, committed to bring forward legislation in this area but there has been no progress.  Action is required urgently and all of us would welcome the publication of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support previous speakers&rsquo; calls for a debate on active citizenship and volunteerism in general.  Time is one of the most valuable resources for people in these busy days.  Those who are willing to contribute voluntarily to our society should be acknowledged on an official level in both Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="1666"/> We must discuss how they may be supported into the future.</P>
        <P>The management of Waterford Crystal formally announced yesterday that 492 jobs will be lost.  The company has been a flagship employer, with almost 4,000 employees in Waterford city and county, and has contributed enormously to both the city and regional economy.  It is a serious blow to the south east.  I welcome the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s announcement of the creation of new jobs in Galway, but he also has a responsibility to Waterford.  I ask that he engage with both management and unions in Waterford Crystal to discuss how State resources can be invested in the city to allow it bounce back from this blow.  Many of the people whose jobs will be lost have worked for the company for decades.  It is a major blow to them and their families, especially in the lead up to Christmas.  All Senators should be concerned by this because something similar could affect their constituencies soon enough.  I ask the Minister to come to the House to explain how this serious blow to the region can be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn and others in their call for a debate on active citizenship.  It is a serious issue in a society whose citizens are generally devoid of time, because volunteerism is dependent on people giving freely of their time.  Volunteerism is also dependent on the education system, which seems to be churning out economic units of activity, namely, employers and employees of the future, rather than trying to create citizens.  Active citizens are not born but created.  Secondary students spend some 99% of their time preparing for the leaving certificate examination so they can secure the points to enter third level education.  The education system does not prepare them for the real world, including such issues as suicide prevention and drug and alcohol abuse.  All that is allocated to such topics is some glib, once-off instruction.  I ask the Leader to facilitate Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for a debate on this issue.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom go dtiocfadh an tAire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus Athch&oacute;irithe Dl&iacute; go dt&iacute; an Seanad le pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an chinneadh a ghlac an Rialtas D&eacute; M&aacute;irt ar na riachtanais a bh&iacute; ann do dhl&iacute;od&oacute;ir&iacute; cumas na Gaeilge a bheith acu agus t&eacute;arma&iacute;ocht Gaeilge a bheith acu.  T&aacute; an riachtanas sin &aacute; bhaint amach as an reachta&iacute;ocht agus n&iacute; bheidh an g&aacute; sin, cumas na Gaeilge a bheith ag dl&iacute;od&oacute;ir&iacute;, ann n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&oacute;ibh de bharr chinneadh an Rialtais.  T&aacute; an cinneadh sin ag teacht salach ar an Ghaeilge.  N&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n c&eacute;ille leis, agus sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil m&eacute; ag iarraidh go dtiocfadh an tAire isteach le pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an cheist.</P>
        <P>For those who are not using their headphones, I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come into the House to address the decision by the Government to remove the <Col N="1667"/>requirement that members of the legal profession have a knowledge of the Irish language.  This is not a sensible approach but rather an attack on the language and on the constitutional rights of those who wish to use Irish in their dealings with the courts.  It will be a costly measure for the State because it will have to provide interpreters for simple legal statements in which members of legal professions were heretofore required to be proficient.  Rather than abolishing the requirements, what is needed is a greater effort by third level institutions and professional training bodies to integrate the Irish language into legal education.  I call for this debate as a matter of urgency because the announcement has been made without any consultation with the Irish language bodies or those providing legal services through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Callely on the dispute between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to come in next Wednesday to explain the procedures relating to the purchase of drugs because it is such a complex area.  Some 1.5 million medical card holders are now very concerned they will not be in a position to get drugs on 1 November under their medical card entitlement.  If that happens, these people will be landed with very big costs if they want to fill prescriptions, which they will not be able to afford.</P>
        <P>The matter is urgent.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Union demonstrated its responsibility when it supported the preparation of the Pharmacy Bill which went through the House this year.  We were briefed by its representatives in a very responsible manner.  All of us in the House would recognise the contribution to society of pharmacists, who are hard-working, dedicated and diligent professionals.</P>
        <P>The approach of the HSE in taking these people on without considering the overall scenario is very serious.  I hope the Leader will use his position to try to bring sanity to the current insanity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There is more competition in the pharmacy business than before.  In Roscommon town, two new companies have opened in the past few years.</P>
        <P>I support the Taoiseach&rsquo;s call to introduce a Bill on the control of solicitors and barristers.  It is about time this happened because the vast majority of these solicitors are very responsible and honourable, yet the banks and building societies have let us all down by lending money to solicitors who have given their word on properties without checking the backgrounds of <Col N="1668"/>these people.  It has caused much doom and gloom in the legal profession and building industry, as titles of properties will now have to be double and treble-checked.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Other speakers have called for a debate on active citizenship and the role of volunteering in society.  Senator Daly in particular hit the nail on the head when he spoke about the important role education plays within this, which I believe should be captured in the debate I hope we have.  The Senator indicated that in many cases, comments and culture encouraging citizenship within our students can be glib and one-off but I disagree with this.  In my experience I found teachers take these matters very seriously and do their best within the constraints they have to discharge their responsibilities to students.  I hope a proper debate on this will lead to more exploration of the issue and ensure the efforts made are not glib or one-off.  They deserve to be taken more seriously.</P>
        <P>The issue we are facing is that many of the responsibilities we traditionally asked of parents and families are now being shifted on to teachers in schools.  They have to pick up the slack in that regard.  With the budget coming up, one of the pressures contributing to that has been the change in our tax system and the move to individualisation, which has undermined to a degree the role which the family can play in discharging those duties.</P>
        <P>I hope when this debate comes up we can properly recognise the role played by teachers in our society and also spend time looking at the role played by the tax system in the issue.  Notwithstanding the pressures suffered by the Minister, I hope measures will be taken to rectify this matter in the impending budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a comprehensive debate on planning, particularly with regard to rural housing.  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, brought in guidelines which were generally welcomed at the time.  We found the implementation of those guidelines to be very diverse, as in some counties the spirit has been very much acknowledged and in other cases the guidelines have been virtually ignored.</P>
        <P>I may have mentioned in the House one sinister development that came to my notice.  In England, there is a planning body which monitors closely and in an exceptional way planning developments here in Ireland.  When it was requested as to whether this applied to other countries, it <Col N="1669"/>indicated it did not and the historical link with Ireland was the reason behind the action.  We should bear in mind the traditional concepts that applied to planning in England and Ireland are totally different.</P>
        <P>Taking the village as an example, the English village and the traditional concept of an Irish village are totally different.  The Irish Rural Dwellers Association, of which I am founding member, has put together an extensive file on contradictions and anomalies which exist throughout the country in regard to planning.  The bottom line still is that the young generation is not succeeding in getting permission to build houses on the family farm.</P>
        <P>We are all for good planning but many of these cases raise very serious questions.  My belief is planning decisions should not only be fair and equitable, but they must be transparent also.  It is vital we revisit the debate we had in this House in the past.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach recently raised the possibility of an honours system, apparently quite seriously.  This is an area which must be considered.  If we are to do so, this House must address the difficulties of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  A heraldry Bill was introduced in here in the last session by former Senator Brendan Ryan but it failed.</P>
        <P>I am advised the difficulties are particularly with sections 12 and 13 of the Act and these could be met with a simple amendment which would regularise the position on the granting of coats of arms and so on.  This may a little arcane but it is something the State does to distinguished international persons.  It also has an impact on tourism.  It would also be appropriate if we considered, in light of gender equality, certain anomalous titles in this country.  I speak particularly of the Knight of Glynn, who simply because he has daughters cannot pass on that ancient, fascinating and rather charming title.  Should we not have equality in inheritance?  This would be a simple legislative matter.</P>

	<P>The Senator has made a strong point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a serious point because there is an inequity against a tiny number of Irish citizens.  We are going to lose something <Col N="1670"/>of the magic of our life.  We should consider the Irish titles.  I say that because my kinsman, Denys FitzPatrick, died at the age of 105 three weeks ago, the last MacGiolla Ph&aacute;draig of his line.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the many calls for a review of our planning legislation.  It is hard to believe the processes which ended up in the 2000 Act began well over ten years ago at this stage.  I wonder how relevant the Act is to the Ireland of 2007.</P>
        <P>There are two contexts in which we should act.  The first relates to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and I wonder how effective and relevant a body can be which sits in judgment on planning applications on one day regarding a massive infrastructural incineration development in Dublin city, and on the next day on a one-off rural house in east Clare.</P>
        <P>In a review of our planning policy carried out by my own party earlier this year, we suggested that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as it is currently constituted, is not representative in any way of all sections of Irish society, and that anybody sitting in judgment on planning applications affecting people&rsquo;s lives over and over again should be far more representative of all sections of Ireland, and the rural areas in particular.</P>
        <P>We suggested there should be three sub-bodies of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that would sit in judgment on planning applications in three non-Dublin constituencies and that these should deal solely with rural planning applications.  It would help if the Minister discussed planning policy in general with us in a manner similar to the way the Minister for Health and Children discussed health during the week, giving a presentation and then answering questions.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the recent EU judgment that scuppers the policy in many county development plans whereby if a rural area is under immense development pressure, provision can be made that only existing members of the local community can build in the area.  I call for a debate on the issue as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On 25 October I called for a debate on cockle fishing in the Waterford estuary and marine conservation.  The Government parties rejected that call and voted against it but I was delighted that the Deputy Leader of the House, Senator Boyle, subsequently said the order I had criticised that allowed for cockle dredging in the estuary, thereby causing a great deal of damage to the marine environment, was being rescinded by the Government.  I give <Col N="1671"/>Senator Boyle credit that today we see a new statutory instrument being laid before the Seanad, SI 753 of 2007, which will prohibit dredging for cockles in the Waterford estuary.</P>
        <P>I am delighted this is being done following my intervention and I hope for a similar result in the matter I raised on the Order of Business two days ago, when I called for a debate on the denial of universal child benefit to approximately 2,000 to 3,000 children because of the habitual residence condition.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on planning issues in rural areas.  When discussing the Planning and Development Act 2001 and the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we should look at the objections to planning applications by holiday home owners.  In Donegal, houses for members of the indigenous community have faced objections from those who own holiday homes.  If those people want to object, they should have to pay at least &euro;5,000, not &euro;20 as is the case at present.  That may require a change in EU law but the Government should pursue that.</P>
        <P>The four HSE regional fora have a critically important role to play in representing the views of local communities.  There are 148 members who represent local communities and the chairmen and vice chairmen should be paid an allowance similar to that paid by regional authorities to their chairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to take this opportunity to congratulate the Department of Health and Children.  Once again, Ireland is the safest place in the world for a woman to have a child.  It is wonderful that Ireland continues to have the world&rsquo;s lowest infant mortality rate and that we lead the world in caring for the mother and the child.  At a time of bad news about the health service, it is good to know there are good news stories.</P>
        <P>There is a need for people, particularly Members of the Oireachtas, to be circumspect about how they say things.  The statement made yesterday that churches were involved in the serious abuse of children is simply not true.  There were individuals involved in such behaviour but every church abhors child abuse and it is against the direct teaching of all churches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been asked about the situation in Lea&rsquo;s Cross in recent weeks.  I have been informed today by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="1672"/>that it followed up on the media reports on the Lea&rsquo;s Cross issue.  The Garda has kept in contact with the DPP&rsquo;s office on the matter and on 14 June it was agreed that they would await receipt of the O&rsquo;Donovan report commissioned by the HSE, at which juncture the issue of a full criminal investigation would again be examined.</P>
        <P>Many Senators expressed their concerns about the final number involved in the investigation into diagnoses from Portlaoise, an increase from seven women to nine.  There are concerns about women&rsquo;s confidence in BreastCheck and the other services being provided.  An excellent service has always been provided and this unfortunate incident gives credit to the centres of excellence and to the assurance by the Minister to the House during her three hour contribution on Tuesday that all tests would be double checked from now on.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Coghlan asked about the data that were lost in the post in Britain, warning that this could happen in Ireland.  It could happen anywhere in the world and we should be alert to it.  I will pass on the Senators&rsquo; views to the relevant Department.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Callely and Leyden expressed concerns about the situation involving the HSE and the pharmacists.  I made this point to the Minister, as did Senator Keaveney, on Tuesday; we were the only people to mention it when the Minister was in the House.  The Minister stated her position and outlined what could be done.  There was to be an adjudication yesterday by an independent assessor that would be binding on both sides.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point, however, is important.  When a union cannot represent its members because of another regulation, that regulation must be amended.  We must discuss that and see what progress can be made.</P>
        <P>The Minister and Professor Brendan Drumm are appearing before the Joint Committee on Health and Children at present and some Senators are already present at that meeting.  Any Senator who wants an update on the pharmacy issue should go there after the Order of Business.  New Members may not realise that they can contribute at a committee with the permission of the Chairman but cannot vote.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan, Glynn, Boyle, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Callanan and &Oacute; Domhnaill all called for a debate on planning.  I give a commitment to the House that I will arrange such a debate as soon as possible.  Senator Boyle also raised the issue of the Environmental Protection Agency, which could be encompassed with the scope of the debate on planning.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan asked for information on the death of an infant in 1973.  I will ascertain whether I can get an update on this subject for the Senator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Quinn, O&rsquo;Donovan, Buttimer, Walsh, Coffey and Daly, all expressed their congratulations regarding the activities of the lifeboat service this morning and the saving of the lives of <Col N="1673"/>those who were in danger.  I will leave aside time to have a debate on this subject and I congratulate all concerned.  In particular I congratulate those who wish to see a debate take place on active citizenship.  Senator Buttimer called for an update on the GPA and the GAA from the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan.  I will make inquiries in this regard and will have a reply for the Senator next week in the House.  I congratulate Paraic Duffy, the new director general of the Gaelic Athletic Association on his appointment.</P>

I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Doherty and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed their strongly-held views regarding the considered proposal for the removal of the Irish language as a requirement for the legal profession.  I will pass on the Senators&rsquo; views to the Minister.  As I noted yesterday, there will be a debate on the Irish language in the House before Christmas and this matter can be taken up then.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for an update on and perhaps to have statements with a view to assisting the Minister in respect of an honours list, of which the Taoiseach is highly supportive.  I can state with certainty that the great Senator Norris himself might be one of the recipients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to have even a brief opportunity to contribute to a debate on this important issue.  A fundamental in everyone&rsquo;s life is the right to education.  When I was made spokesperson I made it clear that it is one of the basic rights.  The better the opportunity given to children from nought to six and from six onwards, the better a society and the better rounded people we will have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will begin by being parochial by referring to statistics pertaining to County Donegal.  I commend the Minister for Education and Science on the investment of &euro;104 million in the schools building programme in the county between 1998 and 2006.  People in Donegal are extremely proud of the &euro;35 million that has been invested in Letterkenny Institute of Technology since 1997 and of the investment in 2007 of &euro;7.5 million in adult and further education in the county.</P>
        <P>A total of 81 primary schools and 12 post-primary schools in County Donegal participate in DEIS and I refer to the impact the programme has made to assist those who are from the most disadvantaged areas.  One knows that a programme is a success when one receives complaints about it.  Many people have complained to me that their school does not participate in DEIS and have asked the reason their schools are being placed at a disadvantage by their non-inclusion in DEIS.  One tries to explain that such schools are being disadvantaged because the schools that qualify for DEIS do so because of their disadvantaged status.  Like everything else, if one raises up all ships to the same degree, one simply perpetuates the disadvantage to those that are most disadvantaged.  The Minister should note that DEIS is working if people are complaining of their exclusion from it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While one cannot outline in ten minutes everything that should be discussed regarding education, I will start chronologically.  Preschool exposure in the nought to six age group requires a collaborative approach.  Potentially this could be between the Minister, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I have carried out much work on the childhood development debate and I have raised this matter on an Adjournment debate with the Minister of State at the Depart<Col N="1677"/>ment of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey.  I refer to the fact that it has been proven that the development of a child&rsquo;s brain is affected most deeply by his or her exposure to music.  I continue to raise this issue because MRI scans show that brain development is different when a child is exposed to music.  We had always considered this to be true but have not always had to hand the newly emerging proof.  As such proof now exists, Ireland should be at the forefront of ensuring that it translates into our early education system.  Heretofore, the debate on early education has pertained in the main to the subject of child care.  This is a financial issue in respect of how much people must pay or otherwise, rather than a debate on content within child care locations.  The media focus on another aspect of child care, namely, whether they comply with the correct standards in respect of cleanliness and aspects other than the content to which the child is exposed.  I do not criticise the child care facilities.  This should be at the forefront of this debate.  It is beyond question that what children are exposed to from birth to age six is important in enabling them to learn at school and cope with the life that primary school presents.  The evidence can no longer be ignored.  We urgently need to plan how we can support our preschool facilities and maximise the science that underpins childhood development.</P>
        <P>In primary schools we have seen great advances in buildings, capitation, minor work, the summer work schemes, the DEIS investment and many other programmes directed at the most disadvantaged.  I hope this increase in resources continues as the cost of running schools rises owing to energy prices among other pressures.  People building new houses receive grants for environmentally friendly measures such as wood-chip burners.  The primary schools inform me that if they got some support towards installing small wind turbines, they might be able to generate their own energy.  We have an element of environmental friendliness among schools through the green schools initiative but we also have a rising cost in the running of our schools.  Schools are reaching out for solutions.  Could the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government communicate on the realistic opportunities?  There are still difficulties, such as connecting green power sources to the ESB grid, but the schools want to be more efficient and get involved in environmentally friendly projects.</P>
        <P>I realise the pressures on the Minister due to areas of significant growth that are putting demands on her resources for primary school buildings.  I ask her to progress the projects that have recently commenced.  The primary schools building programme had seemed to come to a stop for a long time but in the past decade it has moved on, mainly owing to the Minister&rsquo;s intervention.  However a small number of schools thought they were on the way to getting new <Col N="1678"/>buildings but recently received letters telling them everything was on hold.  If I mention the word &ldquo;Clonmany&rdquo; the Minister will remember being there and wondering how it had slipped off the list for so long.  We want to see those schools moving to completion.  I understand that in some places there are no school buildings for children under the age of seven, but there are other places where the conditions are still very bad.  These are few compared with the number ten years ago, but they still exist.</P>
        <P>The Minister is familiar with areas such as Dublin 15 where there has been a sudden increase in the catchment or population and schools must be built or expanded dramatically to deal with the rise in population.  This can be because of immigration or because many houses were built in an area in a short period.  There is a potential for a similar problem in the Border areas because of the so-called grannying issue.  People who moved from Derry to Donegal still send their children to schools in Derry, usually by using the children&rsquo;s grannies&rsquo; addresses in Derry and there has been a court case on it.  If the court case judges that those children must go to school where they reside and not cross back into Derry, we may have a problem that will transcend all age groups, primary and post-primary, and I want the Minister and her officials to examine this urgently in case it becomes a problem.  Schools in Buncrana such as Scoil Mhuire and Cranna College are already under pressure and will be under serious pressure if this changes.  I would like to think we could continue to get feedback from the North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  Much good work is being done but we could have much relevant input from the Border areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must use my remaining time to speak on third level student supports.  We are moving towards the new Bill being brought in so the changes will be statutory.  I implore the Minister to keep an element of flexibility, however she can, in a statutory scheme.  The students and vocational education committees are concerned that the grants have been late every year because forms were not filled out correctly.  They think the forms could be simplified.  The VECs and the councils feel that if they get the powers to process this, it is important they get the personnel to deal with it.  The date on which the grant thresholds are released is late and we want to ensure that it is as early as possible and keep the system as simple as possible.</P>
        <P>There are many other areas I would have loved to have raised, such as strategies for keeping young boys at school given that many of them are leaving to join the construction industry, which is declining.  In the past girls left to join the textile industry.  We must ensure we keep as many people in school as possible, not necessarily in an academic environment but in skills-based education that will help them adapt to career opportunities.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to continue to examine access to third level education.  The introduction <Col N="1679"/>of fees in the North has been a bad step for Donegal students.  I would like to think that through the North-South Ministerial Council the Minister could put pressure on Northern Ministers to prioritise the removal of third level fees in the North.  It was done in Scotland.  This is impacting on Donegal students and minimising their ability to get involved.  To deal with the entire world of education in our allocated ten minutes is impossible, but I thank the Minister for her time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge her courtesy to my three sons when they recently visited Leinster House.  The Minister chatted to them and they were taken with her description of the Seanad as a centre for talented adults.  I hope today&rsquo;s debate confirms that.  This is a significant debate on an important area.</P>
        <P>Education is the greatest catalyst for opportunity we have.  It liberates and empowers people.  A holistic education is the greatest gift we can give children and adults.  We cannot forget that the greatest resource in our education system is our teachers.  We have an extraordinarily committed, professional teaching force at primary and secondary level.  They have adapted to new curricula, multiculturalism, changes in population structure and the complexities of modern society with great ease and professionalism through personal stress and effort.  They invest hours beyond the school day in doing so and we must not lose our sense of gratitude to our extraordinary teachers.</P>
        <P>In the context of creating equality of opportunity in a society founded on egalitarian principles, the creation of a State system of preschooling or the mainstreaming of what is happening in child care is of critical importance.  My colleagues in the Labour Party will have much to say on that.  Much is being done at community level and great work is being done through community child care groups.  However this is patchy and the costs can be prohibitive, even with subvention.  With little capital expenditure we could create a preschool system, and we should do so.  There need be virtually no capital expenditure because many buildings will have been obtained through the capital grant schemes over recent years for preschools at all community levels, and those buildings are available for use.</P>
        <P>There are also resource houses in many communities which could be used.  Through an imaginative use of the school day many primary schools, or sections of them, could be used to create a preschool system.  Nothing could more militate against disadvantage than a State preschool system.  It is very necessary.  Obviously, it could have a voluntary dimension but it should be developed by the State.  If it is to develop incrementally it should focus initially on disadvantaged areas but I do not believe it should <Col N="1680"/>be incremental.  Radical plans should be put in place to provide it.</P>
        <P>In a recent collection of essays, Fergus Finlay of Barnados drew attention to the fact that Ireland rates with Turkey, or is below the radar, in the OECD in terms of its contribution to preschool education.  That is very serious, and we should do something about it.  I commend the provision of preschool education to the Minister as an important social reform.</P>
        <P>When the Minister was last in the House I raised the obvious need for advance planning to cater for the new commuter belts and the movements of population.  This is clear even in my constituency where many people have moved and continue to move from Dublin to live in the south Cavan area.  This is great news to the extent that the population is being augmented and we welcome that.  However, there is a crisis with space.  There must be more planning and the Department will have to be more visionary in identifying where population growth is occurring and liaising with various bodies, such as the planning authorities, to identify those areas and to put in place infrastructure.  We did not use the builders enough, particularly during the boom.  There was not enough emphasis on requiring builders to create this infrastructure in large estates by contributing to the building of schools and providing areas for them.  Far more could be done in this regard.  It is important that we get this issue resolved and that, in future, we do not simply react to development but are involved at the outset of the development by ensuring the provision of educational facilities.  We are familiar with the cases that arose in north County Dublin this year.</P>
        <P>It remains important on every public occasion to acknowledge the enormous contribution, when nobody else would make it, of the Catholic Church to the provision of education in this country and to acknowledge the voluntary investment of people and resources in that regard.  In any new configuration of education provision to cater for multiculturalism and new population centres, the role of the church should never be ignored and compensation, where it arises, should be paid.  It should be a real part of the ongoing structures.  We must also acknowledge people&rsquo;s right to denominational education should they wish to have it, as most people do.  This is important, particularly in my constituency, where minority communities, such as the Church of Ireland, Presbyterians and other faiths, wish to preserve their identities and personal lifestyles.  They want schools to preserve their ethos and we must be cognisant of that.</P>
        <P>Immigration is extraordinarily important at present.  Currently, there are 28,000 pupils in our schools who do not speak English as their first language and 35% of pupils are not English speakers.  The provision of English classes for parents is important.  There are developments in this area but more could be done.  Will the Minister outline how this is progressing?  Immigration <Col N="1681"/>should be seen as an opportunity.  All empirical research suggests that the influx of new people, cultures and personalities into classrooms only increases academic excellence rather than the contrary, if the resources are put in place.  It will be necessary to maintain the number of teachers in order that they can provide English classes for both pupils and parents.  We must also continue to be conscious of integration.  Given the recent occurrences of social disorder in Paris and other places arising from ethnic tensions and immigration, we must take the opportunity to prevent similar problems occurring here.</P>
        <P>Discipline remains a huge issue in schools, despite the high calibre of the teaching profession.  All schools should have to accept their share of disadvantaged pupils; there should be no cherry-picking.  The Minister told the TUI congress that the Department is conducting an audit of enrolment policies and statistics in schools.  What was the outcome of that audit?  Are all schools coping with the inclusion of special needs pupils, Travellers, non-nationals and students of all communities and classes?  There is a two tier system but can the Minister confirm we are not contributing to it but doing everything to prevent it?  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on the grind schools as reported in the national media today.  The bottom line is that we should have in place policies to prevent schools acquiring an in-built advantage in that respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague Senator Buttimer will speak about the National Educational Psychological Service or NEPS.  There are problems with the lack of availability of the NEPS throughout the country.  There is still a huge time lag between the time a difficulty is identified by the teacher in the classroom and the subsequent assessment.  By the time intervention occurs, the problem can be too far advanced.  What is the Minister doing about this?  There is still an inadequate number of educational psychologists.</P>
        <P>The director of Teagasc, Professor Gerry Boyle, a native of the Minister&rsquo;s county, recently made the point that the university modular system should be used to halt the flight from the land and to facilitate working with industry, communities and so forth.  In particular, he said some of the modules in university courses could be used to assist both awareness of agriculture and investment in agriculture and diversification.  Perhaps his suggestion would be examined.</P>
        <P>Finally, will the Minister explain what is being done in schools in the life skills education area to tackle substance abuse and the issue of teenage pregnancies?  What courses are in place?  There is overall pastoral care in the schools and the teachers and school authorities do their best but what is provided of a structured nature?  Schools must be used in a holistic sense to provide life skills for dealing with issues such as teenage pregnancies and addiction.  In addition, pupils should be trained in the acceptance of ethnic diversity.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="1682"/>response on how we are progressing in those areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge her willingness to give so much of her time to listen to the concerns of Members about the entire spectrum of education, from primary to third level and beyond.  I agree with many of the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and would welcome further debate on them.  However, I will not dwell on them aside from observing that education must be holistic and the issue is how our educational system can give a rounded education to young people by using that approach.</P>
        <P>I intend to focus my remarks on the points system for access to third level education.  There have been many debates on reforming the points system.  The Points Commission report was produced in 1999.  It agreed that the points system is still the fairest and most transparent.  It has been recognised as such by applicants, parents and the education providers.  That is its strength.  However, I always have been concerned that the holistic aspect of education is being lost in the process of achieving enough points to secure access to third level education.  What has always concerned me about grind schools, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned, is that the reason for their existence is the colossal number of points necessary to get into third level colleges.  Do the people who come out of this have a properly rounded education?  We must consider this again.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Government has put a lot of money into the development of post-leaving certificate courses and the allocation of places.  However, although this represents an alternative route into third level education, somehow the message is not getting out.  People still have a perception that if they do not go to university they do not have a proper third level education.  They do not consider the post-leaving certificate courses, which are an excellent path to certificate and ordinary degree courses and from there to honours and postgraduate degrees.  This area does not get enough attention.  The money is there and there are many courses with more than 30,000 places.  All third level faculties can be accessed through this route, although it takes a little longer.  This means that students can study at their own pace and according to their own abilities rather than being under colossal pressure to get 500 or 560 points.</P>
        <P>The points race is soul-destroying and it is destroying our education system.  This makes me wonder whether we should consider some changes to the leaving certificate examination, such as giving students a second bite of the cherry in one year.  If a student has done extremely well but misses out by a few points on medicine, perhaps he or she should be given a second chance in August rather than taking a full year.  I acknowledge that the Minister has tried to reform entry into medicine by introducing a new system, <Col N="1683"/>which is to be welcomed.  However, this adds three or four more years onto the course.  Could we allow students to have a second chance at the leaving certificate exam in the same year?  I have been pushing for this since long before I came into this Chamber.  We did have a system in which one could take two examinations in subsequent years and share the points, which was dismissed because of competitiveness in the market.</P>
        <P>I am no longer concerned about entry into any course other than medicine.  Other courses available today have alternative means of access.  For example, those who want to study veterinary science can do a health science course in the Institute of Technology in Carlow followed by a veterinary course in Scotland or Wales.  Many other career paths have similar alternative means of entry.  The only one that does not is medicine, as the Minister has acknowledged.  This is something about which I feel strongly.  I would love to find out how many of us know old-fashioned doctors with a lovely bedside manner who needed no more than leaving certificate chemistry and biology to get into medical school.  Many of these turned out to be superb doctors.  I would love to see a return to the days when one did not have to achieve 550 points.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who have a natural ability should find a path into third level education.  I refer in particular to the old-fashioned medical man who has a good bedside manner, not the academic achiever who does not want to sit and listen to a patient talking about his or her illness, although very often the patient may need a chat or a psychological assessment rather than a clinical assessment.  That tradition is fading and I blame the points system.  We should reconsider this, particularly in relation to medicine.  I do not worry about the other areas.  </P>
        <P>Another worry is that there is now access to European universities.  For example, young students can go to university in Budapest.  If they study chemistry and biology they can access universities on the Continent with reasonable leaving certificate results.  However, should we allow this to happen?</P>
        <P>I am very interested in reform of the points system.  The system is fair and transparent but there are weaknesses.  I know the Minister is interested in that area and I would like to hear her views.  Unfortunately I will not be able to wait for the Minister&rsquo;s reply as I have to be somewhere else shortly, but I appreciate her coming here and listening to the points I have raised.</P>

	<P>I wrote a letter to the Minister this week with a PS which contains a tongue-in-cheek story of a recent experience.  By the way, I must point out that the Minister&rsquo;s officials are always helpful and pleasant to deal with.  This is not a personal criticism as the fault is in the system.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; chomh maith go raibh rud ar an gcl&aacute;r inn&eacute; that was mentioned by Senators Norris and Ormonde and me.  It has come to our attention that the Dublin Institute of Technology, the largest third level institution in the country with 21,000 students, does not have access to the Irish Research eLibrary, IReL.  The biggest third level institution is being kept out of the club by the universities.  This is wrong and I ask the Minister to investigate.  I do not have time to develop this point today.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom caint mar gheall ar rud eile at&aacute; pl&eacute;ite eadrainn cheana f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil deacrachta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la eadrainn mar gheall ar an tumoideachais.  Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla rud beag a r&aacute; ar an &aacute;bhar sin.  Tuigim c&aacute;s an Aire ar an gceist seo.  N&iacute;lim ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil aon merit ann &mdash; t&aacute;.  Teasta&iacute;onn uaim an rud at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l againn &oacute; thaobh na Ghaeilge de a mhini&uacute;.  I do not fall off the chair on this.  N&iacute; amh&aacute;in go bhfuil aidhm oideachais i gceist &mdash; t&aacute; aidhmeanna polaiti&uacute;la agus cult&uacute;rtha i gceist freisin.  In that regard, certain compromises have to be made.  Tuigim an arg&oacute;int at&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ag an Aire &mdash; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh balance i gcuraclam na scoile.  I agree, and I have fought for that all my life.  That is why I have sympathy for the Minister&rsquo;s position.  Ar an dtaobh eile den sc&eacute;al, t&aacute; na scoileanna seo ag iarraidh cuir i gcoinne an chult&uacute;r B&eacute;arla as a dt&aacute;inig na leana&iacute;.  They are trying to achieve a balance <Col N="1685"/>with the previous lives of the children.  To that extent, t&aacute; s&eacute; an intinn ag na scoileanna go mbeadh na p&aacute;ist&iacute; tumtha agus s&aacute;ite sa Ghaeilge ar feadh c&uacute;pla bliain, agus ansin tugtha thar n-ais go dt&iacute; an ghn&aacute;th-curaclam.  Braithim go bhfuil an-arg&oacute;int acu agus t&aacute;im ar aon taobh leo.  As the Minister knows, I have spent most of my life ag cogadh agus in full warfare leis na heagrais&iacute; Ghaeilge, ach an t-am seo caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go dtuigim an m&eacute;id ata ar si&uacute;l acu and I agree with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will have a debate here on the budget.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s expectations of the Government with regard to simple things such as doubling the capitation grant for primary schools.  There are children here today who are working hard with their teachers and boards of management.  Can they bring back the news that they heard from the Minister for Education and Science that the primary school capitation grant will be doubled, as was indicated if not promised by the Minister in her speech at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis earlier in the year?  We will park the issue of class sizes until that day comes.</P>
        <P>What is happening with the school building fund?  Tracking a school building project is like finding one&rsquo;s way around a maze.  My office is like a crime scene investigation at the moment.  For example, a school received permission in 1998 for a building project and received another letter in 1999, but the project was moved from one section to another and the school must go on a new priority list every year.  It is not working out in that sense.</P>
        <P>When will we see the investment in information and communications technology in primary schools and in post-primary schools which was promised in the budget and which is on the Minister&rsquo;s plan?  As as far as I am aware, and I would be happy to be corrected on this, the money for it has not been put in place.</P>
        <P>As we do not often get a chance to talk about the school curriculum because we are always in the trenches and at war, I want to look at it generally.  If I could take over this island for a short period, I would rewrite the school curriculum.</P>

	<P>I tried to do it in other lives but I could not convince my own side, never mind Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s side.  An rud at&aacute; i gceist agam n&aacute; seo.  An exercise I have tried with people on many occasions is to look at education in terms of serving the community and at the kind of community we now want.  If one takes a group of people and asks them what qualities they want to see in the next generation of Irish political leaders, and takes another group and ask them what qualities they want to see in the next generation of Irish church leaders,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and if one does the same in the case of trade union leaders, business leaders, etc., they tend to come out with the same list.  There are attributes such as creativity, risk taking, articulation, leadership, tolerance, mercy and others which one cannot measure and for which one cannot get points in the leaving certificate or in any examination.</P>
        <P>How does one deal with that?  We should have a clear objective of the kind of society we are trying to create and then ensure that somewhere along the way those issues are addressed in the curriculum.  Cardinal Newman stated that the first quality of an educated person was tolerance.  Where do we teach tolerance?  I acknowledge that teachers and adults try to give good example.  Where do we state, for example, that we tried at least to infuse that idea into people and where does it come into the curriculum?  There should be an element of that in the curriculum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am winding up at this stage.  I have gone over my time.  Although I have more to contribute<Insert>,</Insert> that would take an hour and a half.  I thank the Minister for coming in to take the debate.  I look forward to her responses and I hand over to Senator Norris.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing his time because he is an expert in this area and would like to make a longer contribution.  I am grateful to him.  I also welcome the Minister.</P>
        <P>Since we started this morning on the Order of Business with an outburst of good news from all sections, let us look at some good news.  In my case, I draw attention to the fact that my old university, Trinity College, for the first time entered the first 60 universities in the world.  This is a significant achievement for a small island such as ours and I am very proud of that.  I am even prouder that DCU entered the first 200 and that is a terrific achievement for this relatively new university.</P>
        <P>I also support those who have spoken about the question of the Irish research electronic library initiative.  It would be scandalous if, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has alleged, it is the universities that are mean-mindedly excluding the DIT.  If that is so, as a university representative I do not stand over it.</P>
        <P>I have two slightly thorny issues which the Leader directed me to raise here.  The first is the question of the four Protestant schools who are in contention.  I realise there is a court case, but I want to lay out a couple of ideas in this debate.  It seems there is a problem, especially with regard to lack of consultation.  The Minister is shaking her head but the reason I say this is because they were bundled together with a group which apparently did not represent their point of view.  The Irish School Heads Association, ISA, stated before the negotiations that it did not wish to accept this and that it would not take it on board, but it does not enjoy negotiating rights.</P><Col N="1687"/>
        <P>I find difficulty in anything to do with ethos.  I really hesitate in such matters.  I had great difficulty even with the Adelaide Hospital issue.  I supported their position for certain clearly defined reasons and do so in this matter as well because it seems appropriate for a school to be allowed an interview to ensure the teachers fit in.  It also respects the teachers.</P>
        <P>Some of the schools that have closed, such as Greendale community school, were excellent.  I have met the teachers from that school.  It is not respectful simply to redeploy them willy-nilly and put them into schools that are hesitant about employing without the teachers undergoing an interview.  It is not a sectarian matter.  For example, I go to St. Patrick&rsquo;s grammar school every Sunday.  Some of the boys, who are not only in the school but sing in the choir, are not members of the Church of Ireland.  They are Roman Catholic.  Therefore, it cannot be a sectarian matter.  It is a question of bullying.</P>
        <P>It was stated on radio that this question of protecting an ethos, which is a difficult and sensitive area for a variety of reasons, would be cast aside in the interests of the question of pay.  In other words, money was more important.  I wonder whether that is true.</P>
        <P>In the light of this attitude towards the Protestant schools, I ask the Minister to look again at the exemption of all the religious schools from the operation of the Equality Tribunal and the equality legislation.<b> </b> I say so in particular because of the question of the sexual abuse of children.  I am in receipt of material from victims of the situation who do not know whether they still have criminal records.</P>
        <P>I will end with this, which is from a victim in this situation:</P>
        <P LI="1">[These children] were not given a basic minimum education, or proper moral, intellectual and social guidance. ... Their parents were not respected nor helped to provide a family life for their children who were taken from them. ... In their recent attempts to rectify these wrong doings, the Religious Orders, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, Ireland and the Attorney General, have all failed to make discovery of documents, notes, records or memoranda in their possession, thus undermining any possibility of abuse victims getting true justice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The person further states that this applies to records of detention, case histories, and continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Reformatory and Industrial School records and other documents are missing or have deliberately been &lsquo;lost&rsquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">So too have details of children being put into care, copies of court proceedings and correspondence from the next of kin.</P><Col N="1688"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Medical records are missing, including dental records, hospital attendance and inspections by doctors of institutions.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">[As a result] details of complaints against any member of the Religious Orders, lay staff, child minders or gardeners, regarding allegations of abuse are missing.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Similarly, complaints in relation to corporal punishment have not been made available and in most cases have not been preserved.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There has not been any submission to the Ryan Commission or any fully enforced request for this, of accounts of money paid by the State to the Religious Orders for work in institutions and how it was dispersed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This comes, not from me but from agonised victims.  They feel strongly that they have, once again, been let down by the State because of the absence and destruction of records.  They are not informed even whether they have a criminal record because, as small children, sometimes under the age of criminal responsibility, they were placed by the State in institutions.  They deserve an answer to that, just as I hope we will get an answer on the thorny question of the ethos.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister would address also the issue of ethos.  It is intolerable that it would be legally permissible for an upstanding citizen, a teacher like me, legally to be fired because of his or her sexual orientation.  I know the case history on this.  It was not on this island where there has not been such a case but in Scotland where the precedent lies.  I had complaints against me in Trinity College on one occasion, but not as a teacher because I was good at my job.  The Minister knows that what happened in this case is intolerable.  I know it is, too, which is why I ask her to address the issue of ethos.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for coming again to participate in this debate on education.  This is her second time in the House in the past two weeks and it is appreciated.</P>
        <P>Education is an important issue.  As we are all aware, there have been many crises in the educational system of late due to the rapid population growth and the influx of people of different ethnic and national backgrounds, which puts a certain pressure on the traditional model of educational provision in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a few points I want to raise with the Minister, some of which I raised on the previous occasion she was in the House but which are important and need to be emphasised.  The greatest challenge for this country is the provision of new schools and the upgrading of existing schools, and that comes down to the issue of adequate funding.  In the programme for Government we have made a commitment to invest &euro;4.5 billion in providing new schools and improving existing ones.  That is a clear commitment for <Col N="1689"/>which the Green Party pushed strongly.  We saw the need to respond to the demand for educational facilities in this country.  However, I acknowledge that we are facing into difficult budgetary conditions and the Green Party must lend its support to the Minister in negotiating for and advocating the provision of that level of funding.</P>
        <P>Education is a priority area.  One of the most basic commitments in the Constitution is to provide for free primary school education for all our children and it is unacceptable that we cannot do so because of a lack of facilities for which there is a clear need.  The Green Party will support the Minister in ensuring the education sector gets the type of funding committed to it in the programme for Government, within the difficult budgetary situation we face.</P>
        <P>My second point concerns the necessity for proper planning and information exchange between local authorities and the Department of Education and Science on the provision of new schools, both in terms of identifying and securing sites and the building programmes.  We have made a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a developing areas unit in the Department of Education and Science to liaise with the local authorities to identify where new schools are needed and to ensure they are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.  I would encourage the Minister to ensure that unit is up and running as effectively as possible.  The exchange of information is a two-way flow.  I am aware in the development plan guidelines for local authorities there is also a requirement that local authorities would liaise with the Department and provide it with information, which the Department cannot access otherwise, of areas of population growth within their jurisdictions.  This two-way flow of information will ensure we are aware, in advance, of the likely areas of population growth and we will be able to plan both the identification and securing of sites and the building of schools so that they are delivered along with the housing and other development that occurs in these areas.</P>
        <P>Another issue touched on in the programme for Government, and one on which I would be interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view, is the commitment made to improve the arrangements for acquiring sites for schools.  On the previous occasion she was in the House, the Minister acknowledged that this is a serious problem because the price of land, usually in areas of rapid population growth, is at a premium and it is difficult for the Department of Education and Science to afford the prices and often must enter into negotiations with local landowners and so on.  The issue of cost is a major consideration for the Department in terms of the provision of schools.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Minister that the issue of empowering the State to compulsorily purchase land for the provision of school sites would be considered by the Government because while in <Col N="1690"/>some developments it may be possible to negotiate with developers and have the developer provide a site as part of an overall integrated development plan, in some cases it is not.  There would be strong public support for the State to intervene in such situations.  The all-party Oireachtas committee that examined the implementation of the Kenny report was of the view that no changes to the Constitution were necessary to implement the provisions of that report.  The Kenny report sought to empower local authorities to be able to purchase land at agricultural prices plus 25%.  I would argue that the same provision could be used by the State to compulsorily purchase land for the provision of essential educational facilities that cannot otherwise be provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue I want to raise with the Minister &mdash; we mentioned it on a previous occasion &mdash; is the need for the designation of more strategic development zones.  We are all aware of the success of the Adamstown model.  It was one of the three strategic development zones identified in the Planning and Development Act 2000, the others being in Fingal &mdash; Hansfield &mdash; and in Navan.  There are areas of intensive population growth throughout the country and perhaps that should be re-examined.  The success in the Adamstown model of building a school within a ten month period and ahead of schedule is something that should be available to other areas of similar population growth, albeit perhaps not as large as the Adamstown site which was more than 200 hectares.  These strategic development zones should become part and parcel of the way we do our planning.</P>
        <P>Another issue is the ability of local authorities to oblige developers to fund the provision of new schools.  Under the local authorities development contribution scheme, there are many works in respect of which local authorities can implement development levies on developers.  They are usually carried out by local authorities &mdash; parks, playgrounds and so on.  Unfortunately, as matters stand, section 48 of the Planning and Development Act does not allow the local authority to oblige developers to fund educational facilities.  I ask the Minster to examine the possibility of having that section of the Act amended to ensure local authorities are in a position to require developers, as part of development contribution schemes, to make contributions towards the development of new educational facilities as part of any developments they carry out.</P>
        <P>In the programme for Government we have made a commitment to ensure new schools are designed for multi-purpose use.  That should be encouraged because there are many possibilities for school buildings to be used outside of school hours for community groups and other purposes.  Will the Minister indicate if that has been factored in to the design of new schools?</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the policy of tumoideachais about which there is a great deal <Col N="1691"/>of concern.  I am aware the Minister is keen to see some English language education introduced at an early stage in the Gaelscoileanna but the Gaelscoil community has requested that this decision be at least deferred until adequate research has been carried out.  The international research indicates that young children are very versatile and have an amazing capacity for language acquisition and that the exposure to two or three languages simultaneously does not take from their abilities to acquire any one of those languages.  It is a very well thought out policy and one that is considered vital to proper immersion in the Irish language in terms of the service the Gaelscoileanna provide.  Will the Minister defer that decision at least until sound research into the policy change has been carried out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  In many ways the Minister for Education and Science and her Department have failed our children; I outlined some of those failures in my previous contribution some weeks ago.  The lack of planning regarding the provision of first and second level schools throughout the country, but particularly in the growth areas such as north Dublin, Dublin 15, Kildare and Meath, is a scandal.  The net effect of current Government policy is large class sizes,  no places for children until they are five years of age, prefabs instead of proper classrooms and parents being obliged to queue for days and nights in the elements to get their children into the school of their choice.  The provision of necessary infrastructure, including the building of schools, must take place in tandem with residential development and the schools must be built before the houses are occupied.  I understand some real progress is being made on that area now, particularly in Fingal, but that must be conditioned in all planning applications.  While that is a role for planning authorities, the Department of Education and Science must take ownership of the school planning process within an integrated framework.  Governments must provide an education for all the children of Ireland equally and guarantee that no child is denied access to education because of his or her religious beliefs.</P>
        <P>Following the unacceptable school crisis this September, some weeks ago we called on the Government to put a motion before this House in Private Members&rsquo; time to establish a national convention on education involving the education partners, politicians and social partners which should address, among other matters, the management of primary schools in a changing Ireland, enrolment policies, domestic and European equality legislation and the planning and building of schools in new communities.  Following that debate, we remain convinced of the merits of such an approach, and I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s position on that following the debate.</P><Col N="1692"/>
        <P>Education is the key to Ireland&rsquo;s future.  With our changing society it is vital that proper integration occurs at the earliest possible age.  The Balbriggan crisis, caused by poor planning by the Department of Education and Science, was a major setback in that regard.  That 95% of the children who were enrolled in the emergency school were black is outrageous and does nothing to facilitate the type of integration that is required in our new multicultural society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will refer briefly to the area of third level education.  We believe third level education is a right and not a privilege to be bought by a few.  That is the reason education is at the core of what the Labour Party refers to as the fair society.  We believe everyone deserves a chance to reach his or her full potential, regardless of class or income, not only for that person&rsquo;s own fulfilment but for what that fulfilment ultimately provides to society and for the country as a whole.  That is the reason we abolished third level fees in 1996, breaking down barriers for those who had benefited from free second level education but who were then told they could go no further.  We believe this is as true of undergraduates studying part time as it is of full-time students and that the continued existence of fees for part-time students is unfair.  Part-time fees for all first-time undergraduates should be abolished.  Will the Minister consider doing so soon?  In many cases, these undergraduates are struggling to keep the show on the road with families, etc. and to recover lost opportunities.  Their deserving efforts should be encouraged.</P>
        <P>The illiteracy rate of 30% among disadvantaged children is a scandal and must be eradicated.  One in three children in disadvantaged areas has serious problems with basic mathematics.  There has been no real improvement in standards in recent years and the gap between children in disadvantaged areas and the national average has widened, which is shameful given the amount of money available but wasted in these most affluent of times.</P>
        <P>Children have no chance of breaking the cycle of poverty if they cannot read.  The national anti-poverty strategy set a target to halve the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006, but it was not worth the paper it was written on because there was no effective strategy to achieve it.  The Labour Party believes that targets must be set and achieved through a series of integrated actions beginning with early intervention, namely, ensuring every child gets at least one year of preschool education.  International research shows that children who avail of preschool education do better at every level of education thereafter and in life.  Providing it free of charge is the only way to ensure it will occur.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
        <P>By detecting difficulties at an early age and continuing to measure each child&rsquo;s progress through school, we will ensure the necessary supports and interventions are provided so that <Col N="1693"/>young people will attain basic skills in school.  Smaller classes, ongoing training for teachers, one-to-one programmes, the involvement of parents, use of technology and greater library provision in schools are essential elements in tackling literacy and numeracy problems effectively.  Educational opportunity is the most effective way to break intergenerational poverty, which still prevails strongly in our rich little country.</P>
        <P>Physical education must be given the prominence it deserves in primary schools.  According to figures reported in the media recently, the amount of time children in Irish primary schools spend on PE is unacceptably low when compared with the rest of Europe.  In some primary schools, PE is not taught owing to a lack of facilities.  In many cases, prefabs have taken over the only play facilities available to schools.  This is a significant problem.  Lack of time and resources and a culture of placing sport and fitness outside the general curriculum contribute to Irish schools languishing behind their European partners in terms of PE.</P>
        <P>The failure to encourage children to exercise regularly and to educate them about the importance of sport and fitness stores up major problems for the future for overall health and well-being.  Official figures indicate that there may be as many as 300,000 obese children in Ireland and the situation is not improving.  There should be adequate provision for PE in every school because it has become the poor relation.</P>
        <P>Swimming is probably the best overall form of exercise for children, but not enough schools have access to pools.  Often, schools that can make swimming available are forced into charging children for the privilege.  The Labour Party would support any proposal by the Minister to develop a fund specifically for the use of schools which want to include swimming in their PE activities.</P>
        <P>We need to provide funding so that schools can upgrade their PE and sporting facilities in association with local sporting bodies where appropriate, as is occurring in some places.  Funding should be made available for the provision of specialist sport and physical education teachers for all primary schools, especially in the most underprivileged areas.  Physical education is an important area of education.</P>
        <P>My opening comments were to the effect that, in many ways, the Minister and the Department have failed our children.  Let us not waste time in putting it right.  The budget will provide an early opportunity and I look forward to its educational content.</P>

        <P>The country has a fortunate quality of education.  No matter the side of the political divide on which people are, we would all accept that our education system has helped to create our economy and society, including its proud and confident young people.  From speaking to schools and students, much of the credit must go to our quality teachers.  I have spent time discussing with other countries their education systems and they are all envious of the high calibre of people we continue to attract into teaching.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The top quartile of leaving certificate students are going into primary teaching, which opens considerable opportunities for young people and ensures the quality of classroom teaching remains at a high level.  I am proud of that fact.</P>
        <P>It is important for communities to continue to ensure the status of the schoolteacher is respected and that principals, as schools&rsquo; leaders, are recognised as contributing to communities.  This is equally true of people undertaking a higher diploma.  Owing to the considerable demand, only those with honours degrees in appropriate subjects are being allowed to take higher diploma courses.  This quality underpins teaching and learning, a fact that should be kept to the fore.</P>
        <P>We must ensure proper in-service and continuous professional development.  Not only do many teachers undertake these in respect of particular subjects and new curricula during school periods, they are constantly upskilling in their own time.  This benefits students.</P>
        <P>The exact level of learning in primary schools and the standards of literacy and numeracy have been questioned.  This year has seen an exciting and non-pressurised development, namely, the introduction of standardised testing.  Schools will introduce testing for primary school students nationally at the end of first class or the beginning of second class and at the end of fourth class or the beginning of fifth class.  Teachers will be able to identify how children are doing and to use the information for each child&rsquo;s benefit.  Teachers will also be able to give the information to parents so that they can understand how their children are doing.  It will not be done in a way that will give rise to league tables as there is no question of gathering the information to ensure local newspapers know which children are doing best in which schools.</P>
        <P>It is intended that teachers and parents will be part of children&rsquo;s educations.  Focused information will be available in respect of disadvantaged schools.  We need to know that the money targeted via DEIS &mdash; &euro;750 million is a great deal of money &mdash; at disadvantaged young people is yielding the basic required results, namely, literacy and numeracy.</P>
        <P>Over the years, we have recognised that schools alone cannot solve educational disadvan<Col N="1695"/>tage, for which reason DEIS and the like include family literacy programmes, provide home-school liaisons, link with wider communities and ensure families are involved.  Library projects and the expansion of the parent room initiative in schools are essential.  For example, Reading Recovery and Maths Recovery are having real impacts because they are targeted one-to-one programmes.  We look forward to seeing similar results.  Standardised testing will provide an overview of how children are doing.</P>
        <P>We continue to do well internationally and we are looking forward to the next PISA results which are due in December.  PISA is an OECD study of maths, science, literacy and how young people are doing.  In that regard, the Council of Ministers meeting last week was presented with the figures from comparative studies of each country.  We are well up the table on literacy, retention and participation in third level education.  On the one hand some will claim we spend less than other OECD countries but on the other the way in which moneys are spent is more targeted.  We spend more on our teachers than other OECD countries.  It is targeted properly to ensure high quality teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>Up to 55% of leaving certificate students go on to third level education, a massive participation rate.  The creation of 45,000 additional places in the third level sector over the past several years has opened up many opportunities for young people.  If further education is included, seven out of ten students doing the leaving certificate this year will go on to further and higher education.  There is no excuse for people as the opportunities are there for them.  We must encourage them along the way and people from the more disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds who traditionally might not have participated in third level education.</P>
        <P>The participation figures for lifelong learning are equally encouraging.  Up to 40,000 people are involved in adult education.  Many of them are in adult literacy courses.  People are breaking down barriers for themselves and have the courage to admit they did not have the opportunity to learn to read and write but they will now take it.</P>
        <P>While we are fortunate in what is happening in our education system, we must recognise the challenges ahead.  The birth rate is rising and the number of newcomers into the country on a daily basis means the population is growing.  We have 4,000 schools, 7 universities, institutes of technology, training colleges, a Garda college and people doing apprenticeships.  Just keeping that show on the road is a huge commitment from the taxpayer.  This year&rsquo;s education budget is &euro;9 billion, all of it well spent.</P>
        <P>Even with that spend, there are challenges with the integration of young people, ensuring young people with special educational needs get the opportunity to reach their potential and ensuring basic facilities and schools for them, particularly <Col N="1696"/>in fast-growing population centres.  The curriculum must adapt and evolve to ensure we are creating the types of people mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and IBEC.  One of the values of our education system is that it is broad-based and we do not allow students to focus too early.</P>
        <P>This year &euro;540 million will solely be spent on schools.  This year alone up to 1,200 schools have school building projects which will create facilities for 17,000 additional students in classrooms.  We are meeting this challenge and it is not fair to say the Department failed in this provision.  Some 15,000 additional children came into our schools this year.  We got it right for 14,950 of them.  It is not fair to say that in an area with much movement of young people the system failed.  There was a time when houses were built and one could anticipate the need for a school in five years.  Instead whole families are moving out of Dublin city to Wexford, Kildare, Meath and north county Dublin looking for spaces in classrooms in junior infants, first class and fourth class.</P>
        <P>The Department has good working relationships with local authorities.  I recently met with Fingal, Westmeath and Kildare local authorities, setting out the Department&rsquo;s needs for next year and the future and how we want the development of schools to go in tandem with new housing estates.  We had a good meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine what legislative changes may be needed to ensure proper planning for facilities in tandem with new housing in the interests of communities.</P>
        <P>School buildings design is not only green &mdash; they have been recommended for green awards &mdash; but, particularly in the Fingal local authority area, it allows them to be used by local communities because they have enhanced PE and meeting room facilities.  Compulsory purchases are being examined but it must be remembered that it may not be cheaper and can be a long process.  We are at the stage where we have an immediate need for sites for schools.  This must be the priority for the building programme for the next year.  Thousands of schools have great expectations for accommodation but my priority must be to provide schools in areas where there are children but no schools.</P>
        <P>We want proud and confident young people who are adaptable and flexible to the changing circumstances they find themselves in and caring and kind members of society.  Our broad curriculum achieves this.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole was probably part of the formation of the new curriculum which is being rolled out in our primary schools.  On top of the broad curriculum, there are subjects at second level, such as CSPE and SPHE, referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, which are critically important in the overall holistic development of the young person.</P>
        <P>Along with curriculum subjects, the junior certificate programme and the applied leaving certificate, which is opening doors to young people <Col N="1697"/>of various different backgrounds and abilities, I would place as much emphasis on extra-curricular activities.  That is where the grinds schools lose out.  The grinds schools focus solely on academic achievement, which is important in an education system.  So too, however, is participation in sport, music, work experience, social work and the other elements that go to make wholly rounded people.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the Department does not support grinds schools.  The league tables in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers did not give an indication of the type of education young people receive in grinds schools.  The top 15 schools that sent their students to UCD were in south County Dublin.  Where is UCD?  South County Dublin.  The top 15 schools that sent their students to NUI Maynooth were all based in the Kildare-Meath area.  In the case of University of Limerick, 13 of the 15 top schools were in Limerick, while the remaining two were in Galway and north Tipperary.  Geography has as much to do with which college young people attend.  The socioeconomic background also has an impact.  It has nothing to do with whether a student is in a fee-paying or non-fee-paying school.  It is a dreadful disservice to all schools for these league tables to concentrate on 300 students on a selective basis when there are 40,000 young people going into third level education this year.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the best way to achieve societal mix with understanding and challenge.</P>
        <P>To everyone dealing in disadvantaged areas, the expectations of young people should be as high as they are in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency.  Too many young people tell me their parents and teachers do not expect anything of them.  If one does not expect it of them, they will not perform.  As a community, we must ensure they feel challenged to reach their potential.</P>
        <P>There is also the challenge of young people with special educational needs.  Up to 17,000 people are employed in our schools to work with young people with special needs.  That is a sea change in the support given to these young people.   It is not all right and perfect.  We still have much more to do but that indicates the progress made, for example, a child with a learning difficulty has automatic access to a resource teacher in his or her school, and there are more than 270 units for autistic children around the country, 75 <Col N="1698"/>of which were set up in the past year.  I thank the schools for helping us meet that challenge, and the parents for their commitment to getting the best for their children.</P>
        <P>Bh&iacute; caint anseo faoin tumoideachas.  T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair labhairt faoi seo mar go bhfuil s&eacute; ag dul &oacute;s comhair na c&uacute;irte.  I expect every school in the country to teach Irish &oacute;n t&uacute;s.  Iarraim ar ghach scoil, is cuma c&aacute; bhfuil siad, c&eacute;n c&uacute;lra at&aacute; acu, n&oacute; an bhfuil siad sa chathair n&oacute; faoin tuath, a ndualgas a chomhl&iacute;onadh &mdash; t&aacute; seo leagtha amach sa churaclam &mdash; agus Gaeilge a mh&uacute;ineadh do na paist&iacute;.  Equally it states that from the beginning that children should be educated in the two languages.  It is public policy that all schools should teach Irish and English to all children.  If I thought the Irish language would suffer as a result I would not do this.  Parents educated to the highest level send their children to schools such as Scoil Lorc&aacute;in in my constituency which is well-established and has a strong socio-economic background so the standard is high as it is in the surrounding schools.  There are, however, gaelscoileanna in areas where the children have neither B&eacute;arla nor Gaeilge ag teacht isteach.  There are children in disadvantaged areas who do not have language skills and we cannot deny those children the B&eacute;arla &oacute;n t&uacute;s.  That is why it is a matter of public policy.  I cannot speak about the Protestant schools because that issue is before the courts but I met with them.</P>
        <P>Who would have thought five years ago that there would be 1,800 teachers doing nothing other than teaching English to newcomers?</P>

	<P>They will be introduced.  I cannot possibly comment on all topics.  </P>
        <P>It could not have been anticipated that there would be 1,800 teachers teaching only English in our schools.  If all of those teachers had been deployed to reduce class sizes there would be approximately 15 children in a class but we had to prioritise.  If all the teachers dealing with children with special needs had been deployed to reduce class size the same would be true.  These were our priorities and continue to be.  Guidelines have been issued to help the integration of young people in primary and post-primary schools.  All <Col N="1699"/>of our information is published in a variety of languages.  Assessment kits for learning have been distributed to the schools.  There are however cultural differences.  That is why I take the point about the importance of ensuring that the families and parents have English too so that they can understand what is happening within the schools.  They are participating, particularly in Dublin, in many adult education courses.</P>
        <P>Our schools depend on leadership and good teaching but in recent months the boards of management in primary schools have changed.  One of the greatest contributions to civic society is the voluntary activity on boards of management throughout the country.  I thank all the people who give their time and expertise to their local schools.  We could not possibly manage the 4,000 schools in the country, over 3,200 of which are primary schools, without that voluntary commitment.  I appreciate the way in which these people willingly offer their services.</P>
        <P>The leaving certificate is an objective independent examination.  It would not be possible to run it twice a year.  It costs approximately &euro;64 million to run and the fees come to approximately &euro;8 million.  It starts at Easter with the oral and practical exams, proceeds to the written exams in June and the results come out in the middle of August.  There is an appeals system and appeals on the appeals which do not end until October.  It is a long process involving approximately 100,000 students, plus the supervisors, correcters, etc.  It is a fair system and we are gradually ensuring that there is a second assessment point in several subjects, whether by way of oral or practical exams.</P>
        <P>The points system is also objective.  The pressure people put on students to get grinds is unnecessary when one realises that this year one could get into an arts course on 346 points.  It is a valuable course, which I did, as I am sure did many Senators.  One can get into a science course on 338 points, and business and commerce on 427 points.  One can enter an undergraduate honours degree course in the Dublin Institute of Technology on 210 points.  There is something available for everbody.</P>
        <P>There has been significant pressure on medical courses but we have made good progress and I hope that we will have a combination of points and an aptitude test for entry to these courses to ensure that we recruit people who have the necessary skills to do medicine and not those who drift in because they know they will get 600 points.  I must keep repeating that there will be no interview because there is a view abroad that there will be.  Ireland is too small for interviews which would become a question of who knew whom, and whose father or mother was a doctor.  That cannot be part of the process.  I am grateful for the co-operation of the universities in trying to implement this new system to whose early introduction I look forward.</P><Col N="1700"/>
        <P>I apologise for taking up so much time but there is a great deal that I could say on this subject.  Suffice it to say that we will tackle as many as possible of the challenges facing education, within the framework of the budget.  The programme for Government, the national development plan and Towards 2016 are conditional on the budget and I must fit into that framework too.  I am planning on the basis that 100,000 extra children will enter our schools.  To provide the same service for extra children will cost a great deal more, which restricts the amount of additional or new projects I can undertake in the immediate future.  If we can continue to do for more people the good work we are doing at the moment we will maintain a strong education system of which we can all be justifiably proud, recognising challenges but that will create the type of confident society we all want.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There was a debate on the National Educational Psychological Service in the other House yesterday.  Mental health is a subject close to my heart because I am involved with COPE foundation in Cork.  There has been a significant increase in the number of children identified with autism, Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome and other pervasive developmental disorders.  We need to consider this issue here.  Successive task force reports have stated that the projected full-<Col N="1701"/>strength NEPS is insufficient to meet all needs for assessment, treatment or specialisation.  The task force on autism commissioned by the Department following the Sinnott case in the High Court is a case in point.  Those involved in NEPS do great work.  There is an over-reliance on the psychological services of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and voluntary bodies to conduct assessments and interventions.  The difficulty is that these bodies have no automatic right of entry into schools or access to teachers and school reports.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Brothers of Charity in Cork operate a regional assessment clinic but despite their best intentions there is a waiting list of 18 to 24 months.  While another assessment team is planned for 2008 it is difficult to see a significant reduction in the number of children with autism and autism related disorders awaiting assessment.  Last week, at the conference of the Psychological Society of Ireland, a paper was presented containing the opinions of teachers on the National Educational Psychological Service and, in the main, the findings were positive regarding the work conducted by individual psychologists with pupils.  However, negative comments were made regarding difficulty accessing the service, too many demands on psychologists and a general lack of educational psychologists.  I ask that the Minister reply to us on this matter, although I know she will say there is a scheme for commissioning private assessments and that more than &euro;2 million has been allocated to it.  To my mind that scheme does not represent value for money for pupils, teachers and the education system as a whole.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to class sizes and the building programme and the Minister mentioned that 1,200 school building projects are under way at the moment.  I ask that she prioritise the construction of a new school in Rochestown in my constituency of Cork South-Central.  This is a large area of Cork city that has a growing population and while Senator Ryan referred to Dublin 15, this area of Cork city has similar needs and I ask the Minister to prioritise it.  Can the Minister give details of the budget for schools building projects in 2008?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer because I know he has much to say and I appreciate the time he has given me.  I also thank the Minister and I will keep my contribution short by speaking specifically about projects in Athlone.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the investment Athlone has received, especially Our Lady&rsquo;s Bower in Summerhill which the Minister visited to open a science building.  I met her on that occasion and I appreciate the money which has been contributed.  Athlone community college is the school dearest to my heart as I was a member of the vocational education committee, VEC, and chairman of the board of management.  Last year we <Col N="1702"/>received an undertaking that a new school would be built after we received a fire certificate from the fire officer and conducted a feasibility study on its necessity.  The project seems to have stalled, however, and last week, after much delay, we realised there is an issue regarding the size of the school.  The chief executive officer held a meeting with officials of the Department of Education and Science on the inadequacy of the size as we are trying to cater for 1,000 pupils.  The plans drawn up by the Department are far smaller than those initially anticipated and I ask the Minister to investigate this impasse.</P>
        <P>We have a site and have bought the old swimming pool from the council so everything is ready to proceed.  We were very disappointed because when the Minister&rsquo;s officials met the CEO and school principal last week, they had a completely different agenda and wished to discuss another matter which I would like to discuss with the Minister in private.  I do not know what is happening on this matter now and I ask the Minister to investigate the situation.</P>
        <P>We have all spoken of commuter belts and Killucan is in the Westmeath commuter belt.  The national school in the town has acquired a four-acre greenfield site because the existing building is completely inadequate for the expanding number of pupils it faces.  Various pieces of land in the area have received planning permission.  I know the Minister has had a meeting with the county manager so I ask her to expedite both projects I have mentioned.  I acknowledge the amount of money the Minister is already spending.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of Fianna F&aacute;il I am proud of the record of my party in education historically, going back to the days of Donogh O&rsquo;Malley and Se&aacute;n Moylan, and especially in the past five to ten years.  This applies very much to the current Minister for Education and Science who has been very successful in her brief.  I was staggered by the statistics I came across when researching this debate and I will share them with the House.</P>
        <P>Investment in education is three times what it was in 1997, the school building and renovation programme is five times larger than in 1997, the <Col N="1703"/>primary capitation grant has almost trebled and school transport investment has more than trebled.  This investment has clearly yielded results because access to higher education for 17 to 19 year olds has risen significantly since 1998.  The most recent figures relate to 2004 so I anticipate very favourable figures for more recent years when they become available.  Various socio-economic groups, including the unskilled sector and other sectors, have achieved a greater level of access to third level education.  This is a significant fact and any party would be proud to have it in its manifesto.</P>
        <P>I was a teacher for 20 years &mdash; the Cathaoirleach will be interested to know I spent a year in the faithful county &mdash; before I had to give up teaching to take over a family business commitment.  I have three sons who have gone through the education system and as someone who has been very involved in school management in more recent times through the vocational education committee, I believe the education system in this country is second to none.  Nothing is perfect and there are flaws but I believe more people are accessing higher levels of education today than at any other time.  If the Celtic tiger achieved anything it was investment in the future of our young people.</P>
        <P>The litmus test facing any society is how it cherishes those who most need help and I am old enough to remember a time when slow learners were hidden away as an embarrassment.  We are now going in the right direction and I have statistics in this regard but I will not go into them.</P>
        <P>Many teachers are frustrated when they hear the pupil-teacher ratio is improving.  There are more teachers but it is little comfort to a teacher with a big class to know four or five special needs assistants in the school may withdraw one, two or three of his or her pupils on a regular basis.  He or she will face a big group regardless.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio by 2011 and I hope this can be accelerated because large classes still exist in certain schools and this matter must be examined.</P>
        <P>I am reluctant to stray into the area of gaelscoileanna for a number of reasons, most pertinently because of an ongoing issue on which I do not wish to comment.  All I will say is that I respect Senators O&rsquo;Toole and de B&uacute;rca but my instincts lie strongly with the Minister.  I do not think the debate is sufficiently in the open.  The people behind gaelscoileanna are motivated by a love of the Irish language but they make up a formidable group with a strong publicity and propaganda machine behind it.  The Minister clearly gave her rationale in one or two sentences today and I share it.</P>
        <P>It may be time for a debate on how successful the gaelscoileanna have been in terms of their <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of promoting the Irish language.  Have any independent studies been undertaken to show whether the advent of gaelscioleanna has <Col N="1704"/>meant the language is ag eir&iacute; n&iacute;os treise or, alternatively, declining?  Has there been a negative knock-on effect, for example, in the mainstream primary level teaching of Irish?  If gaelscoileanna are not leading to an increase in usage of the language, thus safeguarding its survival, they merely represent an alternative educational choice for parents who prefer their children to remain separate from the mainstream.  I may be on dangerous ground in asking such questions.  A debate on this issue is due.</P>
        <P>The Minister initiated the north Kerry education development plan, which was greatly welcomed by all involved in education as an important initiative.  It seems to be losing impetus, however, and may require an enhanced initiative.  The person overseeing the programme is a Listowel man and eminent educator.  I hope there will be further consultation with parents before any decision is made by the trustees of the various schools.  I am particularly concerned about the future of St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school in Balyybunion, which may be vulnerable.  The role of the VEC in Kerry must be safeguarded.  VEC schools are often the poor relation when it comes to amalgamations and rationalisation programmes.  They may not have the power of some other schools but it is important that there be public accountability at all levels in the education system.</P>
        <P>I have brought the Minister&rsquo;s attention to Dromclough national school, whose 190 pupils, eight teachers and three special needs assistants are waiting some time for a technical team to decide whether they will be granted a new school or a renovation.  I understand a new school has been agreed in principle and I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in what is an excellent school with an outstanding principal.</P>
        <P>A principal of another school in Kerry asked me to point out that there has been a universally positive response to the new T4 technical drawing programme.  The Minister has endowed it with grants for equipment, furniture and so on.  The only problem seems to be a deficit in accommodation.  If a room has to be designated for technical drawing, there does not seem to be sufficient funding to make up the balance other than through the provision of prefabricated accommodation.</P>
        <P>Reference was made earlier to the notion of a philosophy of education.  This is something the Minister might debate with us on another occasion.  I was educated in St. Michael&rsquo;s College, a small secondary school in Listowel.</P>

        <P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s comment that while we may be spending less on education than other OECD countries, the spend is more focussed.  However, it is a cause for concern that the figure of 4.6% of GDP places us last out of 30 OECD states.  Secondary level education, for example, must be given the priority it deserves.  The establishment of the new post-primary education forum is to be welcomed.  Part of its brief is to lobby for increased funding and I wish it well in this.</P>
        <P>It is time to speed up the process of equalisation of State funding as between community, comprehensive and VEC schools, on the one hand, and voluntary secondary schools, on the other.  Almost 60% of second level students attend 400 voluntary secondary schools.  Considerable measures have been put in place to bridge the gap, with certain equalisation measures included in the school services support fund that are exclusive to voluntary secondary schools.  The gap persists, however, and that is an affront to the right of parents to make choices about the type of secondary school their children attend.  It is a long time since the report of the steering group on the funding of second level education, which called for the payments of grants to all voluntary secondary schools to meet the costs of insurance, secretaries, caretakers and cleaning and repairs.  It is scandalous that there is not equalisation of funding.  I acknowledge an interest in that I am involved in the governance <Col N="1706"/>of 100 voluntary secondary schools through the CEIST network.  It is a just cause and I hope that parity will be established in the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt mar gheall ar an tumoideachais.  Aonta&iacute;m le mo chomhleacaithe, an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole, ach b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go rachfainn n&iacute;os faide.  It is too simple to make a comparison between the teaching of Irish and English, because t&aacute; an B&eacute;arla buanaithe sa t&iacute;r ar bhealach nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge.

Ba cheart don Aire an taighde a dh&eacute;anamh mar a mholadh di.</P>
        <P>Gaelscoileanna will be pleased to accept whatever results a study would show.  It is important to note that although the Department of Education and Science is the paymaster, it is not its function to be excessively in control of how educational services are delivered for the various communities that require them.  International research shows there is no disadvantage to pupils in an immersion approach for a period of some years.  It is important that research should be undertaken in this State.  It would take some two years to gather and it should be done.  In the absence of such research, we are operating on the basis of ideology and people will not understand or accept the decision that has been made.  Postgraduate research from NUI Galway indicates that the standard of English is higher in these schools.  People are willing to accept the outcome of whatever study is done.

        <P>Members may be familiar with the story of the United States politican who smeared an opponent by suggesting he had a child out of wedlock.  &ldquo;I know it ain&rsquo;t true&rdquo;, the slanderer said, &ldquo;but I want to see the son of a gun get up there and deny it&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He may not have said &ldquo;gun&rdquo; but that is the word I prefer to use in this House.  There has been more than a whiff of that strategy in the air as certain politicians tried to up the ante in the debate about school patronage and the governance of primary schools.  I am concerned by the language from experienced elected representatives and from other quarters.  The shortage of school places in Balbriggan meant that an emergency school had to be opened to cater for some 100 non-Irish, non-Catholic, mostly African children.  The difficulty here was the shortage of school places.  This was a planning issue arising from the concentration of people in that area, for which there were specific reasons in terms of housing that was accessible to the State, and the failure to plan ahead for schooling needs.  The central issue, therefore, was planning, but it has turned into a case of attacking the enrolment <Col N="1707"/>policies of denominational schools.  This is intolerant, unprofessional and unacceptable.  I have been concerned about unhelpful comments regarding baptismal certificates, for example, being used as pass books.  This is basically attempting to run one agenda on the back of another.  It is true the issue is integration but it is clear that denominational schools have an excellent record in the integration of what have been called the new Irish.</P>
        <P>I disagree respectfully with Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris in their constant emphasis on this issue of ethos and the protections available for denominational schools under the law.  It is ironic that there is disagreement with the Department of Education and Science about the refusal to allow Protestant schools to interview.  I agree with the criticism because it is a necessary part of respecting denominational school and I would worry that the Department is putting person management ahead of the right of schools to determine whether particular people are suitable for a teaching post.</P>
        <P>If we are to criticise, we should acknowledge at least that it is out of respect for parental choice for a certain type of schooling that denominational educators are entitled to protect their ethos.  I encourage the Minister not to cede to the voices which carp against the right of schools to so protect their ethos.  The parents who send their children to those schools consciously are taxpayers as well.</P>
        <P>Although it is desirable for the Department to respect individual and different types of providers of education, and facilitate them rather than control them too much, it is nonetheless very important we continue to promote an attitude among parents and throughout the community.  It is important to promote attitudes of inclusiveness.  We hear anecdotal reports of people travelling distances each morning to take their children to schools where there are fewer immigrant children.  That is something to be deplored.  Respecting parental choice does not mean we should not encourage people to take an inclusive approach to integration in education.  The caveat is that if parents feel the quality of education will be lower because many of the students in the schools do not have English, such students will not be brought along.  That is the best argument for continued increased investment in English language learning skills for our new Irish within our mainstream schooling system.</P>

I had not quite realised there are so many new Senators with backgrounds in education but I am sure their aim will be to make a positive contribution and not just keep me on my toes.</P><Col N="1708"/>
        <P>Two issues were new.  The first concerned the National Educational Psychological Service, which is very valuable.  The Government set this up in 1999 and all schools have access to psychological assessments.  It is important to point out not all children require a psychological assessment to be able to get additional resources because every school in the country has resource teachers at primary level.  That is important.</P>
        <P>The recruitment process for this year took longer than anticipated and the panel then became exhausted.  It became difficult to recruit people for certain areas around the country but the new process began and was closed on 25 October.  Short-listing and interview will now take place.  The process was slower than I would have liked this year but it is in hand.</P>

There is an acceptance that there may be a gap in the middle years between the standard of English and Irish as against children in other schools, but they would catch up in sixth class.  I do not believe it appropriate that any child should be behind another in those intervening years. Th&oacute;gadh an taighde ocht mbliana.  Any international research on this is inconclusive and I am not sure there would be any conclusions.</P>
        <P>It is just a matter of policy but I remain committed to the Irish language and ensuring our schools in particular promote the Irish language at all levels.  Mar is eol do dhaoine, rinne m&eacute; chuid oibre maidir leis an Ardteistim&eacute;ireacht by changing the focus on to the oral Irish in the leaving certificate examination, which would make a significant contribution to the teaching and learning of Irish.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the need for the group sewerage scheme grant to be raised to the same level as the group water scheme.  It might not be <Col N="1709"/>directly relevant to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs but I welcome him to the House to answer my query.</P>
        <P>We must ask what aspirations we have for the future of the environment.  My home town does not have a sewerage scheme so the sewage runs raw into the River Foyle.  We battled for nearly 30 years for a tertiary treatment plant that could improve the situation but, further up the Foyle, the major scheme there is already part of the programme.  The difficulty lies in ensuring that An Bord Plean&aacute;la gets what it needs to approve the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our approach to the large schemes, however, is not mirrored by the situation with smaller schemes.  At one time, a number of people came to me looking for a group sewerage scheme closer to Muff, further up the Foyle.  The people of Ture worked hard to put together a scheme but when they put together the figures, it turned out that they had mistakenly been looking at those for a group water scheme and, given the levels of grant subventions for group sewerage schemes, it was not practical.  I have raised this before and was told there is no demand for the scheme so there is no point in putting it together.  It is a chicken and egg situation, however, because if it is not viable in view of the level of grant, there will be no demand.</P>
        <P>Do we want to create such a demand?  Yes, on the basis that because there are so many rural dwellings and one-off houses, there are septic tanks all over the country.  European directives are changing the monitoring, cleaning and evaluation process for septic tanks so it makes economic and environmental sense to encourage people into the group sewerage scheme and away from the septic tanks and puriflow systems.  There has been a review of group sewerage schemes but instead of carrying out pilot projects, we should take a further step and ensure the group sewerage scheme grant is increased to the same level as the group water scheme.  We will then give an indication at individual level that we want to improve the environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A lot of voluntary effort goes into the planning for group schemes &mdash; the Ture group spent a long time working on the scheme.  Currently, however, the group sewerage scheme allows for 75% of the cost up to a value of &euro;2,031, compared to 85% of the cost up to a value of &euro;7,619 for a group water scheme if 90% of people in the area support it, a significant difference.  The group sewerage scheme support in CL&Aacute;R areas is better but 100% of people must want to join and, in reality, very few places exist where 100% of people will sign up to anything.  Even the 100% versus 90% in non-CL&Aacute;R group water scheme areas makes a difference.</P>
        <P>I raise the group sewerage scheme today because I am also worried about bigger schemes. Carndonagh is one of the few places that has a good sewerage scheme on the Inishowen peninsula.  There were lengthy delays with the Malin <Col N="1710"/>sewerage scheme when it should have been an extension of Carndonagh.  As a result, it fell under the new criterion whereby the local authority had to pay a considerable amount to the scheme.  In areas like mine, there has been little investment in business so our ability to generate co-financing for such basic infrastructure is curtailed, particularly when the price of new sewerage schemes is so high.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to thank Senator Keaveney for raising this important issue.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regrets that he is unable to be here in person due to another commitment.  He has asked me to respond to the motion on his behalf.</P>
        <P>Group sewerage schemes, though much less numerous than group water schemes, have provided communities with the opportunity of connecting to public sewerage networks through communal sewage collection systems that are, in turn, connected to local authority sewers.  There is a continuing interest in forming new group sewerage schemes.  This interest comes mainly from clusters of houses currently dependent on septic tanks and situated close to towns or villages with public sewerage services.  In some cases, difficulties with the disposal of septic tank effluent are being experienced by septic tank owners, particularly in sensitive areas or where there are poor ground conditions.</P>
        <P>Small village communities have also expressed interest in setting up group sewerage schemes where there are no public sewerage services available.  However, few, if any, village sewerage systems have been provided through group sewerage schemes, mainly due to difficulties associated with the location, siting, ownership and management of communal wastewater treatment systems.  Operating and maintaining wastewater treatment infrastructure is intrinsically more problematic than water treatment.  Operational failure could result in serious public health or environmental consequences and there is the ongoing issue of disposing of treated effluent and the sludge from the treatment process.</P>
        <P>The current grant available to householders under the group sewerage programme is &euro;2,031.58 per house, or 75% of cost, whichever is the lesser.  The corresponding grant for group water schemes is &euro;6,475.66.  There is, however, positive news.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is at present funding a pilot wastewater collection and treatment project for rural villages, which was proposed by the national rural water monitoring committee, to test a range of new, small-scale wastewater collection and treatment systems under Irish conditions.  The objective of the pilot programme is to explore new, cost effective ways of collecting wastewater from houses in rural <Col N="1711"/>communities and to evaluate new approaches to meeting their wastewater treatment needs.</P>
        <P>This pilot project has pioneered the use of septic tank effluent drainage systems, commonly referred to as STEDS.  Under this approach, existing septic tanks are retained on-site with the effluent being collected through a special filter to be drained via a small diameter pipe to a small package treatment system.  It is hoped that this alternative collection and treatment system will prove appropriate for use in small rural communities with low population density and site specific environmental conditions such as shallow bedrock, high ground-water conditions and limited effluent discharge locations.</P>
        <P>Construction work on the pilot projects is now complete and they are undergoing commissioning.  Monitoring of the performance of the new infrastructure has commenced and some preliminary results will be available to the national rural water monitoring committee shortly.  The lessons learned with regard to the technologies and costs associated with both the treatment and collection element of the pilot programme will inform policy and determine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in the provision of wastewater collection systems.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has asked the national rural water monitoring committee to report to him on the results from the pilot projects, including its recommendations on the future role of the group sewerage schemes in the provision of wastewater collection systems, as soon as possible.  The Minister is committed to reviewing the level of grant aid for group sewerage schemes when this report and the recommendations of the national rural water monitoring committee become available and this will happen in the short rather than the long-term.  I will also advise the Minister of the discussions here as part of the review process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House today and his presence here has solved a mystery for me.  My question pertains to the universality of child benefit and initially I had addressed it to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, because neither I nor the groups on whose information I am working were clear as to who was responsible for this issue within the Government.  I am grateful to the Minister for coming into the House and taking responsibility for this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Essentially this issue concerns the universality of child benefit.  The Government&rsquo;s National Children&rsquo;s Strategy 2000-10 states:  &ldquo;...child benefit is an important means of reducing child poverty and supporting the welfare of children, <Col N="1712"/>given its universal coverage and its neutral relationship to both the employment incentive and decisions regarding family formation&rdquo;.  These words are highly important and all Members would subscribe to them.  However, in recent years, child benefit has not been applied universally.  A small number of children exist, who perhaps are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, to whom child benefit is not made available.  This is because of the habitual residence condition.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business on universal children&rsquo;s day two days ago and a number of groups have been campaigning for the restoration of child benefit to the aforementioned small group of children.  The campaigning groups are led by the free legal advice centres, FLAC, but also include the Vincentian Refugee Centre, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Barnardos and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.</P>
        <P>Their campaign concerns the habitual residence condition, which I understand was introduced in 2004.  Its initial purpose was to prevent social welfare payments, including child benefit, being made unless persons could demonstrate two years&rsquo; habitual residence in Ireland.  Following legal advice, it became clear that the habitual residence condition could not apply to children whose parents were from EU member states or the European Economic Area.  Consequently, such parents are not subjected to this condition.  However, a small number &mdash; the free legal advice centres estimate between 2,000 and 3,000 children &mdash; remain deprived of the benefit because of the application of the habitual residence condition.  Most of the children concerned are the children of asylum seekers or those seeking humanitarian leave to remain.  FLAC found figures showing that at the end of September 2007, just 2,019 such children were in this category and were deprived of child benefit.  The point made by FLAC and the other groups is that the deprivation of child benefit to the parents of such children has had a severe effect on them because many of them already exist on direct provision and are therefore already on extremely low incomes.  They cannot afford to buy basic essentials such as food, schooling and medical requirements.  Were child benefit restored to them, they would be able to so do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My question also concerns the extent to which the Government had considered its international human rights obligations when taking this policy approach to these children.  Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified in 1992, provides that children&rsquo;s rights should be respected without discrimination of any kind.  Moreover, Article 26 states that children have the right to benefit from social security.  It is clear from the convention that governments should not discriminate against children on the basis of the immigration status or otherwise of their parents.  In effect, however, the application of this condition has deprived a particular small group of children of what should be a universal <Col N="1713"/>benefit and what the Government has referred to as an important plank of the strategy to remove children from poverty.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister the reason the Government has not considered the rights of the child in the application of this policy.  I also ask the Minister to consider whether the implementation of this policy has in effect broken not only the Government&rsquo;s own promises contained in the national children&rsquo;s strategy, but also our international human rights commitments to children, namely, to ensure they are entitled to social benefits without any discrimination based on parental status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  In general, child benefit may be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years who is ordinarily resident in the State.  Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education or incapable of self-support.  The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and the qualified person must satisfy the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the habitual residence condition is to allow access to our social welfare schemes to people who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.  It was introduced because Ireland at that time was one of only three member states of the EU to open its borders without restriction to nationals of the new EU states in May 2004.  EU regulations provide that EEA nationals who are migrant workers, that is, who are employed or self-employed in this country or who are receiving Irish jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit since being in employment here, are entitled to payment of family benefits in respect of their families whether the families are resident with them in Ireland or in another member state.  Under these regulations, the family members are treated as if they are resident in Ireland for the purpose of child benefit.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of the habitual residence condition in 2004, full examination was given by my Department to the question as to whether it was consistent with a number of international conventions to which Ireland was party, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Article 26 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) The State parties shall recognise for every child the right to benefit from social security, including social insurance, and shall take the necessary measures to achieve the full realisation of this right in accordance with their national law.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The benefits should, where appropriate, be granted, taking into account the resources and circumstances of the child and persons having responsibility for the maintenance of the <Col N="1714"/>child, as well as any other consideration relevant to an application for benefits made by or on behalf of the child.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The convention allows the national legislation to prescribe the manner of provision of that benefit.  The benefit does not have to be a cash payment and benefit in kind may equally satisfy the requirement.  Therefore where direct provision is made, as in the case of persons in the asylum process, that provision meets the obligations of the convention and Ireland is not obliged to pay child benefit in addition to such provision.  The outcome of this examination was that the habitual residence condition was not incompatible with the provisions of the convention.</P>
        <P>Approximately 2,000 claims to child benefit for some 3,400 children have been refused since May 2004 as the applicant did not satisfy the habitual residence condition.  Those who were refused were mainly persons whose claims to asylum were not yet finalised, who did not have a work permit or who had no attachment to the workforce in Ireland.  In the same period, a total of more than 160,000 new claims for child benefit were received and awarded.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing monitoring of the application of the habitual residence condition, my Department reviewed the outcome of related child benefit decisions during the period between January and the end of August 2007.  A total of 28,542 decisions were made on new child benefit claims in this period.  Of these, a total of 3,430, or 12%, required particular examination of the habitual residence condition.  A total of 90% of these cases satisfied the condition and only 341 were refused because this condition was not satisfied.  This shows that it continues to be the case that only slightly more than 1% of the total number of new child benefit claims fail to satisfy the habitual residence conditions.</P>
        <P>The review also confirmed that those who are refused child benefit are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, others who have not obtained a work permit, or persons who have had only a minimal or no attachment to the workforce since coming to Ireland.  As I have already stated, those who do not satisfy the condition because they are in the asylum process have direct provision available to them, and in this manner the rights and welfare of the child is protected.   If refugee status is granted to such persons, they are accepted as habitually resident and become entitled to child benefit in respect of their qualifying children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask a supplemental question arising from the Minister&rsquo;s reply and I believe I am entitled to so do.  Am I to understand that direct provision is made instead of child benefit in cases where direct provision is made to the children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  This issue was considered at the time with particular reference to <Col N="1715"/>the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It became clear that the convention does not prescribe that a straight cash payment must be made.  If a state makes indirect provision &mdash; Ireland devotes quite substantial resources to indirect provision &mdash; rather than making payment by way of child benefit that is equally acceptable under the UN convention.  That is the position at present.  While I agree the numbers are small, there is a range of reasons.  The figures clearly indicate that our society wants to look after children irrespective of where they come from, and <Col N="1716"/>we do that well.  According to the current examination for which I have given Senator Bacik the figures for January to August this year, more than 28,000 applications were granted and of 3,430 that were examined, 90% got it and only 341 failed.  The system is being more than fair to and conscious of the rights of children.  That is important.  Where there is direct provision that is equal and counts as making a direct cash payment.</P>
