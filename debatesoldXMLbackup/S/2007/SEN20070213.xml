	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to restore to the many schools in County Galway the disadvantaged status which has been withdrawn due to the change in the criteria for selection and as a result have lost out on the many beneficial supports necessary to provide a comprehensive education system.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator White of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the pressing need and compelling case for a university in the south east region by upgrading Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s designation to that of a university, given that such a move would boost economic development in that region.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure 130 jobs at <Col N="2"/>Premier Foods in Thurles are not jeopardised by a decision of the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to provide an update on the action the Government is taking to prevent the closure of rural post offices and to ensure their viability by including agricultural as well as social welfare payments through the post office network.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Ulick Burke, White and O&rsquo;Meara and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to say that at this stage, people are well and truly focused on the next general election, which is only weeks away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>At this stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party should be congratulated for provoking another &ldquo;Michael&rdquo; moment yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They are so overcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if they are not here, I assure Senator Ross that I will be backing him on this issue.</P>
        <P>I have met many people who know they will be away for a period during May or June.  They are upset at the prospect that they will not be able to vote in the upcoming general election.  Would the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to look at the possibility of allowing those who are away on holiday or on business to vote by postal vote or to allow them vote before they leave the country?  We have established in law the principle of postal votes for members of the Army and the Garda, and now for prisoners.  I do not think a huge amount of imagination or flexibility would be needed to allow people to vote in an election if they have bona fide evidence that they will be away on polling day.  It could be done simply by establishing polling stations in local authority head offices or by extending the postal vote principle to include such people.  Many people I meet in my constituency make the point that the forthcoming general election will be the third consecutive election to be held during the summer months, when people are more likely to be away, and therefore it would make sense to allow people who are away to use postal votes.  I ask the Leader and her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to consider this proposal to see whether something can be done, even at this late stage, to make this necessary change to electoral law.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il will debate the report of the Moriarty tribunal later today.  When does the Leader envisage this House will have such a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal made by Senator Brian Hayes about postal voting, which I have discussed in this House on many occasions over the years.  I suggest that we should examine the possibility of electronic voting in that context.</P><Col N="4"/>
        <P>The Independent Members of the House are finding it difficult to follow the various movements which are being made in advance of the forthcoming general election.  The Labour Party has said that if it gets into office, it will reduce the basic tax rate from 20% to 18%.  Fianna F&aacute;il has said that if it is returned to office, it will reduce the top rate of tax from 39% to 38%.  The Progressive Democrats have said that if they get back into office, they will increase pensions by 50%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Wait for the rest of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael has said that if it gets into office, they will sort out the health service within a year.  The Green Party has said that if it gets into office, it will sort out global warming.  Is this not the right time in the history of the State to propose a national grand coalition of all the parties, which will sort out the country once and for all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>So says the Independent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators on these benches would be very supportive of that kind of development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure they would.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We would do our best to work in such a climate.  The Independent Members are not in a position to buy our way into office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must be joking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot offer any inducements to the public.  We just do our best.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the regret in the Senator&rsquo;s voice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of education has been raised in the House on a number of occasions recently.  Senator Ulick Burke and others have asked for a debate on it.  I understood that problems with class sizes in primary and post-primary schools were to be resolved during the lifetime of the Government, but an ongoing war continues to be fought on the issue.  It has been reported that new schools have been built without playgrounds for the children, which is the antithesis of all educational philosophy as exemplified by the current curriculum.  The Department has responded that it is concentrating on building classrooms, but we might as well put children in prisons as put them in classrooms without outside play areas in which they can work, operate, play, enjoy themselves and express themselves.</P>
        <P>It would be useful for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the Department&rsquo;s unacceptable failure to make such facilities available.  When the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, came to the House in recent <Col N="5"/>times to discuss the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, she gave an absolute guarantee that appropriate resources would be made available.  Given that the report of the National Council for Special Education, which outlines a timeline for the various levels of support, has been on her desk for the past three months, it is time for her to start looking at those resources, especially as money should have been made available from 1 January.  I would like the Minister to update the House on the money and resources which have been made available to the National Council for Special Education as well as the training that has been put in place and the plans which have been developed.  A debate with the Minister for Education and Science would be most timely at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that Senator Brian Hayes has already spoken about a subject that I would like to raise.  I thank him if he did so.  I heard something about it when I was running to the Chamber, but I am not sure if I have got it exactly right.  I would like to ask for a debate on taxation.  There is a need for a change in the Government&rsquo;s taxation policy, which in recent years has benefited the most well-off&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Statements on the Appropriation Bill will be taken today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with the cuts in the top rate of tax.  The Labour Party proposes that the standard rate of tax would be cut when we are in Government and this would benefit lower and middle income people, which is the fairest way to approach taxation policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about indexation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;especially in light of the raft of stealth taxes that have been brought in by this Government over the past few years.</P>
        <P>It is reported in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> that the TCD anti-bullying centre carried out a study on the level of bullying in primary schools, which is at 30%.  There is a high rate of bullying against boys in primary schools in particular.  One of the authors of the report commented that since the last report was carried out 14 years ago, bullying has not reduced in schools and the level of bullying now is similar to what was reported in 1993.  A pilot programme to prevent bullying has been in operation in schools in County Donegal.  I ask the Minister for Education and Science to consider having a nation-wide programme for the prevention of bullying in schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Institution of Engineers of Ireland has stated that Dublin&rsquo;s commuter belt is now the same size as that of Los Angeles.  This has not come as news to the Progressive Democrats and it is the reason we have launched a policy document entitled A New Heart for <Col N="6"/>Dublin which recommends the relocation of Dublin port.  The issue of the increasing size of Dublin must be addressed.  Are young couples to be forced out of the city when there is a 600-acre land bank in the centre of the city that could be developed?  I ask the Leader to have the Minister for Transport come to the House to discuss this subject as he has responsibility for the ports under the Transport 21 plan.</P>
        <P>It disappoints me that in a rush to talk down the progress of the economy, a candidate in the general election in Dublin West &mdash; needless to say, a Fine Gael candidate &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I never thought it would be Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Senator Morrissey moved again as I thought he was in Dublin North? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and which is not true.  I ask for restraint from the Opposition benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>He is bouncing all over the place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Members opposite are attempting to talk down how the economy is going.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Fine Gael Leader in the House to comment in the absence of the person who made the outrageous allegation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>A line in the sand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry should be the candidate anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate the poor quality health services around the country.  Every week brings a new scandal in the health care system.  It was brought to my notice that the HSE is now assessing domiciliary care applications that were submitted in 2005.  There is a waiting list of almost two years for a decision on applications for domiciliary care allowances.  This is nothing short of a scandal as the cost of rearing a child with special needs is higher than the norm.  The Government has an obligation to become involved with the HSE and progress those applications.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised that matter on the Adjournment of the House last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>A carer&rsquo;s allowance cannot be awarded until such time as a domiciliary care <Col N="7"/>allowance is granted.  There is a significant conflict of interest which the Minister for Health and Children needs to address.  What is happening is scandalous.  I know of a significant number of people who are waiting for their applications to be processed&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, the matter was raised on the Adjournment last week. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but nothing is being done. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  On the issue of pensions, last night the Progressive Democrats announced a commitment to increase pensions by 50%.  One could be forgiven for believing the party had not been in Government for the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We delivered on two promises, one made prior to the previous election and one prior to the election before that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the party not pay the increase now?  Does it expect to be in Government on its own after the next general election?  It will be wiped out. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The wipe-out has begun in Longford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the need for play spaces, sports halls and so on in national and other schools.  The line from the Department is that the INTO, of which the Senator is a former president, insists that all available resources are spent on classrooms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Department&rsquo;s line. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate could help clarify this and other issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department&rsquo;s line is new spin. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>It is rubbish. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Mansergh to continue without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is rubbish, I would like to be informed.  Let us have a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>On a second point, if we are to move Dublin Port I wonder why we spent hundreds of millions of euro on the port tunnel.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate on the Appropriation Act 2006 as it will allow the House to have a proper discussion of tax, spending and budgetary policies.  I welcome convergence on taxation policy, first by the Green Party and, more recently, by the Labour Party, both of which have <Col N="8"/>modified their attitudes.  Government taxation policy since 2003 has removed 38% of income earners from the tax net.  They will not be affected by proposals to cut tax.  This has been the main thrust of Government taxation policy and it has won great praise from the European&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It has won praise from the Government. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a Government claim. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Mansergh seeking a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>May I finish without interruption?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has won praise for having the most favourable taxation policy for low income earners.  It is a distraction to talk about a little unfinished business from the previous Government in terms of the top tax rate.  It would not even compensate the wealthy for the curtailment of various tax reliefs. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator clear that with the Progressive Democrats?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on the Middle East, specifically the deteriorating situation in Iraq.  Yesterday, 85 people were tragically killed as they tried to buy foodstuffs in a market.  Queues of unemployed men are being bombed in a sectarian civil war.  Mr. Nuri al-Maliki was practically blown up by the reverberations from a bomb while appealing for peace at a press conference.  It is a disaster.  We have, in North Korea, an example of how United States policy can work if the State Department is allowed to do its job.  Following difficult and protracted negotiations it appears negotiators are on the verge of success in persuading North Korea to abandon the nuclear option. </P>
        <P>The plight of deaf people has been brought to my attention again by a constituent.  Some time ago I asked the Leader about the universal new born hearing screening programme which can identify hearing loss in children at a very young age.  The Government was asked to introduce it in 1998 but nothing has been done.  I hope we can convince it to adopt the programme.  Even Romania, Latvia and Slovenia, which have weaker economies than Ireland, have introduced it.  The programme gives people a chance.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Health and Children the use of Irish sign language in hospitals.  I understand there have been a number of cases where patients with hearing difficulties have found great problems in making their symptoms known to doctors.  This is because even <Col N="9"/>in hospitals with some signage system, the British system is used and there is nobody who can use Irish sign language.</P>
        <P>While it is a slightly parochial matter, I am seeking a debate on the theatre.  We could include the location of the Abbey Theatre about which I have tabled a motion on the Order Paper.  Although I often praise Trinity College, I wish to express some concern in this regard.  I am sorry Senator Ryan is not present to hear me say a few critical things about that establishment.  We can be proud of the fact that a Trinity academic, Dr. Anil Kokaram, has been nominated for an Oscar for devising a film computerisation programme.  However, it seems as if theatre will only be rewarded in the technical areas because of the closure of the drama studies course in Trinity College.  I am concerned about reports that have reached me that members of the staff of TCD are being silenced.  A <i>fatwa</i> has been circulated notifying staff that they are not to talk about this issue with the press, under any circumstances, even though it affects their livelihood and the standard of the university.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>He is making a speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking a debate on the whole situation.  In that debate I will point out that this stunt was tried by the discredited President George W. Bush when he went for the Dixie Chicks, but they got five Grammys.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Occasionally, one wonders what effect the Order of Business debate might have.  I am pleased to report that on a number of occasions last week we raised the issue of pricing in a particular location.  Later that week, I saw that petrol prices had dropped by almost ten cent a litre, which is 45 cent per gallon.  That was as a direct result of the good work that was done here last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was on television.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has saved the consumer an amount of money.  Long may that continue.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the situation in the Middle East with particular emphasis on Iran.  In the recent UN vote on the Holocaust, Iran was the only nation that refused to condemn what had happened because it does not recognise the Holocaust ever took place.  The Iranian President makes dangerous pronouncements, denying the truth.  Sooner or later, they <Col N="10"/>will see the writing on the wall but I hope it can be done peacefully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the call for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House for an urgent debate on a series of educational crises that have arisen on her watch and particularly in the last 12 months.  There is a proposal to close Seamount College, a second level school in Kinvara, County Galway.  That school has been shown to be not only viable but also among the highest ranking schools in the country, according to various surveys of its students&rsquo; examination achievements.  As a former Minister for Education, the Leader will understand that this is unprecedented.  The proposed closure has been sanctioned and approved by the Minister for Education and Science.  As far back as 15 October 2006, the school&rsquo;s patrons announced that they were withdrawing from the school and that there would be no intake of students in September 2007.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Kitt and myself raised this matter on the Adjournment last week but the signs in the Minister&rsquo;s reply were ominous.  At a public meeting on Friday night, a letter from the Department was read out, which clearly indicated matters of serious import to the parents, students and staff of that school.  The Minister had sanctioned and approved the appointment of a manager to the school, having examined the situation for four months during which the school did not have a board of management.  The board&rsquo;s term of office ended on 15 October and it was not reappointed.  According to the Education Act, the sanctioning of approval if satisfied that the functions of the board were not being efficiently discharged was one of the reasons the Minister has the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am urgently seeking a debate.  In addition, catchment areas throughout the country have been in place without change for the past 30 years, despite the many representations of public representatives, parents and all the partners in education.  We now find that the catchment area of Kinvara school has been abolished and subsumed into the Gort area.  We are told that the children of Kinvara, who are in an already overcrowded school, will not begin first year in 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is matter for the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this point.  There is collusion at the highest level between some of the partners in education to allow this to happen when the school has been shown to be viable, given that approximately 500 potential students <Col N="11"/>could be accommodated there.  There is also the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must find some other way to raise the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know of any other way as the Minister will not reply to representations and we get answers that are only partially true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The last point I wish to make is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought he raised his last point minutes ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-that the Leader should personally take up the matter with the Minister.  The Minister should come to the House and definitively state why, at a time when &euro;184 billion is being spent on infrastructure, we are closing a viable school in Kinvara, County Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>We recently heard of the case of a well-known celebrity who contacted RTE on several occasions when she heard another celebrity was to appear on a television programme.  She telephoned RTE because she was afraid something offensive might be said about her.  RTE took the case very seriously and decided on pre-recording the interview in question and then having it examined by its legal people.</P>
        <P>It is a pity RTE cannot be as sensitive in other cases.  Every week there is constant demonisation of the clergy and we see fun being poked at religion.  We know why this is the case &mdash; it is because of the terrible scandals which happened in this country.  However, it is not fair to suggest every single person with a religious vocation should be demonised in this manner.  We have heard compliments in the House, for example, that the hospital system deteriorated when the religious left the hospitals.  We could say the same of many schools &mdash; in fact, the issue with regard to the school to which reference was made has a religious content.</P>
        <P>RTE is not subject to good taste and decency regulation at present, as we know, but I understand it will be in the very near future.  It should not be necessary to have regulations to do what is right and fair.  I hope good taste and decency will in future be shown not just to the clergy in general but to their families and relatives and to those who admire the clergy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Tomorrow is St. Valentine&rsquo;s day and people will focus on romance, but it also the tenth anniversary of the introduction of divorce in Ireland.  It is interesting to look back on articles written at that time.  The late Pope John Paul II <Col N="12"/>and Mother Teresa led a strong campaign and claimed divorce would lead to a 10% increase in marriage breakdown.  If one considers recent figures, it appears they may have been correct, which is worrying.  It is thought the percentage of marriage breakdowns has risen from 2.8% almost to 10%, and it is estimated it could involve 160,000 people.</P>
        <P>It is important that we consider the issue of marriage and the supports we can give to the institution of marriage.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate for next week.  We need to acknowledge that marriage breakdown can be a serious social problem and is in need of urgent attention.  It is interesting to consider last week&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> poll which showed that three quarters of those sampled would support divorce again, and that it has gained support among women voters.  It would be opportune to reflect on ten years of divorce to see what we can do to restrengthen marriage and relationships in a way that reflects modern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s call for a debate on the issue of postal voting.  The register of electors has been printed and at first glance appears a big improvement on the old register.  The issue of giving votes to people going on holidays reminds me of the debate we used have about immigrants voting.  Some people are away so long on holidays that we could not really give them a vote.  However, I welcome any discussion to find practical ways of dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised the issue of Seamount College in Kinvara.  It is the Sisters of Mercy, western province, who intend to close the college and there is no gainsaying that.  I support the Senator&rsquo;s call for a site for a new secondary school in Kinvara if the Sisters of Mercy are not prepared to provide the site, lease the property or take in new students in September.  With regard to the change in the catchment area, Senator Burke and I have campaigned for years to improve the situation in the context of school transport which has suffered because of the restrictions of the catchment area.  Perhaps the change in the catchment will help.  I would welcome a debate on the issue of an alternative site for a new co-educational secondary school in Kinvara, especially in light of the increased number of houses and the increasing population in Kinvara and south Galway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, we discussed the Defamation Bill and the establishment of a press council and press ombudsman.  I listened to a sports programme last night on which a number of contributors referred to an article in a Sunday newspaper which suggested that the Irish soccer manager should buy petrol, pour it over himself and set himself alight.  If we are to be subject to this type of journalism, we must return to the legislation to see what kind of a response we can <Col N="13"/>expect from the press to articles such as this.  This type of carry on is not acceptable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know how badly the Irish team played, but please God it will do a lot better when it gets to Croke Park in March.  Articles such as the one printed on Sunday are unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to see, based on her Adjournment matter, that Senator White has shown an interest in Waterford Institute of Technology, and I was happy to see her canvassing in Waterford yesterday.  We hope to see many more people doing the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of voting and of people being away in May and June.  Let us not fret about June, but talk about May.  I hope we all have a holiday in June.</P>
        <P>Postal votes are not just for the Defence Forces or Garda, but also for people who are bed bound or invalids.  Many of these have applied for postal votes.  Senator Hayes suggests that as the postal vote principle has been established, we should try to find a mechanism whereby those legitimately travelling abroad during the general election could exercise their vote.  I do not know if that can be done.  The same question was asked recently at a meeting I attended.  I will talk to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to see if the issue can be tackled.</P>
        <P>The Senator also asked when the House would debate the Moriarty report.  We hope to debate it as soon as the current spate of legislation is concluded as it is part of our schedule.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked if we could have a grand coalition.  No thanks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader should not rule it out.  It is currently only a core principle, but everything could change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il is and always has been a grand coalition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator also seeks debate on education and said that some new schools have been built without playgrounds because the Department has prioritised the building of classrooms.  I understand that, but a modicum of space to stretch one&rsquo;s legs is surely required.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole also spoke of a report on special education, something very much needed.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy wishes us to hold a debate on taxation, which I am sure every Labour Senator would attend.  One need look no further for an example of chutzpah, which I stress is an example of a good word rather than bad language.  She also sought a debate on bullying in primary schools.</P><Col N="14"/>
        <P>Senator Morrissey mentioned the belief at the Institute of Engineers of Ireland that a new heart is needed for Dublin and his ideas on moving the port to a new location.  Senator Bannon suggested that we ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to attend the House to discuss the domiciliary care allowance.  If he consults the Official Report, he will see that last week I achieved a very good outcome in an Adjournment debate on such care in Westmeath and Longford.</P>

	<P>Please allow the Leader to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is steadily improving.  The Senator also spoke of the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; pension plans, which I felt were very exciting.  That was another example of that useful word, chutzpah.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that I would agree with the Leader if I knew what was meant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It means &ldquo;bravura&rdquo;.  Senator Norris sought a debate on the Middle East.  It is amazing that the deaths of 85 people there merited only a minor item on the news.  I worry about President Bush raising his predatory paw to Iran, since he feels that he must go out in a blaze of glory, as he would see it.  The Senator also spoke of the plight of deaf people and a test that can be administered universally to diagnose the condition in very young children.  A debate on theatre would be very interesting and not at all parochial.  He also raised the very important matter of the closure of the drama studies course at Trinity College, Dublin.  I do not understand why a course that attracts so many new students should be cut.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also cheap, costing only &euro;250,000 a year.  The college is acting in a penny-pinching matter by closing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin mentioned the Seanad having shown its relevance through effecting a 10 cent drop in the price of petrol.  Senator Leyden discussed the issue in living colour on television on the night that it was raised, and it clearly had an effect.  The Senator also raised the issue of Iran.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke suggested that we invite the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to attend the House to discuss Seamount College, a second level school in Kinvara.  I have been following that because Senator Kitt has spoken to me over recent weeks on the issue, as has Senator Ulick Burke.  A very large meeting was held in Kinvara last night on the issue.  I know that the nuns have pulled out or indicated their intention to do so, but it is amazing that a thriving <Col N="15"/>second level school in Kinvara should close.  It is a very odd situation, and the catchment area is being divided, with part going to Gort.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Oranmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected.  Seamount College deserves closer scrutiny, and the proposal from Senator Kitt and, I am sure, Senator Ulick Burke for a new college on a greenfield site should be pursued.  The nuns own the building and are going to move out.  No one can take it from them.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the case of a certain woman who contacted RTE because of an appearance by Mary Coughlan scheduled for &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  It has nothing to do with her namesake, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The Senator stated quite correctly that the station had taken great care, consulted its legal advisers, and had everything scrutinised.  I would always prefer listening to Mary Coughlan rather than the other woman, but that is no concern of mine.  He also said that RTE was not subject to good taste regulations and rightly provided evidence of its demonisation of the religious over an extended period.</P>
        <P>Poor Senator Browne raised the issue of divorce.  I think that pre-nuptial agreements have discouraged women.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is separate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is very keen on them, and any woman wishing to approach him would decide to be haughty.  However, Senator Browne is wearing a lovely tie which would be good for St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day tomorrow.  He wants a debate on marriage.  It is quite an unusual request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>And on divorce, the legislation for which is ten years old.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone is due a second chance.  In any case, Senator Browne wants a debate on marriage and asked could it coincide with St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day.  It cannot because that is tomorrow.  We might have it next week if we could, but there is no time.  My difficulty is that I do not know who will come to debate it.  There is no Minister for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a serious element to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course there is.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an equality issue.  Men are encountering problems accessing their children following marriage breakdown.  We could include that in a general debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne is quite correct.  I am not being funny now.  With the break-up of marriages, I find there are local authority housing issues.  The mother in the main gets the children, and then the father wants them at weekends but has nowhere to take them.  Considerable numbers of fathers are looking for local authority housing where they can bring their children at weekends.  It is a significant problem and perhaps Senator Browne is correct, but I would not be in favour of curtailing the right to divorce, which is now set in law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting we should.  I am merely suggesting we reflect on the ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed.  Senator Kitt spoke of Seamount College and stated he would support the idea of getting a new site.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins spoke of an article in <i>The Sun</i>.  Although I did not see it, it was an awful thing to say.  The disrespect for human life conveyed in that is unacceptable, and I thank him for raising it.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2006: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we commence I would like to remind the Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except for the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  Each amendment on Report Stage must be seconded.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 46, line 15, after &ldquo;his&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or her&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to include both genders in the Bill.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, said previously that he was advised by the parliamentary draftspeople to leave the wording as it is in the parent Bill. This amendment will not impact on the parent Bill.  The parent Bill could have a reference to the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; with the interpretive legislation having this mean &ldquo;his or her&rdquo;.  We could also have the new reference to &ldquo;his or her&rdquo;, as per our amendment, with the two formats coexisting.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on why he feels he should not accept our amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>When this matter was raised on Committee Stage I under<Col N="17"/>took to consider it between then and the debate in the D&aacute;il, but as the amendment has been raised again here, I have once more taken the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the matter.  There are many possible approaches to amending Acts that have not been gender proofed and each instance is examined on its own merits, rather than adopting a blanket approach.  I am advised in this case that it would be difficult to avoid the use of the pronoun in every instance by referring to the person everywhere, given this is a piecemeal amendment of the Defence Act 1954.  </P>
        <P>If the &ldquo;he or she&rdquo; style were to be adopted in this case it would interfere with the integrity of the Defence Act 1954 because the provisions of that Act that are unaffected by this Bill would continue to read &ldquo;he&rdquo; only.  If the Act were to be rewritten or consolidated there would be full gender proofing and an effort would be made to avoid personal pronouns where possible.  In any case, the Interpretation Act provides that a word importing the masculine gender should be read as also importing the feminine gender.  For these reasons I will not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister considering introducing a consolidated Act at a stage?  This is not a huge issue but should be seen in light of the fact that the Minister wishes to recruit more women to the Army.  A change in legislation might be worthwhile in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>We are taking other measures to encourage women to join the Army but I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  As Senator Tuffy will be aware, this is only part of the legislation that we are introducing, following the first part of the recommendations of the committee.  Further legislation will be introduced later to adopt the second part of the committee&rsquo;s proposals and the matter raised by the Senator will be considered in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 62, line 29, after &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;, or, where such person is incapacitated or deceased, on the application of a person who is the spouse or relative of such person&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and would like to know if the Minister has had further thoughts on the issue.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>

	<P>The current provisions were modelled on section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 rather than on the Criminal Procedure Act 1993 to which I may have referred on Committee Stage, and I apologise for this error.</P><Col N="18"/>
        <P>I am not aware of any amendment made, to date, regarding section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  While I have no objection to the intention of the proposed amendment, I do not consider it appropriate to depart from the current position in ordinary criminal law.  A practice would appear to exist of making it possible for a relative of a deceased person to make a statement rather than its being enshrined for the moment in law.  I am aware, however, that there is an ongoing debate regarding the operation of these provisions in ordinary criminal law.  It would appear to be appropriate to await the outcome of this debate and reconsider the provisions at that stage, as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In marking the passage of this legislation through the Seanad, I thank Senators from all sides of the House who contributed to the debate.  The amendments proposed and accepted have improved the Bill.  In particular, the provisions relating to the appointment of the military judge and chief military judge benefited from amendment and reflect the status attaching to these positions.  The Bill represents a major advancement for the operation of the Irish military disciplinary system.  It represents a sensible and practical model, draws on the most recent developments in common law jurisdictions and will serve us well in the years ahead.  The measures included are proactive as regards human rights.  Crucially, they provide for the effective maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The measures in the Bill will be welcomed by all members of the Defence Forces and they will ensure that Part V of the Defence Act, which relates to summary procedures in courts martial, complies fully with best practice and human rights norms.  I thank all Members for their contributions, which have been most instructive and extremely helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister and his staff on the passage of this Bill through the House.  I thank the Minister for his readiness to accept amendments on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, I could not attend during Committee Stage, for which I apologise, but note that some of our amendments were accepted, particularly those to ensure military judges would have to be accepted through the Cabinet.  This was a significant advance.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in his reply on Second Stage that this legislation had the perusal of the Human Rights Commission, which is very welcome.  I congratulate him and his Department on <Col N="19"/>this because it is important that where we introduce modernising legislation on the operation of the court martial system in the Defence Forces, the Human Rights Commission have an oversight function.  It is important that it operate to the very highest standards of human rights.  It is worth stating, at the conclusion of our consideration of this legislation, that it has the very significant support of the representative organisations within the Defence Forces.  It has been greatly helped by the process of consultation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his staff.  Like Senator Brian Hayes, I, too, appreciate that some of the Opposition&rsquo;s amendments were accepted on Committee Stage.  The Minister has said he will examine further some of the issues we raised, which is also very much appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister and his staff on the Bill.  There was much discussion and the Minister took on board the views of many relevant bodies.  I compliment him on his acceptance of the very good and constructive amendments tabled by the Opposition parties.  He was prepared to take them on board to improve the Bill.  It is great to see a Minister taking on board good, worthwhile amendments that will improve a Bill.  I welcome this and congratulate the Minister on his performance as Minister for Defence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the comments of the preceding speakers on congratulating the Minister and his officials on bringing forward this Bill.  It is worth noting that the military authorities themselves took the initiative to bring their own legal system into line with best international practices.  They are to be congratulated in this regard.  It is rare that we have defence legislation in the House and I believe this is the second such Bill in the lifetime of the Government.  We have had the Ombudsman legislation and now we have this comprehensive legislation.  Those of us who had an opportunity on Second and Committee Stages to examine the legislation can certainly vouch for and endorse its merits.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials for drafting the legislation.  I join with previous speakers in hoping it goes through the D&aacute;il before the general election in order that it is enacted in the short term. </P>
        <P>I again take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister and the Defence Forces, including its personnel both at home and overseas who play such a vital role in defending this State and make a major contribution on the international stage in respect of peacekeeping.  We do not get ample opportunity to acknowledge their service and it is only at times such as this, when there is legislation before the Oireachtas, that we can do that.  I am sure my fellow Senators will join me in extending congratulations to all concerned.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</P>

    <Title>Appropriation Act 2006: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of this opportunity to appear again before this House to resume our discussions on public expenditure and the background to the enactment last December of the Appropriation Act 2006, which gives statutory effect to voted expenditure for 2006.</P>
        <P>Before we examine the detail of public expenditure it would be useful to put it in context by reviewing briefly our economic performance and the performance of the public finances in 2006.  The economy continued to prosper and grew by more than 5% last year.  For the first time in our history there are more than 2 million people employed in the State.  Unemployment has fallen from 10% in 1997 to just more than 4% today with only 1.2% on long-term unemployment benefit.  Our unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the EU, where the average unemployment rate is double that in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer Statement published last month showed the Exchequer recorded a surplus of nearly &euro;2.3 billion in 2006.  This compares to an Exchequer deficit of half a billion euro the previous year.  The nation&rsquo;s debt now represents less than 25% of our income.  It is no wonder the European Commission consistently ranks Ireland as one of the top performers at EU level when it comes to managing our public finances.  In its recent assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update, the Commission noted once again that Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary strategy provides a good example of fiscal policies conducted in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.  With so many more jobs and people employed, more goods and services are being produced and the consequent increase in tax receipts has allowed for a significant increase in the level of public services.</P>
        <P>The end-year Exchequer statement showed that, on an issues basis, net voted current spending increased in 2006 by 11.2% or some &euro;3.3 billion.  Some 79% of these increases were targeted at the priority areas of social welfare, which received additional resources of &euro;736 million last year; health, which received &euro;1.2 billion extra; and education where additional current funding of &euro;663 million was made available.</P>
        <P>Net voted capital expenditure grew by 11.5% or by some &euro;666 million in 2006.  For the fifth year in a row expenditure in 2006 is expected to be within profile, reflecting the sound management of the public finances.  The 2007 Revised <Col N="21"/>Estimates Volume, to be published on 22 February next, will set out detailed provisional expenditure outturns by Vote.  The Government is also determined to ensure  these significantly increased levels of public expenditure result in real improvements in public services.  It is relevant in this context to point to some concrete examples of the progress that has been made.</P>
        <P>Social welfare impacts directly on the quality of life of many sections of society, including our most vulnerable citizens.  Last December the Minister for Finance announced the largest ever welfare budget package with an increase of more than &euro;1.4 billion.  The historically high package delivers on the Government commitment to bring State pensions to &euro;200 per week, with the contributory pension increasing to more than &euro;209, and with substantial across the board increases providing very tangible benefits to more than 1.5 million men, women and children, including pensioners, low income and welfare families, carers, those with disabilities and dependent relatives.</P>
        <P>In addition to the significant rates increases, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has introduced a number of fundamental reforms targeted directly at tackling remaining child poverty numbers, supporting carers through increased incomes and supports, increasing the status and incomes of women pensioners as well as enhancing the incomes of older people generally.</P>
        <P>The resources allocated to the health sector have increased almost four-fold since 1997 to around &euro;13 billion in 2006.  All services have benefited from this greatly increased funding.  To get the most out of the increased resources, a major programme of health reform is under way, building upon the establishment of the Health Service Executive as the single agency charged with the management and delivery of health services at a national level.  More than 1,200 additional hospital in-patient beds and day places have been put in place since 2001.  Waiting times for most common procedures have been reduced to between two and five months, helped by the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund which has arranged treatment for more than 50,000 patients.  Primary care services have been improved and the roll-out of primary care teams is now well under way, with 100 teams being put in place in 2006 and a commitment to create 500 teams by 2011.</P>
        <P>A national child care strategy was launched by the Government in the 2006 budget.  The early child care supplement has been introduced, which is worth &euro;1,000 for each child up to his or her sixth birthday.  An extra 50,000 child care places will be created by 2010 under the five-year national child care investment programme.  To complement the roll-out of these new places, a total of 17,000 child care workers will be trained over the next five years.</P>
        <P>Education is key to promoting our future competitiveness and building a modern knowledge economy.  There are now almost 11,000 more <Col N="22"/>teachers in our schools than there were ten years ago, including teachers at post-primary level.  There are now almost 8,000 teachers working solely with children with special needs and learning difficulties in our schools.   There are about 8,300 special needs assistants meeting the care needs of these children compared with fewer than 300 in 1997.  The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has fallen from 22:1 a decade ago to 17:1 students in 2005, and at post-primary level from 16:1 to almost 13:1 over the same period.  More children are now completing second-level education.  There are higher participation rates at third level, with more than 30,000 more third level places than in 1997.</P>
        <P>I happen to take a particular interest in agriculture.  Direct payments to farmers amounted to almost &euro;2 billion in 2006.  The percentage of payments made is significant and compares very favourably with the situation in all other member states.  Moreover, the single payment scheme has simplified processes for farmers, reduced the level of paperwork and halved inspection levels.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This Government has also nurtured the agrifood sector, which has seen its gross value added, GVA, increase by more than 60% between 1997 and 2005.  The value of agrifood and drink exports to the EU market has grown by more than 40% over the same period.  Exports of Irish food and drinks in 2006 are estimated at a record &euro;8 billion.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Government agreed the agriculture provisions of Towards 2016 with the farm pillar.  The overall package was &euro;6.8 billion, of which the Exchequer provided funding of &euro;4.7 billion for rural development measures.  This is an increase of 135% in Exchequer spending compared with the &euro;2 billion provided in the previous round.  The measures contained in Towards 2016 will underpin the &euro;8.7 billion commitment to agriculture under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>Our sustained period of economic growth has also presented us with an opportunity to tackle the infrastructure deficit and to lay the foundation for continued economic and social progress in the future.  Over the past ten years, great advances have been made in expanding the roads and public transport networks.  As a direct result of our investment in national roads, major traffic bottlenecks have been eliminated and journey time savings have been achieved throughout the country.  The worst traffic bottlenecks including those at Drogheda, Dundalk, Balbriggan, Kildare, Monasterevin, Cashel, Limerick, Ballincollig, Youghal and Kinnegad, have been targeted first.  Further work to eliminate other bottlenecks on the major inter-urban routes continues, while relief roads for Castleblayney and Waterford city are well under way.  It is now possible to travel from north of Gorey to north of Dundalk on almost 180 km of continuous motorway and dual carriageway, or from south of Portlaoise to Dundalk on 170 km of continuous motorway and dual carriageway.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is now the fastest growing railway service in Europe.  Almost 70 new locomotive-hauled carriages were added to the larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann intercity fleet in 2006, at a cost of &euro;120 million.  In 2007, 150 new intercity self-propelled railcars costing  &euro;325 million will start to arrive for service on the intercity routes servicing Dublin, Westport, Ballina, Sligo, Galway, Tralee, Waterford and Rosslare.  The bottom line, in terms of additional seating capacity on our railways, is a huge increase of around 6 million passenger journeys per annum.</P>
        <P>During 2006, more than 1,300 building and modernisation projects were supported in schools.  This investment in our education infrastructure comes on top of a sustained investment drive between 2000 and 2005, during which the Government has delivered 76 new schools, with construction under way at a further 23 new schools; 380 large-scale refurbishments or extensions, with construction under way at a further 54 schools; as well as 6,055 small-scale projects, involving upgrade works and small-scale extensions.</P>
        <P>The Appropriation Act 2006 provides for a capital carryover into 2007 of &euro;159 million, or about 2.4% of the 2006 provision for voted capital.  To allow for spending of the capital carryover amounts in the following year, the Minister for Finance is also required under section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 to make an order no later than 31 March determining the capital carryover amounts by subhead which will be available for expenditure on those subheads consistent with the amounts by Vote included in the Appropriation Act.  The draft ministerial order for 2007 has been tabled for D&aacute;il approval.  Under the capital carryover arrangements, &euro;31 million is available for investment by the Office of Public Works, largely on new works, &euro;29 million is available for the Department of Transport to invest mainly in road improvements, and &euro;20 million will be invested by the Department of the Environment, Housing and Local Government on vital water and sewerage works.  These investment funds, which are carried over from 2006, are available in addition to the moneys that will be allocated in the 2007 Estimates.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Looking to the future, the period to 2013 represents a major window of opportunity to accelerate the tackling of our infrastructure deficits before population related expenditure pressures in health and pensions loom larger on the horizon.  We must use our favourable demographic situation to build up the productive capacity of the economy and lay the groundwork for stronger economic growth in the future.  The National Development Plan 2007- 2013 will involve expenditure of &euro;184 billion over the next seven years.  As it is based on the achievement of annual average economic growth of between 4% and 4.5% over the 2007-13 period, it is affordable.</P><Col N="24"/>
      
        <P>The investment will be rolled out within a framework of economic and budgetary stability and in full compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Among its key objectives are the improvement of everyone&rsquo;s quality of life, the promotion of balanced regional development in the context of the national spatial strategy, greater long-term environmental sustainability and the strengthening of all-Ireland co-operation.  Under the plan, resources will be allocated with a &ldquo;whole-of-Government&rdquo; approach and a cross-departmental perspective.  The plan involves a carefully crafted and integrated strategy, under five priority areas.</P>
        <P>The investment of almost &euro;55 billion in economic infrastructure under the new national development plan will finance the completion by 2010 of the major inter-urban road routes; a significant enhancement of the Atlantic road corridor; a quadrupling of investment in public transport, compared to the previous plan; and a significant switch to the generation of much more electricity from renewable sources.  Some &euro;20 billion will be invested in the promotion of enterprise, science and innovation.  There will be a particular focus on research and development, as well as investment in potential start-up and high-growth companies.  Almost &euro;26 billion will be invested in training and education under the human capital priority.  This will support the continuing upskilling of the workforce and further increases in the number of people attending third level education, including students from disadvantaged areas.  A major programme of reform and modernisation of the third level sector will also take place under this heading.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;33.6 billion will be invested in social infrastructure.  Approximately 60,000 new social housing units, 40,000 new affordable housing units and 500 primary care health teams will be provided by 2011.  The investment of approximately &euro;50 billion under the social inclusion priority, over the seven years of the plan, will allow for the creation of an additional 50,000 new child care places by 2010; a reduction in the number of children with serious literacy problems, particularly in primary schools serving disadvantaged communities; and new supports for older people living independently in their own homes.  If older people cannot live at home in independence and with dignity, the plan will fund the provision of high-quality residential care for them.</P>
        <P>Under the value for money framework, which has been put in place by the Government in recent years, most capital projects are being completed on time and on or within budget.  Value for money will be central to the implementation of the new national development plan.  The value for money framework and the capital appraisal guidelines, in particular, will apply to the programmes and projects being financed under the plan.  All capital projects above &euro;30 million will be subject to full cost benefit analysis.  A project <Col N="25"/>manager will be appointed to monitor the progress of each such project.  Robust implementation and monitoring procedures, including the measurement of performance by reference to inputs and target outputs, will be put in place.  Progress will be overseen by a monitoring committee that will include representatives of social partners and regional and other interests.  An annual report on the progress of the plan will be submitted to the Oireachtas to increase the level of accountability in respect of the delivery of the plan.</P>
        <P>I stand proudly over the Government&rsquo;s record in managing public expenditure.  The Government has delivered strong and sustained economic growth for over a decade, within a budgetary position that is the envy of the rest of Europe.  It has made available unprecedented levels of resources &mdash; almost &euro;51 billion in 2006 &mdash; to fund improvements in public services.  The Government has improved the quality of life and living standards of the people.  More people are at work, taking home more of their own income and enjoying more and better quality public services than ever before.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s stewardship of the economy and the public finances to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is clear the Government knows how to spend money, but that is not news.  It is easy for one to spend money when it is available to one.  Funds are available to the Government because the success of the economy means that people are paying more tax.  The Government knows how to tax people &mdash; 50 stealth taxes have been introduced since the last election.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to widen the tax bands routinely, in line with inflation, has made the public aware of its approach to taxing workers.  The Appropriation Act 2006 does not clarify how the Government intends to get to grips with its pathological inability to tax fairly and spend wisely.  The Government is patting itself on the back for its amazing ability to spend the money of hard-working families.  I will explain to the House the real consequences of a decade of Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats rule.</P>
        <P>Despite the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s attempt to move the goalposts, the recent budget confirms that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats will not deliver on their core promise that 80% of earners will pay tax at the standard rate only.  People who earn considerably less than average earnings will continue to pay tax at the same rate as multimillionaires.  If one earns an extra &euro;1,000, one will be clobbered with a 47% rate of tax, which is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s failure in this regard.  The stamp duty code, which prevents young families from buying homes in established neighbourhoods, needs to be reformed but the Government has not done so.  It has failed to end the practice of making families serial victims of its tax policies.  It has done nothing to <Col N="26"/>ease the burden of child care expenses.  Severe tax penalties are imposed on parents who choose to care for their children at home.</P>
        <P>The Government has not addressed the unfairness of the operation of many tax shelters, which allow people with substantial earnings to shelter huge amounts of money from tax.  While there is no upper limit on what a person can shelter from tax, the Government gives low and middle income earners less than half the rate of tax relief on pension contributions.  Many workers who are outside the tax net, which is to be welcomed, are unable to benefit from the contributions they make to pension funds.  I have said consistently that the relationship between tax and pensions needs to be overhauled.  I hope the Government will tackle this problem.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance said that his budget was &ldquo;a green budget&rdquo;, but he has failed to introduce significant reforms in the tax code to promote more sustainable patterns of development.  He is belatedly waking up to the reality that many ordinary taxpayers are being ripped off because they are not getting the full value of the tax reliefs to which they are entitled.  While Fine Gael welcomes the decision to make spending on nursing homes and trade union subscriptions deductible at source, the Minister&rsquo;s approach to the matter has been half-hearted.  Rather than abolishing the meaningless restriction on health relief claims to cover expenses over &euro;125 for a single person and &euro;250 for a family, he has rationalised them into a single threshold of &euro;125.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, is seeking to trip up taxpayers by preventing the introduction of a simple system whereby every medical expense would attract tax relief.</P>
        <P>I remind Government Senators that the national development plan is not a gift from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to the people of Ireland.  Every family in Ireland will pay &euro;120,000, on average, in the coming years to fund it.  Its worth hinges exclusively on the value for money and efficient delivery of the projects which are included in the plan.  While there is no question about the ability of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to spend this money, I doubt their capacity to deliver value from this spending for those stuck in traffic jams, waiting in accident and emergency departments or looking for affordable houses.  The Government&rsquo;s record in such areas does not inspire confidence.  Just over half of the roads programme, which will cost three times its original estimate, has been delivered.</P>
        <P>The health strategy has almost collapsed with only a tiny fraction of the extra capacity delivered and no serious reform yet pushed through.  Less than half the target for social and affordable housing was delivered, while the country suffered damaging urban sprawl.  Our hospitals, our schools, our public transport system, our ports, are all crying out for coherent planning and delivery.  However, it is disheartening to see so many <Col N="27"/>projects recycled from the last plan and so many targets repeated.  Do we have grounds for believing it will be any better next time?  No Fianna F&aacute;il or Progressive Democrats Minister was ever made responsible for the serious failures of the last national development plan.  Getting it right this time depends on an honest appraisal of what went wrong last time but there is no evidence this has been done.</P>
        <P>The new national development plan lists the achievements of its predecessor but fails to mention how far short of target they fell.  There is no analysis of the under performances, why public private partnerships did not materialise, why reforms in the work vital to yield the potential from expensive infrastructure were not implemented.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have reviewed the period of the last NDP in a way that could only be described as selective and self-serving.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael in Government will impose a new framework on the NDP designed to deliver value.  We will publish the cost-benefit appraisals before committing taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We will establish an independent unit to audit evaluation work.  We will implement a gateway system to ensure that projects have been robustly tested and that responsibility has been pinned.  We will require regular public reports on the progress of projects and their status, be that red, amber or green.</P>
        <P>The last NDP was an exercise in how not to plan.  Numerous spending programmes in the last plan were not delivered on the scale initially promised.  In the case of regional development the Government promised to spend &euro;4.09 billion under the BMW regional programme but has spent only &euro;2.48 billion, which is 61% of the total promised.  The Government promised to spend &euro;656 million on the e-commerce and communication measure but has spent only &euro;100 million, which is 15% of the total promised.  The Government promised to spend &euro;446 million under the child care programme but by the end of 2005 it had spent only &euro;273 million, which is 61% of the total.</P>
        <P>The Government promised to spend &euro;1.2 billion on the back to education initiative but will spend only &euro;600 million, which is 51% of the total promised.  In the case of health, the Government promised to spend &euro;1.3 billion on non-acute and continuing care but has spent only &euro;844 million, which is 65% of the total promised.  In the case of water, only 35% of resources allocated under the management and rehabilitation initiative, including the water conservation programme, were drawn down.  Rural water investment was also under-funded with only 54% of the original target realised.</P>
        <P>It is timely to reflect on the Government&rsquo;s overall record on spending.  In the case of inter-urban routes, the last NDP proposed to upgrade the five major inter-urban routes to motorway or dual carriageway standard.  Initially costed at &euro;5.6 <Col N="28"/>billion, they are now expected to exceed &euro;16 billion and were only 50% completed by the end of last year.  The original scheme for Luas was for a single continuous line from Dundrum to Tallaght, through the city centre.  The project was costed in 1996 for &euro;279 million, but the final cost was &euro;750 million.  Its target completion date was 2000; it was not completed until 2004.  Do I need to remind Members of all these?  The Dublin Port tunnel was originally estimated to cost &euro;222 million in 1999.  The contract awarded in 2000 was for &euro;449 million but the final cost is expected to top &euro;1 billion.  Is the Minister of State hanging his head in shame or does he regard it as a joke?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am as proud as Punch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2005, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, purchased a site for a proposed new prison intended to replace Mountjoy Prison and the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The Minister spent &euro;30 million for a 150 acre site at Thornton Hall in Swords.  This price was estimated by valuers to be more than eight times the going rate for land in the area.  Is this value for money?</P>
        <P>I remind the House about PPARS which was a health payroll and personnel system under development by the Department of Health and Children.  It was costed at &euro;8.8 million in 1998 but the cost of the project had reached &euro;150 million in 2005 when the project was finally suspended.</P>
        <P>The record of the Government is simple.  It inherited the strongest set of economic statistics of any incoming Government in the history of the State.  It presided over a period of immense private success and huge public failure.  Thankfully, the people will be able to decide for themselves very soon and give their verdict on how they think the Government dealt with the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike the last speaker, in my encounters with the people I have found they recognise that fantastic progress has been made and that the country was never better.  Equally, a number of unsatisfactory problems require a lot of further attention.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  He highlighted in his speech some of the benefits of increased expenditure in, for example, social welfare payments; in health where there has been a considerable increase in life expectancy over the past ten years; in the tackling of educational disadvantage; and in agricultural spending, most of which now comes from the Exchequer rather than from Europe.  I wish to highlight the national Exchequer commitment which was not possible in the past.  Taking the example of infrastructure, I know of nobody who does not appreciate the Luas enormously and the new trains and new bypasses.  I am looking forward to travelling on the Ennis bypass this weekend.  I acknowledge there have been some over<Col N="29"/>runs and some trial and error but all the evidence is that the Government is getting this right and that we have learned lessons.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight a few points in the very interesting Central Bank report published in the last week.  Growth is very healthy as are the public finances.  However, the bank makes the point that continued surpluses &mdash; &euro;2.3 billion in 2006 &mdash; will be needed, given significant external and internal risks.  The Minister for Finance in his budget allowed for surpluses in 2008 and 2009.  From the various policy announcements from parties opposite it seems clear to me that if they were in power the cushion of a surplus would very rapidly disappear.  Senator Terry has stated that the Government is very good at spending but the budgeted expenditure was at &euro;830 million under budget last year.  The conventional wisdom is that one should spend all the money one has got but I do not think one should do that if it will involve waste.  The doubling of employment in 20 years is the outstanding achievement of successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  I will allow that the rainbow coalition, which was in power for two and a half years in the middle of the 20-year period, is entitled to a small share of the credit.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank report refers to a pick-up in full-time employment and notes that women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce is climbing above the European average.  This is a significant development.  Traditional industry, which had been fairly flat in recent years, recorded a growth rate of 3% last year, its best year since 2000.  Contrary to the impression that employment in industry is falling, it increased by 8,400 in the first three quarters of 2006.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank forecasts that the general government deficit will fall to 22% in 2009.  Assuming current Government policies continue, all the evidence suggests that Government finances will be considerably healthier that the bank&rsquo;s projection.  The Central Bank report also points to various dangers and risks.  For example, it states that the rate of Government spending &mdash; under the present Government rather than any alternative &mdash; in relation to gross national product is set to rise and that the volume of Government consumption increased by 5% last year.</P>
        <P>Members have expressed concern about costs.  The Central Bank report gives some interesting examples in this regard.  For instance, between 2000 and 2004 the price of alcohol increased by an average of 5.7% per annum.  In 2005 and 2006, the rate of increase declined to 2% and 2.5%, respectively.  One wonders whether some of the difficulties experienced by parts of the pub trade in recent years were due to well above average price increases over a five-year period rather than the introduction of the smoking ban and random breath testing.</P>
        <P>The cost of energy is also a matter of concern.  The Central Bank report notes that the average price of electricity for industry is 33% above the European average, while the price of gas is 56% <Col N="30"/>higher than the European average.  The American Chamber of Commerce and other industry bodies have warned about these costs.  I believe the regulator was too willing to award large increases in gas and electricity prices last year.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank report includes an interesting statistic about the cost of building a house.  In Dublin, where it costs &euro;195,000 to build a house, the price of a house is &euro;400,000.  In Cork, the price of the average house is &euro;300,000 and it costs &euro;146,000 to build a house.  If we decide to alter or adjust stamp duty or other incentives, we need to be careful that we do not increase the large profits being made in construction.</P>
        <P>The report provides the astonishing statistic that the value of assets, in terms of residential housing, increased from &euro;39 billion in 1981 to &euro;553 billion in 2006.  On my reckoning, this amounts to an increase in asset values of approximately 1,400%.  It also includes the sobering statistic that Ireland&rsquo;s labour costs per hour in manufacturing, at &euro;18.30, are almost four times higher than those of the Czech Republic which stand at &euro;4.91 per hour.</P>
        <P>Public sector pay increased by 7% last year.  We also have a number of industrial disputes.  In this respect, one does not always compare like with like.  I value highly the work done by nurses and teachers; it may well be more valuable than some other activities.  We need to watch disparities in this area.</P>
        <P>As elections approach, the question of value for money goes out of the window.  I wonder how many of the proposals with which we have been bombarded in recent days, mainly by the Labour Party, have been assessed for value for money.  Did the Fine Gael Party assess their value for money before eagerly climbing on board and cheering &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo;?  While the proposals may be worthwhile when viewed in isolation, will the general tendency be to increase Government expenditure above and beyond the rate of growth?</P>
        <P>A question never asked in election campaigns is what one will stop doing if one decides to do X, Y and Z.  I am certain a rainbow government, if elected, would shove aside several programmes.  The Dublin-based spokespersons on finance for the Fine Gael and Labour parties clearly have decentralisation in their sights.</P>
        <P>As I stated on the Order of Business, I welcome in principle the Labour Party&rsquo;s conversion to the broad analysis and tax policies of recent years, against which it has fought a less and less convincing rearguard action.  I look forward to listening to the contribution to Senator Ryan who has repeatedly stated that tax reductions were not responsible for the Celtic tiger.  It now appears tax reductions are the centrepiece of Labour Party strategy.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is right to warn that ambitious tax cuts should not constrain vital increases in social services.  As I stressed on the Order of Business, while I do not object to the Labour <Col N="31"/>Party changing its policy, I object to its utter caricature of the Government&rsquo;s tax policies, which have been geared to taking the maximum number of people out of the tax net.  The 38% of taxpayers who were removed from the tax net will not benefit from the standard rate being 20%, 18%, 16% or any other figure unless they are brought into the net again.</P>
        <P>As I indicated on the Order of Business, the European Commission has praised the Government for having the friendliest tax regime for low income earners of all European Union member states.  This is the main accent and emphasis of Government taxation policy.  The reason Fianna F&aacute;il secures around 40% of the vote is that it delivers.  There is no truth in the absurd caricature that budgetary policy is for the benefit of a couple of dozen very rich people.  Many of those on the higher tax rate earn only slightly more than the threshold.</P>
        <P>As far as the wealthy are concerned, the reduction in the top rate to 41%, which was, in a sense, a hangover from the period between 1997 to 2002, when the then Government was supposed to reduce the rate if conditions allowed, does not compensate for the curtailment of tax breaks, on which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has taken action across the board in recent years.  I will challenge the Labour Party every time I hear it utter the drivel that Government tax policy is for the benefit of the very<?oasys _jy ?>rich.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh should relax given that his party and the Labour Party could be in Government together.  I did not intend to interrupt him but as the Labour Party Senators are not present, I thought I would help them out.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who outlined the money being spent on education.  I am glad Senator Mansergh is still present because I wish to correct some of the misinformation he supplied on the Order of Business.  Spokespersons on the Government side stated that the reason schools are being built without playgrounds in a country that is awash with money is that it is the policy of the education partners.  This is not the case.  The fact is that building classrooms and schools is crucially important, as also is class size.  I sought such a debate earlier and perhaps we can go into that matter in greater detail on another day.</P>
        <P>In fairness to Senator Mansergh, however, the point he was making on the Order of Business was that following consultation with the education partners, the Department decided that this year it would give the lowest priority to outside works in schools.  Those proposals concerned new playgrounds, however, whereas I was referring to putting classrooms on top of play areas, thereby losing them.  I am asking Senator Mansergh to take an interest in this.  As of now, schools which will get approval to build for the next academic <Col N="32"/>year have still not been informed.  The list has been determined in the Department and people know it will happen, yet those concerned have not been told that such projects will go ahead.  As soon as schools receive approval to proceed, they must then go through the planning process to get it up and running, which means there will be disruption next year.  If they got the information now, however, that disruption could be avoided.  There are no cost savings involved here.  It is just a matter of having a better administrative approach.  I am asking for that to be done.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to class sizes and the number of additional teachers.  To balance the picture, however, it is important to recognise that one quarter of all primary school pupils are in classes comprising more than 30.  Therefore, there is no point in the Minister of State telling me that the teacher-pupil ratio is 1:17.  That may be a statistical or mathematical fact when one allows for the inclusion of small island schools, compared with large urban schools.  However, we need to talk about class size, not the teacher-pupil ratio.</P>
        <P>Given the 1:30-plus ratio, the amount of individual time a teacher can give to a student in the course of a day is less than ten minutes.  That is the difficulty that has teachers in a state of uproar at the moment because they feel they cannot do the job they wish to do.  More importantly, coming up to a general election, I have mentioned this matter because it was a pre-election promise but it has not been delivered upon.  In fairness to the Minister, she said she has put the resources in another direction.  I will not get into that debate but the fact is that what was promised in terms of class size has not been delivered.  That is an important matter to examine.</P>

If somebody rings up the Rape Crisis Centre and expects to be able to do their business tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, that is not an unreasonable expectation for somebody from the Gaeltacht.  On the other hand, it is extraordinarily difficult for a small group like the Rape Crisis Centre to make that kind of service available.  We need a balance in our approach to these things.  There is too much zealotry ag baint le dul chun cinn pholasaithe Gaeilge na t&iacute;re seo.  We need to be a little more careful in what we are doing.</P>

M&oacute;ran de na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; tarlaithe san Eoraip, is s&oacute;rt political gimmickry at&aacute; i gceist to get recognition for the Irish language.  I welcome what has been done in that regard.  I will not replay my views on the Minister&rsquo;s decision to change the name of my home <Col N="34"/>town from &ldquo;Dingle &mdash; Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is&rdquo; to &ldquo;An Daingean&rdquo;, but I think that is the kind of nonsense that creates a split, a division and aggrevation.  It achieves nothing &mdash; it does not get people speaking Irish &mdash; and turns people against the language.  That is the kind of nonsense and political gimmickry we can do without &oacute; thaobh dul chin cinn na teanga de.</P>

        <P>Tabharfaidh m&eacute; achoimre ar an deacracht a bh&iacute;onn ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute; &oacute; thaobh pholasaithe Gaeilge de.  &Oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;it, t&aacute; s&eacute; de n&oacute;s agus de polasa&iacute; ag an Roinn Oideachais agus &Eacute;ola&iacute;ochta, agus ag na Rialtais &eacute;ags&uacute;la, f&eacute;achaint ar na Galltachta&iacute;.  They have always been far happier to get a few people in Dublin, or a few Northern Unionists, to speak a few words of Irish.  They have always considered that to be a great success. We should be ag f&eacute;achaint ar na Gaeltachta&iacute; agus investing money in muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; so that we have the infrastrucht&uacute;r agus go mbeadh seans acu &oacute; thaobh oideachais de, mar shampla.

Bheimis in ann an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt amach as na Gaeltachta&iacute; mar gheall air sin, seachas an dearcadh faoi l&aacute;thair sna polasaithe, ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na Galltachta&iacute; agus trying to develop it there.  It will never work in that way.</P>
        <P>&Oacute; thaobh na h-ardteistim&eacute;ireachta de, the leaving certificate, bheadh dh&aacute; scr&uacute;d&uacute; ann, two alternatives &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge sa leaving certificate.

Bheadh seans ann do dhaoine scr&uacute;d&uacute; ardteistim&eacute;ireachta a dh&eacute;anamh i labhairt agus scr&iacute;obh na teanga.  That would be one level and then another subject if people wanted to take it would be litr&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge, Irish literature, which would have labhairt agus scr&iacute;obh na Gaeilge but would also have ini&uacute;chadh agus scr&uacute;d&uacute; ar litr&iacute;ocht agus fil&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge and all that goes with it, stair na litr&iacute;ochta agus fil&iacute;ochta agus mar sin.  That would be a sensible way to go forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There should also be particular support, taca&iacute;ocht in oideachas ag an tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al.  Ansin bheimis praitici&uacute;il.  T&aacute; &aacute;iteanna sa t&iacute;r, cos&uacute;il leis an D&iacute;seart i nDaingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is n&oacute; &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Chadhain agus an t-ionad i mBaile Mh&uacute;irne which could immediately be available to allow people to participate i bhforbairt na Gaeilge agus gn&eacute;ithe den teanga.  These are a few of my ideas with regard to the approach to the Irish language which we need to consider.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has always struck me as being sensible on such issues. <Col N="35"/> There has been much hypocrisy with regard to this issue.  I love the Irish language and use it every day of my life.  However, there is no Member of either House who is more critical than I of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for his political gimmickry, although I do not question his commitment.  He has taken the wrong approach.  We should be looking at the Gaeltachta&iacute; and spreading out from there rather than looking at the Galltachta&iacute; and trying to enforce Irish.</P>
        <P>We need to bring people with us.  There is genuine passive support for the Irish language but that will only last so long as we do not interfere with people.  The idea of putting pressure on industry and large State organisations to carry out much of their business through Irish is a nice one but I would prefer to ask people to do it rather than force them.  They will turn against Gaeilge if they are forced to consider the cost of installing an Irish answering service, putting somebody in place to deal with queries through Irish or installing a system to make certain documentation available as Gaeilge.  We are at the tipping point.  We should be clever in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not refer in his speech to the green issue.  The greens are going to save the world and the Government wants to get the green vote, yet the Minister does not refer to the issue.  The greatest waste of money &mdash; I ask Senator Terry to add this to the fine list she outlined in her contribution &mdash; is the &euro;217 million put aside in the budget for carbon credits.  The most sickening aspect, apart from the waste of money, was that the Government cleverly presented it as a major, positive step for the environment that so much was being spent on carbon credits.  It is a fine, for God&rsquo;s sake.  We should be ashamed of ourselves.  It has been put aside because we did not do what was necessary to meet our needs.</P>

	<P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with regard to bio-fuels.  Yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nine O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo; headlines referred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s introduction of new regulations which are more demanding than the national regulations.  I spoke on this issue in the House in the last session.  In fact, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is not the first but the second county council to do so because Fingal County Council was the first.  Clare County Council and other county councils are also considering it.</P>
        <P>Is this not a shame?  Why does nobody think of asking why this is the case?  If the Minister of State decided tomorrow morning that every house built in Ireland would have to have solar panels on the roof, we would save hundreds of <Col N="36"/>millions of euro worth of carbon emissions in the next dozen years.  At a cost of less than &euro;500 per house, it is a simple way forward.  I ask that it be done.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House.  It is undoubted there is good news in what he has told the House.  I welcome the increases for pensioners, especially the increase in the non-contributory old age pension.  I am glad the Minister for Finance has announced that the trend which has developed in recent years will continue, and rightly so, for those who worked hard and raised families in difficult times.</P>
        <P>I spoke today to a pensioner who worked all his life in this country but who finds himself on a half pension.  He was two years short of achieving the contributory pension because he reached the age limit and was not allowed to pay more.  Quite a few people are in the same position, mostly farming people.  This man has relations in America, England, Scotland and elsewhere who are also being paid a half pension.  As he is on a half pension, his wife is also paid a half pension.   He feels very aggrieved.  While I am not sure what can be done, the issue should be examined.</P>

	<P>I welcome the increase under the national child care strategy, the training of 17,000 child carers and the increase to 8,000 special needs teachers.  With regard to the agricultural fund of &euro;6.8 billion, it should be pointed out that the Government is investing &euro;4.7 billion of that sum.  It is much needed.  The IFA and farming representatives came before the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food last week to discuss the prices being paid to farmers.  Some 20 years ago, farmers were paid the same number of punts for sheep, cattle and beef as they are today in euro.  Given the inflation over that period, farmers are being paid not much more than half of what they were paid 20 years ago.  Subsidies have increased, which was necessary, but we must carefully <?oasys _dc28- ?>monitor the operation of the fund or rural life will suffer.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>We must recognise the improvements that have taken place to our roads, particularly in the past seven or eight years.  I regularly use the N4, which now has a dual carriageway from Mullingar to Heuston Station.  That is some change from a time when drivers had to pass through all the towns and villages and has taken 45 minutes off that part of the journey.  I look forward to that road being continued with a &ldquo;2 plus 1&rdquo; road all the way to Sligo.  The Dromad bypass project is under way at present.  I am glad all of these projects are coming in ahead of target and on budget, which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The final stage of the N4 &mdash; the Castlebaldwin to Collooney project &mdash; is included in Transport 21.  I want to ensure it remains a part of that plan and that the finance for it is in place.  I also look <Col N="37"/>forward to improvements on the N17 and on the road from Sligo to Enniskillen and Northern Ireland, the N16, on which there have been many accidents and some fatalities over recent years.  It is important to keep our focus on these areas.</P>
        <P>I was glad to read two weeks ago that new trains ordered are on the way and Mr. Kenny from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has announced the first of these will go to the Sligo line.  This is welcome because the Sligo line has had the worst trains in the country for the past 20 years.  Currently, the line has commuter carriages which are not suitable for three-hour journeys, particularly for elderly people travelling to and from Dublin.  Hopefully, these new trains will be on our lines within the next two months.</P>
        <P>I know it is not part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s remit, but the issue of social housing has cropped up frequently of late.  Housing agencies, such as Respond, Cl&uacute;id and Focus, are building houses that are assigned by local authorities.  Several of my constituents have raised the matter of their tenancies of these houses with me, particularly those in houses built by Respond and Cl&uacute;id.  At the time these people were glad to get a house because their circumstances were difficult, but, as happens, their circumstances have improved.  Rent for these houses is close to market value, which is fair enough.  However, if these were council houses, the tenant could buy out the house when his or her circumstances improved, but that is not the case with a house built by one of the organisations I mentioned.  This is an issue we must deal with sooner rather than later.  I believe these people have a right to purchase, just as if they had moved into a council house.  Some of these people went into these houses because the houses were available before a council house was, but now they find they cannot buy out the house.  This is wrong and we must deal with the issue.</P>
        <P>We have a good story to tell in the context of decentralisation.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has rented an office in Tubbercurry, Sligo, while waiting to move to Knock about seven or eight miles away.  Currently there are 74 people in the office in Tubbercurry.  Criticism of decentralisation is wrong because decentralisation is an excellent idea, no doubt about it.</P>

	<P>The mistake made was the timing for the decentralisation programme was too ambitious, but decentralisation will work over a number of years.  Each day I drive along the N4, I see that the new prison offices being built in Longford are almost completed.  I constantly hear from constituents that they want to move out of Dublin.  Therefore, I believe there will be a good take-up of the decentralisation option and people will be delighted when the programme has settled in.  Those working in Tubbercurry are delighted <Col N="38"/>to be there and would prefer to be out of a job than have to return to Dublin.  There are good stories to tell about decentralisation and it should not be criticised so much.</P>
        <P>The issue of the lands bought for the new prison at Thornton Hall at a cost of &euro;30 million has also given rise to much criticism.  In Sligo recently an eleven acre plot of land without any zoning was sold for &euro;16 million.  If the Minister got 150 acres in north County Dublin for &euro;30 million, he got the bargain of the century.  If the Government wanted to sell on that land, there would be significant profit in it.  It was excellent value.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As Senator Mansergh elucidated so eloquently, Ireland&rsquo;s economy acts as a model for success and is the envy of countries all over the world.  Our greatest achievement is that we have virtually no unemployment.  We have had emigration since the time of the famine, but now people are coming here for work and Ireland is a haven for others seeking employment.  The 400,000 new Irish will be our kith and kin and will intermarry here and become our blood relations in the next generation.  The fact that we now provide jobs for other nationalities is for me the greatest accolade to our economy.</P>
        <P>Roads infrastructure has been mentioned by other speakers.  I travelled to Waterford yesterday and can only say the quicker we get the M9 delivered the better.  We must work to have it delivered by 2010.  The Green Party has argued against building motorways, but they are the safest way to travel because they have no junctions or crossroads.  When people get used to the speed of the motorway, they are safer.  I felt nervous initially on motorways, but they are safer.  The existing road to Waterford is basically a country road so the sooner we get the motorway built, the easier it will be for communication with the rest of the country.  It is a pleasure to travel across the country from east to west because the new roads are fantastic.  The improvements that have been made in roads infrastructure are a great achievement.  Despite what Senator Terry said, the roads network has improved tremendously.</P>

	<P>The Luas is profitable and was delivered on time and within the cost of the tendered plan, not the plan decided in 1996, which was different.  I live in Dundrum and use the Luas frequently.  It is always packed and it is a pleasure to have it available.  The sooner we have similar successful projects throughout the country, the better.</P>

	<P>Other large towns like Cork, Waterford and Limerick should develop similar public service transport.  County councils should get on their bikes in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted money has been allocated for 50,000 new child care places in the Estimates.  It is important that child care providers are made aware of the plan and know where the places will be created.  We cannot just put up the money for these places without a proper plan for its allocation.  Different areas of the country have different needs with respect to the number of child care places required.  We need a clear, transparent plan with regard to how the 50,000 places will be delivered and implemented.  As a business person I know a plan is irrelevant unless it can be delivered and that implementation is far more important than the paper plan.  One must be also able to deliver.  The &euro;1,000 child care supplement is of tremendous help to parents, but I propose that the Government increase that for every child under six to &euro;1,250 in the 2008 budget and &euro;1,500 in the 2009 budget.  We must maintain the rate of progress and help parents with the cost of child care, which everyone knows is very expensive.  Another area is our standard of living.  Child care and ageism are the two main areas on which I concentrate as a Senator.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, might persuade the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, that mandatory retirement at the age of 65 must go, as I proposed in my document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a new T&aacute;naiste now, a gentleman.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I always think of her ladyship as the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>As a result of my policy document, I have given talks around the country and had letters in the newspaper.  I have been inundated with telephone calls and letters from people in a desperate state <Col N="40"/>because they do not wish to retire at 65.  An <i>Irish Times</i> MRBI poll last autumn indicated that 41% of those now aged 50 had no intention of retiring at 65.  People are living much longer and are much healthier.  They are absolutely capable of doing their jobs and are experienced workers.  Why should they be jettisoned at 65?  There are skills shortages in many areas of business and industry, and it is crazy to guillotine people the moment they turn 65.</P>
        <P>I am on a mission during my time as a Senator, which I hope will continue after the next election, to change that, something I hope will happen within the next few months.  It would take only minor legislative changes to scrap mandatory retirement.  There would be great economic benefits to the country.  I do not understand why the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is not agitating for such a reform, since, if people are still working and paying taxes, they are not necessarily drawing their pensions.  It would be a win-win situation.  We would keep experienced, skilled people in their jobs and continue to collect taxes, while payment of the old-age pension could be postponed until a person left employment.</P>
        <P>Mandatory retirement should go, and we should introduce phased or gradual retirement in its place.  I am not saying everyone should remain at work, but people should have the choice.  I had to give up my job in the schools section of the Office of Public Works when I got married in 1969.  My boss did everything to try to keep me.  I was able to work in a semi-State organisation because I had a skill that was needed, but if I mention to people today that women had to give up their jobs when they got married, they do not understand, since they have forgotten that such a situation once obtained.</P>
        <P>The discrimination whereby people aged 65 must give up their jobs is as serious as when women had to give up their jobs when they got married.  Cases are before the courts in Spain and in England.  Would it not be great if our Government took the initiative itself rather than waiting for a European directive as happened in 1973?  The moment we joined the EU, all the married women were allowed to return to work.  Senator Mansergh mentioned their great contribution to the economy.  I will now lobby every Minister on mandatory retirement, since the situation is ridiculous.</P>

	<P>Senator Terry should acknowledge how well the economy has developed, something shown by the fact that the life expectancy of a 60 year old woman is now seven years longer than in 1935.  That is evidence for how much living standards have increased.  One policy decision that has been absolutely visionary has been to ban the smoking of cigarettes in public places.  At the moment, Irish life expectancy is below the <Col N="41"/>OECD average, but as the results take effect over time, it will no doubt rise above it.  The country is fine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his senior officials to the House.</P>
        <P>This debate on the Appropriation Act 2006 is timely, since never before in recent years has there been such concentration on legislation and budgetary issues in the run-up to a general election.  Nothing concentrates a politician&rsquo;s mind more than the electric chair or the date of the general election; both have a certain inevitability about them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that we know it is going to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This case has certainly concentrated the mind of the leader of the Labour Party.  In the words of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, there has been a conversion on the road to Damascus.  Deputy Rabbitte was converted from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Workers&rsquo; Party to Democratic Left, and now he is the leader of the Labour Party.  He has therefore undergone three Damascene conversions, whereas St. Paul had only one.</P>
        <P>Nothing is certain in this world except death and taxes, as Benjamin Franklin stated in 1789.  Albert Einstein said that the most difficult thing in the world to understand is income tax.  In the case of Deputy Rabbitte, one might quote George Bernard Shaw and state that &ldquo;a government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Last Saturday&rsquo;s proposal from the Labour leader, the most unexpected source, came as a bolt from the blue.  We had all expected the leader of the Progressive Democrats, who will address his party&rsquo;s annual gathering in Wexford next Saturday, to suggest further innovations regarding taxation in conjunction with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Deputy Quinn has said that one cannot enjoy the same level of services as Finland, Portugal or Greece unless one has a similar level of taxation.  That suggests a rise in taxation, but he also called for a reduction in taxes.  He was not as active in that regard when he was Minister for Finance.  Is that a coherent policy or just more empty promises?</P>
        <P>In 1992 the top rate of tax was 48%, and the lower rate 26%.  The former came down to 41% over the years, with a commitment in this year&rsquo;s Budget Statement to cut it to 40% next year, with a lower rate of 20%.  There is no reason in the wide earthly world a new Administration of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats should not continue the success story of the past ten years with a consistent policy of reducing <Col N="42"/>income tax.  The electorate must decide whether it should trust the parties that delivered a reduction in income tax or a party that has opposed such reductions since its foundation.  I hope a simple leaflet will be issued to every PAYE taxpayer when his or her P60 is sent out or any other information is conveyed to demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s proven record in that regard.  What has happened can be tracked.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Act itself, but in a sense circumstances have directed me to highlight the situation regarding income tax, since we would not have been able to deliver this level of services without it.  The Government increased income tax receipts over the years by having 2 million people at work, and that is a direct result of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Administration.  It is easy for a party which has not been in Government for more than ten years to give away money it does not have.  It delivered high taxes consistently through any coalition Government of which it was a party.  All of a sudden, because of the realisation of its dwindling support in the opinion polls and the unlikelihood of Opposition parties coming together to form a Government, it is trying to buy the electorate.</P>
        <P>Ireland has in recent years achieved one of the best economic performances in the world, with economic growth since 1997 averaging 7% compared with the EU average of 1.5%.  We now have the highest level of employment in the history of the State.  I reiterate that 2 million people are employed.  That is an enormous achievement.</P>
        <P>When I was in Government in the mid-1980s, there was emigration, there were cutbacks and there was fiscal rectitude.  All that was happening in a difficult period when I was in the then Department of Health.  There were cutbacks in health and throughout the public sector to correct the economy, and we have got it correct.  I, and every Member of this House who was a Member at that time, can take credit.  Sacrifices were made, by the country as a whole and by individuals, but especially by politicians of Fianna F&aacute;il who were supported at that time by the Tallaght strategy of the then Leader of the Opposition, former Deputy Alan Dukes, who was courageous enough to identify the position in which we were and who took an unselfish attitude for which he got little reward from his friends in the Fine Gael Party, who brought him down shortly afterwards.</P>
        <P>We find ourselves in a position where the Government finances are very healthy.  There is no question about that.  Against this increased background of prosperity it is only right that the Government invest strongly in infrastructure, and it is investing 5% of gross national product in infrastructure &mdash; twice the European average.</P>
        <P>In the 2007 budget the Government honoured its commitment to achieve a basic social welfare pension of &euro;200 a week, that is, a rise of &euro;18 a week.  The Leader of the Progressive Democrats and T&aacute;naiste, Deputy McDowell, has given a <Col N="43"/>commitment that if he is returned to Government, with Fianna F&aacute;il, the old age contributory pension would be increased to &euro;300 during the five-year lifetime of the next Administration.  I believe that commitment will be honoured.  I await the discussions in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, where we are producing our own manifesto in this regard.  Given that we achieved the &euro;200 pension in the lifetime of this Government and we increased the pension to more than &euro;200 in the last budget, I do not see anything too difficult to achieve in that commitment.  Compare this with the meagre pension increase achieved by the rainbow Government in the bad old days, just &pound;2.29 in 1995, when the then leader of the Democratic Left, former Deputy De Rossa, who is now a member of the Labour Party, was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That was before the conversion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, that was before the fall on the road to Damascus.  The Government has returned &euro;5 billion to the people in tax reductions since 1997.  The national debt has more than halved.  Some &euro;1.7 billion that was previously spent on debt is now available for investment in services.  In education, we have invested considerably in schools, etc.</P>
        <P>I also would be concerned about Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal in its last manifesto to raid the pension fund that we have built up for the future.  Nobody, not even Deputy Rabbitte, has suggested raiding that fund to pay for whatever investment.  That fund is untouchable and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, must ensure that we leave that fund building up.  That fund, which is a tribute to the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, has been continued by the Minister, Deputy Cowen.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for the opportunity of speaking on this matter.  We in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are responding in like fashion to the audacious statement by the leader of the Labour Party last Saturday.  It has been exposed by the Minister for Finance as hypocritical, unworkable and unfeasible without overall policies.  I cannot see why the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats will not continue with meaningful, realisable and achievable tax reductions, and the people will respond in May when the general election occurs.</P>

	<P>I have been listening with great interest to the debate and I want to address some of the points raised by Senators.  Senator Terry strongly criticised the Government on failures and overruns, especially in the previous national development plan.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="44"/>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Much has been said about different projects delivered under the previous national development plan.  Frankly, many of these comments have been blown out of all proportion and are ill-informed.  That is being polite about some of the comments.  Taking the port tunnel as a case in point, the proper comparison to make is between the price at tender and the price at delivery.  The tender price for the port tunnel was &euro;580 million and the final cost was &euro;750 million.  Much of the difference between the two is due to the operation of the price variation clause, which captures construction inflation, and also the higher than anticipated land settlement costs.  Taking the two issues into account, the final cost overrun is a more modest 6%.  These are the facts of the matter.</P>
        <P>In general terms, the experience of delivering infrastructure projects is positive and, as a number of Senators on this side of the House stated, increasing numbers of capital projects are being delivered, both on time and within budget.  We are putting in place a range of measures to strengthen our focus on delivering projects on a value for money basis.  The Government is well aware that there is more to public expenditure management and delivery of public services than making available the resources, as we have done.  Good governance also requires that we ensure that the public gets good value for every euro spent.  That is why the Government has put in place a comprehensive value for money framework that addresses every aspect of public expenditure, from the planning phase right through to implementation and delivery.</P>
        <P>For example, in February 2005 the Department of Finance published new detailed capital appraisal guidelines to ensure that major capital projects are planned in a cost effective manner.  In January 2006 the Department of Finance followed this up with a range of value for money requirements codified in a value for money, VFM, circular to all Departments.  The new rules include the following requirements: an individual must be appointed as project manager for all major capital projects to monitor and manage progress; all projects costing more than &euro;5 million must undergo a preliminary appraisal and a full detailed appraisal; all projects costing more than &euro;30 million must undergo a full cost benefit analysis at detailed appraisal stage; all capital programmes with an annual value in excess of &euro;50 million and of five years&rsquo; duration or more must be evaluated at the beginning and mid-point of each five-year cycle unless otherwise agreed; for major information and communications technology projects an independent peer review process must be carried out at key decision points by an experienced team; and Departments and agencies must report progress on their capital programmes and major projects in their annual <Col N="45"/>reports.  The Department is certainly taking those issues seriously.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised Irish language issues.  To enlighten and remind him, the Official Languages Act 2003 was brought in by this Government, the first to bring in such legislation.  We were the first Government to appoint an Irish language ombudsman.  The Irish language has official working status in the EU and this took effect on 1 January 2007.  Funding was introduced in 2006 for an advanced Irish language skills initiative and that is continuing into 2007.  There has been investment of &euro;132 million in Gaeltacht infrastructure schemes since 1997.  An additional funding of &euro;1 million was provided to assist organisations involved in language maintenance in the Gaeltacht, including a language planning initiative.  In total, approximately &euro;103 million is being made available in the 2007 Estimates for the Irish language and the development of the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Questions were raised about the sustainability of the national development plan and whether the country could afford it.  I certainly heard some ill-informed criticisms from different quarters to the effect that public spending growth is not sustainable or that the national development plan is not affordable.  The reality is quite different.  Growth in current and capital public spending has been maintained at around 10%, on average, in the past five years, compared with an average annual gross national product, GNP, growth of around 9% in the same period.  This level of increase has allowed for major improvements in public services, with tangible impacts in areas such as education, roads and public transport, and more resources are being allocated to strengthen front line public services such as health and justice.  We have invested considerably in building our economic infrastructure in a way that supports the growth potential of our economy and the recent national development plan will provide a coherent framework for this strategic approach to resource allocation.</P>
        <P>I do not feel I need to cover the subjects of health and child care, but more than 1,200 additional in-patient beds have been put in place since 2001.  More than 50,000 patients have been treated under the National Treatment Purchase Fund and all persons aged 70 and over are now entitled to a medical card.  In addition to significant improvements in the income guidelines for standard medical cards a general practitioner, GP, visit card is being introduced for certain low earners.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to overruns and I think I have explained them fairly well.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of stealth tax and it is important to point out that average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayer since 1997 and all employees have seen their average rate of tax fall since 2002.  People are earning more, paying proportionally less tax, there is greater equity in the tax system and a <Col N="46"/>substantial number of people are paying no tax at all.  Some 80% of people pay less than 20% of their wages in income tax and this year more than 750,000 people on low incomes will pay no tax, compared with fewer than 400,000 in 1997.  There is now a statutory minimum wage and those earning the minimum wage are out of the tax net.  I could go on in this manner with reference to a number of areas.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the Government&rsquo;s tax measures in support of the environment and Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to bio-fuels in this regard.  The Finance Act 2004 provided for the introduction of a scheme for bio-fuels providing relief from excise duties.  The number of applications made for relief under this pilot scheme indicated a strong interest in developing a bio-fuels industry in Ireland.  Consequently, a provision was made in the Finance Act 2006 for a significantly expanded five year scheme on mineral oil tax relief, the scope of which extends to projects which are not of a pilot nature.</P>
        <P>The scheme commenced in November 2006 and will provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of bio-fuel per annum, at a cost of more than &euro;200 million over five years.  When fully operational the scheme will result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of more than 250,000 tonnes, meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by bio-fuels by 2008, help reduce our dependence on conventional fossil fuels and stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.  As mentioned, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, made a significant announcement in this regard.  These fiscal incentives were designed to kick start the domestic bio-fuel industry and the evidence suggests this is happening.  Vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief for hybrid vehicles was introduced in January 2001.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the purchasing of carbon credits.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is to meet our mission targets based on three fundamental areas.  We will participate in the EU emissions trading scheme, a range of measures across the remainder of the economy and the purchase of State carbon credits.  The purchase of carbon credits is just one element of a broader strategy aimed at meeting our ambitious targets of cutting greenhouse gases.</P>
        <P>I have answered most of the questions raised and my colleagues on this side of the House have also dealt with them.  The discussion this afternoon has illustrated that this Government has spearheaded a remarkable strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s economic fortunes over its period in office.  We have an economy that is, in many ways, the envy of Europe.  With far-sighted initiatives such as Transport 21, the national spatial strategy and the national development plan the Government has demonstrated its vision for sustaining our economic development in the medium and long term.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s discussion has also shown that there is very little new or valid in the criticisms voiced. <Col N="47"/> We all know the challenge is to ensure delivery of our commitments and value for money in the use of public funds.  This is what the Government is determined to achieve and we have put in place structures and mechanisms to this end.  I thank the Acting Chairman and Senators for the courtesy extended to me in the House today.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that they may speak only once on Report Stage, except for the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to the discussion thereon.  Each amendment on Report Stage must be seconded.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, line 42, after &ldquo;television&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and digital radio mondiale&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am happy to welcome the Minister of State back to the House and regret I was not present on the previous occasion.  I spoke extensively on Second Stage and tabled many amendments, which my colleague Senator Henry moved on my behalf because I was detained at a symposium in Trinity College.</P>
        <P>I am being helpful and in this regard I have tabled one amendment on Report Stage as a test case to provoke debate.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board and include in his speech the point that, but for the Seanad, the radio broadcasting element might not be included in the legislation.  It was certainly not in the Bill until the amendments were tabled.  It is very important that we have the most efficient and technically advanced form of broadcasting for our citizens abroad, who also include deaf people.  The radio system is very important.  The BBC, for example, would probably consider the radio broadcasts of the BBC World Service to be at least as significant and powerful as the television broadcasts, and probably more powerful in terms of altering public opinion.</P>
        <P>My remarks concern a kind of conflict between the digital audio broadcasting, DAB, system and the digital radio mondiale, DRM, systems.  I must be open and lay my cards on the table in that I am simply not technically proficient in this matter.  I am therefore putting on the record of the House what I have been advised about the broadcasting systems and what may be regarded as the advantages of the DRM system over the DAB system.  The first is that DRM is a cost effective solution delivering free-to-air digital community radio.  There is particular value in reviewing this option to create affordable opportunities for small-scale service on digital platforms, especially for targeted audiences.  The DAB system is 25 years old <Col N="48"/>and is really designed for large national services.  It has not been available to small-scale community stations because of its prohibitive cost and its multiplex nature.  This means that coverage for a single service is difficult to target effectively.</P>
        <P>My advice indicates that many in the industry regard the DAB system as already out of date.  As I am sure the Minister of State and his advisers are aware, what we used to call &ldquo;wireless receivers&rdquo;, in other words, radios or &ldquo;trannies&rdquo; or whatever they are now called, are not equipped for DAB1 and they certainly will not be equipped for DAB2.  They will not get the updated system, as has happened elsewhere.  DAB1 has already been replaced by DAB2.  The two systems are not compatible and new receivers are required for the latter, which is now coming on stream.</P>
        <P>DRM is an energy saving upgrade for the medium, long and short wave bands, giving near FM sound both day and night.  It complements DAB rather than competing with it.  DAB2 is more efficient and allows better sound quality and more stations.  Like broadband, DAB creates a deficit for those who live away from large towns.  I presume this makes a significant difference to a scattered population abroad and implies that its receiving capacity is reduced.</P>
        <P>DAB carries many stations grouped on a multiplex and transmitted from a common mast.  A centralised mast is remote from existing target areas of small stations.  DAB duplicates in that each station&rsquo;s programme is carried into the service areas of others to uninterested listeners, thereby producing a scatter effect.  Many rural areas have too few stations to form a group and fill a multiplex so they cannot be served by DAB.  Does this imply that to receive DAB, one must create a group and subscribe or be near a re-broadcasting system?  Does it mean isolated people will be excluded under DAB?</P>
        <P>I am also advised that if DAB is to be used in Ireland, it should have broadcast quality at least equal to FM, which is not the case in the United Kingdom.  DAB2 will improve fidelity.  RTE&rsquo;s FM signal is three times stronger than that of our UK neighbours and this will make it very difficult to convince the public that DAB1 is relevant at this late stage.  It other words, it is being suggested that we leapfrog and go straight to DAB2.  However, we must tell consumers that their receiver equipment is out of date.</P>
        <P>Radio Denmark has advised would-be DAB radio purchasers that DAB2 has been adapted by the world DAB body.  Existing radios now being sold in Ireland will not work with this new system.  Micro-power DRM, using near CB channels, can provide a solution.  In other words, provision could be made for small-scale stations.  It would be important for RTE as a public-service broadcaster to inform its listeners that existing DAB radios do not meet the new standard and will be obsolete in future years.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should acknowledge the problem.  Let me refer to a quotation by the <Col N="49"/>Australian Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, who I am glad to see is both a Senator and a woman.</P>

	<P>The Danish have had experience in this matter.  A newspaper, <i>Politiken</i>, quotes Mr. Paul Sams&oslash;e, the head of engineering from the Danish equivalent of BBC Radio &mdash; or Danish state radio:</P>
        <P LI="1">[W]hen asked whether owners of DAB receivers would have to replace their DAB radios in five years time, Paul Sams&oslash;e replied: &ldquo;Yes &mdash; just like you&rsquo;ll also have to get a new television set and a new mobile phone.&rdquo; ... Denmark is the only other country in the world apart from the UK where DAB has actually started selling &mdash; like in the UK, DAB has started selling only due to heavy advertising &mdash; so with someone like Paul Sams&oslash;e saying this, and taking into consideration that previously he&rsquo;s been a big supporter of the DAB system, it makes you wonder about whether everybody will have to buy new DAB receivers in the UK as well.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, by taking this system, virtually every radio in the country is rendered obsolete.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>The Minister of State has a well-satisfied little smile playing at the corner of his lips.  Perhaps he has just been passed the full, complete and definitive technical answer to this, and I look forward with some interest to his reply.  Could he confirm something that came not just from me and the Independent benches, but from other colleagues on this side of the House?  There was significant interest on the Government side as well.  The Government tabled its own amendments, but only after I had tabled those amendments in the first place.  The Minister of State might, perhaps, because he is a gracious man, acknowledge that the Seanad has played a significant role in ensuring that not only television images, but also radio broadcast material is made available to the Irish diaspora.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Senator Norris has eloquently set out the case for it.  Towards the end of his address he indicated the desire and intention, as provided for in the Bill in terms of television, to ensure that the Irish abroad have full access to what is available, using the technology.  We should now use the opportunity contained in this legislation to extend this through the radio as well as the television network.  In that regard, I am happy to second and support the amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>At least Senator Norris did not have to distribute most of his contribution because we already have it.  We all received what he got and what he said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that I was briefed and that, to a certain extent, the technical material is beyond my capacity. </P>

	<P>Senator Kenneally, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris was speaking about being interrupted, but it did not take him long to start interrupting somebody else.  I realise he did not have the benefit of being in the House on Committee Stage and hearing what the Minister of State said.  He indicated, and Senator Norris is saying, that this would not have come about as regards radio broadcasting were it not for the amendments tabled by him and others.  That is not the case, however, because the Minister of State made it quite clear that it was not necessary to put it into the legislation since RTE already has a remit to broadcast&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no wonder the Government tabled those amendments to cover the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Kenneally, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>He is off again.  RTE already has a remit to broadcast and is already doing this on long wave.  However, the Minister of State agreed &mdash; and Senator Norris is correct in saying this suggestion came from all sides of the House &mdash; that he would include it in the legislation.  The <Col N="51"/>Minister of State came forward with the amendments on Committee Stage, as agreed by the House.</P>
        <P>The Bill is not concerned with digital radio mondiale, DRM, versus digital audio broadcasting, DAB.  It is not technical legislation as such.  It enables RTE to do certain things as regards television and now radio.  The Minister of State quite clearly made the point on Committee Stage that if this were to be included in the legislation, it would basically force RTE or whoever into broadcasting only through one particular mechanism.  I am not sufficiently technically minded to be able to say which is the correct one.  None of us knows whether in two, three or five years&rsquo; time any of these systems might be obsolete.  However, if we stitch it into the legislation now, we are stuck with it.  It would mean the legislation would have to be changed again to be compatible with the technology of the day.  That is the point the Minister of State was making, above all else, on Committee Stage, and I believe the legislation would be better if it were left out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Kenneally put it very well what the Bill is about.  I share his disappointment that Senator Norris was not in the House for what was a very interesting debate on all sides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that it is pestiferous and in violation of the rules of the House to refer to a Member&rsquo;s absence.  I am sure my elderly colleague, Senator Mooney, and my even more elderly colleague, the other one whose name I have forgotten, will remember this in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is quite correct.  Senator Mooney, without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not meant with any sense of malice.  It was just that it was unfortunate that there was not an opportunity.  I am sure the Senator had perfectly good reasons for not being in the House.  I said this because I do not believe it is fair to the House to go into all the arguments again.  Senator Kenneally has pointed out that in the context of the amendment tabled by Senator Norris, it is not a case of either-or.  The question arises as to the motive behind Senator Norris tabling an amendment specific to a particular type of radio technology which Mr. Enda O&rsquo;Kane, through his very active lobbying of all sides of the House, has been promoting when there is no reference in the Bill to the alternative type which the Senator has been very much against.</P>
        <P>To try to sum up matters, more than 800 radio stations in Europe operate the DAB system.  On the references in the documents to the Danish engineer, my information is that at the highest level in Radio Denmark there is no question of DAB no longer being used.  RTE&rsquo;s position is that it is attempting to have what is generally referred to as the industry norm.  It does not want to be out of step with the European norm, which in <Col N="52"/>effect means that more than 800 stations operate the DAB system.</P>
        <P>As Senator Kenneally has said, and it bears repeating, we are moving in a technological environment that is evolving very quickly.  There is no guarantee that even what is referred to in Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment will be the industry norm in three, four or five years&rsquo; time.  Mr. Enda O&rsquo;Kane has focused to a large extent on the question of community radio somehow being terminated.  In other words, if there is the adoption of a particular technology, community or local radio will not be available.  We must remember that the Bill refers to the setting up of various structures.  There will be a new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland which will be responsible for regulating both the introduction and maintenance of the spectrum as well as the regulation of radio in this country in the digital age.  To suggest at this point, in line with the doomsday scenario being put forward, that the existing radio service will no longer be available because of the adoption of a particular technology, which is not in the Bill anyway, is mischievous.  I do not for a moment doubt the motives of Mr. Enda O&rsquo;Kane.  He is a former distinguished member of RTE&rsquo;s engineering staff and knows what he is talking about.</P>
        <P>I will share with Senator Norris the fact that I do not always know what I am talking about in terms of technology.  This is real technical stuff.  I would love to be eavesdropping on all the so-called techies when they talk about the benefits of DAB1, DAB2 or DRM.  However, in last week&rsquo;s <i>Radio Times</i>, the British equivalent of the <i>RTE Guide</i>&mdash;&mdash;--</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the other way around.  The <i>RTE Guide</i> is the Irish equivalent of the <i>Radio Times</i>.  It existed long before the <i>RTE Guide</i>.  The Senator should not be parochial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was only attempting to put on the record what it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that is the attitude here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I still believe the <i>Radio Times</i> is the British equivalent of the <i>RTE Guide</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has got it the wrong way around.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>A letter was sent by a listener from Watford in Hertfordshire, whose name I will not put on the record.  She wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">I&rsquo;ve heard that current DAB receivers won&rsquo;t be able to decode the new standard for DAB transmission (AAC+) [which I point out to Senator Norris is another new technological name that I have not come across previously, although it is explained; it confuses the matter even further] being adopted in various countries.  In three to seven years&rsquo; time, will DAP receivers on sale in the UK today be obsolete, or will we simply need an adaptor?</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P FLI="0">It is a moot point.  The answer given by the technical side of the BBC states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In November last year, WorldDMB, the organisation that defines the standards for digital audio broadcasting, announced that the current DAP digital radio system was in the process of being upgraded to adopt the new AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) system.  The new digital radios will have better transmission quality and the capacity for more channels.  Although the new DAB+ radios will be able to decode ordinary DAB broadcasts, the old radios will not be able to decode the new broadcasts [This is the point on which Senator Norris touched.].  It&rsquo;s too early to say which stations will broadcast in DAB+, but don&rsquo;t panic just yet.  A spokesperson for the BBC&rsquo;s digital stations tells <i>RT</i>: &ldquo;There are over three million receivers in use in the UK that can only decode signals conforming to the original coding standard, and this number is growing rapidly.  The BBC is committed to ensuring its services continue to be broadcast in a way that is compatible with these receivers.  Listeners can be confident that, at whatever stage they buy a DAB radio, they will always have access to a varied range of services.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the Irish context, my understanding is &mdash; although I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; that there are no DAB radio receivers in this country capable of receiving DAB broadcasts and there are no DAB broadcasts currently but there will be in a few weeks&rsquo; time.  RTE is involved in pilot trials in this respect.</P>
        <P>The standard here is the FM frequency.  RTE generates approximately &euro;40 million a year from its radio services.  Will RTE abandon the FM frequency and spectrum at some point in the future?  It would defy commercial logic for it to do so unless it is certain it will maintain the services to which its listeners have become used and will demand from a public service broadcaster.</P>
        <P>I do not wish in any way to diminish Senator Norris&rsquo;s valuable contribution but this matter goes back to a point Senator Kenneally made.  We are waiting to hear what the Minister of State has to say on this issue.  He is the most important person here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Even more important than the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;given that it is to him Senator Norris directed his amendment.  However, I suggest that, irrespective of the merits of DAB versus DRM or whatever, the debate on this Bill is not where this argument should be taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to reply, I am sure he and the Members would like to join me in welcoming the Right Honourable Andrew MacKinlay, MP, from the House of Commons.  I welcome him to the House and hope he enjoys his stay here.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="54"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>He is very welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only too pleased to acknowledge the contribution made by Senators on the Second Stage debate here.  As Senator Norris pointed out, a strong recommendation and argument was made that the proposed legislation should require RTE to provide this radio service as well as a television service to Irish communities abroad and, as a consequence, section 3(1) was amended on Committee Stage to require RTE to provide such a service.</P>
        <P>Primary legislation in the main outlines principles rather than specific technologies needed to support such principles.  As a consequence, the amended wording sets out the principle that RTE must provide a radio service to Irish communities abroad but does not specify the broadcasting technology to be used in delivering such a service.  In essence, the Bill entrusts RTE with the task of considering the most appropriate technological and financial means of addressing the broadcasting needs of Irish communities abroad and, importantly, to account for the public funds expended in such provision.</P>
        <P>The amendment, as proposed by Senators Norris and Henry, would tie RTE to using the digital radio mondiale standard.  This amendment might prove to be unnecessarily restrictive in terms of current and future technology solutions and, as such, I am unable to accept the proposed amendment.</P>
        <P>With regard to some of the issues raised, DAB1, DAB2 and DRM are all fine choices but we should give the broadcasters the flexibility to let them best decide how to reach their audience.  New radio sets would be required to listen to DAB and DRM.  There are 200 types of DAB sets available ranging in price from &euro;50 upwards.  DRM sets are only coming on stream and are priced at &euro;220 upwards.</P>
        <P>The current text of the Bill allows RTE the flexibility to use both DRM and DAB.  RTE&rsquo;s current position is that the DAB is the preferred digital alternative for national FM coverage and the DRM may be a digital alternative for its international long-wave services.  RTE is upgrading its long-wave transmitter in Meath and will begin night-time DRM transmissions for RTE Radio 1 later this year.</P>
        <P>We did not specify in the legislation covering the setting up of RTE in 1960 the technology that was to be used at that time.  Therefore, I consider this amendment to be unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that as the proposer of the amendment I have the right to make a brief reply.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply which was gracious and generous, unlike that of the first spokesperson for the Government whose <Col N="55"/>contribution reflected the usual snotty dog in the manger Government attitude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not realise the Senator was so offended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other hand, it was refreshing to be patronised by my old friend Senator Mooney.  It took me back to the old days and I felt that I was really at home.</P>
        <P>I shall explain myself and why I did this.  I was not in the House at the time as I was chairing a symposium in Trinity.  The Senator on the other side of the House knows only too well that one goes where the voters are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.  There was no reflection on the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There are not that many voters here.  There are one or two but their votes are already sewn up.  I went where my voters were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was right.  There was no reflection on him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was perfectly right.  We are going to save a planet so that the Senator&rsquo;s old airwaves can go whizzing through it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that where the Senator was throwing a Frisbee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Norris to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>To be a little bit more serious, I say this because I show respect for this House.  I originally tabled an amendment, which did not get on to the yellow list of amendments but appeared on the white list that came out during the holidays, simply because I spotted that provision was not made for sound broadcasting.  I accept absolutely that I am not technically proficient and I received briefings.  Subsequent to my tabling of these amendments, I was contacted by Mr. O&rsquo;Kane and he gave me a great deal of technical information.  The Government then tabled its amendments, which was a good move.  I agree with what the Minister of State said in the sense that he is offering a series of options and that this proposal would narrow and restrict them.  That seems to be a perfectly reasonable, logical and non-exclusive answer.</P>
        <P>In response to the attitude I got from the opposite side of the House, I tabled only one amendment.  If I wanted to be difficult, I would have tabled 258,000, but I knew that would be aggravating, stupid and a total waste of time.  I wanted to table this amendment because although I had an idea about what the Minister of State said because I glanced through the documents, I had received a second briefing, having sent the Official Report of the proceedings to Mr. O&rsquo;Kane.  Out of deference and courtesy to a man to whom Senator Mooney, who is involved in the <Col N="56"/>radio business or profession or whatever he wants to call it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that was a gracious comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Senator was sulking because I deprecated his trade.  After all we are in the duke&rsquo;s ballroom so we will not have any trade here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He is involved in the profession.  I tabled that amendment.  I note that while a large number of stations use the DAB system, the Swedish Minister for Culture recently turned down a proposed extension of this system in Swedish radio.</P>
        <P>The Seanad has done a good job in opening up this area of radio broadcasting.  We collectively as Members of the Seanad should say we did a good job, we took on our brief and this is one of the things Senators are supposed to do.  I am glad we did it.  We also put on record some of the concerns of people who are more technically proficient than I am.  I make no apology for tabling one sample amendment, getting the updated information on record, having the opportunity to hear what the Minister had to say and getting his detailed reply to the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2: </P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) the principal British television broadcasting services which are free to air as of the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is a replica of an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  The other amendments were graciously accepted by the Minister, but I was very unhappy with the response to this particular amendment.  I did not press the amendment because I wanted to give the Minister an opportunity to look at this important issue.</P>
        <P>Among other things, this Bill will bring about the end of analogue, which will mean the end of what is known as the spillover whereby the signal of British channels is received by a significant number of Irish households, especially on the east coast.  The ending of analogue and the arrival of digital in a short two-year period will mean that this spillover will end.  Those who currently receive British channels free-to-air will no longer receive them on that basis, as it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to have the first multiplex that contains Irish stations only.  The Minister stated that there <Col N="57"/>will still be some spillover in the Border counties, but the rest of the country will have to pay for British channels.</P>
        <P>This amendment asks the Government to be generous and to create an equality throughout the country based on what is currently available on the east coast.  The whole country should receive the main British channels free-to-air in a multiplex which could be simultaneously available with the first multiplex.  When he was before the House, the Minister made it clear that it would be possible for two multiplexes to be rolled out simultaneously.  The Government might regret not doing this as consumers would soon see that it is effectively charging people for something that they currently obtain for free.  From a political point of view, that would not be positively received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and the proposal articulated by Senator O&rsquo;Meara.  She mentioned the east coast, but once the community television deflector system was abolished, many people in rural Ireland could no longer receive transmissions from British channels.  We are now going down the road where we must pay for everything in this country, but those community groups provided an excellent service at a minuscule cost.  Companies such as Chorus were charged with providing this service, but they have failed to deliver in many parts of rural Ireland.  I would like the Minister of State to address that issue when he replies, but I am happy to second the amendment as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some sympathy with the amendment tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Meara regarding the British broadcasting services.  A great part of the country in the Border region and along the east coast benefits from this spillover.  However, the Bill refers to the national television broadcasting service, including TG4.  We have some control over these services in this country and we can legislate on them.  I do not know how we can legislate for another country&rsquo;s television service.  We are talking about British television.  We are a sovereign nation in charge of our television output and what emanates from Ireland.  Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment deals with output that emanates from a different country.  While I accept that it will be a big loss to people when it comes about, I do not see how we can legislate on something outside our control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Kenneally&rsquo;s views when he expresses understanding and sympathy for the motives behind this amendment.  He is also correct to state that we cannot legislate for what goes on abroad.  However, I raised a number of possible scenarios on Committee Stage that might help to address this.</P>
        <P>If one wishes to view British television channels, one can do so by subscribing to Sky, Chorus or NTL.  However, these are not free-to-air services, which is what Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment is about.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred to large parts of Leinster, but I would like to point out that we are also talking about all of the Border counties.  As a child, I often used to read with great amusement about how deprived we were in County Leitrim, even though we received BBC Northern Ireland and UTV long before they came to Dublin.  We were well aware of what was going on and it was wonderful to understand the culture and the British way of life.  This may have informed my views of the relationship between the two islands as a result.  We were able to receive the UK stations from a young age.</P>
        <P>However, the digital footprint will ensure that this will be heavily emasculated, as Senator O&rsquo;Meara correctly pointed out.  We are moving into a serious television environment and I am glad that this Bill is being brought before the House as it is about free-to-air digital television.  It is not about being charged for watching every five minutes of television, which is the environment we have sadly moved into over the past five years.  Anybody who follows this issue at a cursory level will notice Sky TV trumpeting the fact that its subscription base in this country has been increased.  The company has made millions of euro, often because people cannot get the stations on a terrestrial basis, as Senator Coonan stated.  They have no choice but to use satellite television.  It is even becoming more difficult in my part of the country.</P>
        <P>I suggested something on Committee Stage that I will also raise at the next plenary session of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  It is somewhat fortuitous that a distinguished Member of the British House of Commons is in this House tonight, namely, my honourable friend Andrew MacKinlay, MP.  He has a tremendous interest in all things Irish and we have discussed this before.  I hope to persuade him to table a question on this issue in the House of Commons.  Following the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish Governments agreed that a transmitter should be located in Belfast to transmit TG4 primarily to the Nationalists in Belfast and its environs.  This was done under a cultural dimension, so there was no technical difficulty with it.  However, there are large parts of Northern Ireland where one cannot receive RTE television.</P>
      <P>I will propose that an amendment be made to the BBC charter to allow the corporation to transmit BBC Northern Ireland across the island of Ireland, and that a reciprocal arrangement be made to allow RTE to be transmitted in all parts of the island.  I do not suggest such measures would address the specific issues which have been raised by Senator O&rsquo;Meara.  It is possible, given the close relationship between the two islands, that progress could be made in this way.  The United Kingdom agreed in the cultural dimension of the Good Friday Agreement to allow TG4 to operate in Northern Ireland, which is within its territory.  An argument could be made, therefore, for RTE&rsquo;s services to be transmitted in Northern Ireland, with a reciprocal arrangement that would <Col N="59"/>allow the BBC&rsquo;s services to be transmitted here.  The Minister of State might be able to give us some hope that RTE will be in a position to negotiate on the rights issue after the multiplex has been set up.</P>
       <P> Senator O&rsquo;Meara knows this is a question of rights, rather than technology.  Perhaps RTE will be given the resources to negotiate on the rights issue in order that the British stations can be included on the multiplex which will be transmitted free to air.  I have every sympathy with, and understanding for, the Senator&rsquo;s position on this matter.  I cannot say I would readily agree to accept this amendment if I were the Minister of State.  I have a great deal of sympathy for the argument that has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara, who has moved amendment No. 2, is concerned about the reduction in the overspill of UK analogue services from 2008.  The decision to switch off UK analogue services in that year has been made by the authorities in that country &mdash; it is not within the control of the Irish authorities.  Irish television viewers, who have benefited from the overspill of UK television services in the past, do not have an automatic entitlement to that overspill, which results accidentally from the analogue transmission process.  UK television services are available in a number of ways to Irish viewers, who can avail of cable, satellite and MMDS services.  A limited amount of UK digital overspill may be available in the future to Irish viewers in Border areas.  A number of UK channels may be received by some Irish viewers as a result of overspill from UK satellite services.  As the provision of UK television services in Ireland is subject to commercial and legal implications, UK channel providers can make decisions on service provision in Ireland, whether free-to-air or as part of a commercial offering on cable, satellite, MMDS and, in future, on the digital terrestrial platform.</P>
        <P>This Bill seeks to put in place a framework which will create opportunities for the establishment of a number of multiplexes.  It is likely that the mainstream UK channels will be offered on at least one of these multiplexes.  While I recognise Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s concerns about the availability of UK broadcasting services to Irish households, my primary aim is to create a legislative framework for this country&rsquo;s broadcasting services.  Therefore, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.  This Bill will not end the overspill of UK services &mdash; that is the subject of a decision being taken in that jurisdiction.  We cannot force the UK channels onto Irish digital terrestrial television.  We can create such an opportunity, however, which is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney spoke about TG4, which is available in Northern Ireland for cultural reasons, as he said.  I empathise with his proposal that BBC Northern Ireland be made available here.  I understand that such a decision could come about only on foot of a major change of the BBC charter.  I do not think any such change is planned at present.  Given that Senator Mooney intends to <Col N="60"/>raise this matter at a higher level, I am sure it will be discussed further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mooney for his generous, creative and broad-minded approach to this issue.  It contrasts with the Minister of State&rsquo;s narrow and limited view of the issue, unfortunately.  I appreciate the acceptance of this amendment would pose many challenges to those working in this area.  We face challenges every day of the week as we go through life &mdash; that is what we are here for.  Governments, in particular, are in the business of facing challenges.  The aim of this amendment is to ensure services which have been available for many years are continued.  While it may be an accident that such services are available, people have got used to them.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Mooney, I grew up in the midlands, where BBC channels were not available.  When I was a child, I went to Arklow, County Wicklow, to visit my uncle, who had a range of BBC channels.  By viewing those channels, it was possible to experience a similar but different culture.  The availability of the BBC channels broadens one&rsquo;s mind, engenders a sense of closeness to Ireland&rsquo;s nearest neighbour and allows us to participate in the wider community.  I do not suggest such experiences will not be available in the future, because people will continue to buy cable and satellite services.</P>
        <P>This legislation gives the Government an opportunity to be generous by extending to the rest of the country the services which are available to many people on the east coast.  While it would not be easy, it would be a generous gesture.  If they put their minds to it, it is not beyond the capacity of the officials in the Department or the Government to address the many issues which have to be dealt with.  It is clear they are not minded to do so, however.  That is regrettable because this Bill represents a great opportunity for them to do something about a matter that will be a source of trouble in the future.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State recalls the controversy some years ago about television deflectors.  Senator Coonan mentioned the problems which arose when people who were used to being able to view a set of channels were no longer able to do so as a result of changes in broadcasting legislation.  People were very upset when services started to be provided by legal operators like Chorus and Horizon.  I remember well that it was a big issue in the 1997 general election.  I am surprised the Minister of State, as a politician, cannot see that his failure to act in this regard will lead to trouble in the future.  It is a pity there is a sense of denial in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is no point in blaming the UK authorities for taking away these channels by moving them from analogue to digital, when we could play a role in that process.  As Senator Mooney said, there is considerable co-operation between the British authorities and their counterparts here.  There is no reason people cannot sit down, roll up their sleeves and reach agreement on this matter.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s narrow and limited response to my pro<Col N="61"/>posal.  There may be trouble in this respect in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s suggestion, which was seriously considered before it was decided that it is not appropriate for the Minister to take into account the accidental availability of UK services when making decisions about what makes sense in terms of Irish broadcasting policy.  Under the legislation, four multiplexes are available to provide lots of channels within the Irish digital terrestrial television platform.  We need to accept that the charge in the BBC charter is a commercial one.  Having given serious consideration to this amendment, we have decided it would not be appropriate to accept it.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for selecting this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.</P>
        <P>Many schools in County Galway have recently lost the designation of disadvantaged.  People at the coalface in those schools recognise they are being penalised for their excellence.  This is true in the case of Mercy College, Woodford, County Galway, a second level school with an extraordinary commitment from staff, parents&rsquo; association, board of management and students to achieving the highest possible educational standards.  The school is in a CL&Aacute;R area which is in itself a recognition of this being a disadvantaged area and initiated by the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  It is also an area of declining population.</P>
        <P>Under the old scheme of designated disadvantaged schools there were no indicators as to why certain schools were included, other than the fact that they were in disadvantaged areas.  The benefits that those schools received and which they used with great effectiveness were extra capitation to spend at the discretion of the school, home-school community liaison officers, some teaching hours and extra guidance and other ancillary services.</P>
        <P>In changing the criteria under the new DEIS scheme, the Minister has withdrawn some of those valuable support mechanisms and resources from the schools.  If she is serious about commitment to the disadvantaged in education she has lost the plot in this instance.  She stated that she has not written to the schools involved, but neither has she confirmed by letter that she is not withdrawing those supports.  A home-school liaison officer in a school can be the means of keeping children at school and the withdrawal of this service is a serious blow to school management, teachers and students.  It can be seen in no other <Col N="63"/>light than that they are being penalised because of their super endeavour to help disadvantaged students by keeping them in second level education and helping them attain better results at both junior and leaving certificate level.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Department cannot stand over such extreme folly.  If some of those students in urban areas drop out, the results are very serious in many cases.  It is clear that under the criteria of the new scheme, DEIS, there is a bias towards major urban areas as against rural areas.  It would be difficult to find an example of a similar secondary school in a rural disadvantaged area.  The results of the support mechanisms in that school were obvious at both junior and leaving certificate level and in the retention rate.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent report referred to the board with responsibility for supervising school attendance, the National Educational Welfare Board, and the HSE.  He stated that the board had failed in dealing with the case where a child in a disadvantaged area missed more than 20 school days per year.  The board has been ineffective in following through when children are absent from school for more than 20 days.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to indicate to those schools included in the former disadvantaged status system that they too will retain their support mechanisms and resources and that the obvious imbalance between the urban and rural schemes will be eradicated.  The new scheme introduced on 30 May 2006 was supposed to ensure equality within the education system but there is no equality in this new scheme.  The scheme will be welcomed by certain schools because they have been included for the first time, but the 140 second level schools that have lost this designation feel aggrieved because they are being penalised for their excellence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House about these schools.</P>
        <P>Ensuring that children from the most disadvantaged communities in Galway and elsewhere receive the support they need to succeed at school is a key priority for this Government.  To this end, we have significantly increased investment in tackling educational disadvantage in recent years.  In 2007 we are providing nearly &euro;730 million for targeted initiatives at all levels.  This is an increase of nearly &euro;95 million on the comparable 2006 figure.  This investment supports the roll-out of additional supports under the DEIS action plan, through which 51 primary schools and 11 second level schools in Galway city and county will benefit from a comprehensive package of extra supports.  Galway schools are well represented in the list of DEIS schools, making up nearly 12% of all the rural schools in the programme.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that an independent review process was available to schools which did not qualify for the new programme.  Additional schools were added to the programme as a result <Col N="64"/>of making successful review applications.  The Department of Education and Science is satisfied that all schools have been assessed on the basis of the best information available, ranked in terms of the correct criteria and given a fair opportunity to appeal.</P>
        <P>Unsuccessful schools were advised at an early stage that they would be allowed to keep the supports they have under pre-existing schemes for the current school year.  The Department of Education and Science is in the process of informing these schools that they will retain additional teaching resources for the duration of the DEIS action plan.  The effectiveness of these posts will be reviewed in line with the ongoing review process in place for DEIS schools.  It will be a condition of the retention of such posts that schools comply with any reasonable requirements of the review process.</P>
        <P>Schools currently participating in the home school community liaison scheme will not be excluded from the scheme and, from the commencement of the 2007-08 school year, they will continue to avail of home school community support liaison services for the duration of the DEIS action plan.  The level of service will be commensurate with the size of the school and its relative level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Many schools retain additional capitation from previous schemes which have now been subsumed into DEIS.  From the beginning of the 2007-08 school year this capitation will be offset against increases in the rate of general capitation.  This process will take four years and will ensure that no school will experience a reduction in annual capitation as a result of this measure.  Changes may arise from other factors such as enrolments.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Government has not only provided for a major increase in supports to our most disadvantaged schools through DEIS but has also addressed the concerns of schools which did not qualify for the new initiative.  I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Kenneally.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  Waterford Institute of Technology has been in receipt of major capital investment and its main campus can now support more than 6,000 students.  For this reason, as Dr. Edward Walsh, president emeritus of the Univer<Col N="65"/>sity of Limerick, stated in January 2005, &ldquo;The challenge for the State in establishing a university in Waterford should not be significant, either in financial or organisational terms.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>We hear daily about the knowledge economy and the importance of producing more graduates and developing strong research skills.  The industrial base in the south east relies on traditional manufacturing and agriculture.  Upgrading the designation of Waterford Institute of Technology to university status would attract new, high-tech skills to the south east region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator White for sharing time.</P>
        <P>The upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s designation to that of university is an important issue for Waterford and the entire south east, which is being fought at regional rather than county level.  One of the weaknesses of the region in the past was its failure at times to pull together.  While Waterford has the largest population in the south east, counties Kilkenny, Wexford and Carlow also have significant regional towns.  Clonmel and Carlow, for example, are experiencing rapid development.  Traditional rivalries have been set aside and the entire region and public representatives from across the political divide have united in support of Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>Prior to becoming mayor of Waterford and joining the board of governors of University College Cork for a year, I believed one could build a university on a green field site.  I quickly learned from educators and the eminent members of the board that universities are built on reputation rather than bricks and mortar.  Waterford Institute of Technology, as any educator in Ireland will testify, has enjoyed an excellent reputation for many years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The same can be said of Carlow Institute of Technology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not dispute that, but Waterford Institute of Technology offers a much broader range of degree courses than any other institute of technology.  Carlow has its place. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Where should the university be located?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the five cities in the State, Dublin has three universities, Cork, Galway and Limerick each has one, while Waterford does not have a university.  The city and the south east region suffer as a result.  This issue must be addressed. </P>
        <P>Today, the Urban Forum criticised Dublin&rsquo;s urban sprawl and the manner in which the city has developed.  It called for a regional balance and proposed developing Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Leinster now accounts for 54% of the population, most of whom live within commuting distance of Dublin.  This is not good for Dublin or the economy and must change.</P><Col N="66"/>
        <P>Some in the university sector do not want the status of Waterford Institute of Technology to change to that of university because they believe such a move would create greater competition for funding.  While Senator White is correct that the institute of technology has done well financially in recent years, specifically in terms of capital projects, it would have access to a much greater range of funds in the university sector.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Government has appointed an eminent person to examine the strong case the institute made almost 12 months ago.  I hope a report will issue soon.  It is vital to the economy of the south east that the region should have a university.  As predicted, the manufacturing sector is struggling as Ireland develops into a high skill economy.  If the current third level deficit is not addressed, the south east will continue to suffer.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, is well aware of the case for upgrading the status of Waterford Institute of Technology because the case has been made so often in the past.  She will hear much more in future as we continue to fight our cause.  I hope the demand to designate Waterford Institute of Technology as a university will be granted soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators White and Kenneally for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  As they will be aware, the Minister for Education and Science has commissioned a preliminary independent examination of the submission made by the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology seeking university status. </P>
        <P>In February 2006 the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology wrote to the Department of Education and Science requesting a review of its status under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997.  The provisions of section 9 state that the Government may appoint a body, which will include international experts, to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, an educational institution should be established as a university.  On the advice of the body and the recommendation of the authority, the Government may, by order, provide that the institution shall be a university for the purposes of this Act.</P>
        <P>Aside from the detailed statutory review process that is required in progressing an application, there are also significant wider issues that need to be considered in advance of any statutory review.  For example, there have been wider policy developments in the overall higher education sector that are important in this context.  In particular, it is important that account is taken of the significant recent changes in the overall legislative framework governing Irish higher education, with the passage of the Institutes of Technology Act 2006, as well as wider Government policy on foot of the review of Irish higher education carried out by the OECD in 2004, the broad thrust of which was endorsed by the Government.</P><Col N="67"/>
        <P>A central purpose of the OECD review was to support Ireland&rsquo;s strategic ambition of placing our higher education system at the front rank of the OECD in the context of the wider national objective of developing as a world-leading knowledge economy and society.  A key recommendation in the OECD&rsquo;s report to the Government was that Ireland should retain the differentiation in mission of the university and institute of technology sectors, which it identified as a key strength of our system, and that there should be no institutional transfers into the university system for the foreseeable future.  The report also recommended that universities and institutes of technology should be brought together under the remit of a single authority for the purpose of achieving a unified higher education strategy.  It further recommended that the extent of external regulation of the institutes of technology should be lightened, giving them greater managerial freedom in responding to the opportunities and challenges of supporting regional and national social and economic development.</P>
        <P>The Institutes of Technology Act 2006 addresses significant elements of these recommendations and marks a major milestone for the sector and for the development of higher education in Ireland.  The Act provides for greater autonomy for the institutes to fulfil their missions. The institutes are now within the remit of the Higher Education Authority, which will support an integrated and cohesive strategic approach to the development of higher education in line with national priorities.  The Act means that, in practice, the HEA and the institutes of technology will engage and relate in a way that is similar to the way the HEA and the universities engage.</P>
        <P>There are a number of areas where the operation of the institutes has changed as a consequence of the role of the HEA.  On budgets and finances, the HEA determines an institute&rsquo;s budget in line with the funding relationship that exists between the HEA and the universities.  The HEA assumes the role in establishing formal arrangements to permit institutes to borrow or to underwrite borrowings in a manner similar to that prevailing in the university sector, allowing a greater level of institutional flexibility and responsiveness.  The Department&rsquo;s role concerning the approval of research, consultancy or development work or the acquisition of land has devolved to the HEA.  Similarly, specific approval from the Department to run individual courses or programmes is no longer required.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements provide for a more autonomous and strategic relationship with Government, through the HEA, reflecting the dynamic and competitive nature of the environment in which the institutes are now operating.  The new legislation will transform the Irish higher education landscape and needs to inform our consideration of the case being made for university status for Waterford.    In order to achieve the best outcome, a preliminary independent examination of the governing body&rsquo;s submission has been commissioned from Dr. Jim Port, a UK-<Col N="68"/>based independent consultant on higher education issues.  In requesting the independent advice, Dr. Port has been asked to conduct a thorough assessment of the submission made by the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology having regard to national strategy for the development of Irish higher education, implications for regional development in the south east in the context of the national spatial strategy and any likely implications for the overall structure of higher education in Ireland.</P>
        <P>While no specific deadline has been set for the completion of this report, it is expected that Dr. Port&rsquo;s advice will be received in the first half of 2007.  Once completed, the independent expert report will be used to guide the Government&rsquo;s decision on whether a formal statutory review process should be initiated to consider the application, as required under the Universities Act.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science is aware of the strong support that has been built in the south east region around the application from Waterford IT for university status.  However, the wider policy developments that I have outlined are also fundamental to her consideration of the appropriate steps concerning the application.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators again for having raised this matter.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to be able to raise this important issue.  There is an urgent need to ensure that the result of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s ruling on Premier Foods&rsquo; recent merger with RHM does not result in job losses in Thurles.  I will briefly review the background to this matter.  Thurles and other north Tipperary towns have been hit by significant job losses in recent years.  Premier Foods is considered to be one of the backbone industries in Thurles.  Like Erin Foods, Premier has evolved from the original Irish Sugar Company whose closure some years ago was a major local and national story. <Col N="69"/> Last August, Premier acquired Erin Foods as part of its takeover of Campbells, which itself had acquired Erin Foods in 2002.  Therefore, Erin Foods&rsquo; operation in Thurles forms part a series of branded food products currently being produced in the town.</P>
        <P>Last Friday, the Competition Authority ruled on the merger and there was a similar ruling by the authority&rsquo;s British equivalent.  The impact of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s ruling is that Premier has been told to dispose of Erin Foods.  This is a source of considerable anxiety in Thurles because Erin Foods forms a huge part of the lines being produced in Premier Foods plant there.  The situation is best set out in an e-mail from a woman in Thurles &mdash; I will not reveal her name as I do not have permission to do so.  She settled in Thurles ten years ago when her husband was offered a position with GMX, which is one of the plants that has since closed.  They settled very successfully in the town but have watched with disbelief and dismay as industry after industry has closed, with no replacement &mdash; all during our supposed boom years.</P>
        <P>The woman&rsquo;s e-mail states &ldquo;last month came great news&rdquo;, when Premier Foods, which last year acquired Erin Foods, announced an increased investment in the plant, particularly in the next two years.  There was obviously a positive reaction to this news as it was felt to be a vote of confidence in the operation, and would mean it would move forward.  The Competition Authority&rsquo;s ruling last Friday was met with great dismay.</P>
        <P>The number of jobs at Premier Foods is approximately 150 to 160, which includes sales staff and so on.  There is a concern that these jobs are at risk because of the need to dispose of Erin Foods.  Senator Coonan and I, and the Deputies from north Tipperary, had a meeting today with senior management of the company.  We voiced our concerns and put it to them that the best possible outcome would be that the entire operation in Thurles would be sold as a going concern, and as a single unit rather than breaking it up into its separate component parts, which we feel would be difficult and dangerous.  We do not know if that will happen but Premier Foods is a very successful commercial company which offers much in employment and economic terms to the town of Thurles.</P>
        <P>There is great bewilderment that the ruling of the Competition Authority, which seeks to protect the consumer in the overall, could have the impact of undermining and possibly endangering jobs in a town which has already seen considerable job losses and needs jobs like these maintained.  The woman who wrote to me, and who has possibly written to others also, beseeches me to at the very least investigate this decision and use the resources available to do everything I can to avoid the loss of yet another 130 jobs.  I do not consider the jobs are lost, by any means.  I have every confidence that this situation can been resolved.  It is a matter of considerable importance.  I thank the House and the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Meara for raising the matter and for allowing me time to speak on it.  It is a very important issue for north Tipperary, in particular the town of Thurles and its surrounding area.  I appeal to the Minister of State to leave no stone unturned in seeking a resolution to the difficulties in which the company finds itself as a result of the decision made by the Competition Authority.  As Senator O&rsquo;Meara stated, the 150 or 160 workers who are employed directly at the company are our first concern.  However, we also have a concern for the greater community of Thurles, where industry has been based on the food industry and has suffered its share as far back as the closure of the sugar factory.  Many of those jobs have never been replaced.</P>
        <P>To take up where Senator O&rsquo;Meara finished, from a positive perspective, there is every hope that the factory and the jobs can be saved.  The workers at the plant and their unions must be commended on the way they have approached this difficulty and on the decisions they have taken in order to operate better practices.  If this factory is compared with a similar factories in Britain or elsewhere, it can be seen there is much room for production there.</P>
        <P>With regard to Government intervention, I appeal to the Minister to get involved and to sort out this difficulty.  We want the factory retained as a viable unit.  It is very important it is not sold off or divested of some of its brands, such as Erin gravy rich, oxtail soup, or a brand which is doing well at present, McDonnells curry sauce.  There is huge potential and room for further development at the factory.  The public and the workers are concerned, arising from the Competition Authority&rsquo;s decision, that if the factory is sold off and the new company can divest itself of those brands, in a few years we will left with nothing but a ghost factory.</P>
        <P>We in the area are positive and believe the factory can be saved.  Politicians are working as a unit in this regard.  We appeal for help from the Minister of State and the Government, which we have no doubt we will receive.  For the greater benefit of the community in Thurles, it is essential this happens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my mid-west colleagues, Senators O&rsquo;Meara and Coonan, for raising this important matter.  The Competition Authority on Friday last announced its determination that the proposed acquisition of RHM plc by Premier Foods plc may be put into effect.  The Competition Authority is required under the mergers and acquisitions section of the Competition Act 2002 to determine whether the result of the proposed acquisition will substantially lessen competition in the markets for goods and services.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no role or function in non-media mergers under the Act, nor is the Minister entitled to access any commercially sensitive information on which a decision of the authority <Col N="71"/>is based.  It would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment in any manner, shape or form on the authority&rsquo;s determination in this case or any other case.  However, since the announcement, Enterprise Ireland has been in contact with the company, which has stated that Premier Foods will dispose of the Erin brand to address the Competition Authority&rsquo;s concerns.  It has not, however, made any decision yet about the plant or the jobs therein.  It will commence a review and Enterprise Ireland has offered to assist in every way possible.  I assure the Senator that the Government, through the agencies, will do everything it possibly can to secure the jobs.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for Thurles and north Tipperary involves driving the transition to the knowledge economy by winning new foreign direct investment in the innovation-driven, high value, high skills sector, and by working with the existing company base to expand its presence in Ireland by the addition of increased strategic functions.  The Government recognises the need to achieve high value employment in Thurles and is committed to marketing the area as part of its national goal of achieving balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of Thurles for inward investment has to be seen within a regional context, with the national spatial strategy providing a framework for the achievement of this goal.</P>
        <P>The IDA has five supported companies in north Tipperary employing 610 people, one of which is in Thurles.  Gilbert and Mellish, a pharmaceutical distributor, has purchased rights to a BSN Medical product and employs eight people in the Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles.  In addition, investments by Taro Pharmaceutical Ireland in Roscrea and Taylor Made in Templemore will result in significant additional employment for north Tipperary generally and the surrounding towns.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development works closely with IDA Ireland in the development of, and the promotion and marketing of, tailored property solutions to potential investors throughout the mid-west, including the development of Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles.  Shannon Development&rsquo;s sectoral emphasis in the mid-west region is on attracting new knowledge-intensive projects in information communications and technology, globally traded businesses, medical technologies and life sciences.  The agency has completed first stage development of Tipperary Technology Park, which includes 25,000 sq. ft. of state-of-the-art <Col N="72"/>accommodation to facilitate the attraction and development of knowledge-based enterprises.  Associated with these activities, a major Government-funded marketing effort is underway, which involves Shannon Development, IDA Ireland, the local town council, LEADER, the North Tipperary County Enterprise Board and the Tipperary Institute, to promote the advantages of the town as an industrial location.  There is confidence this effort will be successful in the medium term.  In addition, Shannon Development continues to support the existing industrial base in Thurles.</P>
        <P>Since the new building at the Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles was completed in August 2002, Shannon Development has been promoting space and facilities to the indigenous entrepreneur who wants to develop his or her own business.  The facilities cater for &ldquo;knowledge age&rdquo; enterprises in the various stages of development &mdash; from the feasibility study stage to the venture capital stage and beyond.  There are currently seven businesses operating from the incubator InnovationWorks Tipperary.  The seven businesses currently operating in the incubator are involved in software development, marketing services, customer service call centre, back office operations, health and safety training materials and custom-designed burn garments respectively.  Shannon Development, the North Tipperary County Enterprise Board and the Thurles Marketing Group also operate offices at the park.  Three further companies occupy the larger expansion spaces on the park, namely, Digital Cinema, which is involved in a project to convert all the nations cinemas into digital cinemas; C&amp;C Wholesale, which operates a customer service operation; and the vetting unit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  From a base of zero in 2002, there are currently over 100 people employed on the site across ten companies.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, as well as other agencies, are partners in the Thurles Marketing Group, which was established in 2002 with a view to developing a pilot marketing initiative in north Tipperary as part of the implementation of the County Economic and Cultural Strategy 2002-12.  The focus of the marketing initiative is to promote Thurles as a location for business investment, both foreign direct and indigenous.</P>
