	<P>I have notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to introduce measures to reduce the exorbitant cost of motor insurance in this State, especially for young drivers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to outline the supports he intends to pursue for marching bands given that the new year will begin the season of activities that will entertain communities throughout the country should they be given some finance to survive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give an update on the proposed child care subvention scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Asset Recovery Offices, back from committee, to be taken without debate on the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements on the merits of farmers&rsquo; markets, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1, to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes, on which Members may share time, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for closing comments and to respond to questions from spokespersons; and No. 3, statements on plans to improve water quality under <Col N="2046"/>the rural water programme, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2, to conclude not later than 3.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, on which Members may share time, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for closing comments and to respond to questions from spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the initiative by the Leader in response to a discussion we had at a leaders&rsquo; meeting about Ministers taking questions following statements.  This is a very good innovation and I am pleased the Leader has been able to bring this to the proceedings and that Ministers have agreed to do it.  I hope we can develop and extend this initiative.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to an issue raised yesterday by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, which was initially raised in the House by Senator Bacik and on which many Senators have spoken.  I refer to the position of &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt.  The article by Lara Marlowe in <i>The Irish Times</i> is truly shocking, as a Senator stated yesterday.  We have had our own experience in this country with hostage taking and captivity with Brian Keenan.  I would like to think the Seanad could be effective in this area and that we can agree a strong all-party motion.  Perhaps we can suggest to the D&aacute;il that a cross-party motion would be tabled in that House as well.  We should agree a motion, have it passed in both Houses and ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise it at the next EU Ministers meeting as a priority issue.  It is truly shocking to read the plight of the female Colombian politician who has been held for five years in the most appalling conditions.  If there is anything we can do, and small actions can make a difference sometimes, we should try to do it.</P>
        <P>While much has been said about yesterday&rsquo;s budget it fails a number of people, especially the vulnerable in our society.  For example, there was no change in the means test for carers, many of whom work full-time in the home and are not eligible for this aid.</P>
        <P>I return to a topic discussed in the House some time ago, namely, child care.  The budget did not address the serious concerns arising from the changes in child care subvention.  I attended a meeting on the matter last week with many child care providers.  Will the Leader raise this matter with the Minister for Health and Children?  I had hoped the budget would address the child care supplement issue given the costs of child care for parents in this country which are among the highest in Europe, but it did not, nor did it address the changes being brought about by the early child care supplement.  The increases in that would only pay for five weeks of child care approximately and, therefore, many parents are left struggling with the cost.</P><Col N="2047"/>
        <P>The budget failed to address the issue of families struggling to meet child care costs and with no changes in the medical card scheme and minor changes in the qualified child allowance and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, consistent poverty among children has increased in the past year.  We must invite the Minister back to the House to discuss the range of issues affecting children and families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the point made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I welcome that the<?oasys _jy ?>Minister will take questions at the end of the debate on food and the merits of farmers&rsquo; markets.  That is a welcome development and we should show we can use it usefully without abusing it.</P>
        <P>On the issue I raised yesterday and which Senator Fitzgerald raised earlier, namely, the question of &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt, we should take this matter further.  I discussed the matter with some Members of the other House last night.  There was another occasion when parliamentarians were adept and ready to go to Colombia to plead the case for various people.  I believe there is a strong case for people from this Parliament to go to Colombia and not at taxpayers&rsquo; expense.  I would like to have the representatives of FARC in front of me.  I would like to make the case for &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt and to hear the answers.  This woman has been imprisoned for one reason only, namely, she was brave enough to oppose terrorism publicly and all that goes with it.  We have no vested interest in this matter and it is something we should consider.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of both Houses received by post recently a book called <i>Best of Irish Poetry 2007</i>, from the Munster Literature Centre.  I draw Members&rsquo; attention to that because accompanying it was the startling information that literature is the only aspect of the arts which does not have a permanent home in Dublin city.  There is one in Cork, in fairness to Cork County Council or Cork City Council, whichever it is, but whereas the visual arts have theatres, galleries, houses, etc., there is no permanently owned, rent-free or secure home for places such as the Irish Writers Centre or the Dublin Writers Museum.  We should ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to discuss that issue with us to allow us plead a case in that regard.  It is an issue we should raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the comments made by colleagues regarding &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt and the Labour Party would support anything we can do in these Houses to make our position known.</P>
        <P>To return to the issue of the budget, I hear shouts from the other side of the House to the effect that it was a great budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Flattery will get the Senator nowhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;but there is complacency regarding the issues Senator Fitzgerald mentioned earlier.  What should be the benchmark in terms of the budget, and is it a subject for debate in this House?  How do we decide whether it is or is not a great budget?  I heard people say on a radio programme this morning that there was a warm welcome for the stamp duty changes, but when I listened further it was explained that they were welcomed by banks, the construction industry and estate agents.  Why would those sectors not welcome the changes in stamp duty?  I am not saying those changes do not have some merit but if they are good enough to introduce now, they were good enough to have been introduced when they were needed six months ago.  Instead, they are being introduced <Col N="2049"/>now as a panic measure at the tail end of the construction boom.</P>
        <P>We talk about a green crusade or other views or objectives of people, but the only objective we should have in terms of budgetary, economic and social policy after ten or 15 years of plenty is a full frontal attack on poverty and social injustice.  Why was the budget not a social justice or poverty budget?  We are told about a green budget.  Let us have a budget that will address child poverty once and for all.  We are supposed to be a beacon to the world in terms of our economic development.  Why can we not be a beacon to the world in terms of having equity, equality and social justice in society?  That is what a budget should be about and, regrettably, this one is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the budget.  We had a worthwhile debate yesterday on the drugs problem in this country.  The budget has gone some way towards ensuring we will be able to tackle the drugs culture in the coming year.  I welcomed the sentiments expressed in the House.  All Members are trying to come up with solutions, which is the only way forward, and not criticise each other in the House.</P>
        <P>There was a social aspect to the budget.  For the first time, a couple received a &euro;41 increase.  We have never seen such an increase in social welfare and pensions and it is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I welcome also the changes in the housing area.  I have the pleasure of being spokesman on housing and look forward to a full debate in the House on the way we can alleviate the problems in housing.  A total of 46,000 people do not have a house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Whose fault is that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;yet 5,200 houses are locked up by local authorities throughout the country.  It is important that Fine Gael and Labour reflect on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Who has been in Government for ten years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>They are running the local authorities and it is time they examined their position.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Our conscience is clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given an extra &euro;1.7 billion to deal with the housing problem.  While I want to be fair to Fine Gael and Labour representatives in the councils, it is taking far too long for local authorities to get schemes up and running.  It takes six months to bring a Part 8 application to the council where it remains for another three months.  My colleague, Senator Regan, will agree that many schemes came to the council in an 18-month to two-year period but they did not deliver any housing in that time.  This <Col N="2050"/>is a problem.  We must have a full debate on this and I ask the Leader to allocate time for it.</P>
        <P>The budget also addressed green issues.  These are serious issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party has put forward some good proposals in the budget.  I am delighted about that because it is time we tackled the problems we face in that regard.  Perhaps the Leader would allocate time for debates on the basic issues of drugs and housing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the primary care unit in Athlone.  I am disgusted and disappointed with the procrastination of the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  This project was first mooted in the 1990s.  A site was purchased in 2002 for &euro;1.2 million and in 2006 a capital allocation of &euro;13.7 million was made.  However, there is still no primary care centre.  The proposal was to progress through the planning and construction stage in April 2007 and a cost-benefit analysis was to be carried out.  This has been completed and the project does represent value for money.  Everybody is anxious that there is value for money in the health service.</P>
        <P>I am not asking that the Minister come to the Seanad on this matter because she has already told me that Athlone has the best figures in Ireland for attendance at accident and emergency departments.  The reason is that there is no accident and emergency department in Athlone.  It does not have a primary care unit or services.  I do not want the Minister to come to the Seanad and I do not need to hear a reply from her, but I ask the Leader to intervene and find out the building start date for the primary care unit in Athlone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Before raising the issue that concerns me, I wish to comment briefly on the remarks of Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Alex White on caring for the less well off in society.  Next year the Government will spend &euro;17 billion on social welfare.  Fr. Sean Healy of CORI described the social welfare increases in last year&rsquo;s budget as historic.  Senator Alex White asserted that there is less equality in this country.  The most scientifically based measurement of equality is the Gini coefficient.  It is accepted among all economists as the most worthwhile method of assessing equity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We are way down on the list.</P>

	<P>We are way down on the list.</P>

	<P>Read the right list.</P>

	<P>Senator Cannon without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006, the most recent measurement, Ireland was fifth of the 27 EU member states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is spin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The most equal countries in the EU were Poland and Lithuania.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We are less equal now than we were 15 years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are people leaving Poland and Lithuania to come to this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;according to the OECD&rsquo;s figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because Ireland is a country of opportunity for those who are willing to work hard to provide for themselves.  If Senator Alex White wishes to go to Poland or Lithuania, he is most welcome to do so.  That is where he will find the most equal economies in the EU.</P>
        <P>The issue that concerns me is the recent decision by the NRA not to develop the vast majority of the rest areas along the motorway network.  This is a seriously retrograde decision.  I call on the Minister for Transport to intervene immediately.  The former Minister, Deputy Cullen, intervened in 2005 to get the NRA to provide a plan for fully serviced rest areas with restaurants, petrol stations and so forth along the motorways.  There were also plans to provide resting areas for drivers but these have now been abandoned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Blame the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>France has over 50 years&rsquo; experience in providing motorways and has the longest motorway network in the world <i>per capita</i> of population.  It has a mandatory requirement that a rest area is provided every ten kilometres.  The French are aware that driver fatigue causes deaths on their motorways.  I urge the Minister to intervene and direct the NRA to rescind its decision and reinstate its plans to provide rest areas along our motorways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There appears to be cross-party support for a motion calling for the release of &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt.  I am delighted Senator Fitzgerald and others have raised the <Col N="2052"/>issue again.  Yesterday, I asked the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House for a debate on prison reform.  A sum of &euro;14 million has been allocated in the budget for the expansion of the prison building programme, a mere &euro;5 million is allocated for social inclusion measures under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and there is no increase in funding for the probation service, which is already hopelessly under-funded as everybody working in the criminal courts knows.  It would be useful to have a debate on the purpose served by the prison building programme and additional prison places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader said yesterday, in the context of the drugs debate, that there is unanimity about the need for tougher measures and mandatory sentences.  I do not believe there is.  I do not believe mandatory sentences for drug and other offences serve a purpose in terms of rehabilitation.  The three young mothers, whose cases were reported yesterday, were sentenced two days ago to long terms of five, four and three years respectively.  Had mandatory sentences been imposed they would have been sentenced to ten years each.  What purpose does this serve?  These are mere couriers; they are low down in the chain.  The people at the top of the chain, the drug barons, are not being caught.</P>
        <P>We must take a rational approach in any debate on crime, prisons and drugs.  Knee-jerk reactions and measures simply do not work.  It is not enough to say to people that they must say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to drugs.  It is similar to asking people to abstain from sex to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS.  We should look to harm reduction programmes and more measured and rational responses.  Senator Boyle said yesterday that the war on drugs in the US is not working.  We must have a rational debate on the issue here, particularly in the context of this huge increase in funding for prisons, which is most regrettable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Colombian politician, Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU, meetings regularly discuss politicians in difficulty in various countries.  Some of them, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, are well known but there are other less well known situations.  When I was a Deputy I put down a number of parliamentary questions about them on a number of occasions.  Would the Leader seek a report on the politicians mentioned at the last IPU meeting to ensure that we add our voice to those of others expressing concern?  Sometimes we can do little about some of these situations but we should, as an honest broker, convey our dissatisfaction with ongoing problems in a number of countries, particularly with regard to the politicians.  The case being dis<Col N="2053"/>cussed today involves a female politician but across the board there are a number of issues which should be updated and addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over Christmas many people will spend a great deal of concentrated time in each other&rsquo;s presence.  It is a festive occasion and everybody is supposed to be in a happy, festive mood.  There will also probably be plenty of alcohol consumed in every house.  I wish to raise the issue of domestic violence.  On festive occasions, when people are supposedly having a good time, there is a greater opportunity for the physical, emotional or sexual abuse of partners or other family members to occur.  I commend the radio advertisements being run at present.  They are very sad and poignant.  We should continue to debate the issue of how to encourage people to report abuse, how to minimise domestic violence and how to support those who are dealing with its fallout.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to raise an issue that might seem silly but which I believe it is important.  Could we have a debate on how we can make Christmas and the long winter nights less lonely for older people?  It is a cross-departmental issue but some people appear to fall between the departmental stools.  There are many good voluntary workers who operate with Government grants but for the people who are most in need nothing can beat a little human touch from the community.  As I said on the Adjournment last night, it might consist of someone lifting the telephone to talk to them once a week.  Perhaps we could have a discussion on the loneliness of many people &mdash; not only in rural areas but elsewhere, as one can be very lonely in a crowd &mdash; and how we can, as individuals, reach out this Christmas to people in our community.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is timely, after yesterday&rsquo;s budget, for me to renew my plea to the Leader on behalf of non-contributory old-age pensioners and those who will shortly apply for this pension.  I propose that we remove the means test for this pension.  The bulk of pensioners in this country are on a contributory pension, have a State pension or have private pension schemes.  We are talking about approximately 40,000 people.  Many people on non-contributory pensions are women who had to leave work owing to the marriage bar, small farmers at subsistence level&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who did not come above the radar on tax and PRSI, and people who were duped in the workplace and did not have their cards stamped, to use the old colloquialism, or in other words people whose employers did not pay their PRSI contribution.  The majority of people who apply and receive non-contributory old-age pensions are deserving.  The cost of administering the means test must at least equal, if not exceed, the amount of money saved.  It <Col N="2054"/>causes great hardship and pain and is inequitable and unfair.  We should salute these older people and remove the means test as a goodwill gesture.</P>
        <P>I again issue my plea to the Leader to use his good offices to achieve this.  He promised me he would come back with a report on this.  I would like to see the up-to-date position.  It is a critical issue for many families and many people are involved.  This ties in with the remarks of Senator Keaveney, which I second, about lonely and isolated people this Christmas.  Many of these are the people I am talking about.</P>

	<P>As a member of the Council of Europe, I intend to raise this next week at a meeting of the human rights section.  It would be worthwhile to consider sending a delegation from this House to Colombia to meet officials there.  We should bear in mind also that this discussion is being broadcast around the world on the Internet.  It is possible that someone in the FARC guerilla movement may be listening and may have enough humanity to release this innocent victim.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on telecommunications.  From the end of February next year the Eircom telemessage service will be discontinued.  The operator service has already been discontinued.  There has been a reduction in services from Eircom since it was privatised and without consultation with stakeholders or company directors.  The telemessage service took over from the old telegram system, which was an excellent service provided to this country over the years, bringing both sad and good news.  The telemessage service is quite useful and has often been used by Members of the House.  There is now a reliance on Internet services, but many people still require this urgent form of communication.  The removal of this service from 29 February next year is a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the services provided by Eircom.  Since privatisation there has been a reduction in the roll-out of broadband.  In my home in Castlecoote, for example, I cannot get the service most Senators have in their homes and offices.  I have broadband in my office in Roscommon town, but in my home in Castlecoote, which is just six miles out, I do not have it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of the Munster Literature Centre.  I, too, received that fine book of poetry and the accompanying letter, which I immediately sent on to the director of the James Joyce Centre in Dublin.  The James Joyce Centre is internationally known.  We restored the entire building by raising &euro;1.5 million through voluntary efforts and we are in negotiations now with Government.  A consultants&rsquo; report has been commissioned, although it is perfectly obvious that what needs to be done is to separate the cost of maintaining the building, which should be a State cost, from the propagation and celebration of the works of James Joyce, for which we are quite capable of raising the money.  The support of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and, I am sure, many other Senators for a proper international literature centre dedicated principally to Joyce, for example, is welcome.  I will be send the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole to Government and to the director of the James Joyce Centre.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to have to raise a sad matter but I must inform the House that the young Nigerian woman, Adijat Okusanya, whose case I raised a few days ago, was sent back to Nigeria without any support and with no family.  She is 19 years old and arrived in this country at the age of 15.  She was halfway through her degree.  She arrived back yesterday from Mountjoy police station.  She was so traumatised she was taken to hospital.  This is something of which we can be thoroughly ashamed if we really believe in human rights.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of Tallaght Hospital.  I believe in centres of excellence and in an efficient service, but I have always allowed certain caveats.  One is the efficient delivery of a transport service for people who travel long distances.  In addition, certain services should not be closed down until their replacements, which may be more efficient, are in place.</P><Col N="2056"/>
        <P>I am concerned at the recent release by the Health Service Executive of a report on the urgent care centre at Tallaght Hospital, which is to replace the existing centre.  This is on foot of a report by RKW.  However, these consultants were precluded from considering the possibility of two centres, one in Tallaght and one in the Mater Hospital.  The report refers to this on numerous occasions.  It is obviously something they were concerned about, and they were briefed on this by the paediatric accident and emergency consultants.  It is obvious the scope and the terms of reference were narrowed to get the result that was required.  The department of geography in Trinity College also suggested that this was the safest method.  Therefore, we have a number of expert professional bodies involved with this.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s position is that there will be a service, but it is described as a clinic to deal with coughs, colds, bumps and bruises, and a day-case surgical unit to deal with grommets and other such minor procedures.  There is also question of the Tallaght charter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take up that.  When I do, I will emphasise the fact that the Tallaght Hospital charter has been violated.  There was a requirement to maintain the training of nurses, but this is not going to happen.  There will be a hospital entrance but no hospital behind it.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader raise with Government the extraordinary interference by an agent of the Canadian Government in political discourse in this country?  I refer to the attempt by an agent of the Canadian Government &mdash; whose name I have, but I will not put it on the record as I understand this is improper &mdash; to close down the website of GM-Free Ireland.  This has been raised in the House of Commons in an early day motion signed by Michael Meacher and 17 other MPs deploring the efforts of this person to shut down websites using the threat of action for defamation, which is interesting given we were dealing with defamation yesterday.</P>
        <P>The website referred to the fact that the research of this person was fraudulent, as it was.  The fraud consisted of the following.  The research group monitored the buying habits of consumers in a supermarket in Canada in their choice of sweetcorn and determined that a certain type of sweetcorn was more popular.  It was later found, however, that one type of sweetcorn was sold next to a sign referring to quality sweetcorn while the other was next to a sign that read: &ldquo;Would you eat wormy sweetcorn?&rdquo;  That is not exactly a level playing field.  It was a complete abnegation of all scientific standards.  This man is now trying to close down Irish networks that tell the truth about GM food, with interventions by large companies such as Monsanto to deface clear scientific research.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for raising the issue of &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt, the leader of the Colombian Green Party.  I support the calls made today and by Senator O&rsquo;Toole informally after yesterday&rsquo;s intervention for an all-party motion on the issue.  There is no need to reiterate that her captivity is unacceptable.  Its manner and the stance she has taken in Colombia have resonance for our country&rsquo;s experiences.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution regarding the representation by the Munster Literature Centre in respect of the lack of a permanent national literature centre.  The MLC is a neighbour of mine on Douglas Street in Cork and I used to work for it.  I was glad to receive the letter because it was not a supplication on behalf of the organisation.  Rather, it was a call for a national cultural literature infrastructure.  As Cork people and institutions tend to do, it pointed out that Cork has taken the cultural lead in this matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s statements on the budget and the fact that the House was able to have such a debate within one hour of the Minister for Finance sitting down in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It was a valuable exercise and an attempt was made to extend the debate today, although I am surprised by some of the arguments.  The budget involves an additional &euro;1.7 billion in current expenditure, &euro;900 million of which went directly into increased social welfare benefits.  The remaining &euro;800 million went to the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and towards increasing social housing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

	<P>I fail to see how any of the additional spending in yesterday&rsquo;s budget went anywhere other than to the most needy in society.  That is the challenge being addressed on this side.</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald has mentioned two issues of concern for the vulnerable people this budget has failed.  Many Senators have discussed how many people struggle due to the failures and shortfalls in the child care subvention scheme.  The second issue is people&rsquo;s entitlements to medical cards.  Given recent performance, we should have been able to expand medical card eligibility in a proper and meaningful way.  Everyone in the medical world has clam<Col N="2058"/>oured for it.  Through the Leader, I plead with the Government to give the matter further consideration.  It can be addressed in the finance Bill.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators&rsquo; comments on the plight of the Colombian Green Party politician, &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt.  Before people rush off to Colombia, arrangements should be made for the proposed all-party motion.  The Seanad can take the lead and the Lower House will follow.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should pursue the matter with his colleagues at European level in order that we can have a united approach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>They say that politics is a cruel trade, and I wish to pay tribute to a former Senator whose work touched on many of the issues raised this morning.  I refer to former Senator John Minihan, one of the first people to draw attention to the fact that, by any objective standards, FARC is a fascist organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of its remnants are deluded about this, but it is a drug-driven criminal organisation and an enemy of democracy.  John Minihan was to the fore in making this clear because FARC was linked to the Provisional IRA&rsquo;s bomb-making technocrats and, in turn, to a journalist with stars in his or her eyes and journalists involved in the <i>Daily Mail</i>&rsquo;s despicable campaign against the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>John Minihan pioneered the campaign for the reform of stamp duty.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste, <Col N="2059"/>Deputy Cowen, on a thoughtful budget.  While nothing is perfect, I welcome that he changed his mind.  Lord Birkenhead said of Michael Collins that it was great he was loyal to the facts.  It has taken the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance some time to come around on the question, but he has been assisted by a number of parties.  In particular, much of the Labour Party&rsquo;s policy on stamp duty was visible in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reforms, as was Fine Gael&rsquo;s input.  It is difficult for anyone to change his or her mind.  The T&aacute;naiste had set his face against the reform of stamp duty and it took a great deal of guts to be loyal to the economic facts to make the necessary changes in an inequitable tax.</P>
        <P>Like myself, the former Senator was no bleeding heart on law and order, but he would support me in supporting Senator Bacik&rsquo;s call for mercy to be shown in the run-up to Christmas to the three unfortunate women picked up recently on drugs charges.  She reminded the House of the dangers of hysteria surrounding drug-taking.  Speaking as someone who, from time to time, attends AA meetings, I know about substance abuse.  There always has been a substance abuse problem in Europe, particularly in Ireland.  Recently, I finished reading a long essay on poit&iacute;n distillation and alcoholism in mid-19th century Ireland.  It was a widespread problem, not just among the labouring and peasant classes, but also among the bourgeoisie of Dublin.  Ether drinking was so widespread among the North&rsquo;s Protestant population that young ladies in every town used to carry rubber devices to breathe it in.  There was morphine and opium abuse in late Victorian England.</P>
        <P>There has not been a time without substance abuse in Ireland and there is no point in DJs or others getting hysterical about a current upsurge in apparent drug-taking because it has been publicised by the media.  It is like the old canard of long ago, that the Swedes committed suicide unlike the Catholic Irish when the former were actually reporting on suicide unlike the latter.  We are reporting more on substance abuse.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the relevant authorities, the Government and the Opposition to join with the spirit of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s call and to give the unfortunate women a decent Christmas and some class of mercy or compassion.  They are only part of a general problem in society, the foot soldiers in a complex matter.  Like FARC, the Provisional IRA played a prominent part in the drug culture.  Had it not called off its campaign, it would have degenerated like FARC.  Remnants of the degeneracy are visible in the recent murder of Paul Quinn.</P>

I am concerned that our national sporting organisation is embarking on a route of pay-to-watch television for its matches.  I understand it has the right to its self-determination when raising revenue and so on.  However, it would be wrong for an abdication of coverage of our Gaelic games.</P>

        <P>I support Senator Cannon on the proposed decision of the National Roads Authority not to provide rest areas on motorways.  We are all aware of the advertisement telling us that if we feel tired when driving we should take a rest.  Where?  Due to the proposed decision of the NRA one would need to be able to levitate.  Perhaps the NRA will provide skyhooks as an aide to levitation.  I have never seen a more stupid, ill-thought out concept.  This undermines the concept of road safety which has been raised <i>ad nauseam</i> in the House.  To have miles of motorway with no rest areas is ludicrous.  I ask the Leader to communicate with the Minister for Transport to have this stupid decision reversed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas, Deputy Batt <Col N="2064"/>O&rsquo;Keeffe, to address the House on sheltered housing for older persons.  The National Council on Ageing and Older Persons is holding a conference today in Croke Park.  It recently published a report, The Role and Future Development of Supportive Housing for Older Persons in Ireland, making the point that the current provision of sheltered housing for the elderly is insufficient.  With the current rate of provision, it estimates only 23 units will be available per 1,000 elderly persons.  As a result, many elderly people will remain in long-term care, even though they may not need the high level of care provided by nursing homes.  They speak of a need to provide a range of accommodation options for elderly people in rural areas where there is a serious undersupply of accommodation.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State to the House to tell us how he will tackle this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Two more Senators indicated some time ago that they wanted to speak, although the Order of Business has run long over time.  There is a Minister of State waiting to come into the House.  Against my better judgment, however, I will call the two Senators. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment Senators Frances Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik and others on bringing to our notice the case of &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt to which many of us were oblivious.  It is worrying to know that the case has existed for five years because there was a brave person who was prepared to speak out against terrorism &mdash; as we should all do at all times.  Senator Fitzgerald said that often a small act by parliamentarians can achieve major results.  No doubt that we have made an impact on, and contributed to, the successful outcome of many of the human rights issues on which we have spoken here in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>It is important not to distinguish between the human rights of one person and another.  Many of us are hostages both to history and to political expediency.  All the great powers have a pecking order for human rights versus national security, issues which are often difficult to reconcile.</P>
        <P>When Senator Mary White went to Colombia I praised her as a remarkable lady because she demonstrated courage, independence and generosity of heart by funding that cause out of her own pocket.  She monitored the case of the three Irish people held in questionable captivity there and was transparent and open at all times.  At the time I compared her with Jimmy Carter who was also prepared to put his head above the parapet.  I salute Senator Mary White and urge her to continue, although a human rights activist is always misrepresented.</P>
        <P>On the wall of the Listowel Arms Hotel are photographs of a host of great writers, Bryan MacMahon, John B. Keane, Brendan Kennelly and others.  I cannot think of any area that has a <Col N="2065"/>greater claim to be the literary capital of Ireland than Listowel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a hallmark of democracy to give human rights to those who may not have given them to others.  We should stand up for their human rights because it is important for people to have fair trials.  People who have been given a nameplate are not always innocent.  In many cases they are, but even when they have done something very wrong we must stand up for their human rights. </P>
        <P>I support the call for a debate on genetically modified foods.  The significant reduction in the amount of food reserves worldwide raises the question of whether the amount of land set aside should continue to be so.  Not all genetically modified food is Frankenfood.  We need a logical, rational debate on this issue.  Producers have used animal husbandry, breeding and seeds and other materials in the natural course of events to improve stock and crops.  Genetic modification may be another way of doing this.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to see the Opposition nitpicking points in the fine budget then asking what we are doing about local authority housing, given that it controls most local authorities.  What is it doing about the problem?  Where did it put the money it got?</P>

        <P>I welcome the budget, of which 29% is being spent on health and 31% on social welfare, making 60% on the two areas, on behalf of the underprivileged, senior citizens and those on the margins.  For a senior citizen &euro;14 is a large sum of money.  We on this side of the House never <Col N="2066"/>reduced a social welfare payment in our time in government since 1932.  I am proud to be the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group here, apart from being Leader of the House.  By contrast, the parties pontificating here this morning reduced the old age pension from five shillings to four shillings and social welfare recipients&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Many Senators called for a debate on housing which would be worthwhile.  There will be a major housing initiative in February and we will invite the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator McFadden for raising the issue of the primary care unit in Athlone.  I will intervene and do whatever I can about it when I talk to the Minister for Health and Children this afternoon.</P><Col N="2067"/>
        <P>There should be an international centre for literature in Dublin.  There would be no better place than the north city centre where Senator Norris has spent his life fundraising for the Joyce centre, on which he is to be complimented.  I would like to see a centre in the north inner city, on North Great Georges Street or more particularly on Parnell Square if possible, which people can access freely from O&rsquo;Connell Street.  Dublin City Council is involved in a major initiative in the Parnell Square area which I applaud and I look forward to the announcement of it soon.</P>
        <P>Senators Cannon and Glynn expressed strong views on the National Roads Authority.  It is essential for drivers to be able to avail of rest areas on dual carriageways and motorways.  I will pass the Senators&rsquo; views to the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Harris and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed their sentiments about prison reform and substance abuse.  Now I know why the song &ldquo;Come Down from the Mountain Katie Daly&rdquo; was so popular in the 1960s since hearing Senator Harris speak of the various parts of Ireland in which mountain dew was brewed.  I can organise time for a debate on this subject.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney and Glynn referred to domestic violence, particularly in long-stay institutions, an area in which Senator Glynn has much experience.  I will arrange a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly wanted clarification on old age pensions and I am pleased to inform the House that his point was covered in yesterday&rsquo;s budget when an increase of &euro;27 in the qualifying adult rate, bringing the level to &euro;200 per week, or 94% of the target, has now been reached.  This measure will benefit all qualified adults aged 66 and over and will be of special benefit to women who do not have an entitlement to the contributory pension because of home responsibilities, as the Senator has pointed out to the House on many occasions.  The Minister went on to add that, when combined with the increase in the personal pension rate, the impact of this measure will be that over 42,000 pensioner couples will see their household incomes increase by up to &euro;41 per week, or almost by 11%.  The Senator also referred to women under 66 years of age, and I will endeavour to use my influence in that regard, but the news is good regarding part of the Senator&rsquo;s inquiry, on which he has strong views.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for an urgent debate on telecommunications, the reduction in services from 29 February 2008 and the roll-out of broadband.  I have already committed to a debate in this regard early in the new year.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the report on Tallaght Hospital and I suggest this debate could be held before Christmas if the Independent benches take the matter during Private Members&rsquo; business next Wednesday.  Senators Norris and Hanafin also referred to genetically modified <Col N="2068"/>food and I can pass their strong views on to the Minister in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to housing with regard to yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  The figure given for growth in this sector last year of 4.7% was correct.  Projected growth for next year is conservatively estimated at 3%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the level we are at currently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is what parts 1 and 2 of the Celtic tiger achieved in the past ten years and long may it continue.  Yesterday&rsquo;s budget was an honest attempt to address the difficult areas of housing the Senator has correctly highlighted to the House.  Some houses were overpriced, the market had to level and the Government could not get involved, so this could be the right time to do the right thing, as I always say.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for the roll-out of public services for the national broadcaster of our national games.  I hope the day never arrives when the viewer of amateur Irish sports will be asked to pay to watch.  We all support the ethos of the Gaelic Athletic Association and believe players should not be paid to play, though they should be given expenses.  They deserve the highest quality resources to help keep fit because the greatest gift one can give one&rsquo;s body is fitness.  Viewers, those who attend games and those who make these sports want to ensure players have these resources but this House should send a strong message to the GAA that we will not get involved in its affairs.  We are all Gaels and want games to be televised on channels that do not charge for viewing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orm a bheith anseo chun t&uacute;s a chuir leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;irecht seo, at&aacute; t&aacute;bhachtach domsa agus don t&iacute;r.  Os rud &eacute; go mbeidh m&eacute; ag bualadh le bainiste&oacute;ir&iacute; contae agus cathrach san athbhliain chun an cheist seo a phl&eacute;, is mian liom tuaraim&iacute; an tSeanaid a fh&aacute;il roimh r&eacute;.  I welcome the opportunity for a debate on the merits of developing local food economies and direct sale options for producers.  One direct sale option which appeals to many consumers and producers alike is the farmers&rsquo; market.  Others include farm shops, box schemes and community supported agriculture or CSA as they call it in Canada, the USA and Britain, which includes encouraging local abattoirs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before specifically focusing on the merits of farmers&rsquo; markets I want to put the timelines of this debate in a wider context.  Just this week the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, Mr. Joachim von Braun gave us a stark message.  His report, called the World Food Situation, says the risks of food riots and malnutrition will surge in the next two years as the global supply of grain comes under more pressure than at any time in the past 50 years.  Recent pasta protests in Italy, tortilla rallies in Mexico and onion demonstrations in India are just a start.</P>
        <P>In summary, the International Food Policy Research Institute report cites three main reasons for the shortages that are pushing up food prices.  The first is rising consumption as the appetite of fast-growing nations, such as China, is rising as economic booms cause a surge in demand for meat and dairy products.  The second is competition from bio-fuels as the cars of the rich are now rivalling the bellies of the poor for corn, cane and edible oils.  The third is climate change as global warming is putting pressure on water needed to irrigate crops.</P>
        <P>The world has been consuming more than it produces for the past five years and the globalised food industry cannot satisfy global demand.  Local food growing and food marketing economies need to be developed to provide more staple foods for consumers and easily accessible markets for producers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The local food concept is becoming increasingly popular throughout the country as Bord Bia showed in a recent survey.  The evidence for this can clearly be seen in the number of farmers&rsquo; markets &mdash; now over 130 &mdash; public, private and community markets in this country.  I have long been an advocate of farmers&rsquo; markets and would go as far as saying every good-sized town should <Col N="2070"/>have one as part of its food experience.  Markets help to re-connect consumers with local food producers, offering small producers a platform to test out their products, innovate and better understand consumer demand.  In a very direct way markets can also keep us in touch with the seasonality of nature and the taste of fresh local food.</P>
        <P>The experience to date of farmers&rsquo; markets, farm shops and box schemes, suggests that they can provide wide-ranging and long-term benefits, on both a local and regional level, which can be measured socially, environmentally and economically.  These benefits include access to in-season quality fresh food, fewer air miles and, therefore, reduced carbon footprints, more money circulating in local economies, increased employment regionally, the preservation and development of regional specialties and an enhanced level of choice for consumers.  Farmers&rsquo; markets also provide the perfect platform for small food producers to receive extremely valuable feedback directly from the consumer that can lead to improvements in quality and the way the business is run.</P>
        <P>In the last year my Department, in conjunction with An Bord Bia, has hosted various regional food fora, which had the objectives of highlighting the importance of small food enterprises, providing guidance for best practice in regional food marketing development and encouraging food entrepreneurship for the creation of national and regional wealth.  This approach emphasises bringing together small food producers and local development agencies under one roof for presentations from experts, brief case studies from local food entrepreneurs and question and answer sessions.  This approach was successful in that it provided participants with opportunities for networking and showcasing regional produce.</P>
        <P>These regional fora cumulated in a national conference last November.  This was the first national conference to be organised on the topic of local food and almost 300 people attended, representing producers, retailers, consumers and agencies.  The aim of the conference was to raise awareness and understanding of local food as defined by the consumer, highlight the benefits to producers, retailers and the consumer, and offer practical information and advice to those wishing to sell food in their local areas.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the desirability of sourcing food locally.  In that context, I have a particular interest in promoting and ensuring the viability of local abattoirs.  Under the EU hygiene package, all approved establishments, regardless of size, may now export produce, provided it is accompanied by appropriate certification.  The hygiene package ended the previous differentiation between local abattoirs that were only permitted to trade on the domestic market and export-approved abattoirs.  My Department is considering whether there is scope for support for <Col N="2071"/>abattoirs in regard to specific activities under the marketing and processing scheme operated by the Department.</P>
        <P>Direct sales are important for some producers, particularly for horticultural products.  However, several factors can limit the development of this channel.  One example is access to market stalls and suitable facilities and this was an issue raised at the food fora.  As local authorities have powers under the Casual Trading Act, I intend taking this issue up with local authority managers and mayors early in the new year.  I will impress on local authority colleagues the need for running water and power points at markets.</P>
        <P>I seek to promote a level of consistency for all local authorities in dealing with farmers&rsquo; markets.  I take encouragement from other countries such as France where local authorities take their food remit seriously and provide water and lighting.  In Italy, new legislation to improve the already well established farmers&rsquo; market network is about to be introduced.  I hope to have a forum in place in early 2008 that will go through an agenda dealing with the areas of common interest between local authorities and my Department.  In this regard, my Department is currently surveying every known farmers&rsquo; market to ascertain and compile a detailed database of statistics.  This information will then be used to guide Government policy at both local and national level.</P>
        <P>The importance of farmers&rsquo; markets has long been recognised by my Department.  The organic marketing development group, which is funded by my Department, made a significant contribution to An Bord Bia&rsquo;s Guide to Selling through Farmers&rsquo; Markets, Farm Shops and Box Schemes in Ireland.  This guide is available on An Bord Bia&rsquo;s website and I hope Members will have an opportunity to read it.  The purpose of the guide is to assist growers, producers and other food entrepreneurs, both organic and conventional, who wish to set up in business through those outlets.  Information and advice is presented in a concise, easy-to-use format, with step-by-step action plans, useful checklists and relevant guidelines.  Both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are covered.  The guide gives a clear understanding of what is involved in selling through farmers&rsquo; markets and points traders in the right direction should they require more detailed advice or information.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a widespread impression that all produce sold at farmers&rsquo; markets is organic.  The reality is that generally only a minority of stall-holders offer organic food.  It is important, therefore, both for consumers and stall-holders, that this distinction is obvious at the markets.  Consumers themselves can play a positive role in regard to correct labelling.  If they have any doubt whatsoever of the validity of an organic product on sale at a farmers&rsquo; market, they can ask the seller to show them a copy of the producer&rsquo;s current organic licence.  If the con<Col N="2072"/>sumer is not fully satisfied with the documentation produced, or if the seller is not in a position to provide the necessary documentation, my advice to consumers is to walk away without purchasing the product and notify my Department of their concerns.  It is an offence to display produce for sale labelled as organic if it is not certified by a registered organic certification body.  My objective is to ensure consumers can have full confidence in the organic food they buy.  My Department has assigned additional staff resources to its organic unit and officers of the Department are now systematically inspecting retail outlets, including farmers&rsquo; markets, to ensure all product identified as organic has been produced fully in accordance with the organic regulations.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to developing the organic sector in Ireland.  In the programme for Government, we pledged to increase the land area under organic production from the current figure of less than 1% to 5% of total agricultural area by 2012.  As the demand for fresh local and organic produce grows, so do the opportunities for local producers.  The organic retail market was estimated to be worth some &euro;66 million last year, compared to &euro;38 million in 2003.  By 2012, the organic market is expected to be worth &euro;400 million.  At present, however, 70% of the organic produce consumed in Ireland has to be imported.</P>
        <P>The Irish people have a fundamental choice to make.  We can continue to hope other countries will be in a position to meet our demand for organic and non-organic produce, whether onions, asparagus, tomatoes, cucumbers or even potatoes which are sometimes imported into Ireland.  Alternatively, we can put in place the options for farmers to diversify.  Several farmers I know provide enough produce for local shops and local farmers&rsquo; markets.  Some of these have the capacity to guarantee continuous supply to supermarket chains, others do not.  My job is to help all farmers, large and small.  We need them all and we need more people to take an interest in growing food in the years ahead.  Farmers&rsquo; markets are a way to help more farmers and growers to get access to the market.  When we support or even help to establish a farmers&rsquo; market, we are helping not just our own community to develop in a way that is healthy for all concerned but, globally, we are doing something small but practical to improve food security in Ireland and worldwide.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him belatedly on his appointment.  It is a portfolio in which he is particularly interested and of which he has personal knowledge given that his constituency of Dublin North was one of the first areas in which horticulture and local organic food production were developed.</P><Col N="2073"/>
        <P>The Minister of State concluded his remarks in a sensible fashion.  We must keep in mind that the contribution of farmers&rsquo; markets and the organic sector will never be huge in quantity or percentage terms in the context of our overall food and agribusiness market.  It is an important sector and it certainly has room for expansion, but it will not answer all the questions on the future of agriculture and food production.  I will shortly attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food where we will discuss Brazilian beef.  Here in the Chamber we are discussing local organic food production and farmers&rsquo; markets, while the Oireachtas committee will discuss the importation of Brazilian beef.  Somewhere in between is the solution to which we must all aspire.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister of State quote the statistics on world food production.  I read some of that report in one of yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers.  It is an issue that requires careful consideration, not only by political thinkers and policy makers in this State but also within the European Union.  In the last ten years, at European level, we have gone from milk lakes and beef and butter mountains, and the associated political scandals, to the other side of the equation where Europe and the world is barely producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the population.  This is a major challenge to address as agricultural land is being turned over in huge percentage terms towards bio-fuel and other alternative uses.  We face the danger, at world and even European level, of not being able to produce enough food to satisfy the consumer at home and abroad.  We cannot move away from that debate.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In this context we must be realistic with regard to both farmers&rsquo; markets and organic food production.  These are emerging sectors which need to be developed.  These markets are a fine showcase for local food productions in many towns, with Darina Allen springing to mind in County Cork as a pioneer of the sector.  The Midleton market every Saturday morning is thriving, with people coming from all over Cork and the larger area of Munster.  In my own area there is a farmers&rsquo; market in the Nano Nagle centre in Killavullen which is going very well.</P>
        <P>These are very welcome and the local authorities must continue to play a very proactive role in allowing these markets to expand and develop to their maximum potential.  With regard to the production of food for these markets, I welcome the progress made in schemes such as the REPS, in which I know the Minister of State has an interest, and the grants for organic farming.  At a time when so many young people have moved away from a career in agriculture and when we must reflect on how to again portray agriculture as a viable and vibrant career for young people, further money should be invested in the REPS, organic programmes and the farm installation <Col N="2074"/>grant, which would give people a direct cash injection to start up a farming business.</P>
        <P>In one sense, we should never need to speak about organic food or the horticultural industry in Ireland because of the quality of our land and the tradition of quality farming.  From a European and world perspective, Ireland is almost seen as a green centre of food and horticultural excellence.  We should continue to build on that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the suggestion continuously made by my party in recent years regarding a green food label for food produced in Ireland.  That is not entirely related to this morning&rsquo;s debate but we must reflect on it to ensure Ireland retains its name for green and safe quality foods in the eyes of European and world consumers.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State stated accurately that not all food sold in farmers&rsquo; markets is organic.  His comments were realistic and perhaps the consumer requires further education in that regard.  At least we are having this debate at a time when the consumer is much more open to learning about quality food and is more understanding of the concept of food miles and environmental concern and damage.</P>
        <P>In a sense, the ball is on the penalty spot and the goalkeeper is gone.  It is only a question of putting the ball into the net if we can plan a strategy for our food marketing, our green Ireland image and our quality control in a deliberate and progressive fashion.  I am sure the Minister of State will lead the way in that regard.</P>
        <P>Some of the statistics are in one way impressive but in another show the size of the market about which we are speaking.  Some 35,000 hectares of land are being farmed organically in Ireland, which is probably slightly less than 1% of our landmass.  We should aim to significantly increase that proportion of land used for producing food organically.  This will not answer all the questions over the future of Irish farming or future food supply but it is an important sector on which we can build.</P>
        <P>I am not sure of the accuracy of the statistics but I am advised the organic retail market in Ireland is currently valued at approximately &euro;70 million and rising.  That is a welcome figure, as every &euro;1 million of food produced at home and consumed locally is good for the Irish economy.  Taking into account the concept of food miles, it is also good for the environment.  We welcome the progress made here but, to recall a phrase from another almost forgotten era, there is a lot done, more to do.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours and I know of his personal commitment to the matter.  His programmes on green food, food markets and organic food will come about side by side with the global picture of the future production of food for Europe and the world.  Organic and farmers&rsquo; markets, although small in percentage terms, are valuable in other terms.  We <Col N="2075"/>support them and look forward to the Minister of State progressing and expanding the sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chuir roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis ar&iacute;s as ucht an s&aacute;r-obair at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh aige sa Roinn.  It is regrettable that our scheduling today has the Minister of State making a statement on farmers&rsquo; markets when there is a very interesting meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the issue of Brazilian imports.  Senator Bradford mentioned this and we would all like to attend it as well.  Perhaps we could give more thought to the scheduling next time.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his success in promoting the green Ireland image and the manner in which he is promoting a healthy-living lifestyle throughout the nation.  The Minister of State is winning as there is now strong evidence the public is buying into the green message, and his job may very well be made easier in future.  The issue will become consumer-led as people switch on to the idea.</P>
        <P>I will not go into too many statistics but a recent report indicates spending on organic food in Ireland averages &euro;40 per month as compared with &euro;29 per month in 2003.  Another survey shows three in ten Irish people have consciously changed their eating habits in order to be healthier over a one-year period.  Eight out of ten have reduced their intake of fast foods and 75% of the population now indicates it is prepared to pay more for healthier food.  We are going in the right direction.</P>
        <P>Farmers&rsquo; markets are a bit like Christmas in that everybody is for them.  This does not mean they are perfect in every way and I have some reservations, to which I will refer in conclusion.  Overall, they are a powerful and important force for getting across the idea of healthy eating and promoting the concept that we can, in Ireland, be self-sufficient and produce good quality food at local level to be consumed at local level.</P>
        <P>In that respect they offer our farmers a very important opportunity to diversify at a time when, as the Minister of State indicated, we are even importing potatoes.  They can be a great signal to our agricultural sector that there is an opportunity here and that farmers&rsquo; markets will provide an outlet.</P>
        <P>For years, farmers were irate at the fact they produced good quality foods which were being sold in the major supermarkets and multinationals at significant profits.  The farmer could not see how he was getting so little out of the deal.  The old-style single convenience store at the street corner is almost a thing of the past and there is no median now.  There is either selling in large supermarkets or the welcome new arrival of the farmers&rsquo; market as a new option for the producer.</P>
        <P>It is also a great outlet for people who wish to boost their incomes, be they breadmakers, chee<Col N="2076"/>semakers or other local artisans.  They did not have this outlet in the past.  It is inspiring creativity in them and helping the household budget because in many cases these people would not be extremely well off and it is an additional source of income for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Department and An Bord Bia on the way in which they are successfully promoting the image of farmers&rsquo; markets.  Last year&rsquo;s RTE series on farmers&rsquo; markets was excellent and I read with interest that it has been shown on inward flights from the USA.  It also has been screened in New Zealand and Australia.  I understand that a new series is due to run in April.  It shows vision on the part of An Bord Bia to sponsor such a programme.  The Department&rsquo;s Agrivision 2015 committee also has some useful proposals for the future.  I commend the Minister on organising the series of regional fora on farmers&rsquo; markets culminating in the conference last month.  The Minister of State has stated today that there will be further developments on those lines.</P>
        <P>Some 130 markets are now operational with an annual turnover of &euro;28 million, which is not to be sneezed at.  While in the overall context of our agriculture budget it is not a large sum, it is growing.  The Minister of State was very welcome recently in my town of Listowel when he came to address a food fair organised by Deputy Deenihan.  He had a very good robust exchange with local farmers and he certainly gave as good as he got.  He had an opportunity to see the Listowel farmers&rsquo; market before he left.  He may wish to consider that market as a useful template for future farmers&rsquo; markets.  It was not without difficulty that it was established.  Before I was elected to this Chamber, I was a member of the local authority in Kerry and of Listowel Town Council.  We had a long gestation period and a rather bruising exchange with the farmers&rsquo; market promoters before dialogue commenced.  Dialogue is always very good.  The chairman of the town council happened to be the chairman of the farmers&rsquo; market group, Councillor Anthony Curtin of Sinn F&eacute;in, who is an excellent man.  He got us all together and we made an agreement as to how it would run.  It has been a great success and the fears of many of us, including myself, have been more than allayed.</P>
        <P>Coming from a business background as a retailer, I know there is always a sense among people who are paying rates &mdash; often swingeing rates &mdash; service charges etc., which provide for the annual budget of a town, that people who come in on a casual basis may be reaping the profits of the regular traders&rsquo; endeavours throughout the year.  Perhaps there should be a more meaningful contribution by the farmers&rsquo; markets to the town budget.  While I may be straying from the theme of today&rsquo;s debate, the Minister of State mentioned that he would consult with county managers and local authorities, which is good because there have been some difficulties in that <Col N="2077"/>regard.  There is still some residual resentment in country towns.  The regular retailers feel they are subsidising all this and are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  The antithesis is probably truer in that farmers&rsquo; markets are a major attraction, bringing people from far and wide, as Senator Bradford said.  Tourists love to make for the farmers&rsquo; market.  The first thing they ask when they reach the hotel is where and when the local market takes place.  There is a spin-off for the shops and traders of the town.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State touched on the regulation of farmers&rsquo; markets.  In my experience 90% of them are well regulated whether they are self-regulating or it is done with the advice and assistance of Department inspections.  I have read that a number of markets are operating at less than a premium level.  Perhaps there is a need for some tightening up in the Department&rsquo;s inspections.  A tighter regime on labelling may need to be introduced.  I understand there is no labelling requirement for loose foods such as cheeses that are cut and prepared before the customer.  When it is packaged and supposed to be organic it must be organic.  A recent report on the &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo; programme suggested that all is not well in this regard and that foods that are not organic are being sold as organic.  While I do not know how widespread that practice is, it would devalue the farmers&rsquo; market movement if it were allowed to take hold.  I am glad to note the Minister of State is observing that.  The Consumer Association of Ireland has also made some representations regarding labelling.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the provision of important services such as water by the local authorities.  Not all farmers&rsquo; markets operate in what would be the ideal hygiene regime.  Overall there is a need for some tightening.  The FARMA group in the UK seems to be quite successful in that regard and it might be appropriate for us to have a similar operation here.</P>
        <P>I had not expected the Minister of State to refer to abattoirs and I am delighted he did.  It bothered me that approximately ten years ago there was a very serious crack down on country and village abattoirs.  Much of it was necessary because we needed to impose the highest standards of hygiene based on European directives etc.  However, I believe it went over the top.  What truer or more natural passage from the farm to the counter is there than a man who rears his own beef, slaughters, dresses, prepares and sells it?  It cuts out everything else we do not want.  I would like to see support for the remaining abattoirs.  Obviously they must operate under pristine conditions &mdash; we would not accept anything less.  I hope a new attitude will be taken because too many of them fell by the wayside.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State and his Department.</P>

Labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; ar &aacute;bhair &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bhaineann le c&oacute;ras bia na t&iacute;re seo.  </P>
        <P>I should begin by agreeing with the point Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan made.  I was in this House when the Abattoirs Act was passed.  I believed then and still believe it was the most regressive measure on food safety introduced in my time.  Something that was intended to protect our food got rid of traceability.  Traceability became an issue only when we eliminated the local abattoirs.  I said at the time we should have insisted on certain standards in local abattoirs.  However, we chose to introduce a state of the art set of regulations for which only wholesalers could qualify thus putting the small butcher in a local town out of the market.  I even tried a fallback position some years later.  I suggested the State might help out by building abattoirs in a location so that a butcher could go and kill his own animals in that central abattoir and have his own chilled room or cold room there with his own key.  When butchers bring an animal to be slaughtered they can never be 100% sure that what they get back is all their own.  Nowadays they have got much cleverer about it.  It is an important issue and should be revisited.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State might find this somewhat peripheral.  Approximately one year after the introduction of the Abattoirs Act we introduced a set of regulations for the establishment of restaurants, which is still intact.  They are appalling.  They covered everybody&rsquo;s needs, mainly to protect the vintners in case restaurants started selling a pint of stout.  The Minister of State should walk into a restaurant in France or another European country, look at it physically and then come back to Ireland.  When somebody talks about a rip-off republic in Ireland and that restaurateurs are overcharging, he will see why.  I have never seen a restaurant in France with two toilets for instance.  Regularly they would not have the additional set of doors we require to get into a toilet.  They can produce their food on the table much more cheaply than we can.</P>
        <P>There is a quality issue relating to farmers&rsquo; markets.  My mother used to sell fruit and vegetables, among other things.  I could walk into the house blindfold the day that the Irish tomatoes came on the market at the start of the new season.  They had a beautiful smell which one does not smell any more unless one grows them in the back garden.  I know that the Minister of State grows his own and he knows precisely what I am talking about.  An Irish tomato can be eaten like an apple, both for the smell of it which is gorgeous, the taste of it which is gorgeous and the colour which is gorgeous.  Chefs will say that to slice open a home-grown or backyard-grown Irish tomato is unique.  Many chefs in Ireland use tinned tomato for the simple reason they cannot <Col N="2079"/>get the desired quality in the tomatoes bought in a shop.</P>
        <P>I have raised another issue <i>ad nauseam</i> for the past 15 years in the House.  People come back from places like France or Spain with photographs taken in the local market &mdash; in places like Patagonia in South America or wherever &mdash; which show the vegetables on display in the market.  They then wonder why we cannot have the same in Ireland.  The reason is quite simple and the answer can be found where I live in north Dublin.</P>
        <P>I happen to live in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency and we in north Dublin can live off the vegetables that fall through the sorting machines of the local vegetable producers.  These are perfectly good cucumbers, peppers and tomatoes which do not meet the size and shape requirements dictated by some boffin in Brussels as being proper for our needs.  It is madness that perfectly good, tasty fruit is being dumped because it does not conform to a sorting process and this should be investigated.</P>
        <P>I know that the issue of food miles is close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart.  One of the problems is that much of the food we grew up with and loved is no longer available because it does not travel well.  I will cite an example.  Anybody of my age or anybody who grew up with an orchard in the back garden or in the field next door, or anyone who ever robbed an orchard in his or her youth, when people still felt it necessary to rob an orchard, will remember that the main apple was Beauty of Bath.  It was a lovely striped apple with red and yellow running through it and a bit of red visible when it was bitten into.  The problem is the Beauty of Bath apple does not travel well; any contact and it bruises.  It is not commercial and therefore it is not available to buy and has disappeared from the market.  However, it could be sold in local markets as local produce.</P>
        <P>I stand to be corrected but I have not seen home churned butter in any of the farmers&rsquo; markets I have visited.  It is no longer available and it has a distinctive taste.  C&iacute;m &iacute; gcona&iacute; ag f&eacute;achaint ar im ar na seilfeanna, b&iacute;onn various types of butter such as salted, unsalted, sweet, or not so sweet.  Butter is butter in Ireland.  I wonder if we are losing out but I do not know the reason.  I am certain we are losing out by not having<?oasys _jy ?>homemade butter available.</P>
        <P>I completely agree with a point touched upon by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan on the question of the relationship with the local shops and the local authority.  This is where a certain amount of regulation could be introduced.  Some farmers&rsquo; markets are better regulated than others.  I refer to the milk market in Limerick where stands are bought for a year at modest cost.  The market is kept nice and clean and it complies with certain basic regulations without the need for somebody with a clipboard coming around.  The market is well run and it pays a fee to the local authority <Col N="2080"/>which allows for the fact that a market creates litter and needs to be cleaned up and nobody will object to this practice.  Markets also draw people into towns.</P>
        <P>I have views on many issues to do with this subject.  Local delicacies have been lost over time.  The Listowel fair sells what is generally called in Listowel and north Kerry a Kerry pie but it should correctly be called a Dingle pie.  This is a mutton pie which is made locally and is a delicacy.  Abraimis faoin sliog&aacute;n dubh, big hard mussels, which are a delicacy in many parts of County Donegal.  They could be available as a local delicacy, such as tripe in other parts of the country.  There is not an area in Ireland that does not have a local dish and their sale in farmers&rsquo; markets would make them known and understood by people.</P>
        <P>I recently visited a market in Castle Street in Edinburgh, just off the main drag.  On a certain day every month, what is called an international market is held; we might call it an immigrant market.  Hot food is sold from every country imaginable.  This is an element of multiculturalism which would fit in very well with farmers&rsquo; markets and would allow people to learn more about each other.</P>
        <P>This subject was raised by me in this new Seanad when, to the great amusement of the rest of the House, I asked what had happened to Irish mutton.  It is no longer possible to buy Irish mutton.  The British have realised this is an important issue and Prince Charles is now the patron of the British Mutton Society.  I ask Members not to make any jokes about this fact but even the Acting Chairman is laughing.  Prince Charles is the patron because he wants to preserve the specific taste of mutton and he is absolutely right.</P>
        <P>In the south of France in the Pyrenees, mutton is called <i>mouton</i> as opposed to <i>agneau</i>.  The French also sell something that cannot be bought in Ireland, a year-old chicken, named a <i>chapon</i>.  These are usually corn-fed and they are all numbered.  Roquefort cheese is a farmers&rsquo; industry in a tiny part of France.  Every single roll of cheese is numbered.  I recently watched a television programme in which Irish people went to Italy to run a food business on a swap basis.  They were in a cheese business where every single roll of cheese was stamped and numbered to allow for traceability.  There is much that we could do in this area.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by making some brief points.  I have a curiosity on a million issues which could never be fulfilled.  I refer to one of the aspects of the current situation which drives me mad.  I recently visited Birr, County Offaly.  I went into the butcher&rsquo;s shop next door to Dooley&rsquo;s Hotel because I usually go into shops when I visit a place and ask about their business.  I asked them whether they sell much meat to the hotel next door.  It is kind of question we ask in Kerry but people in the midlands are more reticent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>You would not get an answer in Kerry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The butcher told me they were doing a great business with the hotel until they received a visit from the food fascists &mdash; I should say, the food Nazis &mdash; who told them they could no longer supply the hotel.  The fact that they were selling meat to the hotel which might then sell it to me on a plate meant they had become wholesalers and would have to comply with a new set of regulations.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this regulation.</P>
        <P>The UK takes a different approach with the result that we require a much higher number of core sales for wholesalers.  The result is that small butchers on the northern side of the Border are supplying restaurants and hotels in County Donegal while butchers in County Donegal cannot supply their own hotels because they cannot meet the same regulations.  This may sound confusing but I do not have the time to explain it in more detail.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will pass what used to be the North Dublin Farmers Co-op on his way here every morning.  If he did nothing else in his tenure as Minister of State than to convince farmers of the advantages of belonging to a co-operative and looking after themselves and perhaps taking a lower price in order to facilitate local buying and selling, it would be a good achievement as farmers&rsquo; co-operatives need a boost.  I apologise for being a little disjointed in my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House and I thank him for his presentation.  I recognise the role played by the Minister of State in promoting the concept of farmers&rsquo; markets around the country.  His arrival into the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is very timely because there is a public appetite for the emergence and development of a much greater number of farmers&rsquo; markets.  This debate is examining the reason the development of those markets is important and there are many compelling reasons for supporting and encouraging good quality and appropriately regulated farmers&rsquo; markets.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to the development of farmers&rsquo; markets is reflected in the programme for Government.  The stated objective is to encourage more direct selling from farmer to customer by restoring and promoting a national network of farmers&rsquo; markets.  Members should work towards such a national network.  The Minister of State also referred to his intention to hold a forum early next year to bring together city and county managers to facilitate the exchange of best practice in the development of farmers&rsquo; markets, which is important.  He has recognised that the support given to such markets nationwide varies from one local authority area to another.  While there is great support for, and highly successful initiatives regarding, farmers&rsquo; <Col N="2082"/>markets in some areas, in others there is not so much.  It is important for the city and county managers, who are in a key role, to recognise the economic and other significant benefits of encouraging farmers&rsquo; markets in their local authority areas and to do everything possible to try to support the emergence of such markets.  Representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have met representatives of the organisation for local authority management to discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>There are many compelling reasons Ireland should support the development of farmers&rsquo; markets.  One has been raised by previous speakers, namely, the issue concerning Brazilian beef.  This highlights the reason we should develop local markets at which producers, farmers, growers, brewers, bakers and those the Minister of State described as food entrepreneurs sell local, fresh and in-season produce to the local community.  The concerns regarding Brazilian beef highlight some of the disadvantages of the global market and global food supply chain that has developed in recent decades.</P>
        <P>Turning to the issue of food miles, people have become increasingly aware of the threat posed by climate change, the issue of energy security and so on.  In this context, the food miles that accompany the transportation of products from other parts of the world mean there is a direct impact on climate change and energy efficiency and security.  Moreover, the issue of different quality standards applying in producing countries elsewhere in the world also arises.  Consumers who buy such products cannot feel certain about the levels of quality assurance, safety standards and so on to which these food products have been subjected.</P>
        <P>The local food markets and farmers&rsquo; markets make much sense because they are the alternative to buying food, the provenance or origins of which may not be completely clear to the consumer in supermarkets.  They are much more intimate and a direct link exists between the food&rsquo;s producer and its consumer.  Moreover, there is a possibility and opportunity for a relationship to develop whereby consumers can find out more about the food products, the food that is grown in their local area, what is in season, how the food is grown, its nutritional value and some of the benefits of different food products.  A wide range of products is on sale in farmers&rsquo; markets, including organic fruit and vegetables, home-made bread, jams and cakes, farmhouse cheeses, in which Ireland has developed a niche market, local sausages, organic meat, ham and so on.  There is great potential in this regard for consumers to educate themselves further about food, good diet, organic produce and how food is grown and developed in their local areas.</P>
        <P>As other speakers have noted, farmers&rsquo; markets revitalise market towns and bring back life to town centres.  Recently, I visited Vienna in Austria.  While one hardly would describe it as a <Col N="2083"/>town, the city centre was characterised by a wide range of street markets, which seemed to attract many people.  There was a real buzz on the main streets and I imagine the high street retailers also benefited from the number of people who obviously were attracted into the city centre by such street markets.  Farmers&rsquo; markets can also make an area much more attractive for tourism and can strengthen the local community because participating in and attending local farmers&rsquo; markets can be a highly enjoyable social occasion and it helps to retain community identity.</P>
        <P>There also are many environmental benefits associated with farmers&rsquo; markets.  They reduce wastage and result in fewer food miles because the food has not been transported for thousands of miles to get to the market.  In addition, the food sold at farmers&rsquo; markets requires less processing, packaging and preserving.  As previously noted, it educates the public.  Those who shop at farmers&rsquo; markets find out a great deal more about the products they are buying because they can discuss the food with its producer.  Farmers&rsquo; markets also encourage product diversification because they allow the stallholders and food producers to experiment with new food products and to receive direct feedback on what their consumers do or do not like.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, also noted that farmers&rsquo; markets constitute an important part of the strategy to develop food security and a much greater level of self-sufficiency in food production in Ireland.  Given the rising price of oil and the threat of climate change, this should form a key part of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&rsquo;s strategy in future and the Minister of State is working to ensure this.</P>
        <P>A couple of problem areas are linked to farmers&rsquo; markets and the development of this sector.  One has already been mentioned by previous speakers, namely, the issue of regulation.  Regulation is often seen as anathema to small food producers because it can hamper, limit and place unfair burdens on them.  However, the difficulty with poor regulation or a lack of regulation in the farmers&rsquo; market sector is the consequential absence of quality assurance or standards that people can be sure are being met.  Unfortunately, sometimes traders and food producers may be passing off their food as being home made or organic when this is not the case.  Consumers and those who frequent farmers&rsquo; markets require some form of reassurance that such produce actually is home made or organic.  This is in everyone&rsquo;s interests and those local food producers who participate in farmers&rsquo; markets and who have quality produce to sell have no difficulty with the idea of some form of quality assurance or certification system.  This also would protect genuine farmers&rsquo; markets, as some markets that describe themselves as farmers&rsquo; markets have sprung up, which more accurately should be <Col N="2084"/>described as commercial private markets instead.  The Minister of State should comment briefly on this issue and suggest how genuine and authentic farmers&rsquo; markets can be protected and a distinction made between them and the other form of private market.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also made the important point that local authorities, in supporting the development of farmers&rsquo; markets, should provide both the space for such markets &mdash; usually civic spaces in the centre of towns or villages are the most appropriate &mdash; and water and adequate power points, especially where cheeses, fish, meat and so on are being sold and chilling and ventilation facilities are required.</P>
        <P>Another issue highlighted by the Minister of State concerned the limited amount of organic produce grown in Ireland.  Some farmers&rsquo; markets have experienced a shortage of food growers and organic vegetable growers.  The greater the number of farmers&rsquo; markets that can be encouraged, the more producers will be encouraged to develop organic produce.  This route must be chosen because, as other speakers have noted, the development of Ireland as a centre of food excellence requires the development of our organic sector.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House today and I look forward to his response.</P>

	<P>I again welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  The debate this morning is timely and I congratulate the Minister of State on his initiative last week when he launched the regulations.  While it is important to have regulations, it also is important to take cognisance of the fact that Ireland must travel a long way.  In his opening remarks, the Minister of State highlighted the issue regarding the impending crisis faced by the world regarding the food we consume.  It is important that everyone buys into the concept of being traceable and accountable in respect of the food we consume and I commend the Minister of State in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also congratulate the Minister of State on setting up the meeting with the local authorities in the new year.  In her closing remarks, Senator de B&uacute;rca alluded to the importance of ensuring that casual traders or hawkers do not invade and take over farmers&rsquo; markets, which should be confined to being markets for farmers.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure this will be the case.  Were hawkers and traders to come in and take <Col N="2085"/>over, it would be wrong and would undo all the good that has been done thus far.  It is important that we have farmers&rsquo; markets.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to local delicacies, an area in which I know the Minister of State is interested.  The English Market in Cork is not strictly a farmers&rsquo; market but it is an outlet for locally produced meats, poultry, dairy products and fish.  The Faneuil Hall model in Boston has a food fair.  Perhaps the Department can examine the possibility of having the same type of market in Dublin or in other regional towns because it is important that we sell the message that home-grown, organic Irish food is second to none.  It is important that we do this.</P>
        <P>When I was growing up, my late grandmother used to supply eggs to local shops.  Traceability was not an issue and the eggs were good.  The hens were cared for almost better than ourselves.  The whole community knew from where their food was coming.  It is important that we return to that situation.  Senator Bradford referred to the green food label, to which the Minister of State is well disposed.  I appeal to him to progress this issue.</P>
        <P>Since Darina Allen started farmers&rsquo; markets, they have been a great success.  My nieces go to one with their parents and last Saturday a constituent of mine went to one to buy red cabbage for her Christmas dinner.  That is the kind of mentality that is now evident.  People are sourcing their food at these outlets which provide direct access for consumers to local, fresh food producers.  We have to market this approach and introduce a labelling system.  Members of all parties now recognise the importance of this issue.</P>
        <P>The <i>Irish Examiner</i> revealed last year that some Irish supermarkets bought onions from New Zealand.  Taste in food is important, as we all know.  The Minister of State is a gardener but I do not have green fingers.  There is an onus on the farming community and producers to produce quality foods.  There is no comparison between the fresh food we get in farmers&rsquo; markets and the produce available in supermarkets.  We need to market quality foods.  Homemade bread, cheese, organic and free range meat and other products should not be lost to this generation.  I urge the Minister of State to target schools through the civics programme or transition year modules because, as Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan stated, we must inculcate in young people the importance of proper food.  The most important thing we can do is pass on this legacy to future generations.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  This is my first opportunity to applaud him on his initiatives and the promotion of farmers&rsquo; markets.  I wish to concentrate on three issues.  The first is what the Minister of State has referred to as the local food concept, the second is regulation and the third is food labelling.</P><Col N="2086"/>
        <P>We have an excellent organic market in Athlone.  People do not want to eat processed foods.  I acknowledge the work of producers.  I am aware some bakers start baking at 2 a.m. to have fresh produce available for the following day.  A significant amount of work is involved over and above what most people realise.  Many producers also travel significant distances.  Some people come to Athlone from as far away as Ballinasloe in County Galway and from Longford.</P>
        <P>I would die rather than buy a strawberry in the middle of November.  We should not do that.  One of the best aspects of a local market is that one can buy local produce seasonally.  Perhaps the Minister of State can examine how to make people more aware of this issue.</P>
        <P>Food packaging is also reduced when one shops at a local market.  One can bring a shopping bag and not get all the glitzy plastic and cardboard packaging.  This is an important consideration in terms of waste management.  The Minister of State should encourage the use of less packaging.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to local abattoirs, as did other Senators.  My local butcher still kills animals and traceability is not an issue as we know from where the produce is coming.</P>
        <P>I tabled a motion at our local town council on the designation of an area for the farmers&rsquo; market.  However, the approach locally is haphazard.  Is it possible for the Minister of State to regulate or legislate in this area?  It may be helpful to meet with city and county managers and town clerks but more is required because the outcome is dependent on whether the individuals concerned have goodwill towards farmers&rsquo; markets, which is not always the case.  The provision of parking, lighting and water is important for farmers&rsquo; markets.  A French market comes to Athlone once a year, which is a great attraction also, and perhaps this is something on which we can expand.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said people should ask about food labelling but it is difficult for consumers to challenge producers.  Legislation on a green label is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  As I have not seen him in the House since his appointment I congratulate him and wish him well in his tenure of office.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting local and regional food.  The Department&rsquo;s Agri Vision 2015 action plan and Towards 2016 include measure in this regard.  Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has worked closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for markets, providing a guide to farmers&rsquo; markets, advice and mentoring assistance.  A comprehensive guide to selling through farmers&rsquo; markets, farm shops and box schemes will be launched this month to assist <Col N="2087"/>local producers wishing to sell their produce in their local area.</P>
        <P>It is crucial to raise awareness of the local concept.  In that regard, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in co-operation with Bord Bia, organised a series of regional food fora which took place over an 18-month period from late 2005 to early 2007.  These events brought together regional, speciality and artisan producers along with relevant State agencies.  The aim was to increase awareness of emerging market opportunities and encourage best practice in developing regional and local excellence in food.  It also provided a forum for these producers to raise issues of particular concern.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have alluded to the importance of local produce.  We are very lucky in this country that we have land available to us.  Perhaps people can be encouraged to make an effort to grow their own produce in their back gardens.  I accept we are not all expert gardeners like the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am no expert.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I grow a number of vegetables and there is a significant difference between them and what one buys in the shops.  We are fortunate in that we have very good potatoes in this country.  There is no comparison between them and the small imported potatoes with which we are sometimes presented in restaurants.  They cannot compete with the nice floury spud we are used to here and that we appreciate.</P>
        <P>I was pleased the Minister of State alluded in his contribution to the small abattoirs, which are of vital importance.  Great emphasis has rightly been placed on hygiene but I find it objectionable, especially in the case of small abattoirs operated by family butchers, that the bar has been raised so high it is stopping them killing their cattle and lambs which are sourced locally.  Some butchers in my area &mdash; Claremorris, Kiltimagh and Ballyhaunis &mdash; kill their own animals.  They display the herd number and the name of the farmer from which the beef or lamb was purchased in their shops.  That is a wonderful service because the customer knows exactly from where the animal comes.</P>
        <P>There might be less talk about imports of Brazilian beef if those small abattoirs were allowed to operate the way they operated in the past.  They killed their own animals and the quality was of the highest standard.  The best judge of that was the housewife because if she did not get what she wanted she would move to another butcher, which happened in the past.  With all the talk of hygiene and all the regulations in place, we still have little resistance &mdash; perhaps our immune systems are weak &mdash; to the many illnesses we currently face.  That was not the case when we were somewhat more liberal in our attitude to food. <Col N="2088"/> Food was always cooked very well at that time, which was an important factor.</P>
        <P>Under the Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-2013, operated by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, support for the development of farmers&rsquo; markets is included under the village renewal and development measure.  The aim of this measure is to provide appropriate small-scale infrastructure to enhance the economic and social attractiveness of villages, small towns and the surrounding countryside.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The development of farmers&rsquo; markets has received support across the country from local action groups delivering the 2000-06 Leader programmes and is provided under the new programme.  The selection process for the local action groups to deliver the Leader type measures under the new programme will commence shortly.  I understand funding to networks of producers to market, promote and advertise themselves and their markets at local level is currently provided under the Leader programme.</P>
        <P>There are now approximately 130 markets throughout the country, a number that has grown from a small base in recent years.  Bord Bia estimates that the farmers&rsquo; market system has an annual turnover of &euro;28 million and it is clear there is potential for the system to grow its share of the Irish food market in future years.  Bord Bia is to be complimented for the work it has done in promoting the markets and Irish grown food.  It has been involved with television programmes, including &ldquo;Fresh from the Farmers&rsquo; Market&rdquo; which was excellent.  I am pleased there will be a repeat of the series.</P>
        <P>If I may be parochial in the time remaining, we have a market in Claremorris, my nearest town at home, which has operated for the past number of years, and another is starting in Kiltimagh under the IRD Leader programme.  The Claremorris market has been very successful and I have no doubt the Kiltimagh market will be successful also because up to 30 years ago there was a great tradition of a market day each month where farmers sold their produce, including hay, straw and oats.  That day is gone but it would be nice to see them return with home-grown farm produce.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I am aware this concept is dear to his heart and I am sure he will give it every assistance in the coming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for the efforts he put in years ago in Clonmel when we were starting up the farmers&rsquo; market in respect of the Main Guard.  While it was not the eventual location, his considerable efforts were appreciated.</P>
        <P>We would like the farmers&rsquo; market concept to be expanded throughout the country because it gives farmers, organic and non-organic, an opportunity to sell directly to the consumer.  They get a <Col N="2089"/>better price for their produce than the supermarkets are willing to pay.  They also provide an opportunity for consumers to get a better deal, and to get keener prices for fresher produce in many cases.  Consumers can also speak directly with the suppliers and therefore traceability is not such an issue.  They provide a social outlet in many towns and villages also.  Clonmel is very lively on a Saturday morning, as is Cahir.  I welcome that and the opportunity to meet people.  I have seen some people canvassing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Never.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I would not do that.</P>
        <P>Farmers&rsquo; markets have a great potential to bring life and vibrancy into communities and that is reflected in many ways.  They provide spin-offs to other commercial activities such as restaurants and pubs and preserve money in the local economy.  That is welcome but I would not like farmers&rsquo; markets to be limited to selling only organic produce because the sub-text on the Irish Farmer Markets website reads &ldquo;organic products for you&rdquo;.  It will be a mistake if the development of farmers&rsquo; markets takes us further down that road.</P>
        <P>I would visit food markets in whatever country I visit.  There are farmers&rsquo; markets throughout Europe but they are not exclusively organic yet they are all very successful.  I check out the market in every country I visit.  I love to see the local produce and find out the way it is cooked.  The real taste of food in the locality is often a pleasure to experience.  It gives a good insight into local culture and the atmosphere is wonderful.</P>
        <P>I enjoy visiting the markets here and support them.  I shop in supermarkets as well and try to buy local food in season but recently I spoke to a baker who told me there is no requirement to indicate if the cellophane wrapper on a product has some sort of preservative on it.  That is a matter of concern to me because if it is a requirement to list the ingredients in terms of preservatives, there should also be a requirement to indicate if a preservative is sprayed on the wrapper to have an input into the freshness of the food.</P>
        <P>Organic produce is significantly more expensive than non-organic, it is sometimes 20% to 30% more expensive.  That cannot be justified because consumers are being ripped off with that level of premium.  Organic food is wonderful.  It has a different taste.  It is easy to differentiate between a battery produced egg and a free range organic egg although a survey indicated one could not tell the difference between organic and non-organic carrots.  Free range organic chicken, which I buy occasionally, is expensive but worth the cost because one knows what one is getting.</P>
        <P>A guest chef on the television programme &ldquo;The Restaurant&rdquo; went out of her way to select free range organic chicken for her chosen chicken dish but Tom Doorley, the well-known food critic, <Col N="2090"/>suggested she would have improved her dish if she had not done that.  With the right cook, animals properly killed and properly grown, stored and cooked food of whatever origin, be it organic or non-organic, will provide delicious results on the plate.  Women, of course, are experts in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not argue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no risks from non-organic food, and perhaps only marginal benefits, if the proper procedures are followed.  If research should establish, and it has not yet been done, that there is a more beneficial nutrient in organic carrots than in regular carrots, for example, what will we do?  Everyone does not eat the same amount of carrots and therefore quantity of intake is also a factor.  Nutrients can be picked up from numerous origins &mdash; it is about the overall dietary intake of nutrients &mdash; but obesity is becoming endemic.  I recall going into Clonmel High School to talk to the boys about diet, exercise and healthy living.  It had quite an impact.  I advised them that instead of having a breakfast roll at lunch time, they should try fresh meat or salad produce.  The shopkeeper who supplied the breakfast rolls was not too pleased.</P>
        <P>What safeguards or controls are in place?  Can anybody remember when the character Dinny Byrne in &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; decorated the eggs with straw?  That type of thing occurs and we must monitor it.  The product might not always be as fresh as is claimed.  There must be greater controls to protect the organic consumer.  There is no such thing as bad food.  In a properly regulated environment all food should be safe for human consumption.  Food is good.  The key to healthy living will always be a balanced diet with due attention to the need for exercise.</P>
        <P>I am in favour of farmers&rsquo; markets.  The more there are, the better.  Every encouragement should be given to their development, and work is being done in that regard by bodies such as Bord Bia, the Leader programme and various Departments.  Most of the work locally, however, is carried out on promotion and that is done almost entirely through voluntary effort at local level.  We cannot undervalue the level of voluntary effort being made throughout the country.  It is to be lauded and applauded.  Some form of direct support should be made available to the people organising the markets for advertising through the local media.  It would be a great assistance to them, even though there is usually great awareness among local people of when the markets are being held.</P>
        <P>We should expand the markets but not make them elitist.  In addition, they should not only be for organic produce.  Consumers should be able to make their choice.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In a debate on the merits of farmers&rsquo; markets one is unlikely to hear anyone across the political divide disagree that the markets have substantial merits.  The arguments in this regard have been made by other Senators.  The key issue is that small farmers in this country are under serious financial pressure.  Many of their farms are not viable.  The markets facilitate direct contact between them and the buyer, cutting out the middle man.  I had a conversation recently with a farmer from north Dublin.  He was told by a large supermarket chain that he would have to grow, pick and deliver his heads of lettuce for 40 cent per head.  If he could not do that, the supermarket chain said it would import the produce from abroad.  The heads of lettuce were being sold in the supermarket for &euro;1.60.  If there was a national chain of farmers&rsquo; markets, as Senator de B&uacute;rca mentioned, that farmer, who is obviously struggling to provide quality produce at that price, would be able to ensure his livelihood and the viability of his farm.</P>
        <P>I am glad there are farmers&rsquo; markets operating in the north west.  Indeed, the most recent one to start operating in Donegal town is a cross-Border initiative between the Strabane farmers&rsquo; market and farmers in the Donegal town electoral area.  They started this excellent initiative by setting up the farmers&rsquo; market in The Diamond and it has gone from strength to strength.  They told me about the difficulties they encountered when they were preparing to embark on this process more than a year ago.  There were difficulties with the local authorities, with getting funding and with different officials about the site and the arrangements that had to be put in place for car parking and so forth.</P>
        <P>We need a properly planned, systematic approach to facilitating farmers&rsquo; markets throughout the island.  It must become easier for people to embark on this process.  I have spoken to the people who sell their produce at the market and many of them would never have dreamed a number of years ago that they would be able to grow their own produce and sell it to their neighbours and the tourists who come to the town.  It was owing to the persistence of a number of individuals who saw the benefits of farmers&rsquo; markets for the local economy and for the consumer in terms of the availability of fresh produce and its nutritional content.</P>
        <P>The markets are also a benefit to the environment.  If there was a national network of farm<Col N="2092"/>ers&rsquo; markets, the produce grown on local farms would only have to be transported a short distance to reach the consumer.  Otherwise, the produce is transported large distances which has a negative impact in terms of carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s experience in this area, I have no doubt he will take this issue seriously.  I urge him to provide more incentives and more education on the benefits of farmers&rsquo; markets.  I hope this debate is a starting point in that regard.  He should also try to make it simpler for those who wish to embark on the process of starting a farmers&rsquo; market.  Funding must be provided.  There is a certain amount of funding from various schemes but there should be additional funding.  I have visited a number of farmers&rsquo; markets and the participants are still raising funds to provide basic facilities such as overhead canopies and the like.  Farmers who are growing produce should not have to concentrate on that or the other difficulties for farmers&rsquo; markets but on the quality of their produce.</P>
        <P>Another issue is the fact that there are different regulations in the North and South.  Perhaps the Minister would try to harmonise them on both sides of the Border.  I am sure he will get the full co-operation of the agriculture Minister in the North in that regard.</P>

	<P>One of my favourite stalls in the farmers&rsquo; markets is the one selling olives.  Clearly, olives have not been grown in Kerry for some time.  Where does that fit in with the concept of farmers&rsquo; markets being an outlet for local produce?  My second question is probably more appropriate for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  I have been a member of a town council for the last 25 years and the council has jealously guarded the rights of people to trade in Listowel under the Casual Trading Act.  We understood there was protection for the town under that Act.  I have a suspicion, however, that the Casual Trading Act has been undermined to some extent by the advent of farmers&rsquo; markets.  There was a move in the Department to revive old markets, whereby markets that had not died out for more than ten years or so could be reactivated.  We were fearful this would lead to a free-for-all and that anybody could come into the town selling blankets and God knows what.  Will the Minister of State consult the Minister on that issue?</P>

        <P>I will answer the specific questions asked by Senators and then I will deal with other questions raised in a more general way.  I will try to do justice to these questions while not keeping anyone too long.  I could talk about this for much longer than I have time to, so I will try to curtail what I have to say in the interests of practicality.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned the so-called olive factor.  This is something which has led to a certain amount of cynicism about the term &ldquo;farmers&rsquo; market&rdquo; and suggests that it is being very loosely interpreted in certain areas, almost to the point of being meaningless.  With that in mind, I have asked my officials, whom I thank for being here today, to contact with the UK body FARMA when organising the forum with the local authorities in January.  This body has about ten years&rsquo; experience in organising farmers&rsquo; markets in the interests of local producers and local consumers, thereby ensuring development of the local food economy.</P>
        <P>Depending on the circumstances of each area &mdash; there is no template that fits every area &mdash; a radius is defined around each market and producers from that area sell their products.  I am not sure whether the defined area in this country will include the 32 counties or will be more local, but we will have to consider this based on the reality.  In the UK, the radius is often 30 miles.  That allows for a certain amount of scope for producers to attend different markets whose areas overlap, but it also means that markets are clearly defined as indigenous markets which are distinctive and reflect the character of their areas &mdash; the smells, the tastes, the products and the personalities.  This will certainly address the olive factor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Casual Trading Act was mentioned.  As an Opposition Deputy I was very aware of the need to avoid a loss of historic trading rights because they are, in many ways, the basis of our market towns and the culture of food production.  Many of these rights are now preserved because they were exercised before the 1 May deadline.  It is for the local authorities to consider maturely how they can balance the needs of retailers &mdash; which are critical, as I will be the first to admit, because they are the people paying the rates, without which our local authorities would be very impoverished &mdash; with those of the markets.  There are many local factors which are not addressed by retailers.  There can be a synergy between farmers&rsquo; markets and the wider retail sector.</P>
        <P>I will address Senator McFadden&rsquo;s question in the more general part of my remarks because the <Col N="2094"/>area of regulations is quite large.  That is why I am consulting various bodies to ensure we get the balance right so that we can introduce necessary legislation without making it too onerous.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators Bradford, O&rsquo;Sullivan and others who mentioned the important issue, in which I am interested, of the need to ensure our producers are not disadvantaged by imports that can avoid the rigorous regulations to which we must adhere.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is dealing with this today.  I do not want to double up on work being done by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, as she is the person attending the Council of Ministers and dealing most directly with the Commission.  I hope she is impressing upon the Commission the need for our beef industry, in particular, to be given fair treatment and not disadvantaged.  I realise there is a parallel process and as Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan said, it is to be hoped our timetables will not conflict in this way next time.  This is an important issue which is different from that being dealt with at the committee and is valid in its own right.  I take the points that were made.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast mentioned that not all farmers&rsquo; markets must be organic.  I made that clear in my statement.  They are not exclusively organic or non-organic.  There are different stall holders with products which may or may not be organic.  That is the diversity which adds to the attractiveness of farmers&rsquo; markets.  It is not a one-size-fits-all solution.</P>
        <P>I accept Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point about a green labelling system.  There is much debate in the EU about labelling.  There are certain regulations that require, for example, that State money is not used to promote a Guaranteed Irish-type scheme.  We might argue about this or disagree with it but it is unfortunately the legal situation.  Private money can be used for such a scheme and for this reason the Restaurants Association of Ireland and other bodies provide labels that refer to produce as coming from Ireland.  We encourage this but we cannot use taxpayers&rsquo; money in a way that would be breaking the law.  I will refer to this again later as other Senators referred to it as well.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the balance between markets and the retail sector.  In this country the balance is very much in favour of the retail sector for food.  Of all fresh produce sold, 80% is through the large multiples.  That is a disproportionately large percentage compared with other European countries.  It is evident to anyone who has visited Italy or France that the market culture there is well established.  In the case of France, it goes back to Napoleonic times.  Markets are large movers of food and not a small element of the overall market as in this country.  Thus, there is room for more selling through local shops and markets while maintaining a vibrant retail sector, especially large supermarkets.  In France and Italy supermarket chains such as <Col N="2095"/>Coop Italia, Carrefour and Monoprix manage to co-exist with a vibrant market culture.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to abattoirs, as did Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who wants a system of State abattoirs.  I mentioned EU regulations before, but we must take cognisance of the potential as well as the limitations of the rules under which we operate as an EU member state.  At the moment I am considering ways of supporting local abattoir development in a practical way and ensuring abattoirs are viable.  It is quite costly to establish an abattoir.  I recently visited one in Wexford and in discussions with the owner we reckoned the cost of getting one up and running was &euro;250,000.  One would need to have a guaranteed throughput, long-term viability, and a friendly bank manager.  The realities for local abattoirs require us to put our thoughts together to ensure their continued viability and the broadening of their networks.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the situation referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I recently visited a farm in my constituency at which harvesting was in full swing.  Its 180 acres of sprouts were to be harvested before Christmas, the main time of year at which sprouts are sold, but there was a great deal of waste because the vegetable&rsquo;s size was specified.  It could not be too large or too small and it needed to be the right colour.  If it was too white, it was rejected.  These specifications come not from Brussels but from the large multiples, which are of the researched opinion that consumers buy a product only if it is a certain colour and size.  The multiples&rsquo; requirements are so narrow that there is a significant amount of wastage.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, therein lies the potential for the local market.</P>
        <P>Food habits change, as witnessed in respect of potatoes, to which Senator Carty referred in a nostalgic fashion.  The market for what were reject potatoes but that are now called, affectionately and successfully, &ldquo;baby potatoes&rdquo; has grown considerably and quickly.  We reject the sweetest and most attractive size of sprouts, namely, the sprouts at the top of the stems.  They and those at the bottom go to waste while the perfectly correct sizes in the middle of the stems are sold.  One grows a three foot tall plant, but the only marketable part is a certain amount in the middle.  In many ways, this is a reflection on the marketing to which consumers respond by buying products as if they are the only ones available.</P>
        <P>The market has significant potential to test whether a product rejected because of its appearance can be sold.  Sometimes, the reject looks better, but that is a matter of opinion.  The same is the case in respect of onions.  A farmer in my constituency ploughed a large tonnage of onions because of sizes the supermarkets did not want.  Good food could have been sold in the local market.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated that we have one type of butter.  It is ironic that, given his pride in the <Col N="2096"/>Kingdom, Kerrygold is the dominant brand in the international butter market and has been successful thanks to the Irish Dairy Board and the producers.  Ireland does not produce any organic butter, however, which is a large gap in the market.  If anyone knows someone who has tried it, he or she should let me know.  I would be the first to agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the diversity of cultures in Ireland allows for significant potential in terms of local dishes.  Producer groups will be an important part of farming and I am working in respect of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to Brazilian beef and local brands.  Instead of patriotism, this should be a question of different products.  To use the car analogy, people do not buy the cheapest car.  They buy a particular advertised product because it is different.  Sometimes, it is far from being the cheapest car, but it can be successful.  Our beef must be differentiated from Brazilian beef in the same way as a car must be distinguishable in many ways other than by its Irish origin.  The Senator referred to the farm adviser addressing the Department and local authorities.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point on Cork and the Munster region, I am familiar with the English Market, which is a good and successful model for large cities and towns.  While a weekly market is often appropriate to a medium or small town, a six-day market would be possible in Galway, Dublin or Cork.  It is horses for courses and it is important we recognise that one size does not fit all.  I dispute the Senator&rsquo;s claim that he does not have green fingers because everyone can grow.  It is a question of giving it a go, which is what I did.</P>
        <P>He referred to schools, but I do not want to address that matter in detail because it is a significant issue.  I will introduce food-growing kits in schools next year as part of the United Nations international year of the potato.  I want schools to be aware of and experience Ireland&rsquo;s tradition in growing potatoes.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden discussed the Athlone organic market, but I am not sure it is entirely organic.  I hope stall holders distinguish clearly between which of them are organic and non-organic, which is the way it should be.  The Senator said the food came from Galway and Ballinasloe, indicating the kind of radius that must be taken into account if we are not to be exclusionary or impractical when discussing regulations.</P>
        <P>I have been working on the seasonal issue.  Every month, I publish a press release emphasising the particular seasonality of food.  While it is essential for our growers, some people do not believe it is important, but I am glad Senator McFadden does.  Austria, France and Italy are as proud and cognisant of their food seasons as we are of Christmas, Easter and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  There are pumpkin, goose and asparagus seasons and one is considered odd if one looks for asparagus outside that time.</P><Col N="2097"/>
        <P>Senator Carty referred to Claremorris and Ballyhaunis.  While I know they are markets, they are not listed on the farmers&rsquo; market list.  Senator Carty and I can discuss the issue with Bord Bia to ensure an up-to-date list of available markets.</P>
        <P>I know Senator Prendergast from my dealings with farmers&rsquo; markets in Clonmel.  She referred to free range and organic, but it is important to bear in mind that they are not the same.  There are different regulations.  Antibiotics can be used in free range produce, for example, but not in organic produce.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go raibh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Dochartaigh ag labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; i dT&iacute;r Conaill an tseachtain seo caite.  C&eacute; go bhfuil g&aacute; le f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht, caithfear an fh&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair a aithint freisin.  T&aacute; liosta de marga&iacute; feirme ar an su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;on at&aacute; ag Bord Bia.  Is fi&uacute; go m&oacute;r an liosta sin.  Aonta&iacute;m go gcaithfimid cur le sin.</P>
        <P>The support I want to give to farmers&rsquo; markets is intended to help local authorities in whatever way we can.  The Department is considering putting up finger signposts, ensuring canopies are available and providing for the infrastructure to make markets viable, as is the case in other countries.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt leis an Aire talmha&iacute;ochta &oacute; Thuaidh, Michelle Gildernew, mar a bh&iacute; m&eacute; cheana, mar gheall ar na forbairt&iacute; ar an d&aacute; thaobh den Teorainn.  Beimid ag dul ar aghaidh le sin &oacute; Thuaidh agus &oacute; Theas, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.</P>
        <P>I will conclude because the debate is drawing to a close.  In the wider context and from speaking with business owners and communities, there is no doubt that farmers&rsquo; markets have a notable positive effect on local businesses and communities.  Recent research has shown that every &euro;10 spent at a farmers&rsquo; market results in a net income of &euro;24 for the local community.  There is a spin-off for the local communities and retailers as a result of money being spent at farmers&rsquo; markets.  It has been estimated that the trade for other businesses increases by up to 30% when a farmers&rsquo; market is run in a town.</P>
        <P>The artisan food market has become busy.  The specialties sector, including organics, is growing at 10% per annum fuelled by consumers seeking variety, well-being, provenance and taste.  Consumer protection and confidence are essential elements in the development of farmers&rsquo; markets and other direct selling routes.</P>
        <P>The time for taking stock of the sector has come.  It has developed to a point but has not had the benefit of official endorsement.  It has developed in an inconsistent fashion.  As Darina Allen said at a recent conference, in some local authority areas farmers&rsquo; markets are funded; in others, they are fined.  These inconsistencies must be addressed.  I will be mindful of this debate when discussing the matter with local authorities.  I will make the Official Report of this debate available for county and city managers, mayors and cathaoirligh of local authorities to show them <Col N="2098"/>there is a democratic mandate and the Oireachtas has an interest in the development of farmers&rsquo; markets at local level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; a labhair ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  I am pleased to apprise the Seanad of the current status of the implementation of water quality improvement plans under the rural water programme of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The rural water programme is an integral part of the water services investment programme.  It has put in place a large number of new water and sewerage scheme in our cities and towns in recent years.  The focus of the rural water programme is on improving the quality and efficiency of water services for the 1.5 million people who live outside main urban areas.</P>
        <P>This year, a record &euro;142 million has been provided for the rural water programme, reflecting a major programme of upgrading works.  It is now being progressed to bring the quality of group water schemes into compliance with required standards.  Under the previous national development plan, more than &euro;575 million was spent on the upgrading of quality deficient group water schemes.  The new national development plan is set to continue this high level of investment, with a further &euro;850 million for the rural water sector.</P>
        <P>One primary objective of the rural water programme is to provide all group water schemes with a quality, treated water supply.  The priority is to deal as soon as possible with all schemes falling within the remit of the drinking water EU directive.  These are schemes serving 50 or more persons or schemes with a commercial element.</P>
        <P>In 1997, the administration of the various measures under the rural water programme was devolved to the local authorities.  Responsibility for the selection and approval of schemes, and payment of grants, rests with county councils.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government retains overall responsibility for policy matters.  The funding for the programme comes from the Exchequer through annual block grants allocated to councils by the Department.  The individual allocations reflect the level of activity locally and are based on work programmes submitted by councils.</P>
        <P>The programme is being implemented in a spirit of partnership and co-operation between the main stakeholders which includes the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, rural organisations such as the IFA, ICMSA and ICA, local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>To understand the scale and complexity of the water quality issue in rural areas it is important to have an appreciation of the scale of the group <Col N="2099"/>schemes sector and of the services provided.  According to the 2006 census, there are more than 5,500 group water schemes, serving around 173,000 households.  The majority of group water schemes, more than 3,700, vary in size from two to 15 houses and are not subject to the drinking water regulations.</P>
        <P>Some 1,800 schemes have been identified as falling within the remit of the drinking water regulations on the basis they serve more than 50 people or supply a commercial operation.  Some 728 of these schemes have their own private water source.  The remainder obtain their supply of treated water through the local authority public supply networks.  Water quality in these schemes is generally satisfactory and on a par with that of the parent scheme.</P>
        <P>Water quality problems are mainly experienced by group water schemes dependent on private sources such as rivers, lakes and boreholes and have no proper water treatment and disinfection equipment in place.  In 2002, Ireland was found by the European Court of Justice to be in breach of its obligations under the drinking water directive by failing to ensure compliance with drinking water quality standards in group water schemes and a considerable number of smaller public schemes, on the basis they exceeded the bacteriological parameters of the directive for drinking water.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the national rural water monitoring committee compiled an action plan setting out a strategy for upgrading the group water schemes falling within the remit of the drinking water directive.  The target was to bring all relevant schemes into compliance.  The plan has been instrumental in focussing the targets of the rural water programme and achieving the objective of improved water quality for rural schemes.</P>
        <P>The 728 privately sourced group water schemes that fall within the remit of the drinking water regulations serve more than 88,000 domestic connections.  Under the national rural water monitoring committee&rsquo;s action plan, upgrading solutions to ensure compliance with the drinking water directive have now been identified for all 728 schemes.  The figures involved will demonstrate to the House the extend of the response required.</P>
        <P>Up to 224 group water schemes are being provided with water treatment facilities through bundled design, build, operate contracts.  Up to 34 schemes will receive stand-alone water treatment facilities.  Some 104 quality deficient group water schemes are being taken into public charge by county councils.  Some 99 schemes will decommission poor quality sources of supply and take new connections from local authority public water supply networks.  Up to 170 will have disinfection-sterilisation facilities provided while 97 schemes have been absorbed into the public network by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>The current status of the upgrading programme is that 72%, 525 schemes, serving 80%, 70,248, of <Col N="2100"/>domestic connections will be completed by end of 2007.  Work on a further 56 schemes is under way and 103 schemes at the advanced planning stage, likely to commence construction early in 2008.  The remaining 44 schemes are at various stages in planning with construction expected to commence by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>Through the policy of rationalisation and amalgamation of smaller group water schemes, particularly in counties Galway and Mayo, where almost 40% of the identified group water schemes are located, substantial cost and operational efficiencies have been achieved.  In tackling the deficiencies in rural drinking water supplies, we have not only concentrated on infrastructural investment in group water schemes but adopted a holistic approach by continuing and intensifying numerous measures to strengthen the sustainability, delivery and management of water services in general.</P>
        <P>In the delivery of the programme all stakeholders are agreed that the provision of costly water treatment projects for group water schemes without complementary actions to prevent pollution of the source is unsustainable.</P>
        <P>To this end several source protection pilot projects to protect vulnerable group water scheme sources from the threat of pollution from agriculture, commercial activity and septic tanks are being implemented.  The intention is that lessons learned from the pilot projects will allow workable and sustainable solutions to be adopted for preventing source contamination and will inform future policy on source protection for group schemes nationally.</P>
        <P>A range of new, small scale wastewater collection and treatment systems as a means of meeting the requirements of small rural communities are being tested.  The hope is that these alternative collection and treatment systems will prove appropriate for use in small rural communities with low population density and site specific environmental conditions, such as shallow bedrock, high ground-water conditions and limited effluent discharge locations.  As part of the same pilot process, the potential for a greater role for group sewerage schemes will be also examined.  We have committed to a review of the group sewerage scheme grants when the results of the pilot schemes are available by the middle of next year.</P>
        <P>To help develop the skills of the group schemes personnel to meet the challenges of delivering consistently high quality water to consumers and effectively managing the operations and finances of their schemes, the remit of the water services national training group now includes training and development for the group water scheme sector.  Management development programmes have been devised specifically for group water schemes with the objective of providing group scheme managers and committees with the capacity to respond to a rapidly evolving water services industry.  It also aims to allow them to manage <Col N="2101"/>and operate schemes in an atmosphere of greater regulation, coupled with increased consumer demands for higher levels of service.</P>
        <P>Under the Water Services Act 2007, provision is made for the introduction of a licensing system to regulate and develop the operations of the group water sector.  The Department consulted widely with the group scheme movement when the Act was being drafted and the sector has given its support to the introduction of licensing.  The licensing regime will put groups on a much more organised footing and will help to secure the long-term viability of those community water schemes that have served well over the past 40 years.</P>
        <P>Overall, therefore, the picture is a positive one. The rural water programme provides a structured and focussed approach to the upgrading and renewal of rural water supply systems, which has, as a core objective, the improvement of water quality in private group water schemes.  The programme is backed by unprecedented levels of Exchequer spending which has facilitated remarkable progress in the past four years in bringing the water supplied by group schemes into line with European standards.  We are now in the position of having improvement works completed and in place for the majority of substandard schemes.  We can look forward to completing the task in 2008 when the group schemes sector will be able to report full compliance with EU regulatory requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I assume that we are discussing not only water provision by group schemes but also public water provision.  I salute the pioneers who put the rural water schemes in place between the 1960s and 1980s.  They were great volunteers and this was the most radical improvement in people&rsquo;s lifestyles after rural electrification.  Those people followed the spirit of the co-operative movement inspired by Horace Plunkett.  The challenge for community activists now is to provide broadband in rural areas.  </P>
        <P>There are at least 45,000 families connected to a group scheme with a private source &mdash; although the Minister of State cited up to 50,000.  Ireland must achieve good water status by 2015 as set out in the Water Framework Directive.  Section 4(1) of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 contains our phosphorus regulations.</P>
        <P>According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s recent report, 70.2% of Irish rivers have a satisfactory water quality and the level of serious pollution continues to be low; 83.8% of our lakes have a satisfactory water quality &mdash; although some people put that figure as high as 90%.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson must share my pride in Lough Sheelin in our area, County Cavan, which is one of the best brown trout angling lakes in Europe.  A local monitoring committee, set up under the auspices of the county council with community <Col N="2102"/>involvement, including farmers, has brought it to a high standard.  I hope that bit of parochialism is allowed in the midst of a national debate.</P>
        <P>There is an increasing trend in the number of ground water samples showing zero contamination which is good news.  To meet EU water standards we must use proper filtration systems against continuing threats.  We need to protect our water supply proactively by minimising the risk of contamination of supplies caused by runs from septic tanks, slurry pits and all industrial and local authority outlets.  There should be a faster reaction time when problems occur.  People should not have to boil drinking water for any length of time.</P>
        <P>City and county councils are responsible for the provision of water services and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has an overall policy and funding role.  County councils provide direct grant aid for rural water schemes which is implemented in partnership with national and local monitoring committees.  This partnership model of delivery, combining the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, rural organisations, local authorities and the Department is important because it gives people a sense of ownership.  In my county, 35% of the population depends on group schemes.  From the beginning through the good auspices and fine initiatives of Cavan County Council we have pioneered an inclusive decision-making process, integrating the various sectors on the local county monitoring committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, of a special package of &euro;5.8 million for water schemes which were at risk of pollution by e-coli and cryptosporidium.  Farmers are making an input under the nitrates directive to which it is difficult to adhere but farm waste management grants help them to meet that responsibility.  People can never underestimate the loyalty of farmers to their communities and their commitment to the environment.  There has been a mistaken assumption that farmers would be less than proactive in protecting the environment but nobody has a greater vested interest in it.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set up a specialist group in his Department to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities in identifying vulnerable supplies and dealing actively with them.</P>
        <P>Each county must provide a strategic rural water plan which feeds into the national monitoring committee.  Local authorities are expected to supervise the provision of good quality water but they do not receive the proper resources from central government for that role which adversely affects their finances.</P>
        <P>The thrust of planning policy is to acknowledge the one-off house but also to develop small towns and villages.  However, there is a cap of &euro;10,000 in grant aid per house, in a new development, towards the provision of water and sewerage <Col N="2103"/>services which has serious implications for planning and development in rural areas.  For example, if a village were to extend by 20 houses, a new public water supply would cost approximately &euro;800,000 and maybe more for a sewerage scheme.  If only &euro;10,000 per house is available in grant aid the local authority would realise only &euro;200,000, leaving a shortfall of &euro;600,000 to be raised through development charges and local taxation or by way of a punitive tax on the householders which they could not pay.  This will thwart the development of small towns and villages and threatens proper planning.  It is at variance with a policy that seeks to limit one-off rural dwellings and encourage the expansion of towns and villages.  County managers and officials have been lobbying the Department to amend this policy.  Ordinary people cannot take the brunt of this and absorb the greater charges.  The Government will have to properly fund this area and provide water to small towns and villages.  I would like a specific response on this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently raised on the Adjournment the issue of group sewerage scheme grants being raised to the level of group water scheme grants and am delighted to see this matter before the House.  The Minister of State mentioned this in his contribution, a pilot project has been conducted and a valuation completed but I am sorry that it will be some months before it is accepted because a better grant for group sewerage schemes would mean a better uptake.  If it takes six months to be accepted it will be even longer before people complete their applications.  If the grant is to be improved we should make those who could apply as part of a group sewerage scheme aware of this fact in the interim so they can consider their applications.  In this way applications will be ready for submission by the time the scheme is improved, which will limit time lag.</P>
        <P>I commend the plans to improve water quality under the rural water programme.  The programme contains measures to address deficiencies in group water schemes, small public water and sewerage schemes and private supplies where no other supply is available.  I echo the comments of others regarding the people who have volunteered their time to this programme around the country.  There is a great sense of ownership that has almost reached the point that people do not want to return groups schemes to councils because they feel they can do a better job.  The programme is essential to our goal of ensuring the highest quality of water in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the 2007 rural water programme was on measures to eliminate water quality deficiencies in group water schemes with private sources.  I know from personal experience interacting with people in Donegal that this is working.  These schemes have been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as <Col N="2104"/>failing to meet mandatory drinking water standards.  Water is a fundamental part of our lives and we should expect highly competent water systems with standards on a par with EU drinking water standards.  I spent a year in Nigeria and understand the difficulties a lack of drinking water can present.  Galway has recently experienced serious problems in this regard that forced people to boil, cool and filter water.</P>
        <P>The basic requirement for water quality is first and foremost the existence of safe drinking water standards.  Some 41% of total programme funding has been allocated to alleviate these water quality deficiencies and this highlights the direct approach of the programme to raising standards in water quality deficiencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report Water Quality in Ireland 2006, published by the EPA, stresses the need for improvement in water quality.  The challenge we face is to have all waters, both surface and groundwater, in good or higher status by 2015 under the water framework directive, WFD, 2000/60/EC.  I am glad the EU is acting as big brother on standards and, while I appreciate Ireland does not need this approach, it is important that standards exist because they encourage people to strive for them.  In my home town there is neither a sewerage scheme nor a water supply and I am delighted that the EU directives ensure towns with a population of more than 1,500 must meet certain standards.  This will drive the advancement of water and sewerage in my area.</P>
        <P>The recorded annual incremental improvement in surface water quality, based on that occurring between 2005 and 2006 and for the three year period since 2004, would, if maintained, leave Ireland potentially falling short of the water framework directive target in the time left for remediation.  A recent study concluded that if current land uses continue unchanged, it will be very difficult to meet the demands of the water framework directive.</P>
        <P>In March 2007 a &euro;142 million spending plan on rural water supplies was announced, surpassing the 2006 figure by 9% and representing an investment in rural water 12 times greater than that of 1997.  In 2007 the rural water treatment programme financed the completion of new water treatment plants for 77 schemes serving 16,200 households nationally.  These, along with other recently finished schemes, will solve water quality issues for more than 30,000 rural households that can now look forward to having in place first rate water supplies.</P>
        <P>Start-up funding is provided in the programme for 35 new treatment plants<b> </b>that will accommodate 10,400 households in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon as part of a merger of more than 100 group schemes in the west and north west.  Funding has been also allocated under this year&rsquo;s programme to allow 196 group water schemes, serving more than 16,000 houses, to be taken over by county councils.  A further 35 schemes, serving up to 4,400 houses, have been provided to secure <Col N="2105"/>new connections from local authority public water supply networks.  Such water schemes represent the serious commitment of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to aid a unified effort to meet water quality standards.</P>
        <P>The increased expenditure allocations for the rural water programme, funded under the national development plan, NDP, this year mark a progressive step in the area of water quality in Ireland.  Expenditure allocations for new water treatment plants for group schemes with private sources is up &euro;6 million compared to the 2006 figure.  Financial allocations to 196 group water schemes being taken over by local authorities have increased by 46% on last year.  I commend the councils on the tremendous work they are doing in this regard.</P>
        <P>The most recent European Environment Agency report in 2005 stated, regarding Ireland&rsquo;s perspective on water quality, that &ldquo;eutrophication of rivers, lakes and tidal waters continues to be the main threat to surface waters with agricultural run-off and municipal discharges being the key contributors&rdquo;.  The EPA&rsquo;s report on water quality, published this year, echoes these sentiments and highlights the problem of eutrophication of waters and the urgent need to address the issue.  In 2006 there were 34 reported fish kills compared to 45 the previous year.  This annual rate, albeit reduced compared to some previous years, is unacceptably high as each fish kill represents catastrophic environmental disturbance to aquatic life.  The consequence of poor water quality is such disturbance to aquatic life and greatly affects the wider community.  It is not only run-off, however, that pollutes rivers and the Foyle is an example of this.  Raw sewage is still entering the Foyle, the matter is not being progressed and this must end.  River pollution from agricultural sources, whether deliberate or accidental, is being addressed and perpetrators are being penalised under the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme, REPS.  However, we must ensure we continue with this programme and deliver these schemes even when a council, local authority or the national Government presides over the pumping of raw sewage into rivers.</P>

	<P>Approximately 25% of groundwater locations exceeded the mean guide nitrate concentration for drinking water, an increase of 2% from the previous reporting period 2001-03, with 2% breaching the mandatory limit, the same proportion as in the previous reporting period.  Breaches of drinking water standards pose great dangers to the public.  Regulation of nitrate levels in drinking water is necessary as excess levels can cause conditions such as methemoglobinemia in young children.</P>

        <P>Quality in 69 water bodies from 21 estuarine and coastal areas from 2002 to 2006 showed that two, or 2.9%, were potentially eutrophic and 13, or 18.8%, were eutrophic.  Eutrophication is a major threat to an aquatic environment and if ignored can lead to decreased number of species and biodiversity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The implications of failing to meet standards and targets in water quality should never be realised.  This system of incentives encourages universal participation in improving water quality and simplifies the process of meeting EU targets.  It is not good to blame particular individuals or groups because we all share the responsibility to ensure the highest quality of water in rural areas.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association, and local authorities must continue to work together as the main stakeholders of the rural water programme to ensure water quality standards continue to be met. I wish the Department, its officials and local councils well in the huge job ahead.</P>

        <P>I congratulate all who are involved in group water and sewerage schemes, which not only provide a basic service but offer benefits for the environment.  None of us can survive without clean water.  It is difficult to explain how, in 2007, there are people who cannot avail of such basic services.  The ongoing work in this area will ensure access for all to water that is fit to consume.  This is important for us and for river and marine life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall avoid the trap into which my learned colleague, Senator Keaveney, fell in trying to pronounce the names of some of the contaminants that have featured in this discussion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, who is my fellow countywoman.  This is an important debate.  Water quality has come to the fore of late given recent events in Ennis, Galway and elsewhere, thus ensuring it received more publicity than might otherwise have been the case.</P>
        <P>It is important our water is clear of the various types of micro-organisms and parasites that have featured in contamination outbreaks.  Many factors can affect water quality.  Water treatment <Col N="2107"/>schemes may struggle to deal with factors such as heavy rainfall, drought, soil type, topography and so on.  Residential development and agricultural activities can also be a factor.  There can even be cases where it is a question of the breakdown of electricity supply.  In some instances, there is a lack of consistency in the cleaning process.</P>
        <P>The quality of water in private group schemes, in particular, is a serious concern.  The European Commission has given the Government its final warning in terms of ensuring water quality.  There has been a high level of contamination, arising in many cases as a consequence of leaks, many of which have not been rectified.  The Health Service Executive has carried out testing at various intervals but this seems to be inadequate.</P>
        <P>Farmers are frequently blamed for water contamination as a result of the leakage of raw sewage.  There has been much publicity of such incidents and it is the easy option when pointing the finger.  There are undoubtedly instances of such pollution but the scale of contamination from this source has declined in recent years.  This is a welcome development.  I welcome the provision of grants under the farming waste management programme.  Contamination by raw sewage is the most visible source of contamination and the one that is most publicised.  However, it is not necessarily the main source of pollution.</P>
        <P>In the case of private wells, owners are responsible for monitoring their own water supply.  If they require an analysis of the water quality, they must contact the environmental health section of the HSE.  It is unclear, however, how many do so.  Given the changes taking place in the environment, it is something to which people should give more consideration.</P>
        <P>The various types of infections that have arisen are more likely to affect those with the weakest immune systems.  I welcome the substantial funding that has been allocated in recent years.  This level of funding is essential.  The figure allocated under the national development plan is &euro;850 million.  Is there are any possibility that the provision of this funding could be brought forward?  This is vital not only in the interest of public health but also with a view to meeting EU requirements.</P>
        <P>The tendering process for group water and sewerage schemes may allow for some economies of scale through the provision of group contracts.  Various types of contracts are being granted and I urge that efforts be made to ensure the schemes can be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State update the House on the roll-out of septic tank effluent drainage, STED, systems.  I seek an update on the pilot scheme in our county.  I see the departmental officials are seeking out that information.  The more efficient and high-quality the systems of water supply and sewerage, the greater the benefit for us into the future.  We must examine how waste water collection and treatment is managed in other countries.  The treatments employed <Col N="2108"/>in the Nordic countries, for instance, are especially interesting.</P>
        <P>The HSE tests water quality in public group water schemes annually.  There is a case for an increased frequency of testing, especially where there is a track record of contamination.  In such instances, testing should be repeated over a period until there can be confidence that the water is of adequate purity.</P>
        <P>The EU directive on drinking water governs our position in this area.  This directive established strict guidelines for the maximum level of contaminants allowed in a water supply.  However, not all these contaminants are monitored regularly.  I understand testing is carried out for the presence of eight to 14 of them.  I am concerned that the presence of other contaminants may be going undetected.  Are there any plans to update the testing system?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have seen from events in Galway and Ennis that water contamination has a major impact.  It is awful for people to have to manage without water.  Contamination of the water supply also has a significant impact on rural tourism.  The Government is committed to the promotion of rural tourism, although as spokesperson on tourism, I have particular concerns about spatial and regional development.</P>
        <P>I compliment John Concannon on his co-ordination of the campaign to revive tourism in Galway in light of the water supply contamination there.  Despite his efforts, however, the impact of the contamination was massive.  The volume of visitors declined and, in many instances, hotels and other tourism-dependent businesses did everything, including offering cost prices, to attract visitors and protect their revenue streams.  It is crucial that the investment is made to ensure our water systems are adequately maintained because the knock-on effects of any failings are serious.</P>
        <P>Businesses are reacting to the incidence of water contamination.  In Galway and Ennis, for example, many businesses have invested in filtration systems because of their lack of confidence in the steady provision of a clean water supply.  It is unfortunate that they felt obliged to do so.  Will the Government give consideration to some type of grant aid for the installation of such filtration systems, which can be expensive?</P>
        <P>When work is carried out under the water programme, it is important an emphasis is placed on protection at source.  Upgrading the schemes is essential but, in the process, it is important to ensure there is adequate source protection.</P>
        <P>I welcome the water services national training programme.  It is essential.  I am concerned about the lack of joined-up thinking within departments in local authorities, as water schemes are struggling in some cases while there is a large volume of planning applications in some zones.  In the village of Newport in my own constituency planning applications are going ahead despite the required water quality level not being met.  Large devel<Col N="2109"/>opments are nonetheless being given planning permission, despite the authority acknowledging there is no solution to the problem.  That is a mystery to me.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers have raised the matter of river pollution.  I was fortunate enough to be born only yards away from Lough Derg, one of the most beautiful places in the country, which is very close to my heart.  It is one of the most beautiful places on the River Shannon.  Not many people associate it with Tipperary, which is an unfortunate failure from a tourism perspective.  I have issues with that also.</P>
        <P>The level of pollution and its visibility are different.  There is a level of pollution on Lough Derg which is unacceptable, and I have had experience of two dogs dying after drinking water from the lake.  The visual effect of the pollution on Lough Derg is a concern and clearly does nothing for tourism promotion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a timely debate, especially considering the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the largest ever allocation of funding in terms of water services.  That announcement has been added to as a result of yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  It is important to note the focus the Minister for Finance gave to water services in his Budget Statement, which itself was an innovation.  That indicates, from a Government perspective, that the matter of water quality is of the highest political importance.</P>
        <P>The difficulty we have experienced with deteriorating water quality across the country, not just in rural communities but in major urban centres, has been much debated and still requires a large-scale co-ordinated response.  There are continuing difficulties with cryptosporidium in the water supply of Galway city and surrounding areas.  Ongoing problems still have not been solved in Ennis and many Members in the House would be familiar with difficulties regarding water supply and quality in many parts of the country.  The reason behind this is that we have allowed water to be resourced that could be abused, not only as a receptacle for waste products but also in terms of compromising use as a source of drinking water supplies.</P>
        <P>The most recent EPA quality of water report shows a third of the rivers in the country used for drinking water supplies are polluted.  That serves as a wake-up call.  It is one of the reasons the Minister responded immediately in terms of changing the regulations for the monitoring of the quality of water systems, giving the Environmental Protection Agency a prime role in the matter from hereon.</P>
        <P>Such action cleared up much of the confusion existing in the past regarding who would take responsibility for particular waterways, which left cases being passed from pillar to post, particularly where the waterway was a boundary between two <Col N="2110"/>local authorities.  There is now a sense of clarity in that area.</P>
        <P>This debate is concerned especially with drinking water supplies.  The provision of an infrastructure for water supplies and a waste water infrastructure is something that we have historically left for local communities, with a minimum amount of support from local authorities, to bring about themselves.</P>
        <P>I once worked as a community development officer with Muintir na T&iacute;re and I noticed the confluence of membership of people in community councils and local group water schemes, a scenario still prevalent throughout the country.  It must be acknowledged that group water schemes brought about an infrastructure that the State, either at local government level or central Government level, lacked the full means to bring about.  It was the marriage of local community voluntary effort and the willingness of such people to be involved at a management and supervision level that provided any drinking water service at all to most rural communities.</P>
        <P>This was a feat in itself but keeping the schemes going has also been something of an achievement.   Currently, the level of pollution and contamination from outside sources must bring us to question the economies of scale that exist with many individual group water schemes.  Is the existing method for providing water in rural communities the best way of getting the job done?</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the democratic infrastructure which exists in group water schemes should be maintained and local people should have the ultimate say in knowing from where their water is coming, how it is being distributed and whether it is of the best quality.  There is a greater role for local authorities and Government, as well as State agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly mentioned that many rural households derive their water supply from having access to individual wells.  For many people this is deemed to be the cleanest source available, but even that idea has come under threat from pollution from outside sources, particularly with regard to ground water.</P>
        <P>The legislation places all the onus regarding supply and quality of this type of water source on the people with individual wells but there is a need to reconsider legislation and oblige the testing of such water in households on a regular basis.  This would ensure people living in or visiting such households would be exposed to the cleanest possible water supply at every opportunity.</P>
        <P>For rural communities there is a special emphasis on having the cleanest water possible.  This morning we debated farmers&rsquo; market and locally-produced food, both of which depend on the food grown in rural communities having access to clean water supplies.  It is important that we have these two debates today as they say much about the future of rural Ireland.</P><Col N="2111"/>
        <P>There is also a need for sustainable planning in rural Ireland.  I will not go into the wider debate of what is good and what is not, but there are reasons for rural communities being diverse in terms of where households are located and where people wish to build houses in future.  The consequence is that it is difficult to put in place a sustainable network of both water supply and waste water treatment.  We must be conscious of this idea in entering the debate of how and where we build houses in rural Ireland.  Not only is it difficult to provide the most efficient infrastructure but there is an added cost in doing so.</P>
        <P>I hope organisations such as An Taisce and the Irish Rural Dwellers Association will take those points into account.  We are concerned here with the essential elements of life.  Water should be clean and plentiful as we are one of the more fertile countries in the world, but it is not.  The reasons behind this come from how we structure our society, allowing elements of pollution to dominate.</P>
        <P>We must welcome the initiatives put in place over the last months in response to the most recent EPA report and we should strive to not only meet the lowest common standards we are obliged to under European Union directives, but seek to achieve the highest possible standards.  We can use that as a mark of quality with regard to the food we produce, the communities we create and in trying to ensure the problems existing now will not exist into the future because of a raising of the bar.</P>
        <P>Despite the increase in funding announced in yesterday&rsquo;s budget and the recent funding programme by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, this area will need sustained and increased funding if public confidence and the necessary infrastructure is to be created.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Boyle that this is a timely debate.  As the House knows, Galway has become synonymous nationally with serious water difficulties which are ongoing.  We are now on our fifth boil water notice.  Clarinbridge, which is at my back door, has had a boil water notice for approximately four weeks and Roundstone in Connemara has one.  Prior to that for six or seven months, as Members know, we had a boil water notice in Galway city and the Oranmore electoral area affecting 90,000 people and causing considerable hardship.  More than 200 people became quite ill and some vulnerable groups such as babies and older people could have died of cryptosporidium.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle spoke about the need to consider new developments and provide adequate water and sewerage schemes, which builds on the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly about the need for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to revisit the capping of grant aid at &euro;10,000 per house for water and <Col N="2112"/>sewerage services if we are serious about clean drinking water.</P>
        <P>No more than the rest of the nation, we in Galway have come to take water quality quite seriously as a critical public health issue.  County Galway has 600 group water schemes.  My research into the rural water programme in Galway has revealed the following.  The rural water programme that comes from private sources is going well.  This is the expressed view of Galway County Council which finds it easier to work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to get funding, initiate works and reach a satisfactory conclusion where private sources are involved, largely because there are fewer steps in the process to get work done.  This is important feedback given where the difficulties lie.</P>
        <P>Of the 600 group water schemes, however, more than 160 are dependent on public water supplies.  Herein lies the difficulty.  The public water supplies are experiencing serious difficulties with water pollution and contamination leading to people becoming ill as a result.  To address this issue we need urgent funding for the upgrade of capital works for the public supply of water and sewerage schemes.  In yesterday&rsquo;s budget for the nation the Minister allocated &euro;471 million.  For Galway alone we need more than one tenth of that for this year.  I met the director of services this week to discuss this point.  He said he needed &euro;5 million immediately for 20 vulnerable group schemes.  By that I know he is suggesting we are in serious danger of people in those areas becoming seriously ill again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to return to the issue of private sources and what is needed in that regard to improve water quality.  Regarding private wells, we need to introduce chemical treatment, filtration or disinfection using either ultraviolet light or chlorination to eliminate all the bugs in the water, including e.coli, coliform and cryptosporidium.  This is an important public health requirement which means drinking water will be 100% safe.  Regarding the public water supplies where we have major difficulties in Galway, and no doubt this is also relevant nationally, all of my research has shown that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can be as successful with the public water supplies as it has been with the group water schemes if it follows a similar approach.  The overall investment needed in County Galway from now until 2012 is &euro;494 million, which is more than has been allocated to the whole country for this year, although it is a five-year programme in the case of County Galway.</P>
        <P>The director of services informed me he needs &euro;5 million urgently for work on 20 vulnerable schemes, including Clarinbridge, Williamstown, Monivea and Carraroe, to solve immediate public health issues with existing supplies.  Reading between the lines, he is suggesting more areas are at risk of illness as a result of water pollution and <Col N="2113"/>contamination.  I have put this on the record of the House and I ask that it be addressed for the sake of public health in Galway.  I am very pleased the Minister of State and his officials are present to listen to this.</P>
        <P>The process of having schemes approved and funded needs to be made easier because the existing process is too long and cumbersome.  Does the Minister of State realise there are 70 steps between the initiation of a scheme for capital works and the work starting locally?  This is ridiculous.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has too many convoluted requirements.  Too many written submissions and approvals are needed.  Too many reports must to be sent between the local authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should ask the people in Kinvara, Clarinbridge or Athenry.  Athenry&rsquo;s temporary sewerage scheme is so inadequate that last year it was necessary to release the sewage into the Clarin river resulting in a major fish kill.  That has now come down the river resulting in a boil water notice in Clarinbridge.  The water is unsafe.</P>
        <P>Insufficient local discretion is given to local authorities to allow them to proceed.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should trust the local authorities to know what is needed and provide them with a block grant.  A pilot could be carried out in Galway to see how we do.  It is very easy to evaluate its effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Arising from the EU water directive, businesses and farmers pay through the use of metres.  The difficulty, however, is who funds the domestic element.  County Galway would be &euro;1 million short and needs the extra money from the local government fund.  Unless the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is forthcoming with adequate funding, money will need to be raised locally for schemes.  This will be met with contempt as rates are always resisted and it is not a reliable way to raise adequate money for something as critical as water.</P>
        <P>We need to simplify the process of approving schemes for capital works by having fewer steps.  Adequate funding needs to be allocated so that local authorities are not left short.  More discretion should be given to local authorities which know where the weaknesses are.  The Department should provide an annual block grant to all local authorities to match their population size and needs.  Galway should be used as a pilot for the nation.  The Department should provide us with &euro;30 million, which is just half of what we need in 2008, and then evaluate how we do.  I will lay a wager with the Minister of State that he will find great success if the Department trusts local authorities with this approach.</P>
        <P>As it stands, the Department&rsquo;s commitment to water supply and quality needs to be seriously <Col N="2114"/>questioned given the unprecedented wealth of recent years.  It is time for a proper, targeted investment programme for public water in Galway.  This is the Minister of State&rsquo;s chance and I would like him to convey it to the real Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give real leadership on water and its importance for public health.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Senators who outlined their views on this important issue.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said that while the theme for the discussion is the rural water services programme, there are a number of other areas in the general water services programme that are of concern.  While they do not come under my area of responsibility, I will respond to as many of them as I can.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the &euro;10,000 cap for services.  As the Senator outlined it, I had the impression that it was a cap on combined water and sewerage if they arose in the same place.  I understand that in general terms it applies to sewerage schemes and it has created some difficulty for local authorities.  It is well to remember the background.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is creating considerable difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Undoubtedly it is.  The distinction I was drawing is that it applies as a cap for waste water treatment for sewerage schemes.  It creates some concerns in local authorities at management and local authority member levels.  Initially the water services investment programme was directed mainly at major urban centres of population.  A large proportion of that work has now been completed and most of the costs associated with this work have been dealt with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The local authorities have considerable funding at their disposal but a significant variation in funding from the development funds exists between local authorities arising from the significant level of development.  This fund was initiated with a view to giving the local authorities some funding to put towards the cost of these schemes.  At this stage it has moved on to smaller towns and villages.  Some of the difficulties which Senators Reilly and Healy Eames and others mentioned relates to these relatively small centres of population where the number of houses is very limited and this grant is paid only for a domestic supply and not for commercial premises.  This creates a particular difficulty in areas where there are fairly small tourism-related facilities which are not big commercial entities but nevertheless are considered as commercial premises.  Currently every centre of population with 1,000 people or more is included in the programme, as are a few with smaller numbers than <Col N="2115"/>that.  I am confident the next review of the system will, to some extent and hopefully to a large extent, address the concerns which Senator Reilly expressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is reasonable to state that it would not be possible to have a completely open cheque book for addressing these schemes.  There must be a sensible attitude of addressing the areas at highest risk first.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The areas with a population of 1,000 or more are all included in the current programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the event that the EPA, in conjunction with the local authority, determines that a particular area not in the current scheme has a significant problem, there is a financial provision which can be drawn down in consultation with the EPA, the Department and the local authority to address very specific difficulties in those kinds of areas.</P>
        <P>Those difficulties can be partially addressed at source protection which is very important, more particularly for the areas being dealt with specifically today, the group water scheme areas and schemes in areas of much higher population, as referred to by Senator Healy Eames when she spoke about Galway and the initial cryptospiridium problem and the subsequent e.coli contamination.  I also refer to Ennis which has had serious difficulties in that regard.  These difficulties are gradually being addressed and the Department is confident they will be addressed successfully.</P>
        <P>The Department and the EPA are currently examining the latest drinking water quality results with a view to cataloguing those supplies at greatest risk from cryptospiridium and also supplies subject to continuing e.coli or other chemical excesses.  This analysis is expected to be completed by the middle of next year at the latest, hopefully a little sooner.  This will inform decisions on the programme from then on.  The contingency fund will be directed at those places.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>To return to the topic we ought to have been discussing, the group water schemes, there is provision at this stage to address the principal outstanding schemes, some of which are in County Galway and some in County Mayo and a few others around the country.  The design, build and operate process which has been applied to them is one that has shown a commendable level of success, although it is also fair to say there have been teething problems in some of the areas with the design, build and operate system for group water schemes.  Senator Reilly will be familiar with some difficulties which have arisen in his own area.</P><Col N="2116"/>
        <P>The new system is being operated in the context of the huge voluntary input by the local people since the 1960s and 1970s when they were the pioneers of the provision of this kind of infrastructure that enabled development both of agriculture and of housing in their local areas.  These voluntary schemes are now at the stage where they need a level of support.  The Department, in partnership with the rural organisations such as the federation, has been proactive in addressing these problems.  We realise there are areas where the very new model, whatever about design and build, is largely out of the hands of the people in the local community but we endeavour to address problems as speedily and as successfully as possible.  I realise some of those difficulties exist and I am grateful to Senators for drawing our attention to them.  I invite Senators to draw the attention of the Department to any difficulties and we will ensure the process of co-operation is brought to bear directly on those issues as this is the way to address them successfully.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the issue of the cap is creating some difficulty.  It is intended to review this system over a period when the local authorities have successfully invested all the moneys from development funds and a large proportion of their wastewater treatment issues have been dealt with.  It will then be possible to find a system to deal with the smaller population areas.</P>
        <P>We are very confident that the pilot group water schemes project currently in operation in north Tipperary will throw up pointers and will inform the manner in which the new group sewerage scheme grants system will be operated.  One of the difficulties associated with group sewerage schemes is that they are not as straightforward as the water schemes and difficult and technical issues arise about treatment, although there is no great difficulty about collection.  These issues can subsequently pose problems for voluntary committees who have done extraordinarily well in the group water schemes sector but might be challenged in the group sewerage schemes sector.</P>
        <P>I refer to a pilot area of concern, the source protection scheme in Senator Reilly&rsquo;s county of Cavan.  I pay tribute to all those involved in this scheme for the level of co-operation from the farming community and from all participants.  This is very encouraging for the future.</P>
        <P>I hope I am not straying in terms of length or width.</P>

	<P>I may continue a bit further then.</P>
        <P>I wish to address some of the issues raised by Senators.  I have dealt with the issues raised by Senator Reilly.  Senator Kelly referred to agricultural pollution.  I acknowledge there have been problems and that the attempts to deal with them in County Cavan have been extraordinarily successful, as has been the general response of the agricultural community.  Senator Kelly also stressed the need for monitoring of supplies and this is gradually happening much more.  Monitoring of the public schemes which are in the ownership of county councils is the responsibility of the EPA but monitoring of the group schemes is the responsibility of the county councils, with an oversight role for the EPA.  As the monitoring is extended in frequency and spread, it is inevitable that other issues such as those outlined by Senator Healy Eames and others, will inevitably come to light.  I have no doubt the Department will be able to deal with those issues and we will endeavour to face up to them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Kelly also referred to source protection and this is an issue which we need to address.  Senator Boyle referred to the ongoing Ennis water supply issue and sadly, I am very familiar with the situation.  The interim solution has been somewhat successful but the long-term solution is what is needed.  He also mentioned the need for testing of single-house wells.  For the moment, all the emphasis has been on the public supplies and on the group water schemes for more than 50 houses, as required under the directive.  Fortunately, a substantial proportion of the other smaller group water schemes receive their water from the public supply and this is gradually being addressed in positive terms.  However, quite a few small schemes consist of two or three houses connected to the one well or in the case referred to by Senator Boyle, one house.  People in that situation are free to have their own water tested and many have done so.  We would encourage people to take this action because it is only when one is aware of a problem that one can do something about it.</P>
        <P>Despite quite negative findings relating to water quality, there are some strong positive indicators with regard to single rural wells.  One suspects that improved agricultural practice may have resulted in wells being considerably more useable than had been the case heretofore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cecilia Keaveney mentioned some issues that were of importance in her own locality, some of which I may have dealt with in that regard.  The public supplies were a matter of some concern to her.  At present, the most recent results indicate a compliance rate of almost<?oasys _jy ?>99%.  However, some issues are still outstanding.  Ultimately, as a number of Members noted, we will become aware of the difficulties through ongoing risk assessment and a fairly rigorous application of the monitoring process.  This is of enormous importance because one only can begin <Col N="2118"/>to address such difficulties when one is aware of them.  However, the record of the Department and the local authorities in addressing schemes has been extraordinarily good in a relatively short period.  Ancillary issues arise in respect of source protection that, ultimately, are the fundamental issues to be addressed, if we are to do so successfully.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney also raised a query regarding the prosecution of local authorities.  Such a provision exists under the regulations introduced this year and the EPA is the body that is charged with that responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I refer to the need for the Minister for Transport to introduce measures to reduce the exorbitant cost of motor insurance in this State, particularly for young drivers.  It is clear that young drivers, who make up 20% of the total, are being bled dry and ripped off by some private motor insurance companies while the Government continues to look on.  In a recent reply to a Sinn F&eacute;in parliamentary question on this issue, the Minister for Transport accepted that, &ldquo;[i]n the case of young drivers it has been represented that the cost of this insurance is still too high&rdquo;.  The problem has been admitted and it is now high time that the Government acted to put an end to this rip-off of young drivers.</P>
        <P>Young drivers, especially males, are forced to pay exorbitant prices for motor insurance.  A significant number are forced into purchasing private cars in the first place due to inadequate public transport provision.  The cost of motor insurance is a huge financial burden for many young people and their families.  The most recent statistics available on this issue are contained in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s report, Private Motor Insurance Statistics 2005.  It showed that young male drivers between the ages of 17 and 20 holding provisional licences can pay up to &euro;4,291 every year to be insured.  Simultaneously, young female drivers in the same position can pay up to &euro;2,381.  The case has worsened in recent years.  In 2002, a survey carried out of young male drivers  aged 17 to 20 with provisional licences showed that the cheapest quote possible was &euro;1,622.  Three years later, in 2005, the cheapest quote possible was &euro;2,082.  This constitutes an increase of &euro;420.  The position has worsened and there has been little action to tackle it.</P><Col N="2119"/>
        <P>The National Youth Council of Ireland&rsquo;s report on motor insurance, entitled The Plunder Years, found that many young drivers are forced to pay insurance premiums by instalment as a result of high insurance costs.  This form of payment incurs an interest charge of more than 18%, further hiking up the price.  Motor insurance costs in this State are almost double the EU average.  In addition there is inadequate regulation, information and research into the insurance industry.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion on Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposal to set up a State motor insurance scheme?  A model exists in Canada, namely, the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation in the province of Manitoba.  This insurance company does not discriminate on age or sex.  The only factors taken into account are the car one drives, what one uses it for, where one lives, one&rsquo;s driving record and the cover one wants.  Quotes are much the same for everyone.  New Zealand also runs such a scheme.  These companies have proven their viability and contribute to better road safety through involvement in every aspect of road awareness projects.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable that young drivers are being discriminated against in respect of car insurance, thereby forcing some to become uninsured and an even bigger threat to other road users.  Although young motorists are charged premiums that are not remotely reflective of the costs of actually insuring them, little has been done by the Government except to allow their continued exploitation.  There is an obvious need for action.  One such action could be the establishment of a State motor insurance company that would sell insurance at a fair price, rather than being set by market forces.</P>
        <P>The National Youth Council of Ireland also suggested that drivers with an accident-free record should be entitled to a rebate funded by a levy on the profits of insurance companies.  Through a State-run system, any profits accumulated could be used to offset the cost of providing insurance and to reduce premiums.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that affordable motor insurance should be available to every resident in the State, regardless of age, sex or marital status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Third party motor insurance is required by law for the use of all mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place.  Motor insurance is provided by private companies in an open and competitive market in which consumer interests can exert influence by seeking quotes and comparing costs before purchasing.  Insurance companies, numbering 29 at present, are controlled by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme, initiated in 2002, has resulted in cheaper and more widely available motor insurance.  In general, the cost of motor <Col N="2120"/>insurance has declined by 11% in the last 12 months and overall, motor insurance premia have fallen by 39% since April 2003.  Various factors have contributed to this reduction including increased competition in an open market.</P>
        <P>Another major reform in this area was the introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The PIAB continues to contribute to the lowering of motor insurance premia by eliminating the 46% additional cost associated with processing claims through the courts.  Compensation claims are now settled much faster and at no disadvantage to the victim.  Similarly, changes in the Civil Liability and Courts Act, which include penalties for giving false or misleading evidence in personal injury cases, have helped to reduce bogus claims.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made in the last two years in reducing the number of deaths and collisions.  A significant reduction in the number of deaths on our roads took place in 2006 when the second lowest rate in 40 years, that is, 368 deaths was achieved.  This downward trend has continued into 2007 with 308 deaths thus far, which constitutes 32 fewer deaths than the comparable figure on this day last year.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority has been established and has developed a new road safety strategy for the period 2007 to 2012, in co-operation with all the relevant Departments and agencies, as road safety is a major cross-cutting issue.  There has been a substantial investment in new, improved and safer roads.  Road safety policy initiatives and safety awareness campaigns have focussed on changing driver behaviour and on drink driving.  Legislation has been enacted to enable roadside mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, a ban on the use of hand-held mobile telephones while driving, as well as the private operation of safety cameras to combat speeding.  Since the commencement of MAT in July 2006, more than 30,000 drivers have been tested at checkpoints monthly.  This testing, aligned with a significant increase in high visibility enforcement, increased penalties and the extension of penalty points has led to a substantial reduction in deaths despite the increased number of vehicles using our roads.  Under the Road Traffic Act 2006, the powers of the Garda were also extended to allow the seizure of all uninsured vehicles whether registered within the State or otherwise.</P>
        <P>In the case of young drivers, it has been represented that the cost of motor insurance is still too high.  As with other types of drivers, the insurance industry assesses the risks involved and sets the premium level accordingly.  Unfortunately, because of the high level of collisions and deaths involving young drivers, this group is assessed as being of high risk.  This risk cannot be denied or ignored.  Figures published recently by the RSA show clearly that young men in particular are consistently over-represented in collisions, fatality and serious injury statistics.  There are several factors at play in this regard, including <Col N="2121"/>lack of experience leading to speeding and other dangerous practices.  The abuse of alcohol and drugs while driving also contributes to the problem.  A study of fatal road crashes in 2003 published by the Health Service Executive showed that driver alcohol is, primarily, a male problem with the highest risk group being those aged from 19 to 34.  Likewise, young male drivers not wearing seat belts figure very prominently in fatality statistics.</P>
        <P>Another reason for high premia is that young drivers are not able to establish a full no-claims bonus until they have been driving for at least five years.  When all these issues are taken into account, it is difficult to envisage the insurance industry providing motor insurance cover to young people for the same premium level as for more mature drivers.  Nevertheless, the Senator is aware that in the case of young female drivers, the premia are not as high.  This difference in treatment is due to the reduced risks involved as perceived by the insurance industry.</P>
        <P>Under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the Government gave a commitment to review the cost of motor insurance for young drivers.  My Department appointed external consultants in September 2007 to examine this matter.  The report, which I expect to receive shortly, should inform us better of the issues involved.  I advise both mature and young drivers to shop around and take advantage of the competition within the market when seeking new insurance or renewing an existing policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply although it did not address the issue.  I am aware of the risks associated with young drivers but 20% of them cannot be penalised without even having a bad record.  Will the consultants carrying out the review on behalf of the Department discuss the problems with youth organisations?  Young people are being ripped off though massive premia, which even the Minister of State acknowledged are high.</P>

        <P>I declare my interest in that I was a member of a marching band when I was young.  I am a musician by background.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was a brass and reed band.  Some of my best memories of having fun in my youth date from that time, even though we were often out in the freezing cold and dressed in the most hideous uniforms it was possible to find with instruments that were very old.  Some professionals had difficulty playing the clarinet I had.  I think that is what made me a very good musician on the clarinet.  I subsequently got a licentiate performer&rsquo;s diploma on an instrument that was much easier to play.</P>
        <P>People turn to music at almost every event in life.  It is a part of births, deaths, parties, celebrations and festivals.  Musicians are expected to appear at these events at their own expense in terms of travel and time.  This is especially true of marching bands, which do not appear by magic, yet we expect them to exist magically and appear when we need them.  No one asks how these bands survive for the rest of the year and people get upset if no band is available for an occasion.</P>
        <P>It costs money to buy and repair instruments, get uniforms and music, travel to events, rent a location to practise, get a teacher and cover insurance costs.  Bands must get involved in fund-raising.  Many bands are involved in marching band competitions and give a lot of pleasure and a sense of occasion to community events.  Coming up to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day there will be a great demand for bands.  From the experience in my town, it is not possible to get a band on many occasions although in the past there were up to a dozen bands available for any given parade or festival.</P>
        <P>There are opportunities for music libraries and instrument banks that can assist bands in terms of being better resourced.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to bring to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism the value to the community I have outlined.</P>
        <P>I began my contribution by saying I was a member of a band and I went on to make a career out of it.  Currently, I am probably involved in a dodgier career than my previous one as a teacher.  The people I deal with now are much more difficult than any of the children in my classes.</P>
        <P>The emotional and social value to children who are members of these bands cannot be underestimated.  Children in bands get a chance to work together.  If three people in a band are playing three different instruments they have to listen to each other.  They cannot just decide to play their piece of music when they choose.  Band members have to learn to work with each other.  These skills are valuable life skills.  Members of bands also make lifelong friends and their pastime can develop into a career.  I do not say we should have a great many marching bands which can produce musicians and entertain people, but it is a by-product.</P>
        <P>We have a fundamental devaluation of music and the arts in this country.  People appreciate music but this does not always extend to financial support.  Insufficient funding is available currently <Col N="2123"/>for the arts.  That said, I acknowledge the significant increase in the Arts Council budget on an ongoing basis.  I hope the Minister of State will announce it is part of the solution in terms of setting up a scheme for marching bands to address the cost of buying and repairing instruments, getting uniforms, tuition, music, travel costs, venue rental and insurance.</P>
        <P>I am pleased with the work done by marching bands around the country.  Support must be given to these bands to ensure they are there when we want them and their numbers do not become fewer, as has been the case.  Otherwise it will be seen that Ireland will have lost more than just marching bands when the situation is evaluated in future.</P>

        <P>Government policy on the arts is set out in the programme for Government and will be elaborated further in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2008-2010 which is being developed.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to encourage and support the strategic development of the arts in local communities, both geographic and communities of interest, for the disadvantaged and for minority groups.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to support national economic and societal progress by enriching the quality of life of the people of Ireland by facilitating the promotion and sustainable development of the arts and culture.  To accomplish this the Government seeks to create an environment that enables arts and culture, including the cultural institutions, to flourish through the provision of an appropriate legislative, policy and resource framework.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department has received numerous requests over the past year from pipe and brass bands and music schools seeking small amounts of funding to purchase musical instruments.  The Minister consequently proposed a Supplementary Estimate for the Arts Council, which was approved by the select committee last Tuesday.  This includes funds for a community music programme.  This will be a pilot programme to be run by the Arts Council.  The scheme will be aimed at providing funding for musical instruments, etc. to bands and music schools throughout the country and will be open to all bands, including marching bands.  The scheme will provide much needed support for local community music groups for whom no formal funding programme exists.  The council has estimated that the cost of the pilot scheme will be &euro;250,000.</P>
        <P>The Department, in addition, has taken a direct role in providing grant aid to the arts and culture infrastructure and has provided substantial funding for the capital development of facilities in all regions in recent years, having regard to factors <Col N="2124"/>such as sustainability and community requirements.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The main vehicle for such capital funding is the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, under which more than &euro;75 million has been granted to 107 arts and cultural facilities to date since the scheme commenced in 2001.  The ACCESS scheme is a key element in the Government&rsquo;s regional arts strategy and has improved greatly participation in the arts for large numbers of people nationwide.  The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.</P>
        <P>When applications for funding under the next round of the ACCESS scheme are invited through advertisements in the national newspapers it will be open to any group, including marching bands, to apply should they have a project that complies with the terms of the programme.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, for coming to the House and the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I welcome the introduction of the community childcare subvention scheme.  I congratulate the Minister of State on a number of aspects of the scheme in particular.  I am pleased the total funding for the scheme will be increased by 16%.  I particularly welcome the fact that the scheme seeks to direct funding on a more targeted basis.  It will support all community based child care services regardless of their location.  It will be based on the actual number of children of disadvantaged parents using their services, opening up the support funding for community services throughout the country and standardising the way services and individual parents benefit from affordable child care.  It demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to child care and measures targeted at tackling social inclusion, a commitment reiterated in the new programme for Government.</P>
        <P>However, there are a number of concerns that some vulnerable parents may be disadvantaged inadvertently.  When the Minister of State came to the Seanad some time ago he assured Members there would be ongoing analysis of this situation.  Will the Minister give the House an update on the commencement of the community childcare subvention scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for raising this important issue.  I appreciate the important and valid proposals the Senator made to my office regarding the childcare subvention scheme and <Col N="2125"/>child care in general.  She has highlighted in particular the need to address the issue of children with special needs and the important points made by some disability groups in that regard.  I thank Senator Corrigan for bringing those issues to my attention and for continuing to be a strong advocate for those groups.  I very much appreciate it.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, which is co-funded under the European Union Social Fund, targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme.  Community based not for profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007 where it was considered necessary to enable services to remain accessible to disadvantaged parents.  That continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With the closure of the equal opportunities childcare programme in December of this year, to continue to support community child care services to provide affordable child care to disadvantaged parents, the community childcare subvention scheme is being introduced from January next year under the Exchequer funded national childcare investment programme which runs to 2010, the successor programme to the equal opportunities childcare programme.  The community childcare subvention scheme has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next three years, representing a 16% increase in funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme staffing scheme, and will continue to support community child care services to provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports of increased child benefit and early child supplement in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.</P>
        <P>As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents to complete a simple declaration form to be included in a return to my office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service is being determined.  The subvention received by services will in turn be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period up to July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it would have on individual groups on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data being received.  Where appro<Col N="2126"/>priate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcome for child care services, and for disadvantaged parents and their children, will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>As I stated previously in this House, this analysis will be completed as early as possible in 2008.  I indicated in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il on other occasions that our aim is to have the relevant analyses completed before the end of February if at all possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Applications from groups entering the new scheme are currently being processed and, when validated, these groups will be issued with letters from the child care directorate of my office approving transitional funding under the national child care investment programme community child care subvention scheme.</P>
        <P>At the outset, 780 groups in receipt of EOCP staffing funding were identified as having no compliance issues concerning their existing grant and were written to and asked to make returns.  A further 45 were added to this list and written to in November and invited to make returns.  I am glad to advise the House that, to date, returns of information have been received from 669 groups and 415 letters have issued from my office approving transitional funding, which brings the groups&rsquo; funding up to 1 July next.  For the first six months of 2008 this funding will be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the group under the equal opportunities child care programme staffing support grant scheme and is approved subject to the necessary contractual arrangements with Pobal.</P>
        <P>At the outset there was no shortage of people who told me and my officials that this data could not be collected, that parents would refuse to provide it and that services would not forward it.  It is vitally important, therefore, that my office engage with the sector at a series of regional seminars and explain the necessity of this process to the scheme and indeed the community child care sector.  The level of returns, at over 80%, has therefore been heartening and has allowed my officials commence analysis of the data and examine the enhancements to the scheme that are appropriate and necessary in the context of the framework it establishes and the increased resources it makes available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This high level of co-operation is a strong vindication of the Government&rsquo;s position and a firm indication that the new scheme is on the right track.  I compliment the various groups who have forwarded the relevant information to us, and the other support groups and county child care committees that have been active in encouraging groups to get all the data to our office as quickly as possible.  I also compliment all those involved in collating and processing the data and forwarding them to my office.</P>
        <P>There is a huge amount of information to be entered and verified involving hundreds of <Col N="2127"/>services and thousands of families but from the receipt of the first returns this process started and with every new return entered, a more complete picture emerges.  One of the facts which has emerged is that in most groups the level of employment among parents appears to be substantially higher than it was at the time of their approvals for funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme.  This is something all Members of the Oireachtas welcome and I believe the provision of community based not for profit child care has enabled many parents avail of employment opportunities.  The second point is that most groups appear to have a lower cost base than in the private sector, largely as a result of little or no rental costs, and this, combined with the not for profit basis of these services, means that even non-subvented parents using these services will still be charged affordable fees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to restate that the more detailed and comprehensive data which are being generated by the new scheme between now and the end of December are being analysed by officials in my office.  I am committed to ensuring that the necessary adjustments to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered by the Government as early as is practical to allow services plan well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I wish to restate that the Government, having invested over &euro;500 million in child care in the past seven years, will not walk away from the community sector or indeed any sector of the national child care infrastructure that is receiving such substantial support.  It is worth repeating that the Government has built a formal child care structure from a very low base.  Since 2000 we have created over 35,000 new child care places in the community and private sector and supported over 26,000 more.</P>
        <P>Given that the new subvention scheme increases funding by 16% over the equal opportunities child care programme&rsquo;s staffing scheme, I refute in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that the Government has suspended such support.  Nothing could be further from the truth <Col N="2128"/>and, as I said earlier, any adjustments which might be considered necessary will be considered by the Government once the relevant data has been analysed.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Maria Corrigan for raising this important issue.  It is an issue that was raised with me by my own constituency colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson.  I reiterate that we are determined to enhance the scheme as it is currently outlined.  I appreciate the many groups, individuals and Members of the Oireachtas who spoke to me about this issue and made worthwhile suggestions.  All of those proposals are being analysed in my office in the Department.  We are determined to ensure the equal opportunities child care programme will be built on and further progress made in the child care sector with the major investment of &euro;575 million which the Government has provided for the national child care investment programme up to 2010.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and thank him for his kind words.  The 80% level of returns is heartening and is a credit to the Minister of State and his Department.  I particularly welcome the fact that 415 letters have been issued approving the transition.  The most important aspect of the scheme is that it offers us the opportunity to ensure that the people who most need affordable child care will receive it.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s response provides further reassurance that where adjustments are indicated to be necessary, from analysis of the data, for more vulnerable people, they will be made.</P>

	<P>I had the opportunity to meet different groups throughout the country as well as Oireachtas colleagues and, in many instances, there was misinformation.  At the meetings I was able to allay the genuine concerns that were raised.  We have told groups that if they have particular concerns or want further data analysis of the position in their centres, they are welcome to contact the Department directly.  All possible assistance will be given to ensure people receive proper guidance and advice on the new scheme.</P>
