	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill &mdash; Committee Stage and <i>a</i>1, which is on the Supplementary Order Paper.  It is my pleasant duty to inform the House that the Taoiseach has appointed Senator Wilson as Government Chief Whip to the 23rd Seanad and has reappointed Senator Glynn as Assistant Government Chief Whip to the 23rd Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the management and planning of our public health service and public service generally.  Just more than four months ago there was a general election campaign during which Fianna F&aacute;il pledged to be the party that could best manage the economy and deliver public services.  This pledge looks very hollow today given the continuation of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s recruitment freeze.  The Minister for Health and Children was in the House some days ago and said this matter would be reviewed on the first day of the month and that no patient would be affected or suffer as a result of the changes.  This is clearly not the case.  Operations are being postponed in quite a few hospitals and there is general unrest in the health service associated with industrial relations activity.  There is no confirmation as to when the recruitment freeze will end.</P>
        <P>During the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il this morning, I heard the Taoiseach almost fail to respond to a question on health.  Despite our having a Minister for Health and Children, a Department of Health and Children and a sub-committee on health, the Taoiseach almost seemed to be washing his hands of public accountability in respect of the health service.</P>
        <P>Yesterday RTE reported there are a huge number of patients, some 41,000, on hospital waiting lists.  Some 24,000 patients are waiting for day care procedures and 17,000 are waiting for inpatient procedures.  In light of these very dis<Col N="191"/>turbing figures and the reported adverse economic climate which appears to be affecting our health service so adversely, will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance come to the House before the budget so Senators can discuss this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In the spring of this year, the Independent Senators introduced a motion on credit union savings to achieve a guarantee of savings protection and a system that would be independent of all representative bodies and others.  There was a long debate in the House and at its conclusion the Government Members did not disagree with my proposal that savings in credit unions should have exactly the same level of protection and guarantee as those in a bank.  They said Government representatives were in talks with the Irish League of Credit Unions in conjunction with the Financial Regulator and they intended to conclude them by 31 March, after which they would move on the issues.  The Government has not been as good as its word on this issue and we therefore need to address it.  I have a duty to introduce my Bill.  I do not mind if the Financial Regulator or Minister for Finance say clearly they disagree with what I propose but I know my proposal is correct.  I am getting telephone calls from all sorts of people who are afraid to speak out and do not want to rock the boat.  I am afraid we will see a run on credit unions such as we saw in respect of Northern Rock.  If there is a lack of confidence, this is what will happen.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to address the issue?</P>
        <P>I have been trying for some time to figure out what has happened to mutton.  I would like the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to answer this for us.  It represents a traditional flavour of Ireland and was the basic ingredient for Irish stew.  Senators will find this very entertaining but that is not my point.  At a time when slow cooking is a fast-expanding area of cuisine, it is time that mutton be made available again in Ireland.  This would provide a new outlet and market for the Irish farmer.  Mutton is derived from lambs that are approximately one and a half to two years old and which are finished on grass.  This is exactly what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been advocating and it represents a significant issue.</P>
        <P>Some of the farmers on the Agriculture Panel are smiling but they will note I have raised this issue in the House on a previous occasion.  Recently in the United Kingdom mutton has had a champion, namely, the Prince of Wales, who has accepted the job of patron of the mutton renaissance campaign.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This area of the market, which is huge in France, for example, is being ignored.  Those who were reared during a particular age will be familiar with the gamey flavour, taste and smell of mutton, which is part of Irish life.  I would like the Minister of State with responsibility for food, Deputy Sargent, to come to the House to offer Senators his views on this matter.  We need to educate ourselves, if nobody else, on the value and attraction of mutton.</P>

	<P>The Labour Party will not oppose the Order of Business.  Given that the Government parties have been quick in recent years to claim credit for this country&rsquo;s economic growth, does the Leader agree they must take the blame when the story goes the other way?  In the months and years leading up to the recent general election, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance tried to claim personal credit for constructing almost every crane in the sky.  I am making this point in the context of the Exchequer figures we have seen today.  Some respected commentators have used the word &ldquo;slump&rdquo; in recent weeks, but it seems a slight exaggeration to describe the circumstances we face as a slump.  There is certainly a slump in the construction sector, however.  Before this year&rsquo;s election, the former leader of the third largest party in the current coalition predicted that if my party and others were to be elected to government, it would prove to be a &ldquo;slump coalition&rdquo;.  We now seem to be having a slump even though Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats are still in power.  Will the Government parties act in a logical manner by taking the blame, given that they were so quick to take the credit in the past?</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is an element of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> about this when one considers what happened five years ago.  During the 2002 general election campaign, many promises were made and we saw a great deal of profligacy on the part of the Government parties, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il.  The people discovered a few months later that they were faced with stringent cuts in public services.  Can the Leader or anybody else tell us anything that will give us any confidence or help us to believe that the same thing will not happen this time?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance and Mr. Eoin Ryan, MEP, to come to the House to discuss tax harmonisation, which is an issue that is gaining some momentum at EU level and needs to be discussed here?  I have discussed the matter with Mr. Ryan, MEP, who has a great deal of knowledge about it.  He is a member of a European Parliament committee examining tax harmonisation, which would pose an enormous threat to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  I am sure Senator Alex White will agree that we need to take preventative measures to safeguard the economy.  There is a precedent for getting MEPs to come to the Seanad to debate issues being discussed at EU level.  I am worried that this subject will be ignored at local level, even if the Minister for Finance is batting admirably on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf.  We should not allow the momentum that is building in Europe to continue, as we might not be able to stop it at a future stage.  The Seanad should use the facility available to it to ask the Minister for Finance and Mr. Eoin Ryan, MEP, to come to the House, thereby allowing it to focus on this matter.  I would be grateful for the assistance of the Leader in this.  The country would benefit from a focused debate on tax harmonisation which poses a significant threat to the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that we should be worried about the financial position within the health service.  As an ordinary person I am rather surprised at the inaccuracy of the figures given as projections by the Department of Finance.  I know this is not an easy area but these figures are remarkably inaccurate from time to time.  This looks like a bit of a bump, the effects of which can be seen in the health service, even though significant amounts of money, approximately &euro;15 billion, have been expended on the health service.  However, too much of this is spent on administration and on the administration of the HSE whereas not half enough goes directly to the coalface.  The result is that in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital operations are being put on the long finger and people&rsquo;s treatment delayed because a consultant anaesthe<Col N="194"/>tist takes a scheduled holiday and the hospital is not allowed to cover his absence because of financial stringency within the service.  It is not acceptable that because a consultant anaesthetist goes on holiday, patients are deprived of treatment because coverage is not permitted.  It is unprecedented and unprofessional.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a matter also raised by my colleague, Senator Bacik and other Senators, the question of the absence of legislation governing the control of trafficking of human beings in particular for sexual purposes.  I raise this matter in light of the reports that Ireland is currently co-operating with police forces in 14 or 15 other European countries in this important area but this co-operation is being hindered by the absence of legislation.  Ruhama has stated that the majority of prostitutes, sex workers, in this country are from abroad and that it has dealt with 200 cases of this kind of exploitation in the past year.  It is not just an urban situation but happens throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has increased the fine for littering.  It would be a great relief in the city of Dublin and especially in the north inner city if we occasionally saw a litter warden.  They are rarer than the greater spotted cuckoo.  There is no point in increasing the fines unless we support this initiative by having litter wardens fining people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the best wishes to our Chief Whip, Senator Wilson and to the assistant Chief Whip, Senator Glynn, on their appointment by the Taoiseach.  I also congratulate all my colleagues who have been appointed as spokespersons.  I wish them well in their responsibilities.  We can get down to work in the House now as all the responsibilities have been assigned.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader of the House to have a debate on health issues.  I am very concerned about the situation which may develop in County Roscommon.  We have accident and emergency cover 24-seven at the moment and this saved the lives of Colm Mee and Paul O&rsquo;Grady and the young man involved in a serious crash in Hillstreet this morning.  I wish to be associated with the sympathies expressed to the family of the bus driver who died as he was bringing 27 <?oasys _dc18- ?>students to Carrick-on-Shannon.  Without the accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital, three lives would have been lost in the past two weeks in County Roscommon.  This highlights the serious nature of the situation.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The managers of the HSE never propose that any manager be let go, but they propose the reduction of consultant numbers in smaller hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Professor Drumm seems to be the Minister as well as the chief executive of the HSE.  I would like to see political responsibility for the management of the health service returned to the Oireachtas.

Three young men have died on the roads of County Roscommon this week and a bus driver died this morning.  Without an accident and emergency service in Roscommon hospital, at least three other young men would have been lost in the past two weeks.</P>

        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the serious issue of unemployment in the north-west region.  Last week there was a request in the House to discuss Shannon Airport and the impact that the withdrawal of Aer Lingus flights to Heathrow would have on the broader Shannon region.  It was correct to request such a discussion although it has not taken place in this House.  However, there was a discussion in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>There also must be a discussion about the north west.  This week there were further job losses in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  Although the number of job losses might appear small to Members of the Oireachtas, a total of 80 jobs have been lost in one company since the summer months, 12 of them this week and 24 last week.  This is at a time when other factories are closing down in the Donegal Gaeltacht and other job losses are occurring.  The losses might be absorbed if Donegal was on a par with the rest of the island but the county has 18% unemployment, the highest levels of poverty and the lowest levels of disposable income.  It is a serious issue which every Senator must tackle.  It is unacceptable that we allow part of the island to be left isolated, as has happened with Donegal and the north-west region.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House in order that we can address this issue and seek action instead of rhetoric.  Donegal must <Col N="197"/>become more than an afterthought for the Government, as it has been for years.  I am seeking the opportunity to address these serious issues in the debate.</P>

        <P>Will the Leader organise a focused debate to examine the degree of bloated administration in the HSE, cutbacks in renting buildings and wastage in general through a plethora of unnecessary meetings?  I am horrified at the decision to remove cancer services from Cavan General Hospital and ask the Leader to convey my horror to the relevant Ministers.  What is the timetable for this?  What transport arrangements will be put in place to deal with this difficulty?  What are the full implications of the removal of an excellent and highly reputed service from Cavan General Hospital?</P>
        <P>Will the Leader find out specifically why in God&rsquo;s name a locum is not appointed for an anaesthetist who is on holidays?  Senator Norris raised this matter previously but it is mind-boggling that the services of a hospital would be held up in this way.  It does not constitute a tightening of finances; it is a false economy obscenity and it is bizarre and unacceptable.  Will the Leader find out how we can rationalise and justify the removal of ten medical beds from Monaghan hospital parallel with the removal of cancer services from Cavan General Hospital?  It is a bleak situation I want the Leader to address.</P>

If I am correct, perhaps one or two of them were accommodated in the new HSE.  I do not speak on behalf of Professor Drumm but, as a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the last term, I would point out that he came before the committee on at least five or six occasions when all parties put to him whatever questions they wished and he answered them.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, does not cross over Professor Drumm&rsquo;s role nor does he cross over her role.  </P>

	<P>I do not know if the Leader and the other Members will join me in sending our very best wishes to our Special Olympians, their families and supporters in Shanghai.  Very often our culture emphasises strength and power and the vulnerable in our society are easily forgotten.  The Special Olympians are witnesses to the power of love and solidarity between people and how this can triumph over adversity and, perhaps, teach the world a lesson.  I am also conscious that they are competing in China.  China has much to learn from the example of the Special Olympians.  This is a country where human dignity is frequently trampled on.  China&rsquo;s one child policy has made it the only country in the world where it is illegal to have a brother or a sister.  As we heard on the radio yesterday, it is a country where many children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome simply are not born; such is the negative attitude to disability that pertains there.  That these games are taking place in China is a good thing and, perhaps, it is a signal of the softening of Chinese culture in Government.  I hope our Government will recognise that the progress in achieving human rights and respect for human dignity in China is not keeping pace with economic progress.  I hope it will not see our strong economic links with China as somehow giving it an opt-out on the need for Ireland to be a beacon, a prophetic voice, in promoting universal respect for human dignity.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Special Olympians I support, as I am sure the House would want to support, the aims of Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Ireland, as it seeks to establish a national medical resource <Col N="200"/>centre for the health promotion of all persons with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, and their families.</P>
        <P>A welcome has already been extended to this morning&rsquo;s news that the police in Ireland and Britain will undertake a campaign aimed at cracking down on those involved in human trafficking.  There is a motion on the Order Paper calling for the rapid introduction of legislation to ban human trafficking.  It is not enough to ban human trafficking.  It is important to recognise that this activity is giving rise to a form of effective slavery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I welcome my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, questioning what happened to mutton.  I thought he was going to volunteer the opinion that it was going around dressed up as lamb, but that would not apply in this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not think it would have been necessary, but in light of the comments from the Opposition parties I support the call for another debate on the health service.  I  thought, given the enlightened comments from the Minister in the House last week in which she outlined the good vision and the necessity for health reform, that people would have been better informed.   Investment in our health services has increased from &euro;3.5 billion when many of us first came into this House in 1997 to &euro;15 billion this year, with a &euro;1.2 billion increase this year.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the very near future on pensions, an area in which the former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, made very good progress in trying to address the deficit among the public in providing for their pensions.  A recently published report has shown a lack of transparency in the financial services industry in revealing the charges being levied on people&rsquo;s pension funds.  As a consequence this will deter people from pursuing investing in pensions to provide for themselves as they become older.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the call by Senator Fitzgerald for a debate with the Minister for Finance, who I am sure would oblige.  The landscape has altered totally and we would like to hear from him regarding the shortfall in Exchequer returns against forecast and the impact this will have across all Departments.  The Leader should be able to put that issue to the Minister who, I am sure, would receive it well.  As the situation is serious, such a debate would be useful and timely.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised a potentially very serious matter regarding credit unions.  We urgently need a level playing pitch in this area and I strongly support what he said.  It is time for the same protection to be applied to credit union customers as is given to bank customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to comments made about the health services.  For some time people have been confused about the roles of the Department of Health and Children, the Minister and the HSE.  I wish to place on the record my appreciation of all those involved in the delivery of the services whether on the front line or in administration.  Thousands of people are receiving excellent services from our service providers.  In recent years much has been done on the provision of service.  I was impressed by one change.  I noticed when driving on Pearse Street that poor unfortunate addicts were no longer queuing and crossing the road in front of our cars.  Thousands of commuters saw this on a daily basis.  They then moved to Amiens Street and we saw a repetition of that simply because nobody wanted a drugs clinic in his or her back garden.</P>
        <P>Now throughout the country pharmacists are participating in a methadone programme.  Drug addicts integrated in their own communities are availing of the required supports.  The House may be aware of some difficulties between the HSE and the pharmaceutical union on the operation of the scheme.  I ask the Leader to make contact with the two authorities.  From speaking to pharmacists, I understand they have been trying to seek a meaningful conclusion to ensure the continuation of the methadone programme, but have been unable to reach agreement.  A deadline of <Col N="202"/>Monday, 8 October has been set for agreement, otherwise pharmacies participating in the scheme will withdraw, which would lead to a very regrettable position.  Will the House pass a resolution asking both sides to enter meaningful discussion to ensure the continued success of the methadone programme?</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment, as I did not have the opportunity to do so last week, and I wish him well in his role.</P>
        <P>I refer to an important issue that involves many communities, both urban and rural.  I seek a debate on school transport catchment boundaries and traffic management audits and plans with a specific focus on the review of catchment boundaries.  In the area I come from, siblings are being separated and they can no longer attend the same schools.  Demographics have changed rapidly in many suburban and rural towns.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House for a debate?  This issue arises every September when schools resume and it needs to be urgently addressed.  School catchment boundaries have been in place for decades and are outdated.  The Joint Committee on Education and Science examined this issue during the previous Seanad but it should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the debate we had on the commencement of the new Seanad regarding reform of the House.  This issue should be examined and debated within the House.  The impression might be given of how democratic is the House.  A proposal was put before the people in 1937, which was voted on in 1938.  Almost 700,000 voted so that we could be elected in the manner we are &mdash; six from the university panels, 43 from the vocational panels and 11 nominated by the Taoiseach.  This has served the country well.  I propose the number of Members should be increased.  Given the  membership of the D&aacute;il <Col N="203"/>has increased from 120 to 166, there should be at least ten more Members.</P>

	<P>It would make sense.  Looking back, we should take pride in this House being the forerunner on debates on stem cell research during the previous Seanad and on abortion during the 1980s and 1990s.  A President was elected who was a former Senator while other former Members, such as Ken Whitaker, have become Ministers and MEPs and have done great things in other areas.  I commend to the House that we debate the matter with a view to increasing the number of Members under the current system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the state of our economy and the new information that has emerged in this regard in recent days, which is at the heart of many of the issues raised, including health and transport funding and so on.  The Leader and other Members on the Government side have stated their desire for the Minister for Finance to come to the House soon to discuss these issues.  I ask that the debate be brought forward because there has been much trumpeting about the importance of prudence.  However, given the scenario we are facing, it would appear the Government has been anything but prudent in how it forecasts for and manages the economy.</P>
        <P>I would like three issues, in particular, to be addressed in the debate, the first of which relates to budget forecasting.  Last year we had a budgetary surplus of &euro;2 billion and we are now on track for a budgetary deficit of &euro;1 billion, a difference of &euro;3 billion.  Last December the Minister for Finance stated we would have a deficit of approximately &euro;500 million.  As I have stated, it is now a multiple of that at &euro;1 billion.  How have we gone so wrong and in the space of only eight to nine months, how has there been such a significant change in the performance of our economy?  How has this only come to light after the general election?</P>
        <P>My second point relates to how the Government will respond.  It is crucial that whatever measures are taken do not undermine the confidence of people working within our economy already, making a difficult situation worse.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure that with whatever moves are taken, expenditure on social programmes is <Col N="204"/>not affected.  We cannot have those in our society who are either too young or too old paying a price for this.  They must be protected at all costs from any required changes.  I would appreciate it if the Leader would ask the Minister to come to the House to answer these questions and give assurances.</P>

With issues such as global warming being raised, these authorities will be called on over the next few years.  The financing of these bodies will be very important.</P>
        <P>Over recent years, we have financed local authorities very well and we are improving this finance all the time.  We cannot sit back on our laurels when we think of what must be done at local level.  I would like to find out what the Minister has in mind in that regard because he has stated he would look into the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Leyden in his call for a debate on the health services, especially the point he made regarding political accountability for such services, which has now been passed to Professor Drumm.  When the issue is raised, the Minister of the day almost has political immunity from being responsible for health services.  On its creation, the Health Service Executive was supposed to be a beacon of hope for the many thousands of people who wished to access services, but it has only been a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare.</P><Col N="205"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to explain the comprehensive dossier sent to the European Commission last Friday in response to a request relating to the local needs restriction affecting planning permissions which is contained in many local development plans.  Initially, the local needs restriction just referred to one-off rural housing, but the same restriction is now being used with estate development.  This is a serious issue as it may breach European rules on movement and freedom of capital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister was asked to comment on the content of the comprehensive dossier returned to the Commission last Friday but he has refused to do so.  That is very unfortunate.  The matter of one-off rural housing, planning and associated issues has been debated at length in this House over the last five years, with many fine contributions from all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dick Roche, when he was Minister in the Department, at least began to act on one-off rural housing and easing that type of restriction on local authorities through the introduction of guidelines.  They were not strong enough in my view but it was nonetheless a start.  Now, his successor is refusing to comment on the content of a very comprehensive dossier returned to the Commission last Friday.</P>

        <P>As my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on education and science, I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s request for a debate on catchment areas.  In my opinion, such a debate may come within the remit of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey.  However, the House should also encourage the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to attend the House to discuss preschool education.  Major investment has been made in first, second and third level education.  In light of the work Senator White will be doing in respect of young people, it would be timely to have a debate in respect of the latter.</P>
        <P>I support calls for a debate on the north west.  As a deputy spokesperson on issues relating to the North, I am also of the view that it would be timely to discuss the degree to which matters have progressed in the recent past on foot of the new dispensation and in light of the opportunities that exist for cross-Border co-operation.  It would be interesting to discuss the new political dispensation that has been facilitated by the Taoiseach and many others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s call for a debate on pensions.  I would welcome it if the relevant Minister would attend the House in the near future to facilitate such a debate.</P>
        <P>Has the Leader made any progress in the context of encouraging the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="206"/>Fisheries and Food to come before the House, as soon as possible, to discuss recent outbreaks of diseases in meat-producing animals on the neighbouring island?</P>
        <P>I agree with colleagues who requested a debate with the Minister for Finance regarding the figures that were published recently.  Such a debate should take place as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I also agree with those who raised the issue of the HSE and funding and cutbacks relating thereto.  We engaged in a number of debates &mdash; to one of which I contributed &mdash; on health last week.  There seems to be a growing belief among those on the Government benches as well as those in Opposition that the HSE is almost out of control.  The Taoiseach had difficulty answering a question on health in the Lower House and I not sure whether the issue relating to the answering of parliamentary questions there has been fully resolved.  Forums have been established across the country to facilitate councillors but, as far as I can see, these are not operating satisfactorily.  Briefings are held for Oireachtas Members, who are herded into Buswells Hotel, and everyone in the southern half of the country is invited to attend.  However, sufficient time is not provided to allow people to discuss health issues.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why the Department of Health and Children employs officials if, as currently appears to be the case, everything is being farmed off to the HSE.  I agree with Senator Leyden and I wish to provide a concrete example relating to duplication in the health service.  I was not particularly satisfied when the HSE was established and the health boards abolished but I was prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt.  As far as I am aware, however, the press offices that served the health boards remain in existence and those employed in them continue to issue press releases.  Surely the central office in Naas should provide this facility for the entire country.  If such a process cannot be streamlined within the HSE, then where the hell are we going?</P>

        <P>I join Senator Mullen in wishing Team Ireland the very best of look at the Special Olympics which will take place in Shanghai during the coming weeks.  This year, the team consists of 142 athletes, competing in 12 different sports, 55 coaches and 200 volunteers from the 18,000 involved in the Special Olympics movement in Ireland.  I know our athletes will do us proud, irrespective of whether they win, lose or draw.  This House certainly sends its best wishes to the athletes and their coaches.</P><Col N="207"/>
        <P>I join Senators Doherty and Keaveney, my colleagues in Donegal, in supporting the call for a debate on employment matters pertaining, although not exclusively, to our county.  I have reservations about the way the IDA implements Government policy in terms of creating jobs in the regions.  I would certainly like to put this issue to the Minister when he comes to the House.  Donegal and other Border counties have experienced huge difficulties as a result of the conflict in the north of Ireland.  Senator Keaveney is correct is saying that the institutions now up and running and power sharing will bring new life to the Border counties.  We should try to embrace this.  As I said here last week, it is also important that when the Minister of Finance comes to the House, the issue of a special dispensation or incentive for the Border counties will be on the agenda.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s call for the Minister responsible for school transport to come to the House.  My portfolio encompasses lifelong learning, youth work and school transport.  It is a sad day for those travelling on school transport because of the death of the 56-year-old male driver at High Street in Elphin, County Roscommon.  There were 26 pupils on the bus.  If one puts this in context, every morning and evening, 140,000 pupils go to and from school on the school transport system.  It costs the Exchequer &euro;111 million, approximately 5% of which comes from local contributions.  Since the accident on that dreadful day on 23 May 2005 much has been done to address many of the safety issues associated with school transport.</P>
        <P>Coming from local authority backgrounds, we are all aware of the HSE and what it is doing at the moment.  We should have a discussion on it and perhaps look at discussing the standard of some of the buses being used for school transport purposes.</P>

I must advise the House, particularly my great friend and colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole that I now rejoice in the title of Government spokesman on food and food health in the Seanad.  In this capacity, I assure the House and Senator O&rsquo;Toole I intend to embark immediately on very comprehensive research, including a rigorous programme of dining out in some of the best eating houses in the country.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the concert coming from the Government benches regarding the Health Service Executive, it is misplaced to make a virtue out of penalising patients.  Last month, senior management in the HSE paid themselves significant bonuses.  This month, we are told, the problems in the HSE are due to the failure of senior management to understand their own budgets.  How can someone pay himself or herself a bonus for doing such a good job, if he or she fails to understand what it means to manage a budget?</P>
        <P>Some Members on the Government benches run their own businesses and would not accept this carry-on from people working for them.  Neither would they accept it from those working for the people.  While this failure is not on the same scale as that of the Minister for Finance who had a &euro;2 billion surplus last year and is now facing a deficit of &euro;1 billion, the HSE&rsquo;s budgetary failure is affecting patient care.</P>
        <P>The issue is accountability, not warm sentiments about what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the HSE chief executive, Professor Drumm, are doing together.  This budget overrun equates to the same amount of moneys wasted on the PPARS project, &euro;220 million, which was switched off once the general election was over.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister told the House of the great job she is doing in the HSE.  When I asked what genuine reforms she introduced into the health services, she was silent.  There has been <Col N="209"/>little or no reform.  Senator Walsh might comment that &euro;3.5 billion was spent on the health services when he first entered the House ten years ago and that it is now &euro;15 billion.  It is easy to spend money; it is spending money well that is the problem.  That is where there is no accountability to the Houses.  Instead of Members on the Government side paying lip-service to the mess into which the HSE is evolving&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a U-turn on health policy by the Government.  While no one is reforming the public health system, it is being given over to the private sector which is not regulated by the statutory bodies established by the Government.  These are the matters to be debated in the House rather than paying lip-service to an unholy mess in the health services.  I know of many patients waiting since last February for basic diagnostic tests in one hospital but who cannot get them because the steriliser is not working.  The Members on the Government side need to open their eyes to what is happening in the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Leyden&rsquo;s call for a debate on the health services.  He has been consistent in his opposition to the recommendations of the Hanly report, attending along with myself and Senator Cassidy public meetings against it in Athlone.  I have serious concerns that acute operations will be finished and accident and emergency services will be downgraded at Portiuncula Hospital.  While we recently had a debate on health services, the extension of the freeze on employment in the health service was only announced yesterday.  The Minister needs to attend the House to debate this development.  She alluded to the fact that Athlone had low accident and emergency admission figures.  That is because there is no accident and emergency service in Athlone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeachas leis mo chara, Senator Wilson.  Little did I think when we were in college together that we would end up in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House so that we may have a debate, in light of the planned reform of the leaving certificate, taking cognisance of the fact that the views of teachers should be taken into account, given that they are primarily responsible for education.</P>
        <P>I do not want to rehash the debate in the House last week, but I request the Leader to seek clarification from his colleagues on the Government benches as to whether they are happy with the current recruitment freeze in the health service and the cutbacks.  Perhaps he will give his answer to the House because it is clear from <Col N="210"/>listening to Members opposite that everything is not rosy in the garden.  It is somewhat akin to<?oasys _jy ?>the old story that while Rome burned Nero fiddled.</P>
        <P>I have a serious matter to raise about which I want the Leader to seek clarification from the Taoiseach, as Head of Government.  It concerns the allegation, and I stress that word, that a serving Member of the Government, as reported by a journalist on a radio programme last week, has admitted to taking cocaine.  It is a very serious allegation.  We need urgent clarification since the use of cocaine is increasing.  While I accept the Government has an active anti-drugs strategy co-ordinated by a Minister of State, it is important that Ministers are answerable to the Oireachtas.  I ask the Leader to seek clarification, accordingly.  The Leader will agree that it would be inappropriate for a Minister to take drugs.  The quotation was, &ldquo;Yes, I take drugs, only coke, and I am not the only one&rdquo;.  That is quite a serious comment.  If it is true it deserves to be answered.  If it is untrue, then the Ministers concerned deserve to have their names cleared.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite a number of speakers were concerned at current developments in the HSE and called for a further debate on it.  As was stated by Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, the leader of the Progressive Democrats in the House, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney was here for two days last week.  These were very informative sessions.  I can certainly ask the Minister to try to find the time to come to the House and update us.  I suggest that might be later in the month, since she was only here last week.  There are other pressing problems, but &euro;14 billion is an enormous amount to spend.  We want to know why this is not percolating down to patients and on all sides of the House we want to see what we can do to help improve the situation. </P>
        <P>As regards calls, particularly by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Mullen, Coghlan and O&rsquo;Sullivan for a debate on the concerns of credit unions, these institutions have been among the country&rsquo;s great success stories.  Some 90% of the time, credit union depositors will know the personnel they deal with.  They are all local people of high standing in our towns and villages and have built up a lovely business in local communities in the course of the past 30 or 40 years.  I shall do everything possible to enhance or support the work of the credit unions and I certainly support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposal for a debate in the House.</P>
        <P>On the proposal to have the Minister of State with the responsibility for food address the House on the promotion of mutton, I accede to that unreservedly.  It is nice to hear our Kerry colleagues in the House, as the experts in this area.  We have always had much to learn from Members from the kingdom in the Oireachtas.  They are extremely successful whether in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  We certainly know they are here <Col N="211"/>because they are people of great vocal prowess and long may it continue.  There is no problem with that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Alex White and Paschal Donohoe called for a debate on the economy.  We have to be consistent.  I should not like this House to be a bad news Chamber.  The media home in on one Chamber.  I should like the Seanad to present the facts, reflecting how positive they are.  These are the figures from the Central Statistics Office.  They are not Senator Alex White&rsquo;s or Senator Donie Cassidy&rsquo;s figures.  The CSO indicated economic growth of 4.5% for the first half of this year.  These are facts, not just one-liners to be shown on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; later this evening.  These figures were released last Friday. </P>
        <P>The quarterly national accounts show that gross domestic product, GDP, in the first half of 2007 was &euro;90.7 million, an increase of &euro;5.7 million or 6.7% on the same period last year.  That does not reflect an economy that is heading for difficulty.  When it comes to employing people, I have as much experience as any other Member of this House, with the exception of one Senator.  Let us not talk down here.  The House comprises in the main all new young Members.  There are 25&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>She wanted a debate on tax harmony and suggested various speakers to address this.  If speakers are not to be members of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, that is a matter for the CPP, I understand.  As a member of the CPP, Senator O&rsquo;Malley can put that suggestion before the committee.  She will get considerable support as it is a good idea. </P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards No. 21 on the Order Paper, dealing with the issue of human trafficking, I certainly support the calls from Senators Norris and Mullen for a debate on that immediately if we can get agreement with party leaders at our next meeting.  I also agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris on litter wardens, increased litter fines and how important this is for the whole island as well as the beautiful city of Dublin.  Senators Doherty, Keaveney and &Oacute; Domhnaill called for Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address the Seanad in a debate on Donegal in particular.  With the House&rsquo;s permission, I should like to include the role of the IDA &mdash; and what it does or is not doing, in some cases &mdash; in this half-day debate that we will arrange with the agreement of the House.  Senator Healy Eames called for a debate about regional development and perhaps that might be included under this heading when the Minister comes to the House.  Senator Mary White also asked for this debate.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all colleagues whom the Taoiseach appointed today, in particular Senator White, who has done extraordinarily good work in the area to which she has been appointed today, namely children and senior citizens.  I wish her well and look forward to working with her.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen and &Oacute; Domhnaill proposed the House send its greetings and best wishes to our Olympians who are in Shanghai.  Some of us have had the pleasure of visiting that most beautiful city in the vast country of China.  It is certainly the career highlight of the 142 athletes concerned and everyone who has supported them.  Ireland can take a bow for its leadership in supporting people with special needs.  We wish them well from all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Jim Walsh and John Paul Phelan addressed the House on the serious challenge in relation to pensions.  I understand that a Green Paper is to be published on this subject by the <Col N="213"/>end of the year and I certainly will allow time in the House for a debate when it comes before us.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivor Callely expressed serious concern on behalf of the pharmacists about events that are proposed to occur over the next few days.  I shall certainly pass on his views to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Paudie Coffey, Cecilia Keaveney and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill made a worthwhile proposal that we have a discussion on school transport and catchment areas.  Senator Coffey was correct in stating that the catchment areas were last decided in the late 1960s.  Since then the population has grown and changed considerably.  I understand that consideration of this issue is at an advanced stage within the Department.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, and I have no difficulty with requesting him to come to the House to discuss this issue and listen to the concerns of Senators so that they may be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator John Hanafin expressed his views on Seanad reform.  This is a serious challenge for all Senators, and we will consider the issue in the future.</P>
        <P>Senator Larry Butler requested a debate on local government.  A Green Paper is to be published on this subject in January, so I suggest we delay this debate for two months so that we can have a half-day debate on the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael McCarthy, whose views I respect as he is a great colleague in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, requested a debate on environment and local needs, especially with regard to rural development.  Those of us who are fortunate enough to have been born, bred and reared to represent the people should do everything we can to ensure local needs are considered.  We must represent the people who elected us to this House without being dictated to by any force that interferes with the quality of life we enjoy in our communities.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan requested a debate on agriculture.  I will endeavour to allow this to take place over the next three to four weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Brendan Ryan suggested that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, come to the House to discuss the requirements of the city of Dublin over the next 25 to 30 years.  That is a worthwhile suggestion, and I will allocate time for this purpose.  As the Senator&rsquo;s party is responsible for Private Members&rsquo; business next week, if the Senator wishes to deal with this urgently, he might consult his colleagues about having the discussion during this time.  Senator Alex White can inform us of the decision in this regard later in the week.  Otherwise, it may take three to four<?oasys _jy ?>weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Jerry Buttimer called for a debate on education.  I have no difficulty with this taking place over the next month or so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move Amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&rdquo;(4) <i>Section 7 </i>shall come into operation on the enactment of this Act, and the remaining provisions of this Act shall come into operation on the first making of regulations under section 42A of the Principal Act inserted by <i>section 7</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The second amendment to this section proposes the inclusion of a new subsection (4) on commencement provisions and suggests, in effect, that the Act should not come into effect until such time as the public lending remuneration scheme is in place.  It is, however, crucial that this legislation comes into effect upon enactment.  As was made clear from the European Court of Justice decision against the State in January of this year, Ireland is in default of its obligations under the EU directive <Col N="215"/>on rental and lending and it is incumbent on us to comply with the decision as soon as possible.  In this regard, our immediate obligation is to provide an exclusive lending right for authors, and this exclusive right will be replaced by a right to remuneration upon the introduction of the public lending remuneration scheme.  It is not possible to await that development, given our immediate obligation to authors.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  However, I give a commitment to the House that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is working towards drafting the regulations to be made under this legislation before the end of the year and that the scheme itself will be in operation from 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment will deal precisely with the Minister&rsquo;s area of concern.  The Bill potentially contains a serious flaw in this respect.  There is no commencement date specified in the Bill, and in the normal run of events such a Bill commences upon its enactment.  This means that the exemption in the principal Act for lending by libraries will be repealed.  However, it will take some time for the regulations under section 7 to be made.  Unless the Minister can allay our concerns, it seems that libraries will be left in a legal limbo between the time of enactment and the arrival of the regulations.  For this reason, we propose a commencement provision which will allow section 7 to operate immediately but will prevent the repeal of the exemption for libraries until the regulations are made.  Otherwise, there may be a gap in which libraries are forced to stop lending books until the regulations are made.  The Bill in its current form does not appear to address this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

Perhaps the Minister of State &mdash; I do not expect the Leas-Chathaoirleach to do so because he is bound by the ruling &mdash; or someone could explain how one word means a charge on the Revenue while the other one does not.  It is utterly ridiculous.  This is undoubtedly going to be a charge on the Revenue whatever happens.  It is meant to be a charge on the Revenue.</P>

I raised this matter on Second Stage and suggested it would be preferable to insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because leaving the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies a discretion which, as the Minister of State said, we clearly do not have since we are in breach of European law.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) The Scheme should be overseen by a board or monitoring authority whose members shall include representatives from the Irish Writers Union and the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In a way this is an absurdity because we are now talking about moneys and situations which may not exist at all.   My amendment puts in place a situation where there should be a board or monitoring authority whose members shall include members of Irish Writers Union and the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency.  If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; means the Government is not going to do anything &mdash; the track record suggests this is the case &mdash; then there will be nothing for the board to oversee.  That also affects amendment No. 5.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 5 is about the disbursal of moneys from the scheme.  It is an attempt to follow what I am informed is best European practice in terms of the disbursal of moneys and it ensures not more than 10% of the moneys accruing shall be spent on administration.  This is an admirable practice.  The only charities I support in terms of famine relief and so on have this provision and state &ldquo;not more than 10%&rdquo; while some state &ldquo;not more than 5%&rdquo;.  The distinguished gentlemen who briefed me on this matter told me that in the case of the United Kingdom, a jurisdiction we frequently follow in terms of legislation, the sums spent on administration are less.  I urge the Government to accept these amendments.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that these amendments now become hypothetical because of the Government&rsquo;s refusal to accept the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In one sense, one could say Occam&rsquo;s razor comes into action as a philosophical principle and that it is absurd to discuss the <Col N="219"/>hypothetical disposition of non-existent moneys.  The moneys do not exist and if we accept the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in its most negative construction instead of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, they never will.  We are living in cloud-cuckoo-land.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State clearly tell me that he intends to fulfil the spirit of our European undertakings and our requirement to comply with European directives and that he will establish this scheme?  Will he give a commitment to establish such a scheme?  Will he assure the House the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s decision, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, is technical and is simply because it might create a charge on the Exchequer?  Will he give a commitment to the House to implement the scheme?  Will he address the substance of the two amendments?  Otherwise they become a complete nonsense.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 4, if one invokes the principle of subsidiarity, which is one of the great European catchcries, it is important that the bodies most directly concerned with this area have an advisory or monitoring role.  Surely it is appropriate that the Irish Writers Union, which represents the authors who will benefit from the scheme, is represented.  What is the point in having an Irish Copyright Licensing Agency if it is not included in this very important section of the legislation?  It is vital to the moral integrity of the scheme that the money allocated find its way to the authors and not be swallowed up in administration.</P>
        <P>Let me explain to the Minister of State that he was delayed in the anteroom because we were at it hammer and tongs in the House debating the Health Service Executive.  A point was made by Members throughout the House, including the honourable gentleman who so valiantly represents the Government on this side of the House, that a disproportionate amount of the health budget is wasted on the administration of the executive itself.  No Member wants this to be the case in respect of the proposed scheme.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom has implemented a similar scheme fully and appropriately under European regulations and it represents a pretty good model.  In 2006 and 2007, the scheme received &pound;7.65 million in grants-in-aid, of which &pound;6.81 million was distributed to authors.  This is the way it should be.  We must ensure not more than 10% is spent on administration.  Will the Minister of State, in his reply, give an undertaking that this scheme will be implemented?  That will satisfy my distinguished colleague, Senator Ross, and also Senator Bacik.  If the scheme is not implemented, it will be a farce and there will be no point whatever in our continuing to press these amendments.  They will be in the land of utopian imagination.</P>

	<P el="0">On Senator Norris&rsquo;s question on whether the scheme will be implemented, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is putting through the legislation and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for the operation of the scheme.  It is preparing regulations at present and intends the scheme to be in operation from January 2009.</P>

	<P>Does it?</P>

	<P>That is its intention and it is our intention that it will operable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I take that as a qualified &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senators allow the Minister of State to finish?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On amendment No. 4, it is the intention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish an advisory committee representing all stakeholders involved, including authors, editors and illustrators, to advise on policy and the operation of the scheme.  This undertaking has already been made publicly by the Minister.  The Minister contends there is a need to maintain flexibility with regard to participation in that committee.  As experience shows, particular organisations often change over time and it would not be appropriate <Col N="221"/>to be so prescriptive in primary legislation as the amendment proposes.  However, the commitment to establish the advisory committee is a fair concession to meeting the Senators&rsquo; concerns.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not exclude representation by the bodies mentioned in the amendment.</P>
        <P>While I certainly accept the spirit of amendment No. 5, also in the names of Senators David Norris, Joe O&rsquo;Toole and Feargal Quinn, I do not consider it appropriate for inclusion in primary legislation.  It is the intention of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna to minimise costs where possible and, in this regard, it is drawing on the experience of the UK public lending rights authorities in respect of joint registration, software, sharing of operating systems etc.  We need to allow for contingencies in the future, such as additional EU requirements, particular forms of training for staff or the once-off purchase of information technology, and it would be therefore unwise to insert a prescriptive limit of the nature proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State will forgive my scepticism regarding  his reply.  When a Minister or Minister of State &mdash; I refer to none in particular &mdash; states in the House that he wants flexibility on an appointment, I usually smell a rat.  When he claims he does not want a prescriptive clause, I become even more suspicious.  Senator David Norris&rsquo;s suggestion that there be a prescriptive right accorded to the Irish Writers&rsquo; Union, the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency and, perhaps, others is perfectly reasonable because these bodies are eminently well-qualified and non-political.  They should, almost by right, be allowed to participate in the body in question.</P>
        <P>Neither the present Government nor any other in the history of this State has a proud record regarding political appointments.  The legislation implies the appointees of the Minister rather than those with independent expertise in this area will have the right to be on the advisory board.  Having noted similar cases so often, I believe this board will be in danger of becoming another convenient outlet for political patronage.</P>
        <P>I do not recognise any sign of the Government being unwilling to make prescriptive appointments in other areas.  We have a social partnership industry in this State where the prescriptive rights of trades unionists and employers to various meaningless committees or State boards or agencies that carry overpaid salaries for very little work are almost embedded in the law and regulations.</P>
        <P>In respect of the body in question, the Minister of State wants to maintain what he refers to as &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  It would be far more sensible if this Bill, which is uncontentious politically, allowed those with expertise in this area rather than those who may have political expertise and political <Col N="222"/>loyalties to honour to have rights to sit on the advisory committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that the Minister of State has indicated clearly that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will set up a small committee or board to oversee the distribution of the funds.  We could go through a long list in the House and in doing so, I would have to say the Library Association of Ireland should be a stakeholder because it represents all the public libraries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This body includes appointees who have been elected by the people to serve on councils.  I always find it quite difficult to understand why people with expertise in a field must be debarred from membership of an organisation because they have been elected as members of local authorities.  We cannot go through a list of all the bodies that could be represented on the committee.  A quite small sum of money is involved and we are making a mountain out of a molehill regarding this Bill.  I appreciate that this is one of the first Bills to pass through the new Seanad and we are anxious to sink our teeth into larger ones, such as the companies Bill, in this session.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State bear in mind the recommendations of this House?  At this point it is impossible for this House to compile a list of those who would be suitable to serve on the body being established.  The Minister of State may decide, after due reflection, that it would be worthwhile to provide for the establishment of the board in this legislation.  The Bill should not refer to the specific membership of the board, but it should allow the appropriate Minister to establish a board to oversee and monitor the distribution of funds.  Perhaps the Minister of State and his officials will consider such an approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will clarify one aspect of this matter.  When I was Minister of State in the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is now known as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it was the lead Ministry responsible for bringing all European legislation into Irish law.  People do not realise that the Department dealt with all other Departments.  I appreciate the background to this problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is introducing this Bill because it is a copyright Bill.  However, the implementation of the Bill is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is responsible for the library services.  That is quite understandable.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may decide he needs to bring regulations before the House for consideration before this legislation is enacted.  Senators recommend that he should consider including in <Col N="223"/>the Bill a provision whereby the monitoring committee would be established under this legislation.  The officials should consider this proposal in advance of Report Stage.  We should not have to depend totally on the Minister of the day to introduce regulations to establish the monitoring committee.  I make that point respectfully as someone who worked in the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  I understand that this Bill is urgently needed &mdash; we are under starter&rsquo;s orders as far as Europe is concerned.  Perhaps all of us share responsibility for the failure to introduce this legislation in the past.  We got derogations for everything at EU level for quite a long time; we got derogations in this regard as well.  Some worthwhile points have been made to the Minister of State and his officials today.  I ask them to consider the various possibilities before Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree that Senators Norris and Ross have made some fair and equitable points.  I do not think they disagree with the point about the Library Association of Ireland that was so ably advanced by Senator Leyden.  We need to reflect on the core objective of this Bill.  When one considers the expertise and knowledge of the Irish Writers&rsquo; Union and the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, it is clear that they have the greatest right to act on behalf of the writers who own the copyright to their material.  It should almost be a <i>sine qua non</i>.  I fully support the amendment in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make the views of Senators Norris and Ross known to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Some of the insinuations made by Senator Ross about people who have been appointed to boards by all parties over the years were totally overboard.</P>

I accept that commitment absolutely and I am glad that it has been given.  It also means I was correct to follow his invitation to withdraw my suggestion that the Government had tampered with the Cathaoirleach.  Like Senator Ross, I am inclined to be cynical.

I thank Senator Leyden, who is qualified in this area and has a long-standing interest in and professional acquaintance with it, for expressing his support.  It is significant that such support is coming from the Government benches.  I know the Minister of State will carry that back to his colleague in the other Department.  I will not name the two distinguished gentlemen in the Visitors Gallery who have given briefings in this area.

	<P>This Bill, as initiated, proposes to repeal section 58 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 in its entirety.  Since the Bill was published, I have received and reviewed observations about the proposal.  The commission took particular exception to the provision in section 58 that under the section and any statutory instrument made under it, all public libraries and educational establishments were, in effect, exempt from the requirement to remunerate authors for the lending of their works.  While it is intended to introduce a public lending right in respect of the lending of works in public libraries, the exemption in respect of educational establishments should remain in place if such establishments are not involved in public lending but are in the nature of advancing teaching and research in our schools and universities.  Senators might recall that during my Second Stage speech, I flagged my intention to introduce an amendment to this section involving an amendment to section 58, as opposed to its repeal.  I hope the amendment will be accepted given that it is intended to continue with the exemption in respect of public lending for educational establishments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 6:</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the Minister, by an educational establishment which is so prescribed for the purposes of this section or comes within a category of educational establishment that is so prescribed&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My amendment to amendment No. 6 has been tabled because that amendment proposes, in effect, to remove educational institutions from the operation of the new legislation altogether.  The purpose of the amendment I suggest is to limit in two ways this blanket exemption for educational establishments.  First, I propose that the Minister be given the right to prescribe conditions for the loans.  Second, I propose that the Minister be given the power to prescribe categories of establishment.  We are all familiar with educational establishments, such as universities, and the great libraries associated with them.  There is no difficulty in agreeing to the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal in that regard.  Is there anything to prevent a video shop or some other similar retail <Col N="226"/>outlet from rebranding itself as a video educational institute and starting to lend videos without having to respect the rights of the owners of intellectual property being given out by way of loans?  Whereas we all understand the spirit of the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention, the use of the term, &ldquo;educational institution&rdquo; may not necessarily cover all eventualities.  We have all seen new outlets and new retail bodies springing up and it is not certain that one of them might not one day decide it is an educational institution.  This is the basis for the proposal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This raises the question of private institutions and educational establishments.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have an excellent library.  Would this be defined as an educational or a public library?  It is a type of private club but Members of the Oireachtas are elected representatives, even though they are the only people entitled to take out books on loan.  Will such libraries be governed by this Bill?</P>
        <P>I refer to the library of the RDS, which is one of the finest libraries in the city of Dublin.  It was established before these Houses and its books are very valuable.  Will that library&rsquo;s copyright rights or charges be covered by the Government?  It would be difficult for the RDS to continue lending books from its library if it were required to pay copyright to authors.  I note the excellent university libraries and school libraries are covered by the Department of Education and Science, but I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on the case of private libraries such as the RDS lending books to the public.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Alex White for raising this matter.  On a point of clarification, my advice indicates that the phraseology in the Government amendment is more succinct in that the term, &ldquo;educational establishment&rdquo;, is already defined in section 2(1) of the principal Act.  An order has been made under that section identifying the establishments covered by this definition.</P>
        <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Leyden, the legislation deals only with public libraries which are accessible to the public and libraries such as the Oireachtas Library or the RDS library are not covered.  Consequent on the advice, I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Government amendment.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on his first visit to the Seanad as Minister and I congratulate him on his appointment.  I wish him well.  He has been efficient in the past and, hopefully, will be so in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister.  I should first apologise to my Seanad colleagues for the clogging of their e-mail in-boxes with approximately 20,000 e-mails that have been sent by supporters of Friends of the Earth, the NGO with which I worked on this Bill, and supporters of other NGOs, seeking their sup<Col N="229"/>port for the Bill.  Some supporters are also present for the debate in the Seanad tonight and I welcome their support.</P>
        <P>I have great pleasure in presenting this Bill to the House.  Climate change is, without doubt, the biggest challenge facing humanity in the 21st century.  There is no longer any doubt that it is happening and that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are its main cause.  Everybody is in favour of doing something about it but the question is, what can be done?  I have been working for some time with Friends of the Earth Ireland &mdash; I am a member of its board &mdash; to ensure practical steps are taken towards addressing this enormous challenge.  A vital practical step is to ensure a strong legal framework to underpin the Government&rsquo;s stated commitment to tackling climate change.</P>
        <P>Climate change has been the main priority for Friends of the Earth since the organisation was launched in Ireland in 2004.  Last April, I and my colleagues drafted this Bill and since then, supported by other environmental and development NGOs, we have launched an Act for Climate campaign which seeks support for the principle that a law should be passed placing an enforceable duty on Government to make necessary cuts every year in greenhouse gas emissions.  That is what this Bill seeks to do.  It provides for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by setting both annual and long-term targets.  It sets an ongoing statutory goal of reducing emissions by at least 3% per year from 2010 and a long-term goal of reducing emissions by at least 60% in 2050.  These percentages relate to the baseline emissions figures measured in 1990 and are based on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and within the EU.</P>
        <P>Support for the campaign on this Bill has been widespread and cross-party.  Grassroots lobbying of the last D&aacute;il by supporters persuaded a majority of Deputies to sign a pledge that Ireland must do its fair share to prevent runaway climate change.  Yesterday, the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, a broad based coalition of Ireland&rsquo;s main environmental and development charities, including Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid and others, strongly stated its support for the Bill.  In theory, there is consensus about the need to tackle climate change.  There are also international obligations on Ireland to act.  Under the UN Kyoto Protocol, which was negotiated in 1997 and is now ratified by more than 160 countries, industrialised countries committed themselves to reducing collective greenhouse gas emissions by 5% between 1990 and 2010.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under Kyoto was to limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above its 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.</P>
        <P>The EU has undertaken further commitments, agreeing to reduce emissions by 20% by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, and is also committed to increasing the reduction to 30% in the context of comprehensive post-Kyoto agreements which are due to be discussed in Bali in December.  These are ambitious targets and Ireland willingly signed <Col N="230"/>up to them.  The problem is that Ireland is nowhere near meeting any of the targets.  Ireland is at present the fifth most climate polluting country per person in the OECD.  The Environmental Protection Agency has calculated that in 2005, the last year for which it had detailed figures, our greenhouse gas emissions were already at 65.95 million tonnes, that is, 25% above the 1990 baseline figure.  This makes it difficult, even for somebody as mathematically challenged as me, to see how we can reduce that figure to 13% above the baseline 1990 figure by 2012.</P>
        <P>The EPA also noted that the most significant and sustained increase in emissions, measuring 160% between 1990 and 2005, was in the transport sector, due largely to increased road transportation.  However, previous Governments continued to build roads and car ownership has increased, with a worrying trend towards purchases of gas guzzling SUVs at the expense of smaller, more fuel efficient and less polluting cars.  Last April, in recognition of the problems faced in meeting the Kyoto targets, the outgoing Government published a detailed national climate change strategy to ensure compliance.  There are many shortcomings with this strategy and it appears to be inadequate, relying largely on emissions trading schemes.</P>
        <P>In fairness, the new Government has adopted a more radical strategy, committing itself to a reduction of 3% per year up to 2012, to a cross-party approach to emissions targets and mandating the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish an annual report setting out progress on meeting climate change targets.  There is also a commitment to an outline carbon budget to be presented each year.  This is in the programme for Government, which I welcome.  In addition, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, made a speech last week reinforcing and emphasising the determination of the Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The changed political climate is welcome.</P>
        <P>This Bill is based upon a prevailing consensus and nothing in the Bill is not already Government policy.  In some ways, the Bill is less radical than the commitments in the programme for Government, which is ironic given that the Bill was drafted last April.  The Bill does not require 3% cuts in emissions from 2008, as Government policy does, but allows for a lead-in period between now and 2010 to set in place the strategies necessary to ensure ongoing reductions.  There is nothing in the Bill with which the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his colleagues in Government should be able to disagree in principle.  It represents consensus about climate change.</P>
        <P>It might be argued that legislation is unnecessary, that political commitments are sufficient and that what is required is national strategies, such as those launched in November 2000 and last April.  My reply is that legislation is essential; the issue is far too important to leave to political <Col N="231"/>commitments.  We must ensure this and future Governments will be bound to follow emissions reduction strategies.  That is probably the most important reason for enacting legislation, rather than leaving it to political promises.</P>
        <P>Legislation is the best way to express all-party agreement.  We know it is the best way to ensure we fulfil our international obligations under Kyoto and we know from unfortunate experience in other fields that political promises and national strategies are simply not enough in practice.  Despite our commitments under Kyoto and previous national strategies, we have seen rises in our greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>We saw political promises being broken by successive Governments on issues such as hospital waiting lists, which the previous Government promised to abolish and which we may consider rather bitterly now, school class size reductions and public transport initiatives.  All of these were political promises and commitments made but not enshrined in legislation.  All too often these promises are reduced to noble aspirations rather than to binding commitments.  In this case, we cannot afford to let climate change and the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fall into the same trap of noble aspiration.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows of the international awareness that political promises on climate change should be enshrined in a legal framework to give them teeth.  Notably, California &mdash; a large economy &mdash; introduced into law a commitment of 80% reduction by 2050 with an interim target set for 2020.  Other similar bills are proposed in the US Senate, including one co-sponsored by John McCain and Barack Obama.  This shows the growing awareness across parties on the need for action on this issue, including in such polarised opposites as Republicans and Democrats in the US.  Closer to home, the UK Government recently published a very comprehensive climate change bill.  Senators who have seen it are aware it commits to five-year targets and carbon budgets.  This recognises the need for legislation.</P>
        <P>We know that Governments, caught in the five-year election cycle, have difficulties with long-term targets.  We know we do not have a shortage of good ideas and proposals on how to reduce carbon emissions.  Some of these are in the latest Government strategy and others were in the previous strategy.  We need a guarantee that these strategies and others will be implemented and that commitments will be met.  A law requiring year-by-year reductions as well as setting long-term targets will drive innovation in reducing emissions in public policy, private enterprise and all our personal behaviour.</P>
        <P>A law is the best way to ensure we have a Government commitment across the Cabinet and that this is not a matter merely seen as the preserve of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  For all these reasons, I introduce this Bill to the House and I <Col N="232"/>will briefly outline what it contains.  It provides for definitions of greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction of those emissions by setting annual and long-term targets.  It places duties on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure the achievement of these targets, it obliges the Minister to provide annual reports to both Houses of the Oireachtas and it specifies actions to be taken if targets are not met giving power to the Oireachtas to devise strategies to ensure they will be met.  The Bill creates a new expert commission on climate change to oversee its provisions and to advise and assist the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Climate Protection Bill provides us with an opportunity to put Ireland in the lead among other nations in tackling climate change.  The adoption of this Bill will send a clear signal that Ireland is fully committed to doing its share to prevent climate chaos.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the privilege of seconding the Bill.  I congratulate my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, for introducing this important legislation.  I also congratulate her on breaking a long-standing rule of the Independent benches by finishing on time.  I must explain to her that we do not do so.</P>
        <P>It is a pleasure to welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to the House.  He knows it is heartfelt.  He and I spent many years discussing, arguing and cogitating on these matters.  Senator Bacik dealt closely with the business of the Bill and I will widen the debate.  As the Minister is present, it is worthwhile examining what the strategies might include.  An important aspect of the Bill is that it ties us in.  It reminds me of the Minister&rsquo;s speech during the general election campaign when he discussed five stages and year-by-year benchmarks.  I like benchmarks and benchmarking is my thing.  I will support the Minister all the way on this.</P>
        <P>Six months ago in this House I made three requests.  I asked that every house built in this country would be required to have a solar panel or another renewable energy source.  I asked that we get rid of the daft system invented by the Department for measuring insulation and heat loss and come to the international and only worthwhile standard of measuring the kilowatt hours of energy required to heat a cubic metre of a house for one year.  Last Saturday week, the Minister made a statement in Wicklow which included those two matters.  If I do nothing else in politics, I feel this is important.</P>
        <P>The third request I made ties in with the issue.  Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill goes through various types of emissions of which the first listed is carbon and the second is methane.  It is important to recognise that methane is 20 times as virulent, dangerous and damaging as carbon.  Nonetheless, every landfill in the country shoves methane into the <Col N="233"/>atmosphere at an extraordinary pace.  We must do something about this.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I never agreed on the matter of chemically dealing with waste.  I do not know the answer to what is the best way to deal with it.  Recently, I met a group which established a research centre at the University of Limerick.  It has a completely closed way of dealing with waste with no emissions, olfactory or otherwise.  It also captures methane.  I was agog when I met those people approximately two weeks ago.  I told them they must meet the Minister and I hope they contacted him.  They told me they could build a plant for &euro;30 million which would deal with 300 million tonnes per year.  I heard that figure with regard to another matter in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency.  This is a much better idea.</P>
        <P>I raise these issues because in terms of the society we want to create, any community which takes full responsibility for looking after all its waste and energy needs should get a tax break.  I stated this to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor and he pooh-poohed the idea.  I was born in west Kerry and examined how much it would cost there.  I examined the amount of energy used for electricity on the peninsula during the course of a year.  New unseen wind generators which produce 1.5 MW could produce enough energy and feed it into the grid.  The Minister speaks about creative and exciting ideas.  This is an exciting idea through which we would all gain.  It is a Chinese bargain and everyone is a winner.  It is the only way to do it.</P>
        <P>I am aware energy is only related to the issue and his colleague will deal with it.  Given technological advances, it is now easy to create microenergy such as microhydro-electric energy.  If a wind generator is established in Newry or if one creates slightly more energy than one requires in one&rsquo;s house and it goes back into the grid, the utility pays one for it.  This does not happen in the South.  This could be done in the morning.  It is a matter of one regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and look forward to it.  It is only pennies but this is about attitude.</P>
        <P>The important aspect of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill is that it is concerned with meeting our solemn commitments under Kyoto.  Kyoto was not dreamt up when we sat around a table.  We signed up to it.  During the past month temperatures warmer than we have here today were recorded in the Arctic where it was 20&deg;.</P>
        <P>To those who state the climate change issue is a left-wing plot I ask them to remember their grannies saying not to waste.  I ask them to do that even if they do not agree with us, but I know the Minister does.  Let us not get involved in this argument.  There are daft people who think this <Col N="234"/>is not an issue.  Let us not waste time with them, rather tell them to speak to their grannies and not waste time.  That would be a good start.</P>
        <P>I am slightly concerned about biomass.  I am concerned that we have not made enough progress on ethanol and the various bio-fuels.  It is interesting to note that this year, Irish farmers gained substantially because of the move towards alternative energy.  Large chunks of the mid-west of Canada and the United States, instead of growing wheat, began to grow crops to produce bio-fuels and bioenergies, which resulted in a doubling of the price of wheat.  The Minister should say that.  He should tell the Irish farmer there is a gain to be made.  This is a new industry and there is money in it for everybody.  Irish farmers doubled their harvest tonnage this year and they do not know why.  Somebody should tell them.</P>
        <P>My colleague raised the issue of carbon emissions trading.  I have a slightly connected interest in that area.  I agree we cannot rely on that.  While we will never have a negative carbon footprint, we need to have regulated carbon trading, but only as part of and at the end of a process.  This industry is full of cowboys.  Carbon emissions trading can only be done if certified and verified by the UN and if the audit on what is being done, whether dealing with a sink in India or something in Ireland, is carried out by auditors who are approved and recognised.  What is happening at present is that people buy carbon credits on the Internet &mdash; what are called verified carbon credits.  We need the same standards of auditing as for company auditing.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will welcome and support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill in the name of the Independent Senators.  It would be a major step forward.  Like the butterfly in the Amazon, it would send shockwaves throughout Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Gormley on his appointment as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have no doubt he will do a good job in that Department.</P>
        <P>When we speak about climate change and greenhouse gases, it is imperative to realise that Ireland probably has had a greater increase owing to our economic development over the past ten to 15 years.  This has probably contributed to the fact that we have had problems with greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>There is a need for an across the board political approach to problems such as those identified in the Bill.  We all want to see the environment and our climate protected.  In recent years we have seen the climate change that has taken place.  In that climate change our summers have become wetter and our winters much warmer.  We no longer have the five or six weeks of frost some of us experienced in the 1960s.  We have not had such frost for the past ten to 15 years, nor did we have one week of continual frost last winter.  This proves there is climate change.</P><Col N="235"/>
        <P>We can do either of two things.  Like some people, such as the Americans and the Chinese, we can ignore it and say we will continue to play and let the others try to do the rectification.  That is not the proper approach.  This matter should be approached on a worldwide basis.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole who said it should be monitored by an independent body such as the United Nations or some other worldwide group.</P>
        <P>When we speak about greenhouse gases, we must look at how to deal with our waste problems right across the board.  Every sector in the country has a waste problem, from the ordinary householder to the largest industry.  Fossil fuels and transport are two of the most significant polluters in the country.  If we are to remain economically viable, we must have transport.  Owing to the size of the country, public transport is not always the answer, especially when it comes to dealing with the haulage of commercial goods.  Many in business will say it is much cheaper to load the container in the factory and send it directly to the port than to load it in the factory, send it to a rail head and have it unloaded again.  This is because the costs are too high.  Therefore, owing to our size we will always have to depend mainly on transport for industries and exports.</P>
        <P>In the area of household waste, many are still not aware of what can or cannot be recycled.  Occasionally we see the odd private fire, especially on a Saturday night or Sunday morning, when somebody decides he or she wants to get rid of waste.  It is unacceptable that this should happen in modern times and nobody wants to see it because people are becoming much more responsible.</P>
        <P>The cost of recycling frightens many people.  We have seen the development of large waste management and waste recycling companies.  Some of the largest companies have become very involved in it which means it must be a profitable venture.  However, is it profitable at the expense of the State or the consumer?  That is an issue that needs to be examined.  We would all like that everything that can be recycled to be recycled, but in this case the costs are starting to outstrip the viability.  If that happens, there will be serious problems in maintaining recycling programmes and projects.  We all know there are a large number of alternatives to deal with some of these situations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all accept there should be further incentives for alternative energy sources.  The proof that the public accept it is that the recent allocation for energy projects for houses was taken up so quickly that the Minister has to announce a new programme either this week or next week.  That shows that people are becoming very aware of climate change and their need to make a contribution to prevent it.  There is not much sense in our making every effort when President Bush appears to be opposed to signing up to the worldwide climate change programme, as are the <Col N="236"/>Chinese and a number of the major industrial players in the world.  We should start to apply pressure on these groups to get them involved on a continual basis with a view to reducing greenhouse gases.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other areas where we could improve our environmental record.  Bio-digesters will have a major role to play so far as agriculture is concerned.  There is no doubt that agriculture is a major contributor but we must ensure it is allowed to continue to prosper.  Let nobody be under any illusions, whoever is in this House in 15 or 20 years&rsquo; time will be speaking about food and food shortage.  That is happening already.  I heard the Minister for Agriculture and Food answer questions in the D&aacute;il today on the cost of energy projects that are taking wheat and other crops off the market.  That is evident in the agriculture sector where the increase in feed prices has been of the order of 60% or 70% during the past 12 months.  We examine all the elements.</P>
        <P>I hope the House can have a full debate on this subject in the coming months.  While the Bill will probably satisfy some people, we must have a full approach and ensure we do everything possible to make our contribution.  However, there is not much sense in making our contribution while some of the largest players turn what we do on its head.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House as the new Fine Gael spokesperson on the environment, health and local government.  I compliment the Independent Senators on introducing into the House this very worthy Bill, which Fine Gael will support.  The Bill sets clearly defined targets and requires systemic reporting systems and a legal framework for the delivery of those targets.</P>
        <P>We all realise that climate change is the most pressing issue facing the world and the facts speak for themselves.  According to the UN, 11 of the past 12 years rank among the warmest years in global surface temperatures since 1850.  The average rate of warming over the past 50 years is nearly twice that of the previous 100 years.  Carbon dioxide is the dominant contributor to current climate change and its atmospheric concentration has increased by more than one third since the Industrial Revolution.  The rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century and the total 20th century rise is estimated to be almost one fifth of a metre.  Geological observations indicate that the sea level rise over the previous 2,000 years was considerably less.  Approximately 20% to 30% of plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5&deg; to 2.5&deg;.  Those are stark facts and the alarm bells are ringing.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is very proud of its environmental policies and plans to make a number of proposals <Col N="237"/>to help us reach our international targets.  For examples bio-fuels have the potential to provide huge benefit to farmers, the environment and the economy.  Most European states have begun the process of kick-starting the bio-fuel industry by using set-aside land for the growth of bio-fuel crops.  Ireland needs to act now if we are to reach European standards.</P>
        <P>To kick-start the bio-fuel industry, we call for a number of steps to be taken and Fine Gael commits to taking them.  All excise duty should be removed from bio-fuels produced from renewable energy crops, which would drive down costs and entice more players into the market.  We urgently need the establishment of grants for producer groups to cover 50% of the costs of establishing such a group subject to a maximum of &euro;300,000 per group.  A public competition should be held for the establishment and operation of a number of bio-fuel processing plants strategically located in a selected number of locations.  Capital start-up grants for these processing plants would initially be given to enable them to become established and begin viable processing operations.  Greater links between international bio-fuel processors and fuel suppliers and the relevant Departments, especially the Departments of Transport and the Marine and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to facilitate the promotion of the bio-fuel industry are vital.</P>
        <P>Production cannot flourish, however, without a market for what is produced.  At the moment, the growth of bio-fuels is hampered by the absence of any serious outlets where they can be sold, which is crazy.  Bio-fuels are indigenous, reliable and increasingly more economical, which is why Fine Gael proposes to legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuels from renewable sources.  All petrol sold at filling stations should include a 5% bioethanol mix and all diesel should include a 2% biodiesel mix.  This would not necessitate the conversion of standard motor engines and would represent a good start in reducing vehicle emissions &mdash; all very tangible and practical proposals.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight other areas that need attention if we are to achieve our targets.  We need to do more to incentivise the use of renewable energies, especially in the domestic market.  I acknowledge the work of Sustainable Energy Ireland in this field already.  It is doing its best with limited resources to raise awareness in the community of new ways to use renewable energies.  We also need to introduce programmes to grant aid the insulation of private dwellings over a certain age.  We are burning thousands of gallons of oil trying to heat houses that are not energy efficient.</P>
        <P>We also need to consider incentives for businesses to reduce emissions and help them utilise renewable energy.  Some of them are already using combined heat processing, CHP, plants that capture, recycle and reuse energy.  We should be doing more of that.  The Government needs to <Col N="238"/>start with public buildings and institutions which need to be audited for their carbon footprint with a view to controlling waste and improving energy efficiencies.  Areas of waste such as fuel, paper and heat need to be addressed.  It would be worth considering starting here in Leinster House.</P>
        <P>Education will be important in trying to achieve our targets.  The green school scheme is working quite well.  While they have a high level of participation, we need to step it up to the next level.  We need to educate our citizens, small and medium enterprises, and industry.  We need to consider public and private transport systems.  They need to be audited on their energy use and their proposals to improve on waste and efficiencies in fuel use and journeys taken, which are areas with huge potential for us to increase our efficiencies.</P>
        <P>We need to build into the future development programmes of all Government agencies a clearly defined policy that is properly resourced and identifies areas to implement our target programmes.  We need to work together to achieve this target and we in Fine Gael will certainly do all in our power in this regard.  I again compliment the Independents on introducing the Bill and we look forward to working with all parties across the House to achieve our targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also thank the Independent group and, in particular, Senator Bacik for introducing this legislation.  As a Member of the other House I introduced approximately half a dozen Bills with varying degrees of success &mdash; in fact none.  I well know the difficulties in drafting a Bill to ensure it complies with the very strict rules that apply in respect of ensuring there are no cost implications for the State.  It is very difficult for an Opposition Member to produce satisfactory legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of an ongoing process of Oireachtas reform, however, the Green Party would like to facilitate Members of both Houses to contribute more to the legislative process.  There are obvious areas that are the concern of the Government, including the day-to-day running of the country, the economy, defence, security and foreign affairs.  However, responsibility for the making of legislation should be shared for both Houses of the Oireachtas and all Members.  We all need to tackle the inequality in how legislation is produced to make us better legislators.  On those grounds this is a fine Bill to produce, especially as it comes on only the fourth sitting day of the 23rd Seanad.</P>
        <P>In general, my party can support the Bill because it covers precisely the matters we have been saying and repeats many of the commitments we have secured in the programme for Government.  It is our hope that everything contained in this Bill will come to pass.  However, a significant proviso needs to be added.  I say this following the contribution of the main Opposition party.  The wording in the programme for <Col N="239"/>Government calls for cross-party agreement.  We do not believe that party politics can be played with the issue of climate change and global warming.  We need a type of Tallaght strategy for the environment, which might be particularly uncomfortable for the party opposite because it means collectively&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be also uncomfortable for the Green Party&rsquo;s Government partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are perfectly comfortable &mdash; perhaps too comfortable with the heating in here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We will wait and see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The need for a type of Tallaght strategy on climate change means that all public representatives need to be involved in a process of education and change.  All of us in this country and through whatever role we can play internationally are aware, because of the nature of the environmental challenges facing us, that we must change the way we live and work and the way we travel.  Without such changes, anything we might say in a debate such as this merely represents platitudes.  If we do not address the core issue of how we came to this situation, we will not go any closer to solving the central problems.</P>
        <P>Certain people have been frivolous in their contributions in suggesting, for example, that a little global warming might be good for Ireland and might result in having grapevines in County Wexford.  However, I point Members to the iconic picture a few years ago of the Taoiseach in his wellingtons when the River Tolka flooded.  With the scale of climate change it is not beyond the scope of possibility that a similar picture in a number of years&rsquo; time will see a Head of Government wearing a wetsuit in a similar situation and perhaps we will have a real flood tribunal then.  The effects of climate change, even in a country like Ireland, will mean rapidly changing climatic conditions which will worsen owing to other environmental effects such as coastal erosion and possibly even the diversion of the Gulf Stream, which gives us a slightly warmer climate than we are entitled to.  Ireland is on the same latitude as Newfoundland.  Our winters should be similar to those experienced in Moscow.  The climate change that could occur if we do not get our act together could result in many unfortunate people becoming more unfortunate because of their inability to adapt.</P>
        <P>By getting our act together environmentally, we will do ourselves a huge favour economically.  Ireland is 80% dependent on fossil fuels and 90% dependent on foreign fuel sources.  Alternative technologies to produce renewable energy should be developed so that Ireland would be at a great <Col N="240"/>advantage economically as it faces new challenges.  However, we have delayed too long and prevaricated while opportunities have been taken by other countries.  For instance, Denmark is similar in size to Ireland with a population of 5 million and it meets 25% of its energy needs through wind energy.  Ireland has greater capacity and it could build turbines to produce energy and create jobs.  This would result in the State paying less to oil rich states in the Middle East and other countries from whom we purchase energy resources.</P>
        <P>Members cannot wind back the clock and say the failures of previous Governments have not been addressed.  We must start here and move forward collectively.  This is why I hope the debate will continue beyond this session.  An important international gathering will take place in Bali in early December and, while the Minister will contribute later in the debate, I hope that rather than completing Second Stage tonight, the debate will be adjourned and resumed following the discussion at international level when Ireland&rsquo;s role will be examined, and I would like the Government to introduce necessary changes in the meantime.  Members can comment on my proposal later.</P>
        <P>We largely agree with the Bill.  Distinctions are made regarding targeting.  For instance, annual targeting is not referred to directly in the programme for Government.  A 3% average over the lifetime of the Government is mentioned because it is difficult to achieve annual targets.  To date, a slowdown in the rate of increase in greenhouse gases is all that has been achieved.  It is likely that last year&rsquo;s level will be repeated this year or there might by a slight increase.  It could be 18 months or two years into the life of the Government before reductions are achieved.  Many of the changes we are making might not take that long to take effect.  That is the danger of annual limits.  Despite it being a difficult target to achieve, I am confident we can aspire to 3% but only if that is done collectively.  If there is political dissension on this issue, I would despair that we could even come close to achieving that target, as business would continue as usual.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a mechanism whereby a vote of no confidence in the Minister would automatically take place if he or she did not fulfil his or her responsibilities in meeting particular targets.  That is interesting and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is too little.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I am confident it will never be applied to my party colleague.  However, one cannot see into the future regarding the competencies of future Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I will not start regarding the competencies of previous Ministers.  The issue should be debated on Committee Stage.  However, this is an important Bill and it should be debated in the context of <Col N="241"/>future international gatherings.  I hope my proposal to resume Second Stage during Government time at a future date is taken on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation and I also welcome the opportunity for the Government and its partners to demonstrate their commitment to and sincerity about the protection of our environment and a reduction in climate change.  In the past few days I have received hundreds of e-mails from people asking me to support the Bill.  That demonstrates the strength of feeling on the issue and proves the wind is behind us.  My party and I will be happy to support the Bill.</P>
        <P>Our nation and our planet need to act now to control climate change and to ensure our environment is properly protected.  There is no alternative, as we have run out of time and we cannot relax into a false sense of security.  We cannot introduce a reactive policy of taxing polluters and paying no heed to the damage done nor can we listen to the false prophets or the flat earthers who say this is nothing to do with climate change because the world is undergoing natural cyclical changes that take place over centuries.  Pollution cannot be dealt with on a case by case basis.  Wholesale reductions in greenhouse gases should be considered on a year by year compound basis.  That is the best way to preserve the planet.  When every scientific expert in the world agrees we have a problem, it is up to us, as politicians, to show leadership and to act.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to deal with the increasing rate of greenhouse gasses and seeks to limit Ireland to 70 million tonnes of emissions by 2010 followed by a 3% decrease annually until 2050, which provides for a compound decrease of 60% over our lifetime.  That is laudable and it is worth passing on to the children of our nation.  As a nation, we need to take a firm grip on what is happening.  During the final two decades of the 20th century, we experienced more hot years than in the preceding 400 years and 11 of the past 12 years have been among the warmest since 1850.  If the Government does not act now, that trend will continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Independent Senators have introduced a bold and ambitious Bill and we support it.  In a spirit of co-operation, we will recommend that more work is done to give the legislation more teeth.  It states if the rate of emission exceeds by 5% the target set down, an assessment of the reasons for this must be carried out, which must be discussed by an Oireachtas committee, while if the target is exceeded by 10%, a motion of confidence in the Minister should be tabled.  I cannot imagine a Minister quaking in his or her boots on the basis of this provision.  As we witnessed last week, any Government, regardless of what is being discussed, can muster sufficient votes to defeat a motion of no confidence.  Tougher penalties should be introduced to make sure the targets are not exceeded.  Even a Minister as motivated <Col N="242"/>as Deputy Gormley would be able to hide behind an Oireachtas committee on this issue and he ultimately would be protected by the Government.  The Labour Party has received advice, which suggests a constitutional issue may arise if the Seanad passes a Bill that contains a provision for a motion for no confidence to be tabled in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The issue of penalties and rewards needs to be teased out.  Carrots must be offered but it also must be ensured a big enough stick is found with which to hit people if they exceed the targets set down.  The Bill makes no reference to the role of local authorities, which could, potentially, play a significant role.  For instance, they could be required to introduce stipulations in their county development plans regarding emissions resulting from rezoning decisions.  The Bill also makes no provision for monitoring the effectiveness of architects appointed by developers to make sure builders are certified to the level required by law.  Consideration should be given to how emissions from buildings can be monitored.  However, all these issues can be addressed later in the debate.  We would like the Bill to proceed and work done on it at a later stage.  It is worthy and we will lend our support.  It is vital that an attempt is made to address climate change before it is too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment and I wish him all the best in the next five years.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate climate change, which is a serious issue that deserves a serious, co-ordinated response at international, European Union and national level.  In urging a co-ordinated response, it behoves us to develop such a response locally and at home, with action built around a comprehensive national climate change strategy published earlier this year.</P>
        <P>This strategy, taken with the White Paper on energy and bioenergy, presents an ambitious but realistic pathway to enable Ireland to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.  It also places us in the position to play our part fully in any reduction regime adopted by the EU and, I hope, on a global level post-2012.</P>
        <P>The ambitious measures set out in this strategy, including ensuring a third of electricity consumed in Ireland comes from renewable resources by 2020, are also consistent with Ireland remaining a high-growth and high-employment society.  As the recent report by Sir Nicholas Stern has pointed out, the world does not need to choose between averting climate change and promoting growth and development.  Changes in energy technologies and in the structure of economies have created opportunities to decouple growth from greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been very successfully decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions.  In the past 15 years our economy has grown by more than 150%, with greenhouse gas emissions rising by only 25%.  As a result, for every unit of GDP <Col N="243"/>we now produce emissions at 48% of their 1990 levels compared with an EU 15 average of 78%.</P>
        <P>This is a result of old and low value &mdash; but high emission &mdash; plant in the industrial sector being replaced with modern, high-value jobs.  To use current jargon, these have a much smaller carbon footprint.  These jobs are in both high-value manufacturing and, increasingly, in internationally traded service activities.</P>
        <P>These new jobs, which are more environmentally friendly, were largely created in the entrepreneurial private sector, both indigenous and foreign.  It is only by maintaining an outward looking, confident and development-oriented society which continues to attract such investment that we can successfully meet the challenge of global warming.  Growth-oriented, enterprise-friendly economies have been always more successful in meeting environmental challenges than stagnant societies.  Thus, the challenges of global warming will serve neither to justify a return to failed command and control nor act as a cover for anti-growth and anti-development ideologies.</P>
        <P>The strategy sets out a series of co-ordinated measures across the energy sector, taking in industry, agriculture, transport and housing.  This will ensure Ireland plays a full part in tackling global warming.  These measures will also enhance our energy security and provide new opportunities for enterprises and employment.  For example, increased supports for the production of biomass and bio-fuel will reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, increase security of supply and provide opportunities for our farmers to develop new cash crops.  They will also provide opportunities for the development of new green industries.</P>
        <P>The Government strategy also provides for information campaigns and incentives to help individual householders conserve energy.  This is one of the most cost-effective ways in which we can all contribute individually to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>There is also provision for the purchase of carbon credits.  In the past this approach has been mischaracterised as some form of delinquency but this is not the case.  Such schemes, properly implemented, can reduce carbon emissions in developing countries while promoting employment opportunities for their people.  The simple fact is a tonne of carbon saved is beneficial whether it is done in eastern Europe, Africa, Asia or Ireland.  The Kyoto Protocol specifically recognises this and has encouraged countries to use carbon trading and other measures to bring about specified reduction at the lowest cost.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that meeting the targets set out in the strategy will require a major national effort.  I wish to see this House, and the Oireachtas in general, immediately begin to focus on how we will meet these challenges.  The joint programme for Government already commits to agreeing an all-party approach on climate change targets.  In advance of agreeing such targets, the Govern<Col N="244"/>ment will set a target for this Administration of a reduction of 3% per year, on average, in our greenhouse gas emissions.  It will mandate the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish an annual report setting out progress on meeting climate change targets and seek to establish a high-level commission on climate change to oversee implementation of the strategy. It commits the Government to mandating the Minister for Finance to present an outline carbon report, or carbon budget, in conjunction with the annual financial budget.  This is to be followed immediately by a report from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government outlining our use of energy in the preceding year, the progress made in reduction targets and Government plans to meet targets in the following year.</P>
        <P>I understand all these commitments are now being implemented.  With regard to an all-party approach, it will take two &mdash; or in this case three or more &mdash; to tango.  I have no problem accepting the provisions of most of this Bill as a statutory underpinning of the programme for Government or for any actions emerging from all-party agreement on climate change.  I wish to see the Bill examined in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which seeks to give legal underpinning to some of the climate protection aims set out in the programme for Government and the national climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>Nobody now doubts the importance of promoting a culture of responsibility where climate change is concerned.  It would be wrong, however, to see legislation as the only or even main way to promote this culture of responsibility nationally and worldwide.  It is at the level of people&rsquo;s attitudes where this problem will ultimately be solved, as all of us take responsibility for assuring the future happiness and prosperity of people on Earth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important that we continue to debate in an open and fair way all the issues relating to climate change, not least the question of whether global warming is a man-made phenomenon or if it is down to climatic changes beyond our control.  A consensus appears to have emerged that global warming is due to increased emissions of greenhouse gases caused by industry worldwide.  Even if there were not such a consensus, it would be the responsibility of the human race to take action to minimise the extent to which we contribute to negative climatic change.</P>
        <P>It could be stated that if worldwide emissions are responsible for increasing temperatures, fixing this should not so much be our national priority but a priority for China, the world&rsquo;s greatest polluter, and America, which comes a close second.  Even Britain&rsquo;s emissions make up only a fiftieth of the total.  As Richard Waghorne wrote recently in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>, arranging Irish emissions on an imaginary 24-hour clock <Col N="245"/>would leave our contribution as the last seven seconds before midnight.  That, however, is not an excuse for us not to take the lead.  We are part of a wider European Union effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and so on.  It appears that the greater contribution for Ireland to make would be in the promotion of alternative, cleaner and greener sources of energy.  The country should promote a culture of solidarity with those countries and people most affected by such climate change as is inevitable.</P>
        <P>We must increase the use of renewables.  Ireland has the best wind resources in the EU, along with significant potential for tidal and wave power.  We should ease planning and grid connection for renewables and micro-renewables, such as domestic solar panels and micro-turbines.  There have been recent positive developments announced in that regard.  We should raise building standards to ensure maximum energy efficiency in new builds.  The inclusion of mandatory solar water heating in all new houses, increased investment in public transport and the restructuring of vehicle tax and VRT to incentivise the purchase of low-emission vehicles all form part of the solution.  Perhaps some of these issues should be included in any forthcoming legislation for climate protection.</P>
        <P>Regardless of our efforts to control our emissions, we must prepare for the impact of climate change on ourselves and others.  A co-ordinated and cross-Government approach is required.  Particular vulnerabilities will include increased flooding and tidal inundation, drought and water stress, along with coastal erosion through sea level rises.  Current planning must take future vulnerabilities into account.  These include migration control and our vulnerability to global shocks in the world economy, which will need to be addressed.  Climate change is likely to lead to more frequent catastrophes, such as mass population shifts, resource conflicts, water wars and so on.  The world&rsquo;s poorest countries and populations will need increased assistance to deal with climate change, as they are the most vulnerable and least resilient to adverse effects.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Turning to some of the specifics of the Bill, I would question the provisions of section 3(1), which sets targets for greenhouse gas emissions for 2010 specifically.  The figure in the national climate change strategy is a projection based on adoption of certain measures, rather than a target.  It is an annual average for 2008 to 2012 rather than a specific year. I am also concerned about provisions making the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government responsible for meeting the above targets.  I would question if this will ensure the necessary buy-in from all Departments, specifically the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Transport.  Would it be better if the Taoiseach held responsibility in this regard?</P><Col N="246"/>
      
        <P>The provision in section 5(3) is odd and I have difficulty with the idea that a Minister would face a motion of no confidence before the Oireachtas in the event that emissions exceeded the national annual target figure by 10% in a particular year.  This is a matter for the hurly-burly of parliamentary life and legislative provision should not be made in respect of it.  I am struck by the odd fact that a majority party in Government might be happy to have a Minister representing one of its minority partners take the flak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept such a scenario is difficult to imagine.  The provision in the equivalent British legislation to the effect that the relevant Minister should be subject to judicial review is more sensible.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Bacik on drafting this Bill and bringing it before the Seanad.  The effort to enshrine in legislation our commitment to taking a lead is very laudable, even if our contribution to solving this global problem is minuscule.  This is, however, an example of the law acting as an educator.  In the past we have often been informed that the law is a blunt instrument when it comes to solving problems which have an extra-territorial dimension and which are, therefore, beyond the power of our law to change.  I commend Senator Bacik on the approach she has taken.  The basis of her approach is to ensure that although our laws can do little enough to change a global problem, they can be used to set a powerful moral lead it is to be hoped will be followed by other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, well for his term of office.  I worked with the Minister on Dublin City Council and found him to be a very practical and amenable individual.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Bacik for introducing this important Bill on climate change.  The Seanad has a great tradition of publishing Bills and bringing them forward into law.  I hope this is the first of many Bills that will be initiated in the House.</P>
        <P>As stated by previous speakers, public concern in respect of this issue is very high.  Proof of this came to my attention this week with the raft of e-mails I received.  These kept my secretary quite busy but I have since calmed her down.</P>
        <P>Support for combating climate change undoubtedly exists among both members of the public and the parties in Government.  The previous Seanad and D&aacute;il engaged in many interesting debates on energy supply.  I look forward to hearing more about this matter and many previous speakers made interesting comments in respect of it.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the imminent and challenging threat posed by climate change.  Everyone agrees we need to continue with our concerted <Col N="247"/>efforts to tackle this problem.  Scientists have informed us the world must change and that countries must introduce major changes in terms of how they produce and use energy if man-made greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced and if the potentially disastrous consequences of climate change are to be avoided.  While natural variations in climate are normal over time, humans are contributing to climate change through the emission of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases.</P>
        <P>Like other Members, I read newspaper reports to the effect that water levels in lakes throughout Europe are falling.  For example, the lowest ever level of water &mdash; it has dropped by something of the order of two metres &mdash; was recorded in Lake Garda in Italy recently.  This highlights the problems associated with climate change.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis referred to waste.  The latter is created by the manner in which some goods are packaged.  Some products in the food industry, for example, are covered in so many layers of plastic that one would need to use a chainsaw to open them.  The position in the drinks industry is similar.  Many beverages now come in plastic bottles but I am of the view that we should return to using glass bottles because these could be recycled and reused.  A great deal of waste is created as a result of the way in which manufacturers in the hardware, electrical industries, etc., package the goods they produce.  Much of the packaging to which I refer is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>In our industrial and modern society, it is necessary to continue using energy in order that we might continue to live to the standards to which we have become accustomed.  However, practical alternatives must be made available.  Such alternatives are beginning to come into mainstream use.  We should, under Transport 21, encourage transport companies to use natural gas in lieu of petrol or diesel.  Approximately 80% of the fleet of the public transport company in Italy uses natural gas.  There is no reason we could not encourage the Defence Forces, An Post, Eircom and our public transport company to do likewise.</P>
        <P>As a developed country and a member state of the EU, Ireland has a responsibility towards the wider international community.  We just cannot state it is someone else&rsquo;s problem and has nothing to do with us.  Ireland must play its part in meeting these targets and in dealing with the most important environmental issue the world faces.</P>
        <P>To meet our obligations to future generations, there is a requirement on all sectors to play their part.  It is our responsibility, in conjunction with the international community, to take increased action and play our part by meeting our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  The programme for Government contains many objectives designed to prevent possible environmental problems.  Each of these outlines clear objectives the Government must and will undoubtedly, under the guidance of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, <Col N="248"/>aim to achieve.  Combating climate change is one of the main priorities set out in the programme which aims to dramatically accelerate the growth of renewable energy sources in the electricity, heat and transport sectors.</P>
        <P>The Government has already taken action on these issues.  Earlier today, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, announced a commitment to achieving energy efficiency savings of 20% by 2020.  In addition, he set a target of 30% for the public sector.  Leading by example in the public sector is another clear objective of the plan announced today.  For example, all public bodies will purchase energy-efficient lighting by the end of this year.  All street and traffic lights will also be energy efficient.</P>
        <P>There are also plans in the programme to create new opportunities for farmers by moving agriculture to a new dual system of food and power production.  Farmers have worked very hard via the REP scheme over the years and they will undoubtedly facilitate the establishment of a new bio-fuel industry, a matter to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred.</P>
        <P>Another associated aspect of this matter is that concerning pollution.  We should examine the level of fines relating to pollution.  Such fines are a pittance.  Some people continue to pollute rivers and lakes because the fines involved are so low that they make no difference.</P>
        <P>Previous Governments had clear objectives and commitments in respect of tackling these issues.  I concur with the idea of all-party support in this area.  I hope the Opposition will give the Minister and the Government its support in tackling the problem of climate change.  As Senator Boyle stated, this represents the only way forward.  There is no scope for messing about or time wasting.</P>

        <P>I echo the general congratulations extended to Senator Bacik on introducing the legislation.  She has done the House a major service.  I congratulate her on her great initiative in bringing forward this timely and good legislation.</P>
        <P>Before proceeding further, I wish to refer to some of the remarks made by Senator Boyle.  I did not appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s attitude, nor did I appreciate his implication that in some way Fine Gael might prove difficult or less than patriotic in dealing with this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle may rest assured that when it comes to patriotism, reason and putting the best interests of the people first, my party has a record that is second to none.  I take great exception to his patronising attitude.</P>
        <P>Obviously, there are many elements involved in the substantive matter of reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions but the element I wish to address briefly is the provision of rail services.  Rather than lecturing Fine Gael, it would suit Senator Boyle to remind his Ministers in Government of the critical importance of promptly developing the rail network again.  It beggars belief that we produced plans for the proposed M3 motorway without a parallel railway.  The fact that this has happened is a horror and the greatest indictment of contemporary politics.  Everybody stands indicted on this count.  I wonder if tolling and big money interests had an input into the fact that this proposed motorway will not run parallel with a railway.  I do not say this carelessly.  The obvious thing was to do it at planning stage.  It was only a matter of putting it alongside the motorway.  It was a bizarre decision.</P>
        <P>The development of a railway line to Navan and the provision of park and ride facilities at Navan are of critical importance, as is the extension of the railway from Navan to Kingscourt in my constituency.  That is critically important to the socioeconomic development of and quality of life in east Cavan.  It throws up huge issues in terms of this debate.  Not only is this railway worthy of development, the entire national rail network must be put back in place.</P>
        <P>Parallel with the provision of railways, an effort must be made through the use of vehicle registration tax to produce fewer emissions and incentivise the use of smaller cars.  I believe Senator Mullen spoke about culture and cultural attitude.  We all have a role to play in our own different ways.  We must contribute to a situation where people wish to share cars when going to work and to use public transport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with all that was said in respect of bio-fuels.  I am in favour of the recent regulations proposed by the Minister relating to solar panels and insulation for houses.  While I fully agree with and applaud that necessary and correct initiative, we must take on board the fact that first-time buyers must be incentivised in some way.  A cost-effective grant system should be put in place.   It would help to achieve the objectives of this Bill if incentivisation or a grant structure for first-time buyers were put in place to encourage alternative energy and homes that are satisfactory from this perspective.</P>
        <P>It is horrific that in recent weeks, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, announced a reduction in the grants for geothermal pumps and wood pellet burners.  I put it to the Minister that rather <Col N="250"/>than reducing these grants, we should be increasing them and using them as incentives.  I welcome this Minister to the House.  I served with him in the House in the past and I ask him, when he is summing up, to commit himself publicly to these grants.  These grants should be increasing rather than decreasing.  That went under the radar and was not noticed by many people but it did happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Bacik and the Independent group for their courage and initiative in bringing forward this Climate Protection Bill.  It is a Bill that one might expect from the Government rather than the Independent group, but there we go.  The initiative is coming from this side of the House.  There is now a real opportunity for the Government to show that it is serious about tackling global warming.</P>
        <P>It is clear the entire international community needs to take key strategic decisions in climate policy over the next years if dangerous climate changes are to be prevented.  In this context, we in Ireland need to play our part.  I welcome this Bill as a first step in that direction.  Dangerous climate change can only be prevented if climate protection targets are set and reached.  There is a strong body of evidence on global warming and its effects.  For example, in the course of the last century, there have been higher temperatures &mdash; in the order of one to one and a half degrees.  Closer to home, we have noticed changes in weather patterns and water.  Global warming is already altering precipitation patterns, affecting our water supply and agriculture.  For example, in Galway this year, this led to much local speculation about the presence of cryptosporidium in our drinking water.</P>
        <P>At a global level, we have also seen the effect of the spread of disease, where many species, such as mosquitoes and rodents, are now altering their ranges in response to the changing climate.  Warmer climates allow these animals to move further north and at higher elevations.  They can bring tropical diseases with them, such as malaria and other fevers.</P>
        <P>We have very good reason to act.  This will mean considerable change to current practices but it can also mean exciting opportunities for us as a nation.  Therefore, there is a job of education to be done by the Minister because change can mean fear.  To bring about this culture of change, I ask the Minister to be practical in his advice and guidelines in helping the consumer, manufacturer, farmer and homeowner to own this change.</P>
        <P>If we are serious, it is time to set up and resource energy offices at local government level to provide for climate protection proofing locally and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, to build in incentives for good practice, such as tax breaks, for any organisation that reduces emissions beyond required targets.  These incentives would mean a win-win scenario for the economy and the envir<Col N="251"/>onment and for farmers whereby they could gain revenue from selling greenhouse gas reduction credits.  For example, farmers and foresters could grow these credits by shifting to conservation tillage, planting trees and growing bio-fuel crops to produce low carbon alternative fuels instead of fossil fuels to power our homes and vehicles.  These incentives would encourage car manufacturers to  switch to very fuel-efficient cars.  At a financial level, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, along with his Government colleagues, should consider lower vehicle registration tax for environmentally friendly cars.  People will act when there are genuine incentives to do so.  As Senator Bacik noted, transport plays a huge role in high emissions.</P>
        <P>The approach I am recommending is one of incentives.  While we certainly need to be stringent in our penalties if we are not reaching our targets, when we are talking about the ordinary citizen and business, we need to provide incentives.  Ultimately, the aim of climate protection legislation should be to make it easier for the citizen, farmer and industry to be good for the environment and planet Earth, thus enabling us to hand on an environment we have cared for to the next generation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity to discuss it.  As a member of a political party that has taken the lead in pushing for real action on climate change, it is encouraging to see the issue being raised as a priority in the early weeks of the 23rd Seanad.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Bacik on proposing the Bill.  I welcome that the provisions in the legislation closely mirror the ambitious commitments on climate change secured by the Green Party in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The agreement reached in the programme for Government of an average 3% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year over the next five years is one that will require skilful political planning and execution.  Essentially, it will begin the challenging process of decarbonising the economy.  If we are serious about addressing the growing threat of climate change and Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this global problem, we have no choice but to begin to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, at an international level many governments are still at the stage of engaging in impressive rhetoric about the challenge of addressing climate change but doing little in practice.  This is because the process of decarbonising an economy requires changes across every policy area including energy, transport, planning, housing, industry, etc.</P>
        <P>The process will require co-operation and buy-in from all sectors and support for a range of policy measures that will call for an often difficult process of adaptation and change.  Political <Col N="252"/>leadership will be essential.  I acknowledge the leadership shown to date by the Green Party&rsquo;s Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, who recently introduced building regulations within months of taking office.  I also acknowledge the ongoing initiatives of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, within the scope of his Department.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a headstart on many other countries, including EU member states, in tackling climate change as we have moved beyond rhetoric with the substantial commitment to reducing our emissions in the programme for Government.  The programme must be implemented.  Within four months of the formation of the new Government, a high-powered Cabinet sub-committee dealing with climate change was established and has already met.  It will agree policy measures that will be necessary in order to achieve the 3% annual targets that have been set.</P>
        <P>However, in countries such as Sweden, which have set serious and ambitious targets for tackling climate change and decarbonising their economies, it has been shown that a vital political precondition for reaching these targets has been cross-party support for implementing the necessary policy measures.  Climate change is too serious an issue to be cynically played with by Opposition parties.  It is too easy to demand action on climate change from the safe benches of Opposition and then to refuse to support the policy measures necessary to tackle it.</P>
        <P>It was disappointing that a Private Member&rsquo;s motion proposed by the Green Party in 2005 seeking an all-party approach to dealing with the issue of climate change was voted down by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Their commitment to tackling climate change does not appear to have progressed beyond the politically superficial level of calling for change but failing to give their support to concrete policy measures necessary to bring about this change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Fine Gael and Labour parties to come off the fence and to stop playing political football with this important issue.  I invite them to join a new all-party commission on climate change which will agree the objectives and policy measures that will allow this country to meet the annual targets of 3% reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.  Let them show real political leadership and join the Green Party and the Government in helping this country to be in the vanguard, giving example to the rest of the world in tackling climate change.  Are they capable of this kind of political leadership?  I hope the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope there is courage not just on these benches but also on the Government benches to tackle this important matter.  I congratulate Senator Bacik on producing this Bill.  I am delighted she has been elected a Member.  She has justified my hopes in her by <Col N="253"/>hitting the ground running, speaking on the Order of Business at the first sitting, putting a Bill down and speaking on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>I also greatly welcome Senator Boyle&rsquo;s elevation to the House.  He said there is the possibility of some arrangement in taking this Bill.  I hope it will not be amended, voted down or laid to rest on the Order Paper.  Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government give a firm commitment by indicating dates for the Bill&rsquo;s passage?  Can we have this before Christmas?  It is good all sides of the House are prepared to accept legislation.  That is good democratic co-operative Government for which this House was intended.  I have spoken to Senator Bacik and the <i>primus inter pares</i>, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, and we will be putting down legislation on domestic partnership drafted by myself and Senator Bacik before she was elected.  I hope it will be met with an equal welcome.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Bacik on the Climate Control Bill because of its simplicity, clarity and directness.  It provides the definitions by what is meant by particular gasses, sets targets and establishes a strategy.  It also sets out the action to be taken in case these targets are not met, proposing a commission to examine the reasons.  It is not just a knee-jerk reaction; it addresses these issues to ensure such a transgression will not recur.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Climate change is the single most significant event on this planet.  The planet is like an aircraft on which we are all passengers, all with an equal investment and interest in it arriving at its destination safely.  However, there is a clear and present danger that it might not.  On board this aircraft there are lunatic hijackers who want to take it over for their own reasons.  They are the corporations and governments, such as the US President Bush, and the German Government, that will not acknowledge the problem of climate change.  I was appalled that Chinese-made environmentally friendly and low-energy consuming lightbulbs were prevented from being imported into the EU by the German Government in order to protect its domestic industry.  That selfish attitude is a disgrace to the EU and should be stopped.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On our aircraft there is also the equivalent of those afflicted by air rage, the climate-change deniers.  They are lunatics.  Last summer, I took the trouble to accept an invitation &mdash; unfinanced &mdash; from the Norwegian foreign ministry to visit the Arctic to see the effects of climate change.  It is very frightening.  In the past year, an area of permanent sea ice the size of the state of Texas has disappeared from the Arctic forever.  Today&rsquo;s weather is very humid.  I am 63 years of age and we have never had humidity like this before in Ireland.  We must recognise our climate is changing.</P>
        <P>I put down a motion on the Order Paper which was gazumped by the viper in my bosom, Senator Bacik, who brilliantly got her Bill taken.  My motion called on Seanad &Eacute;ireann to take note of <Col N="254"/>the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s report, Key Meteorological Indicators of Climate Change in Ireland.  The report stated a stronger warming trend was apparent in Ireland and globally in the 1930s and 1940s.</P>
        <P>The 1990s has been the warmest decade in the Irish instrumental record.  This is consistent with experience in the UK.  I have mentioned the hot days, humidity and so on.  A hot day actually has a scientific meaning.  It is defined as one where the mean daily temperature exceeds 14&deg; centigrade, where a &ldquo;cold day&rdquo; has a mean below 0&deg; centigrade.  A clear indication of a trend exists in both these parameters as established by scientific facts.</P>
        <P>In midland locations such as Birr and Kilkenny, the number of cold days has halved over the past five decades while the number of hot days has roughly doubled.  This is Ireland, which brings matters home to roost.  Our own small island is noticeably and directly affected.  My colleague and friend, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, referred humorously to the butterflies in the Amazon.  That struck a little echo in my mind because butterflies are very important.  There is something in this report I want to draw to the Minister&rsquo;s attention because it might, perhaps, be done without enormous investment.  We need a comprehensive butterfly survey because we are on the margin of the population probably for a very considerable number of butterflies.  They have become a very sensitive indicator that we can use to gauge the extent of climate.  We need not denigrate the humble butterfly.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the second major cause.  Perhaps not everyone in the Chamber will agree, but I believe this is the elephant in the room, namely, the world population explosion.  Since I did my leaving certificate and entered Trinity College, the population on this planet has doubled.  This cannot happen without serious consequences.  This factor lies behind not only a significant proportion of the global warming effects but also behind the resource wars, the tensions between nations and the destruction of the Amazon rain forest.  Let us at some stage have a really serious debate on population change.  There is not a world leader with the moral courage to raise this issue, especially in the religious sphere.  Recently the Pope was lecturing the Austrians for not having enough children.  Every time I hear of a decline in a European country&rsquo;s population I get down on my knees and thank Almighty God because we do more damage to the environment than the unfortunate Chinese, Indians and all the rest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has already been mentioned that Ireland is the fifth most polluting country in the European Union, where &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; has been raised as a phrase.  Seven years ago, a Government Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; was not an option for Ireland, and that is true.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>I shall end on a practical point.  I have passed a letter to the Minister which came into my possession via a very interesting friend in Cyprus.  She is a distinguished international doctor.  Her partner is a distinguished scientist and businessman and they have come up with something in which I believe the Government should take an interest.  It is an ignition system that uses high-frequency technology in combination with rail injection systems.  It can be applied to high pressure ignition, combustive, diesel and gasoline engines.  It is a remarkable invention which does not suit all the big industrial conglomerates and therefore needs some degree of Government sponsorship and assistance.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine the letter to see whether there is something in it that might benefit this country if he went into partnership with the people who are now developing it, namely, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.  I am not suggesting the Government goes into business but rather saying if we are serious about reducing carbon emissions through the internal combustion engine, let us look at this technology.  The international combines are very nervous of it because it might put some of them out of business, but it might also substantially reduce carbon emissions from motor vehicles.  I remind the Minister of this because he has admitted to me that he is almost as scatty-minded as I am and he might forget.  I will drop him a<?oasys _jy ?>note and I request him to take a look at this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be here in the Seanad and to have been given the opportunity to discuss this very important issue.  I have dispensed with the ministerial speech because I am so interested in what has been said, and I want to respond to the speakers.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Ivana Bacik on her initiative, as well as her Independent colleagues.  I also congratulate Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coughlan of Friends of the Earth who helped in drafting the legislation.  I genuinely hope that this is not just a debate in the Chamber today, but the beginning of a dialogue through which we can move forward in a spirit of consensus.  That, above all else, is important when debating the issue of climate change, and I shall say a little about that later on.</P>
        <P>Numerous speakers have stated that this is an urgent issue.  Indeed, it is the biggest issue humanity has ever faced.  This is not an exaggeration.  The science is now incontrovertible.  The fourth IPCC report shows very clearly that the debate is over.  Human beings are causing the warming of planet Earth.  Not only that, we have a window of opportunity of only ten years to avert the worst consequences of climate change by stabilising our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  We have ten years to act decisively and that is it.  There is no more to debate; we shall have to do it.  It will not be just a small party such as the Green Party but <Col N="256"/>rather everyone in this Chamber acting together.  We all have a role to play.  That is why I said earlier that it is important we act together.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris was saying that we just have this planet.  The late Petra Kelly used to say, &ldquo;We have one planet and there are no emergency exits.&rdquo;  That is the bottom line, so we can forget about the science fiction of dumping planet Earth and going elsewhere.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Taoiseach I recently attended the biggest Heads of State meeting in the UN on climate change.  It was a great occasion to be sitting there with everyone, from Mr. Qazi Mohammad Amin Waqad from Afghanistan to Dr. Condoleezza Rice and Chancellor Angela Merkel, all concerned about this issue.  During the lunch break, Al Gore gave a talk.  As we know, the science on this is being updated all the time.  Senator Norris mentioned the ice pack up in the north.  Al Gore told us that only last week, the evidence was coming clearly from Boulder, Colorado which stated that if we do not stabilise the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions now, the ice in the North Pole will be gone within 23 years.  One can imagine the consequences of that.  It will affect our climate enormously.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris is quite right in saying that the climate has already changed.  Even if we stabilise, we are still going to be dealing with the consequences of climate change.  Our climate has already changed.  I issued an Environmental Protection Agency report quite recently which stated clearly that in some parts of the country we are already experiencing 20% more rainfall than previously, and the temperatures have changed.  Anecdotally, one can see that we now have mosquitoes in this country, something we did not have before.  People are putting the bluetongue outbreak down to climate change because we have midges we did not have before, so it will affect us in ways that are quite unimaginable.</P>
        <P>There was an enormous missed opportunity at Rio.  I remember the great sense of hope all of us in the environmental movement had then &mdash; those of us who had been talking about climate change for a long time before that.  I recall going on the Gay Byrne show a long time ago, back in 1990.  Rio presented a fantastic opportunity and it was felt that now we could talk about the dangers of runaway climate change.   The key point is that looking at the history of our earth&rsquo;s climate, planet Earth does not do climate change slowly.  It has always done so unimaginably fast. That is why we are so concerned about the issue.  There are those who claim that while the situation may be changing, we can wait because it may be 100 years down the road.  It will not be like that.  All the evidence indicates otherwise.</P>
        <P>I said at the UN that I am proud of its role, notwithstanding the vested interests of the Germans and others.  I have seen the Germans in action at the Council of Ministers with regard the German car industry.  On one occasion I had to berate my colleague, Joschka Fischer, about his <Col N="257"/>defence of the German car industry because we could have been down two car emissions of about 130g.  That is the route we should go, but vested interests exist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many years ago when I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I visited an exhibition of electric cars in California and met the Governor, Pete Wilson.  I congratulated him and said it was fantastic that the state would go down the route of ZEVs &mdash; zero emissions vehicles.  He said that was not the future, rather reformulated gasoline.  Of course, ZEVs did not happen and the concept of the electric car was killed.  One can now see a video, perhaps on the YouTube website, called &ldquo;Who killed the electric car?&rdquo;  Clearly therefore, those vested interests can act decisively, and I hope they will act now in the best interests of the planet.</P>
        <P>The EU has played a very constructive role.  It has set targets, as have we, of a 20% reduction by 2020.  We hope to have a 30% reduction if we can get a comprehensive agreement at the Bali meeting, which I hope will not be another Rio and instead will be the turning point at which we take climate change seriously.  I get the feeling from meetings in New York that a breakthrough is possible and that the US may be on board.  Arnold Schwarzenegger made a speech at the UN to the effect that California is to go ahead with its plans, but changes in lifestyle will be required.  Although California has a wonderfully warm climate, not only do people drive their cars, they use tumble dryers and will not put out their clothes to dry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many possibilities.  The challenge facing us is enormous.  We must reduce our emissions by 80% by 2050, and perhaps even by<?oasys _jy ?>90%.  Think of the difficulties we have in this country in trying to reduce emissions by 3% annually and then consider the scale of that challenge of reducing emissions by 90% in a short period.  The European Council has recognised that we must reduce by this much.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Bill, it has been correctly acknowledged by Senator Bacik that this proposed legislation is less radical than what is proposed in the programme for Government.  The Green Party negotiated what I believe to be a very good deal on climate change, the environment and energy.  We got they key Ministries in those areas and agreed a 3% annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  The commission in this area which we have proposed will, I hope, be set up before Christmas, and I am progressing that as quickly as possible.  The carbon budgeting plan is in place and will happen this year.  It will be a difficult challenge but it will happen because it must.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on climate change is chaired by the Taoiseach.  This is a forum through which we must examine how each area feeds into CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted earlier, we must also consider the fact that methane is 20 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>.</P><Col N="258"/>
        <P>We are examining the agriculture and transport sectors, the latter  being a difficult sector with which to deal.  Our transport emissions will increase by 218% if we continue the way we are going, building motorways and so on.</P>
        <P>We must understand there are differences on this issue between various parties in this House. While not blowing our own trumpet, the Green Party has led the way, but in doing so, we have perhaps been greatly ahead of the posse. Most people in this country like their motorways, and it is difficult to persuade them that motorways are not in the best interests of climate change, that we should invest the money in public transport.  We recognise that we must bring people with us.</P>
        <P>The carbon levy is also a thorny subject, and at the previous general election, the Green Party was the only party to propose that levy, although people said it was political suicide.  Everyone will have to come on board on this issue and eventually recognise we must decarbonise our society, which means we must put a price on carbon.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it is important we achieve consensus on this issue.  At some stage, Fine Gael and the Labour Party may well be in Government and the Green Party might be in Opposition or in Government with them.  No one knows what will happen in the future.  However, in terms of this single most important issue we face, we must act together. We rescued our economy many years ago with the support of the Opposition parties.  We had enlightened leadership in Opposition parties and we saved our economy, indeed our country.  We now must do the same on the climate change issue.  If we want to have our planet, we must act together.  We have a responsibility.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the argument  that we contribute only 1% to global emissions.  That is not the point.  We can make a major contribution by doing well in Ireland.  Senators spoke of those opportunities and the science for them exists.  I met some people today who are investing in wave energy.  This country had an opportunity in the early 1980s to invest in wind energy and in research and development in that area. We did not take it and the Danes and Germans went ahead of us.  Now we have a wave energy opportunity and I hope we will not waste it.</P>
        <P>We have taken some initiatives and have introduced the building regulations, which are a step in the right direction, but we must go further.  My ambition was to increase building energy efficiency by 40% and then to move to 60%, but I believe we can go to zero carbon emission by 2016.  We must reach that target.  It is not impossible.  I have seen the prototype houses and they are now being built commercially in Britain.  We can build housing estates of such houses.  It is not a case of them being south-facing being some kind of strange house.  The architecture and the science are in place and we must pursue this issue.  Going on my discussions with the building trade, I believe it will come on board.</P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>We are also introducing proper carbon offsetting for ministerial flights.  This will be unique for this country and we will be the first to do it.  We will invest in projects in Africa.  We will know for a fact that this will be proper carbon offsetting.  It was said during the debate that one can simply log on to a computer to do this, but in terms of carbon offsetting, one does not know where the money goes.</P>
        <P>Some points have been made and I wish to respond to them.  I hope I have an opportunity to respond to all Senators.  Senator Coffey referred to insulation grants.  I can confirm that this is part of the programme for Government.  We will give money for the installation programme.  I can assure the Senator of that.  He also raised the question of a bio-energy action plan.  Again, that is part of the programme for Government.  Concerns about bio-fuels have been raised by some environmentalists.  There is no question in my mind but that there is a problem in certain parts of the world.  When one starts to chop down rain forests so that one can invest in bio-fuels, one certainly has a problem.  It must be done properly.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised certain issues.  He and I agree on a lot of matters.  I will not go over what he said because I would be just agreeing with everything.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly was critical of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  The Minister is reforming the greener home scheme and wants to ensure the same amount of money is spent.  Clearly what we would like to see happen is for the money to go to people who cannot afford these green measures.  Many of the people getting the grants were on their second grant.  There was no difficulty for them in terms of cost.  It is simply a question of reform.</P>
        <P>I am delighted this legislation has been introduced in the House.  I turn to the Opposition in general, although I know the Independents are quite separate from other parties.  My colleague, Senator Boyle, has indicated that he would like to see this legislation back before the House on 20 December after the Bali talks.  However, he is quite clear that is subject to getting all the parties to agree, and not only on setting targets.  Targets are one thing but we must agree on  basic measures.  It is very easy to set the bar but we will have to jump over it together.</P>
        <P>The Green Party, when in Opposition, said it would introduce legislation and it offered the Government full co-operation.  We said to the Government at the time that if it wanted to cut back on motorways, invest in public transport and introduce a carbon levy, we would be support it all the way.  In fact, we said we would support it in anything it wanted to do that would deal with the climate crisis.  I do not expect a blank cheque from Opposition parties but I expect a measure of co-operation.  That is the best way in which we can move forward on this very important issue.</P>

It is fine for him to say he is in Government and he now wants the Opposition to swing the lead for him.  I speak only for the Labour Party but it will not be found wanting, nor was it in regard to that proposed Bill.  Apparently, it was suggested earlier that we voted against it, but we supported it.  We will at all times support the types of measures fundamentally needed in respect of this issue.  I say, with all due respect to the Minister, that it is on his side he needs to do the work and where the vested interests are represented in this and the other House.  They are the people to whom he needs to speak if he wants to talk to the builders and others and not those of us on this side of the House.  For our part, we are ready, willing and able to co-operate with those types of measures.</P>

	<P>I was going to share some time with Senator Buttimer.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as I have not had the opportunity to do so before.  I know what a committed and genuine politician he is.  I do not agree with his choice of coalition partner and I echo the comments of my colleague on this side about the job he will have to do to get support on his side of the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca should avoid stereotyping the Opposition the way they have tonight because the Green Party has suffered enough from stereotyping over the years.  The fact there is all-party support for the Bill should have been acknowledged by them as opposed to the line they took.  We accept we are at a turning point in regard to decisions on climate change and the environment.  Difficult decisions will have to be taken on all sides of the House.  One can see from our election manifesto that the Fine Gael party will be very supportive in respect of the key decisions which will have to be taken in this area.  A turning point has been reached by society in terms of putting the environment at the centre.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned Petra Kelly and that certainly brought back memories for me of the time she addressed an audience in Dublin many years ago and of how inspirational she was.  It has taken a long time for her vision to become centre stage.  I would like to give time to my colleague, Senator Buttimer, to make some comments and I congratulate Senator Bacik on introducing this Bill.</P>

        <P>Colleagues mentioned support from all parties.  Just more than two years ago Deputy Sargent of the Green Party, now a junior minister, described Fianna F&aacute;il as a huddle of gangsters spending taxpayers&rsquo; money in a carbon casino plotting the most conniving scams to dodge even the woefully inadequate Kyoto targets.  Echoing what Senators White and Fitzgerald said, it is important there is cross party support not only from the Opposition but from the Government.  I am grateful to colleagues for saying so as it is vital.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle and the Minister supported the idea that Second Stage be adjourned tonight without a vote.  I believe the Minister mentioned <Col N="262"/>20 December, for which I am grateful.  We would like the debate to be adjourned on Government time.  I believe Senator Boyle has promised that Second Stage will resume in the House on 20 December in order that we can see what progress has been made and debate it in the context of progress post the Bali talks and discussions with all the parties on this issue.  I am grateful to colleagues.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the promise by the Minister and Senator Boyle promise, I move that the Second Stage debate be adjourned and resumed in December.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He may not be directly familiar with this appalling case which I raised in the previous session.  It constitutes a grave injustice and a violation of the principle of freedom of association, among other freedoms, and the right to a good name.  It concerns a young man who is directly and personally known to me.  He is a man of good standing and is a very gentle person.  He came to this country in July 2001 and was accepted as a refugee.  His brother was accepted as a refugee and is now a citizen and married with children.  The man is an architect by profession and has no criminal record, nor has he carried out any misdeed whatever.  I have questioned him about this and he has urged me to push this case to the limit.  He wants to know why he is being denied fair and decent treatment.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On being granted asylum status, the man applied for naturalisation as an Irish citizen and this application was turned down.  In the letter sent to him in this regard, he was told he could appeal but that he must include in his appeal the grounds for his application being refused in the first place.  When he wrote to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he was denied that information.  This is completely grotesque and what one would expect in a police state.  It is simply unacceptable in a modern European democracy.  I spoke to various officials and got the runaround myself on a number of occasions.  I wrote letters and they were not answered efficiently.  The man in question tried to employ the facilities of the Freedom of Information Act and this again was refused.</P>
        <P>On the last occasion I raised this matter, the then Minister said the process would be re-exam<Col N="263"/>ined.  That is not good enough because it effectively penalises the person under review by making him or her wait longer with an indeterminate outcome.  I was told by the former Minister that I did not want to know about this and that it was a security matter.  I know all about these security matters and how they are dealt with.  My telephone was tapped 25 years ago and when I contacted Senator Mary Robinson to ask her to raise the matter, she was told it was a security matter and that there was no way in which I could establish the reasons my telephone was tapped or even get an acknowledgement from the Government that it was tapped.  I was innocent of any crime and of blameless record and that is why I feel so strongly about this matter.</P>
        <P>What is the record?  I want the person I represent to be given the opportunity to answer whatever baseless and unfounded charges are being made against him, which, in fairness and decency, he is entitled to do in a democracy.  I would like to know the person who put them on the record.  I would like to know what faceless pimp or spy put something down about this man.  Perhaps it was done because he may be a Muslim.  Perhaps he attends a mosque or perhaps he was photographed by some nark in a group.  Does the Minister of State remember what happened to the former Minister, Deputy James McDaid, when he was photographed at the funeral of a neighbour&rsquo;s child who happened to be in the IRA?  Was this a good day for Ireland?  Are we to return to guilt by attainder, guilt by association or the star chamber?</P>
        <P>I am advising the man in question and will help him in every way I can in anticipation of an unsatisfactory reply once again from a cowardly Government.  I will advise him to take a judicial review.  It is insupportable that somebody should have a black mark put against his name without explanation and without being allowed to know why or to defend himself.</P>
        <P>I would not push this case so vigorously if the person in question were not known to me directly and personally.  I want to know what has been said about him and who has said it.  If we do not receive these answers, none of us is safe in this country.  We will continue to push this matter and demand a reply.  The very fact the man is encouraging me to demand the information is a clear indication of his complete innocence of any guilt, even by association, in this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first time I have had the opportunity to address this House.  I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this matter.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is occupied in the other Chamber.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>It is understood that this matter was the subject of the Seanad Adjournment debate on 26 April last and that the Senator was provided with a comprehensive response at the time, including an account of the circumstances surrounding the refusal of the applicant&rsquo;s original application for naturalisation.  In reaching a decision to refuse that application, the Minister exercised the absolute discretion as provided by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts.  The position remains as stated in the original reply.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purpose of study and periods granted for the purpose of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way that preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who are suitably qualified.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  It should be noted that approximately one third of all applications for naturalisation received are not completed correctly, necessitating the return of the forms and accompanying documentation to the applicants with an explanation of the problems involved.  Valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and inquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may be also necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, more than 1,500 applicants who applied after that date have been found to have insufficient residency in the State for the purposes of naturalisation.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in <Col N="265"/>their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing the financial status of applicants &mdash; their ability to support themselves in the State &mdash; and may involve making inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Inquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ascertain if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  Circumstances in individual cases may mean such cases require a greater level of investigation than others.  When the various inquiries have been completed, the file is referred for a decision to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister is satisfied that these procedures, which have been developed and refined over a number of years, are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Senator Norris will appreciate that the processes can, by their very nature, take some time to complete.</P>
        <P>The person referred to by the Senator arrived in the State on 27 July 2001.  He applied for asylum on 30 July of that year, but his application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 12 April 2002.  This decision was set aside by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on appeal, however, and on 19 February 2003 the person was declared a refugee under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.  On 24 October 2004, he applied for the granting of a certificate of naturalisation.  After the application was considered under the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 and 1986, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform decided on 8 March 2006 not to grant naturalisation.  A copy of the submission prepared by officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the time was forwarded to the applicant for his information.  As I said at the outset, in reaching that decision the Minister exercised the absolute discretion made available to him by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, which do not provide for a formal process of appeal of a decision to refuse naturalisation.  However, the Minister is obliged to make the reasons for his decision available to the applicant under the provisions of section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They refused that too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister understands that the applicant submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act for any records about this matter held by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A decision on that request was communicated to him on 15 May 2006.  If, following an examination of the copy of his or her case file, an applicant considers that the Minister&rsquo;s decision was based on incorrect or incomplete information, he or she can seek a review of that decision.  The applicant was <Col N="266"/>also informed that he can reapply for the granting of a certificate of naturalisation at any time.  The Minister understands that a second application was lodged in the Department&rsquo;s citizenship section on 23 March 2006.  That section is processing applications that were made in the first half of 2005.  Applications are dealt with in chronological order because that is deemed to be the fairest way of treating all applicants.  Therefore, there is no question of any prevarication on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in dealing with this application.  As I have previously advised, the person in question can expect to receive a decision on his case in the latter half of next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is customary to thank Ministers and ask them some questions at this point.  I know the Minister of State, whom I congratulate on his appointment, is a decent man.  His response was a disgraceful load of old blather.  He might as well have read the telephone directory into the record.  There was absolutely nothing in it other than a rehash of rubbish about technical ways of doing this, that and the other.  It is a complete farrago of nonsense and a total injustice.  The degree of the Department&rsquo;s respect for the security of the man in question is indicated by the appearance of his name, address and telephone number in the Minister of State&rsquo;s script, which was handed out widely all over this Chamber.  I want the Minister of State to take this lapse very seriously, because under no circumstances should his name have been published in such a manner.  This is an example of the respect for security associated with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Is that from where the trouble is coming?  Who is responsible?  The questions I raised have not been answered.  What accusation was made against the man whose case I have raised?  The Minister of State said the man can appeal the decision that was taken, which is true.  However, he would have to cite the reasons for refusal, which he has not been given.  The Minister of State also mentioned the Freedom of Information Act, but the man in question has been refused under that as well.  There is no democratic accountability whatever in this instance.  I want the Minister of State to raise this issue with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so that it does not end here.</P>
        <P>There has been prevarication in this case.  The entire piece of nonsense that has been read into the record this evening is nothing other than prevarication.  As someone who used to teach English, I know what the word &ldquo;prevarication&rdquo; means.  I can recognise prevarication.  This is nothing other than prevarication &mdash; there is nothing else in it.  Will the Minister of State bring back the message to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the man in this <Col N="267"/>instance is seeking a review of the decision?  I am demanding that review on his behalf.  It is a sad day for this country when people who fought and died for freedom are the subject of such an utter and contemptible violation of democratic accountability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House.  I congratulate him on his reappointment as Minister of State.  I would like to declare an interest before I start to talk about the temporary closure of the social welfare office in Dunmanway.  The closure occurred when the previous branch manager of the Dunmanway service, Kay McCarthy, who was a cousin and a good friend of mine, sadly passed away in July.  Her death was rather traumatic.  As the Dunmanway branch has not been reopened since it closed in July, the Bantry office now has to deal with and process social welfare claims from the Dunmanway area.  Three jobs have been temporarily lost as a result of this closure, which I hope is temporary.  There is no difficulty in providing a premises in Dunmanway.  I understand that the managers enter into a contract with the Department, which provides the premises, staff and budget, etc.  There is no difficulty with accommodation in Dunmanway &mdash; there are a number of suitable premises which can house the office.  The building that was being used until July is still available, to the best of my knowledge.</P>
        <P>In this era of decentralisation, we should ensure that as many services as possible are retained in a town like Dunmanway, which is geographically at the centre of west Cork.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department of Transport and the Marine are well-established in Clonakilty, for example.  It is particularly important that a service that is connected to an arm of the State is retained in Dunmanway, which is a sizeable, vibrant and growing community.  The current arrangements are creating difficulties for the officials in Bantry, who have to cover the duties which were performed by the three staff in Dunmanway.  It is proving difficult for the social welfare administrators in west Cork to deal with the problems associated with social welfare appli<Col N="268"/>cations, such as dispensing money and obtaining documentation.  An increased administrative burden is falling on the workers in Bantry.  Have additional staff members been allocated to Bantry or other locations to help them to deal with the extra workload?  As the Minister of State will know, it is a sizeable town and this service needs to be retained and reinstated as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Given the employment history of Dunmanway, it is important it does not lose this facility forever.  The old manufacturing facility, Monlycke, closed in the 1990s with the loss of 120 jobs which were never replaced.  This is an era of almost full employment and there may be a case to be made that, statistically, the town&rsquo;s employment levels are as good now as before the closure, but the people of Dunmanway want a return of this service.  Can the situation be reversed and the office returned to the normal standard of service before its unforeseen closure which was caused by sad circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator McCarthy for his good wishes.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs delivers a frontline service to its customers through a network of 59 local offices and 66 branch offices countrywide.  The main services provided from these offices include jobseeker&rsquo;s payments, one-parent family payment and a customer information service.  The 59 local offices are staffed by departmental staff.  The 66 branch offices are run by branch managers employed under a contract for service by the Department to administer certain social welfare services to members of the public in their catchment area.</P>
        <P>Owing to the sad and untimely death of the branch manager in Dunmanway, arrangements had to be put in place immediately to ensure continuity of service to customers.  All claims originally catered for in Dunmanway were transferred to the Department&rsquo;s office in Bantry as an interim arrangement to ensure payments were not interrupted.  The number of customers involved included approximately 230 in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment and a further 120 on farm assist, back to work and pre-retirement allowance.  Since the office closed, 20 customers have signed off the live register.</P>
        <P>Arrangements were subsequently made to distribute the claims between five neighbouring branch offices in Bandon, Bantry, Clonakilty, Macroom and Skibbereen.  The distribution of the claims took into account the proximity of the adjoining branch offices and the availability of public transport.  Customers were facilitated on request to change from their designated branch office when another office proved more accessible.  In cases where customers are living more than 16 km from their designated branch office, their signing arrangements were changed to quar<Col N="269"/>terly signing as opposed to the normal monthly signing arrangements.  Service to customers has not been interrupted by these arrangements and payments are continuing as they fall due.</P>
        <P>It is open to people residing in the Dunmanway catchment area who become unemployed to make a new claim for job seeker&rsquo;s benefit or assistance at any of our offices convenient to them.  They may also start the process on-line from the first day they become unemployed.  However, they must attend one of the offices in the catchment area to complete the process.</P>
        <P>If a customer becomes ill and wants to claim illness benefit, they can forward medical certificates directly to the illness benefit section in Dublin or to any of the social welfare branch offices or local offices convenient to them.  A social welfare inspector is located in Dunmanway and this service is being maintained.  The office of the inspector is open to the public on Tuesday mornings and deals with any information queries.</P>
        <P>In keeping with normal procedures when a branch office post becomes vacant, a review of the delivery of social welfare services in the area served by Dunmanway branch office is being undertaken to determine the most effective way of providing these services in future.  The review in respect of Dunmanway is expected to be completed in a month or so.  I undertake to bring the concerns expressed by Senator McCarthy to the attention of the Minister and to inform the Senator duly of the Minister&rsquo;s decision.</P>

        <P>As a matter of urgency I ask the Minister of State to ensure this service will be maintained.  There is no difficulty with competition for the contract and there is no lack of resources, manpower, ability and accommodation.  There is no reason on the Dunmanway side for this office not reopening forthwith.</P>

	<P>I extend a warm welcome back to the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe<b>, </b>and I am delighted he has been re-appointed.  I know he will always assist.  I have always respected him as an old Brendan&rsquo;s man, or &ldquo;The Sem&rdquo;, as we called it.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on this matter.  I have always been of <Col N="270"/>the view that restrictions imposed by a number of planning authorities are illegal and unconstitutional.  I was disturbed to learn that the Department was contacted by the EU, however this may have properly happened.  Does the Department approve of these restrictions?  I note it has refused to publish its views, perhaps because of fear of legal action, and this may be understandable, but I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation.</P>
        <P>I refer to restrictions on ownership as a condition of planning, which in my view never had anything to do with planning and were always misplaced.  I may have recommended to some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessors in the past ten years that a directive should have been issued from the Department to planning authorities to desist actively from including such provisions in planning conditions.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s observations on the issue.</P>
        <P>Private property rights are protected by the Constitution.  The European Convention on Human Rights recognises rights to private property.  Local authorities have been breaching those rights in a blatant manner.  One county council has inserted a planning condition that a person must reside in the residence for up to ten years before he or she is permitted to sell on the property.  Planning permissions only obtain for a period of five years.  This matter has lost any sense of proportion and does not serve any legitimate reason or right.  It is out of order and these are very unfair impositions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his good wishes.  We will probably meet in Killarney again soon.</P>
        <P>The European Commission wrote to the Department on 27 June this year seeking its views on whether the so-called local needs test contained in a number of county development plans for the granting of planning permission for one-off dwellings in rural areas is compatible with Articles 43 and 56 of the European Community treaty which guarantee respectively the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital.  My Department responded to the Commission&rsquo;s inquiry last week and presented a strong defence of our current rural planning practices and policies.</P>
        <P>On the basis of legal advice available to me, I am precluded from publishing either the correspondence from the Commission in respect of inquiries or investigation into possible infringements or the State&rsquo;s responses because these documents are part of legal proceedings.  For this reason, I cannot provide specific details of my Department&rsquo;s response to the issues raised by the Commission.  Nevertheless, I wish to outline some general points regarding the Government&rsquo;s sustainable rural planning policies.</P>
        <P>In line with international best practice, we operate a policy and plan-led planning system which is aimed at providing for proper and sustainable planning in economic, social and <Col N="271"/>environmental terms.  Each development plan contains specific policies to ensure the integrity of the environment and local landscapes is preserved and protected and that development is sustainable in terms of its scale and nature, and reflects the local authority housing strategy.  The development plan must also have regard to national policies and priorities and its objectives must be compatible with the national spatial strategy and regional planning guidelines.</P>
        <P>There is also a need to maintain the rural fabric of our society, to secure more balanced regional development which will facilitate continued economic prosperity in both urban and rural locations and to reverse population decline in more remote rural areas.  One of the core objectives of the Department&rsquo;s 2005 sustainable rural housing guidelines for planning authorities has been to achieve a balance between facilitating rural communities to meet their own internal housing requirements by allowing a certain number of new dwellings, and avoiding large-scale and widespread suburbanisation of the countryside through a highly permissive approach to development of houses in rural areas close to the main cities and towns.</P>
        <P>The guidelines provide that, in areas under pressure from urban development, reasonable proposals on suitable sites for persons who are part of, and contribute to, the rural community should be accommodated, subject to the proper consideration of matters such as adequate waste water disposal, road safety and design standards.  While the guidelines give illustrative examples of those categories of people who may be assessed as having local roots or links, this list is not intended to be exhaustive.  Each planning authority carries out its own assessment of the rural housing needs to be catered for, taking account <Col N="272"/>of local conditions and planning issues as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The elected members of each planning authority formally adopt their own local needs criteria for inclusion in the development plan.  It is appropriate that elected members should exercise this responsibility, in conformity with general national and regional policies and principles, because they are best placed to understand the development pressures and housing needs in their particular areas.  Moreover, the local need criteria are among several issues considered by a planning authority when an application for permission to build a single dwelling is submitted.  In rural areas not under pressure from urban over-spill and those rural areas that have suffered population decline in recent years, there is a more flexible approach to planning applications in order to facilitate community building and repopulation.  In such cases, there are no local needs restrictions but anyone can apply to build a single house, subject to proper planning principles and requirements.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to monitor implementation of sustainable rural planning policies to ensure an appropriate level of consistency in the application of the guidance across all counties.  I hope I have indicated to the Senator the strong principles held with regard to local needs and local planning applications.</P>

	<P>This deals with sustainable rural planning policy as the Department sees it, but it would be dangerous if the Department totally approves of this.  I do not believe it should be on a legal basis.  I accept the Minister is precluded from commenting further due to possible legal action.  On that basis, I must rest my case for the present.</P>
