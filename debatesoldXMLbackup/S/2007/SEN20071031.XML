	<P>I have notice from Senator Kelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the action she is taking to restore public confidence that adequate resources are being allocated to the ambulance services given the recent concerns expressed by ambulance personnel.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene in the case of a South African citizen (details supplied) who has applied for citizenship for himself, his wife and his daughter each of whom is being processed inexplicably on a different timescale.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the efforts being made to attract major employers into the north west and to secure existing employment that will impact on Donegal given the ongoing employment difficulties since the decline of the textile industry and taking cognisance of the recent plant closure announcement by Seagate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport and Marine to provide an update on the progress made towards delivering integrated ticketing for public transport.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Kelly, Norris and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator <Col N="810"/>Donohoe may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to conclude no later than 2.30 p.m. if not previously concluded, with business to be interrupted from 2.30 p.m. to 3.15 p.m; No. 2, statements on developments in the housing market, to be taken from 3.15 p.m. and to conclude no later that 4.45 p.m, if not previously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, on which Senators may share time, with the agreement of the House, the Minister to be called upon to respond no later than 4.40 p.m., and on the conclusion of No. 2 it is proposed to take tributes from party leaders and constituency colleagues of a former Member of this House, to commence no earlier than 4.45 p.m. and to conclude at 5 p.m., and No. 3, Witness Protection Programme Bill 2007, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., and on the conclusion of said Private Members&rsquo; business, I will ask the House to take without debate an earlier signature motion on the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007, at which time it is hoped it will have completed its passage through the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is agreed.  We have held a number of discussions recently on mental health and it would be remiss of me not to mention the late Professor Anthony Clare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who has sadly passed away.  He contributed significantly to demystifying issues surrounding mental health in this country.  As a society we are indebted to the work he did.</P>
        <P>The Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007 is before the House today.  This Bill was passed in the D&aacute;il last week and allows for a pension for the former Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, to be backdated.  I raise the issue because it has come to my attention that a senior garda has also sought to have his pension backdated.</P>
        <P>Given legislation has now been introduced to look after a former Minister, I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Finance the possibility of examining a situation which affects many pensioners in this country.  The website of the Department of Social and Family Affairs states that if one applies late for a pension, it may not be backdated, even by six months, as the decision is discretionary.  It would be appropriate for a protocol or directive to be introduced to allow some discretion so that people who have worked <Col N="811"/>hard for this country and, for whatever reason, are late in applying for a pension, will have the opportunity to do so.  We should not have rules for former Ministers different from those which apply to every other person who has worked diligently for the benefit of this country.  I ask the Leader to bring the issue to Government and advise as to the response.  Every Member of this House has had a case brought to his or her attention where people were not able to get their pension.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is in the House later and I do not want to pre-empt either the discussion which will take place or the decision which will be taken.  I have given latitude to the Leader of the main Opposition party to raise the issue but I hope other Members will wait until the Bill is discussed later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate there is an opportunity to speak on the matter later as the Bill is being discussed in the House.</P>
        <P>We have seen a substantial number of U-turns from the Minister for Transport &mdash; more than any learner driver would dare to make.  The road safety strategy has been significantly undermined by the changes in approach by the Minister in recent days.  It is unfortunate because it is such a serious issue.  Many people died on the roads last weekend.  It is clear that tackling the problems with the driving licence system should be a priority.  Drink driving and speeding are key issues which are not addressed in the strategy as much as they should be.  Not enough action has been taken.  The strategy does not deal with the shortage of CCTV cameras, for example.</P>
        <P>Many provisional licence holders are worried that they will not get an opportunity to do their tests by June of next year.  The Government has had ten years to get this right.  It is extraordinary that it has not managed to put a proper driving test system in place in that time.  That people who apply for driving tests might not be called for 30 or 40 weeks is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s terrible incompetence.  Can the Leader tell the House whether people who are on provisional licences will be guaranteed to get a chance to sit the driving test by next June?  Can it be guaranteed that if people have not been called by next June, the Minister will come back to the House to give them an opportunity to sit the test?  What will the Minister do in such circumstances?  The uncertainty about whether learner drivers will be called to sit the test before June 2008 is causing them huge stress and anxiety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek guidance from the Chair &mdash; I am afraid I am rather confused.  Where am I?  Am I on a little island called Ireland or am I, as I increasingly suspect, on the flying island of <Col N="812"/>Laputa, described by the late Dean Jonathan Swift in <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i>?  I ask partly because of the matter raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  The Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007, which will be considered by this House later today, seemed innocuous &mdash; we thought it would not do any great harm.  However, a measure has been slipped into the Bill, with wonderfully sly sleight of political hand, to assist one of our own.  I accept that the former Minister, Deputy Woods, is so distressed by poverty that he overlooked the fact that he had not claimed his pension for two years &mdash; one can quite understand that, just as one can understand the eagerness of the Irish taxpayer to reward the person who saved the Roman Catholic Church hundreds of millions of euro, at the expense of taxpayers.  It is inevitable that this country&rsquo;s grateful taxpayers are keen to contribute to the former Minister.  I have in my possession a letter that was sent to me by a constituent &mdash; a humble worker in a dental practice &mdash; who has been disbarred for receiving social welfare provisions, such as a pension, because she is employed by her husband.  I wonder how she feels this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>When I heard this morning that the Health Service Executive is in a state of distraction and paralysis over the significant question of how many electricians it takes to change a light bulb, I wondered again whether this is the flying island of Laputa or just a bad joke.  I understand that a garda will be made privy to these special provisions.  We know that garda&iacute; are unusual people because we have discovered that a garda who ran over somebody at 4.30 a.m., having consumed, on his own admission, three pints of stout and at least two bottles, was then taken 14.5 miles by his colleagues to be breathalysed by them and found not to be over the limit.  Garda&iacute; need extra pensions because they are very unusual people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the Order of Business.  Are you seeking a debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or making a speech on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not dream of making a speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>You could have fooled me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Chair tell me where I am?  Is this Laputa or is it Ireland?</P>
        <P>Assuming from the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s expression that it is Ireland, may I raise one other matter?  I understand from radio reports that the Labour Party intends to introduce a civil unions Bill in <Col N="813"/>the other House later today.  I salute the Labour Party for doing so.  I listened to the debate on the radio and I hope we have a better debate in the Oireachtas.  I will re-introduce my Bill.  I was disgusted to hear one of the contributors to the radio debate, Mr. Quinn, refer to the protection of marriage when saying that historically, certain provisions had been in place to protect the wives and husbands of people who died.  That is a downright lie.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My mother was in this situation after my father died when I was six years of age.  My mother got no pension because it was my father who died.  If my mother had died, my father would have got a pension.  I want the lie that was put out on the air &mdash; that the law was introduced to protect spouses &mdash; to be withdrawn.  It was put out on the air that this is to protect the spouses but it is no such thing; it is sheer prejudice.  I really resent what was said and I must put this on the record of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want the Senator to name anyone who is not here to defend him or her self.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will table this matter as an amendment to the Order of Business.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Civil Partnership Bill 2004 be taken.</P>
        <P>In support of my argument, I remind the House that I am a member of a family which was here when St. Patrick arrived on the island.  I am pretty Irish and I do not need to be lectured about Irishness by anybody as to what is and is not Irish.  I am not going to be defined as having second-class citizenship by any person, Member of this House, the other House or the Irish public or told that my relationships, if they are dignified by law, are going to be put by the likes of Deputy Martin Mansergh and Senators in this House at the level of a dog licence.  If to teach people that I will not accept this and that I will get full citizenship eventually&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I will take another trip to Europe if that is necessary.  I am signalling to the House that this is what I will do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want No. 9 on the Order Paper to be taken ahead of No. 1?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I am concerned to hear reports that nine out of ten of the nation&rsquo;s cr&egrave;ches fail to comply with the standards set out by the Health Service Executive.  Reports suggest that some children are sub<Col N="814"/>ject to being locked up while others are subject to bullying and these reports are a cause for concern among parents.  It is important to ensure the level of concern is borne in mind.  Some of these breaches of standards are minor in nature.  Child care is a growing area.  I refer to a report on its annual statistics by the Department of Health and Children published yesterday which predicts a baby boom with total births of up to 70,000 this year, an increase of 11% over last year&rsquo;s figures.  It is important to ensure the child care system is expanded to cater for this demand and to ensure standards are among the best in the world.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for children to the House to outline his plans for the child care sector.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of road safety which was raised by other Senators.  Fresh from the Minister&rsquo;s 90 miles per hour U-turn on the issue of provisional licences, it seems judges have been forced to throw out 5,000 cases concerning learner drivers because they do not know what is the appropriate fine to impose.  As a former member of a local authority, I am also concerned to see that while the Minister&rsquo;s pay will increase by 12%, his Department is overseeing a reduction of 13% in the sums of money expended on non-national roads.  A total of 60% of the nation&rsquo;s traffic is carried on those roads and they have some of the highest accident rates.  If the Minister is serious about road safety, I would like to see him improving legislation in this matter and providing increased resources in these areas.</P>
        <P>Someone once said that if Ministries were provisional licences, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, would be on his third licence.  I would like the Minister to outline to this House his intended actions on road safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>During the time of the previous Seanad I produced a document entitled A New Approach to Child Care.  I ask that the Minister of State with responsibility for children come to the House and explain the details of the new community child care subvention scheme 2008-10, as some confusion exists.  His motivation and intentions behind the changes are first class because it will direct funding towards disadvantaged children.</P>
        <P>I refer to the frightening headlines in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> yesterday about abuse, bullying and neglect of children in cr&egrave;ches.  All Members know that the women of Ireland are major stakeholders and major drivers of the Celtic tiger.  Before the era of economic immigrants, the women of Ireland drove the Celtic tiger.  I am sure that many of the parents and women who still carry the responsibility for the care of children must be petrified.  They go out to work and must commute from 6 a.m., returning at 7 p.m.  They seek clarification of these reports and they want transparency in the standards and vetting applied to child care facilities.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health <Col N="815"/>and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House as soon as possible to explain the position in order that parents can have peace of mind in regard to cr&egrave;ches?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue to which Senator Fitzgerald alluded, namely, the lack of closed circuit television throughout the country.  In our town of Athlone a serious situation has arisen where three ladies were assaulted.  It was clear from the &ldquo;Crimecall&rdquo; television programme last night that the Garda has not yet apprehended anyone for these crimes.  We have had planning permission for CCTV in Athlone since 1998.  Just prior to the general election, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced with great fanfare that we would have it in a few weeks.  Mullingar is in the same position.  Will the Leader appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide funding in the budget for CCTV and come to the House to tell Members the reason we do not have it?</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator White about the urgency of getting the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House.  I support her in everything she said.  It is middle income families who suffer.  While the disadvantaged will be looked after, we cannot keep piling the responsibility for child care onto the middle income group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to come to the House to discuss the scandal concerning the legal profession and dismal failure of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland to regulate that profession?  There is a need for the establishment of a proper and accountable system of scrutiny.  England and Wales, for example, jurisdictions with which our legal system has similarities, have the Office of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner.</P>
        <P>One of the key recommendations of the Competition Authority report at the end of last year was the establishment of a legal services commission.  The Competition Authority notes that similar recommendations have been made in other reports as far back as one by the Restrictive Practices Commission in 1983.</P>
        <P>This is a major scandal.  I believe 10,000 solicitors are registered in Ireland, a small number of whom are involved in this scandal.  It has serious repercussions for the banking system and for the individuals affected.</P>
        <P>When I brought through the Registration of Wills Bill last year, I received no support whatever from the Law Society which endeavoured to ensure the Bill would not become law.  It will do everything to stop anything that affects its members.</P><Col N="816"/>
        <P>This is the time for change.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to bring forward a Bill to allow for independent registration and supervision of the legal profession.  That profession has always had great influence in these Houses but it is time the Government took a hard stand.  It has the excuse now to bring in such a Bill.  No other professional body in Ireland, so far as I am aware, is self-regulated.  It is not a proper approach.  I receive representations from solicitors who want to see an independent organisation established.  They are unhappy with the way in which the Law Society deals with rural members.  The word &ldquo;society&rdquo; is very apt because it is a little club or society which controls its members.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to explain the crisis in the profession and what steps he will take to bring forward a Bill to implement the Competition Authority recommendations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of road safety and the manner in which the Minister for Transport botched the announcement and made a pig&rsquo;s ear of the matter.  He reduced a significant issue to a swirl of confusion.  This is the Minister who is responsible for the Shannon-Heathrow slots, who introduced electronic voting and has now made a mess of the road safety strategy.  He has panicked and confused 122,000 provisional licence holders.  It is important to debate the matter in the House and also the manner in which it was handled.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to that of Senator White in the call for a debate on child care.  The Senator was a shining example in this area in the previous Seanad.  It is important that we debate the issue of funding for child care and the inspection report on cr&egrave;ches, reports of which are carried in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Norris in the point he raised about the Civil Unions Bill being introduced in the D&aacute;il by my party today.  This is important legislation.  We live in a progressive Ireland.  It requires sensible and measured debate by all sides.  I hope those who supported the principles of the Bill when they were in Opposition will support it now they are in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Some weeks ago I raised the question of what might happen at Hallowe&rsquo;en time.  I regret that what I said has come true.  Unfortunately, it is worse than I had thought it would be.  A warehouse in Mullingar was seriously damaged by a fire started by a firework.  Fortunately, the local authority was in a position to facilitate the individual concerned and no jobs were lost as a result.  It made dim viewing to see local authorities having to move into estates around the capital &mdash; the same could happen in Mullingar, Athlone or elsewhere in the country &mdash; to dismantle the piles of material collected for bonfires.  Many old people will be shivering behind their closed doors.  Last night in <Col N="817"/>Mullingar is not a night I will remember with good feelings.  We need a serious clampdown on the use of fireworks and bonfires.  While I do not want to be a killjoy, if we must have bonfires and fireworks, they need to take place in a controlled way.  What is happening at the moment is quite serious and I ask that strong action be taken to prevent it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for information and a debate on the issue of pensions in the light of the decision of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Cowen, regarding the former Minister.  A genuine issue is reflected in Senan Molony&rsquo;s article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> about a garda with no pension despite many years&rsquo; service in the force.  I am sure many others are in a similar position.  The Minister had indicated to this gentleman that he could not legislate for an individual.  However, that is precisely what he has done in this case.  It calls for a debate.  It would be very useful for this House to discuss the issue and have the relevant information from the Minister.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is a symptom of three characteristics of the Government which need to be put in context.  Arrogance has been displayed since the general election.  We have seen it in the extension of the numbers of committees and Ministers of State, and salary hikes which are in no way comparable with other leaders in Europe.  We also have the issue of low standards in high office.  No Minister will stand up and be counted regarding the Taoiseach receiving money for his personal benefit.  We have seen sheer incompetence on the provisional licence issue.  We have known for ten years that a prerequisite for road safety is that people should know how to drive and be qualified drivers.  No move was made on the issue which was highlighted by my party over many years.  The Minister tried to sneak it in over a holiday weekend.  There is no check on the Government and it is unfortunate that its smaller parties do not provide some check.  We do our best in Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to empathise and sympathise with the 900 people who have lost their jobs in Seagate in Limavady.  It is an area just across the water from where I live.  Donegal people are involved in both plants in the north west and it is a sad day for them.  Having gone through the demise of the textile industry, we offer them the hope that with a decent redundancy package, other opportunities may arise.  I add my voice to others asking that the focus&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have provided for the Senator to raise this on the Adjournment later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to discuss the ongoing meetings of the North-South Ministerial <Col N="818"/>Council regarding issues of mutual concern such as employment and access and mobility?  The council is carrying out studies on mutual recognition of qualifications, including in the areas of health and education, the introduction of single tariffs by mobile telephone operators and the greater availability of public service information for people who wish to cross the Border to live, work and study.  The council is also discussing mutual recognition of pensions, which is topical.  Given this activity at North-South ministerial level, it is important that the Upper House be kept abreast of what is happening.</P>
        <P>I commend <i>The Irish Times</i> on the arts section of yesterday&rsquo;s edition, which addressed the issue of music therapy.  The Order of Business was amended, as the debate on suicide, which was due to resume later, has been deferred.  However, will the Leader seek to ensure the debate on mental health and suicide is resumed?  Anybody interested in mental health issues should read the article on music therapy.</P>
        <P>Last week, I called on the Minster for Education and Science to come to the house to debate the issue of funding for child care, which should also refer to the content of preschool education.  This issue is as relevant to the Minister for Health and Children and I welcome Senator White&rsquo;s call for a debate on this because it is urgent and important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The initial proposal by the Minister for Transport regarding learner drivers was a frightful gaffe, which was bereft of common sense.  He subsequently decided to defer implementation until 30 June on the basis of the input of the driver testing industry but there is no way more than 425,000 provisional licence holders will be dealt with by then.  Like Senator Fitzgerald, I call on the Leader for a debate on this important subject.  I would like the Minister to give a guarantee but he may have to revisit his proposal because he will unable to give one.</P>
        <P>On the subject of pensions, it behoves us all to strive to ensure a level playing pitch for all conscientious State servants in whatever category.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader clarify that residential facilities for non-national children seeking asylum are not under the remit of the social services inspectorate?  If so, what measures can be taken to ensure they would fall under its remit, as this is critically important?  Will the Leader also confirm that residential facilities for children with disabilities fall under the inspectorate&rsquo;s remit?  They were previously exempt but plans were announced earlier this year to bring them under its remit.</P>
        <P>Last week I asked if it would be possible for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to address the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent report on vulnerable adults and the law.  Will the Leader ask the Minister, when he comes to the House, to address the vulnerabilities facing those with mild intellectual disabilities in terms of their protection within society and their right to participate as equal citizens?  I ask that he focus specifically on the support services in place when such persons graduate from schools catering for their disabilities.  The parents of such vulnerable persons often find there are no automatic linkages into other support services.  These parents only come to our attention when they are in crisis, either because they are in danger of losing their children or because the latter have fallen into criminal activity as a consequence of their vulnerability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on its investigation into child care services.  Does the Leader agree it is incredible that a national newspaper should have to wait six months to obtain information, at a cost of thousands of euro in freedom of information requests, on an issue of concern to thousands of parents?  Will the Leader allow a debate on the freedom of information legislation and on the provision of information from the Health Service Executive regarding child care facilities?  There must be uniformity in terms of reporting and the follow-up of complaints in respect of such facilities.  I join Senator Mary White in calling for an urgent debate on the confusion surrounding the community child care subvention scheme.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow a debate on the provision of paediatric diabetes services, with particular reference to the HSE southern region, including Cork city?</P>
        <P>I support the comments made by Senators Fitzgerald and Coghlan on the Government&rsquo;s speedy handbrake turn regarding learner drivers.  The silence of Members on the other side of the House indicates they are embarrassed by the Government&rsquo;s handling of this issue.  I raised the matter of the inadequate provision of public transport in rural areas on the Order of Business last week.  With his senseless policy, the Minister <Col N="820"/>almost removed the only means of transport for thousands of people in rural areas.  Will the Leader agree to a debate on the provision of transportation links in rural areas and on the role of the Road Safety Authority?  We have missed an opportunity to highlight the importance of road safety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for a discussion, on the next occasion the Minister for Health and Children comes into the House, on the future role of community pharmacists?  Will the Leader also brief us on the negotiations under way between the Health Service Executive and the pharmacists&rsquo; representatives in respect of the dispute about their fees?  There has been extensive media coverage of this dispute.  Having spoken to pharmacists in my area, it is my understanding that the public perception that they abruptly cut off the supply of methadone to clients is incorrect.  Any pharmacists providing methadone to patients ensured appropriate arrangements were in place to allow such patients to continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What should have been a watershed in efforts to improve road safety has degenerated into a chaotic and shambolic event.  Is this the best the Government can do on road safety?  There is an urgent need for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, to come into this House and explain why he was about to criminalise 120,000 drivers with provisional licences.  He is covering up his significant failures on drink-driving, people driving uninsured and speeding.  Like many others in this House, when I was driving home last Thursday listening to the Minister making these announcements on radio, I am sure drivers, either with provisional licences or not, were overtaking me at speed.</P>
        <P>The Minister has failed utterly in two years to act on road safety.  He should come into the House and explain himself rather than making the U-turn he did at the weekend on what was supposed to be Government policy.  That is a shambles.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the matter of child care.  For the most part I agree with Senator Mary M. <Col N="821"/>White, but I disagree with her indication that the Minister&rsquo;s proposals are first class.  Too many people in Government are driving around with a first-class service, but the Government&rsquo;s proposals for child care are not first class.</P>

Otherwise we will see fabulous empty buildings across the State because the Minister has lost touch with what is happening on the ground.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request by my colleagues, Senators Norris and McCarthy, for a debate in this House on the Civil Partnership Bill.  We should all support the Civil Union Bill which the Labour Party is to bring before the D&aacute;il today but it should be also noted we have a Bill on the Order Paper for this House which deals with the same matter and which would also give a route to legal recognition for same-sex relationships.  This is a matter in which Ireland lags behind other progressive countries and we urgently need that debate.</P>
        <P>I also support Senators Buttimer, Twomey and Mary M. White in seeking a debate on child care.  In examining the provision of child care, Ireland lags very badly behind other progressive and developed countries, as there is a lack of support for parents who work outside the home.  I have raised this issue previously and we should consider it as part of an overall package of measures, including paid paternity and parental leave, which we do not yet have.</P>
        <P>I note the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, in its pre-budget submission launched last week, called for a package of measures to support parents who work outside the home in a variety of different ways, including a greater provision of child care and support for child-care facilities.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i> report demonstrates the need for regulation of existing child-care facilities.  That is a vital issue, particularly for parents who work outside the home.</P>
        <P>I will mention the debate on crime sought last week.  In particular, comments were made on the other side of the House about the need to introduce draconian measures to fight gangland crime.  There were even calls to bring back internment.  It is important we do not succumb to that sort of knee-jerk reaction to the appalling gangland murders we have seen in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill was rushed through because it was necessary to correct an inadvertent slip made in earlier criminal justice legislation rushed through without adequate debate.  On the criminal justice side it is important we consider much more comprehensive and long-term measures to fight the spectre of organised crime in Ireland.  Knee-jerk calls, such as for bringing back internment, are not the correct answer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously raised the matter of empty houses throughout the country and it has now come to my notice that a substantial number, some 5,200 houses, are closed up by local authorities, with managers standing over such a decision.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister responsible to come into the House to explain why this is the case.  People have been on the housing lists for ten years.  A great deal of money has been allocated for housing development, but it would be beneficial if a small amount of money were invested in the refurbishment of these derelict houses to enable people to live in <Col N="823"/>them.  It is embarrassing for the Government and the local authorities that this has been allowed to happen.   </P>

	<P>Senator Frances Fitzgerald paid tribute to the late great Anthony Clare.  I join her in acknowledging that this great man made a marvellous contribution to those who were most in need.  He was a genuine decent friend and a wonderful man.  He made a huge contribution to the lives of hundreds of families throughout the country.  I salute everything he did and achieved.  I extend our condolences to his family at this very difficult time.  As we all know, a sudden death in a family is extremely difficult.  I assure his family that we acknowledge the achievements of this excellent man and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Norris, Regan and Coghlan expressed concern and put forward proposals in regard to pensions.  As the Cathaoirleach said, Members will have an opportunity to express their views in this regard after the Order of Business when the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007 will be taken.  I have no difficulty in stating my opinion on the matter.  If a person is entitled to a pension, having worked long and hard for it, I am sure there is no more caring Minister than the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  The Senator opposite and I, who come from midland counties, as does the Minister, will be aware that the Minister was not reared with a silver spoon as were many people in various walks of life.  He knows the importance of a pension to a family and to the person who has worked hard for that entitlement.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge all the Minister did when he was Minister for Health.  He would have had first-hand experience of this area when he held that portfolio.  Members can make their views known to him on the debate on that Bill.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Hannigan, McCarthy, Coghlan, Twomey and others made known their views on road safety.  I agree a major challenge faces the Government on this issue, but it must be said that from the 21 July 2005 to 20 July 2006 more than 80 lives were saved because of the introduction of random breath testing.  I acknowledge that legislation was introduced under the previous Government.  Fair comment is always welcome in this House, but to say there was not anything done to address this problem is unfair.  Having chaired the committee that was responsible for making the introduction of random <Col N="824"/>breath testing possible, I know the party members who supported me when I presided over the hard decision that had to be made on its introduction.  I do not want to embarrass any Member here but no Member of any party on the opposite side supported me when I made the proposal and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Regarding the Government&rsquo;s announcements on road safety last week, I was disappointed the proposal regarding the use of black boxes, made by the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which I chaired, was not considered.  If it were considered, why has it not been acted upon?  I will seek a debate with the Minister on road safety in which I will make strong play for the insertion of black boxes in the 53,000 vehicles under the Government&rsquo;s stewardship.  The committee was in unison on this proposal.  We have a duty to ensure school buses, taxis and other vehicles that come under Government licence have a black box.  The costs of &euro;200 per box can be wavered in the forthcoming budget as an expense.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, McCarthy, Hannigan and Bacik proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, as is the right of any Senator.  Senators Hannigan, White, McFadden, McCarthy, Keaveney, Buttimer and Bacik called for a debate on the standards in cr&egrave;ches.  Much good work has happened with the setting up of many cr&egrave;ches.  At the outset a grant of &euro;50,000 was available which has been increased to &euro;100,000.  While much has been achieved in this area, there is room for improvement.  I have no difficulty in asking the <Col N="826"/>Minister to come before the House on such an issue.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden called for the Minister to clarify when CCTV will be installed in Athlone and Mullingar.  As the Senator knows, I played a major role when a Deputy to have this decision brought to where it is.  I will assist, along with Senator McFadden and my counterparts in the D&aacute;il, to see this happen at the earliest time possible.</P>

	<P>Senator Leyden called for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend a debate on the legal profession and the proposal for a legal services commission and putting in place new procedures.  As I said last week, solicitors, in the main, have been trusted by families for generations.  We do not want to see anything happening to that trust.  I hope in the coming weeks we  can have a debate on the difficulties that have recently emerged in the news.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn made a timely call for the use of fireworks to be licensed so they can be used in a controlled way during festive times.  All Members agree with these sentiments and I will pass them on to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We can have a debate on this worthwhile proposal when we are debating environmental matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney expressed her disappointment at the announcement by Seagate on the closure of its plant in Limavady.  The company employed 900 and all Members will join with the Senator in this disappointment.  However, we must also welcome the announcement by a former Member&rsquo;s company, Northbrook, of the creation of 300 jobs in the North of Ireland.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s concerns at the Seagate closure.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney also called for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to address the House in a debate on North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  We have had a debate once every year at least in this regard, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs updating the Seanad on matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  I have no difficulty with this and it should happen before Christmas if at all possible.</P>
        <P>I am certainly in agreement on the music therapy debate and am conscious how important that is.  Senator Keaveney has excellent skills in this area.  Her expertise is a major asset to the occasional discussion in the House of matters pertaining to the music industry.</P>
        <P>Senator Maria Corrigan sought clarification and I apologise to her and to Senator Tony Kett, because I overlooked finding out from the Minister about the matters she quite correctly raised.  I shall certainly take this matter up today and I have no difficulty in allowing time for the Minister to come to the House again to take proposals <Col N="827"/>from very experienced Members in this field such as Senator Corrigan.  Her membership of the House will certainly enhance debates pertaining to this area over the next five years.</P>
        <P>Senator Jerry Buttimer also called for a debate on Health Service Executive services, especially in the south.  There is no difficulty in allowing time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivor Callely called for a debate on the role of pharmacies and the progress of the current discussions with their representatives.  As I said the last time this call was made, there is no difficulty in allowing time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivana Bacik called for a further debate on crime.  I have no difficulty with this either as we all know there is no longer a fear of the law.  I call on members of the legal profession who are Members of both the D&aacute;il and Seanad to come together and contribute to a debate on how we can put back that fear of the law.  Ultimately, that is what it is all about, regardless of the crime.  We must look to the professionals to come to our assistance.  It is the professionals in each area who can bring about meaningful change.</P>
        <P>Senator Larry Butler called for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on housing.  As the House knows, a debate on this issue is scheduled for today and I look forward to the Senator&rsquo;s contribution.  He quite correctly pointed out that 5,000 houses under local authority stewardship appeared to be vacant.  The Senator has some knowledge in this regard and will impart it later in the debate in the House.</P>

I shall endeavour to have the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, address the Seanad within the next two weeks in this regard.  I listened to him tentatively this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and he made an excellent contribution during his interview.</P>

    <Title>Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007: Committee and Remaining Stages. </Title>
        <P>Sections 1 to 15, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The motivation behind section 16 has changed since we last discussed this Bill in the House.  Was it based on other legislation lying around in the Department of Finance that just needed to be tidied up as part of other miscellaneous legislative measures, as we were led to believe?  We were told by the Minister last week that there were eight sections in this Bill when it was first proposed to the Government and that an additional 17 were tagged on.  It now transpires that the motivation behind section 16 was very much to look after one individual.  Regardless of the long-standing merits of the legislation, we now know its basis.  It was interesting that a Government Senator first questioned this.</P>
        <P>A Green Paper on pensions was published by the Government not long ago.  The pension proposals therein have all the newness of a reheated dinner yet, with great haste, section 16 found its way into this Bill.  People are of the impression that the Opposition somehow approves of it in the same way that the Taoiseach and Ministers approve of giving themselves such extravagant pay awards at a time when, in the words of a former Taoiseach, we should be tightening our belts in view of what lies ahead.  This lowers the standing of politicians in the eyes of the general public.  We are making fools of ourselves.  Why was it not announced that this section was inserted to suit one individual and was based on correspondence sent by that same individual to the Minister for Finance? That should have been made known.</P>
        <P>Nobody will dispute the fact that people are entitled to their pensions.  That a former Minister forgot to claim his pension is irrelevant.  What I object to is the sneakiness and the Government&rsquo;s hope that this provision would slip in under the radar, which has happened before.  That is why members of the general public raise their eyebrows at this sort of behaviour.  It is indicative <Col N="829"/>of corruption and of a Government serving itself rather than the people.  Rather than being outraged, people are silently angry that the Government is once again looking after itself, with large pay awards, generous pensions and changing legislation to suit its members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not much Senator Twomey has said with which I could disagree.  It does not do any good in a republic to have people treated differently.  </P>
        <P>What is the purpose, under a Bill entitled Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions, of this section?  One can only assume the miscellanous provisions element allows anything to be introduced in the Bill but surely in legislation, items should be related to one another?  Does the inclusion of miscellaneous provisions in the title of a Bill allow for any provision to be introduced on the whim of the Minister?</P>
        <P>Deputy Micheal Woods, on whose behalf this provision is included in the Bill, described it as the Minister clearing up an anomaly.  I suggest that is not the case.  This provision proposes to create an anomaly.  In the past 18 months I have written to the Minister for Finance on several occasions on behalf of constituents who could not obtain their pension entitlements because they had failed to claim them before a specific deadline.  The Minister indicated, quite correctly, that he could not possibly change the regulations because that would open up a can of worms.  If that response is good enough &mdash; and I believe it is a good and prudent response &mdash; for ordinary pensioners, why is it not good enough for Deputy Woods?  All pensioners should be treated the same before the law.  This is not appropriate in a republic because we are treating one individual differently from everyone else.</P>
        <P>We are creating an anomaly by introducing this provision in law, which is not wise.  It is not appropriate to damage law by creating an anomalous situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the sentiments of the previous speakers regarding this matter.  At the weekend, through some excellent journalism, we became aware of further information pertaining to section 16 of this Bill.  I agree with Senators Twomey and O&rsquo;Malley that this is no way to conduct our business.  Adding a large amount of so-called bits and pieces to Bills allows for circumstances such as this to arise and increases public cynicism.  It does not do the legislation any good, nor does it reflect well on us as legislators.</P>
        <P>One would have to ask why the information about Deputy Woods revealed over the weekend was not given to us before.  Why was it not made clear that somebody had basically forgotten to claim his pension entitlement and that a request had been made to the Department of Finance to change the rules?  If we had known that, we would <Col N="830"/>have been able to deal with this section of the Bill in a more prudent and informative manner.  We read today as a result of another piece of excellent journalism that a garda made a similar request to the Department of Finance but it was denied because of the possibility it would set a precedent.  The reality is this is setting a precedent, which my fellow speakers have said.  We should treat everybody in the same manner.  State pensioners can only backdate their pensions by six months.  In this instance, a former Minister&rsquo;s pension will be backdated much further.  It will breed cynicism and the public will say politicians are looking after themselves again.</P>
        <P>This comes on the back of pay awards which the Government was given and accepted last week.  It shows a Government which is out of touch.  Furthermore, I cannot believe the Deputy in question said it was not a huge amount of money in real terms.  It is &euro;37,000.  On the back of what the Taoiseach and other Ministers said last week about the pay awards, I find such a comment amazing.  It is a significant amount of money.  When the Deputy retires from the House, it will contribute to him having a significant pension.  Given the work he has done, there is no question but that he is entitled to his pension but for one to say this is not a huge amount of money is crazy.</P>
        <P>We should have had this information when we dealt with the Bill last week.  There is a huge lesson to be learned.  Bills brought before both Houses should be more coherent.  The idea of adding on miscellaneous provisions creates a dangerous precedent.  In cases where provisions are being made for individuals, we need more information when a Bill is going through the House, otherwise these situations will arise.  We must treat people fairly in regard to pension entitlements.  We cannot have a situation where the Government looks after an individual who is a former Minister but does not treat people who apply for similar entitlements in the same manner.  Many of us have had cases brought to our attention and have made representations on people&rsquo;s behalf which have been turned down.  How can such representations be turned down when this one was facilitated by the Minister for Finance?  The situation is ridiculous and needs to be changed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>As was alluded to by Senator Twomey, I was the only one who raised concerns about this provision on Second Stage.  I asked why a provision of this nature was being included as a miscellaneous provision in a Bill in respect of which we had to agree to an earlier signature motion and had a time limitation on it because of the main provision dealing with markets in financial instruments.  I was surprised the issue was not taken up elsewhere.  The debate was very rushed and we dealt with the Bill in the minimum amount of time.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>However, the concern I expressed then is one which I express now.  This provision did not need to be dealt with in this Bill and it could have been dealt with in a Finance Bill or in a Bill following the Green Paper on Pensions about which we have spoken on several occasions on the Order of Business.  There was no time specificity about this measure.  It has created obvious unhappiness among members of the public, to which we need to respond as a House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>However, we have passed Second Stage.  All of us need to dwell on how the Bill proceeds from here and keep in mind that all Stages need to be passed today given its main provision concerning markets in financial instruments.  Outside this measure, there is nothing objectionable in the Bill and there is much that is necessary.  It is fortunate we have this opportunity on Committee Stage to reopen a debate on an issue which did not get a proper airing in the first instance.</P>
        <P>Not only do I wish to repeat the concern I expressed on Second Stage but we need to put down a few markers on what should constitute a prior consultation process before the introduction of legislation in either House of the Oireachtas.  This is especially relevant early in the life of what is, following my party&rsquo;s involvement, essentially a new Government.  As I said on Second Stage, legislation which contains miscellaneous provisions is bad and we should avoid it at all times.</P>
        <P>In terms of the details of legislation, being part of a Government involves having an active consultation process prior to the presentation of a Bill to either House of the Oireachtas and I regret that has not happened on this occasion.  Outside the main provisions of the Bill, which we are obliged to pass today, I ask for an acknowledgement that this issue was not properly addressed and, as Senators said, that it is dealt with properly in terms of having an even playing pitch in the area of pensions, that all who offer public service in this State are treated equally and that any inconsistencies in the system and any anomalies which arise because of bad legislative practice are corrected at the earliest possible opportunity, if not in the upcoming Finance Bill then at least in the two social welfare Bills which will come before the Oireachtas on foot of the budget in the next few weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very sorry to see my old friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in the hot seat today because he is a thoroughly decent and honourable man.  It cannot be a very happy day for him to stand over this squalid business.  I also recognise what Senator Boyle said and I salute him for it.  He has acknowledged the technical difficulties but he did not go as far as I would have liked into the morality of this because it is the morality which stinks.  However, he has done the House a service by pointing out just how insidious this process was.  The Green Party is a <Col N="832"/>partner in Government and holds the No. 2 position.  However, it was not consulted about this and it is important to state that on the record.  It is very damaging.  </P>
        <P>What kind of Government is it when this kind of material is smuggled in?  The reason the Green Party was not told is that it stinks.  This is about a snout in the trough and I will label this the snout in the trough amendment.  The Minister of State need not shake his head because that is precisely what it is.  It is for one person who, as I said on the Order of Business, was so impoverished by circumstances that he did not even notice and apparently believes &euro;37,000 is very little money.  Some people live on a lot less than that.  He is in receipt of more than &euro;100,000 per annum from the other House and has just been given another &euro;20,000 for being chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I have always had good relations with this gentleman.  Perhaps we should address the fact one can get severance plus a pension while one is still serving and in receipt of an income.  We are heading into choppy financial waters.  Is it any wonder people in this country have contempt for politicians?  Look at the language of this section, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&rdquo;(9) On application for a pension under this section to the Minister for Finance, by a person whose entitlement to the pension arose on or after the date of commencement of this section, the pension is payable as of and from a date that the Minister for Finance may determine in writing that is&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) not earlier than the date of entitlement, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) not later than the date of the application.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is laughable.  I asked on the Order of Business whether I was in Ireland, which is one little island, or the flying island of Laputa, described by Jonathan Swift as the place where they distilled moonshine from cucumbers.  Is there any possibility one could, in one&rsquo;s wildest dreams, have granted a pension earlier than the date of entitlement?  Alternatively, could one grant a pension later than the date of application?  This is bizarre material and a complete disgrace.</P>
        <P>We have been told a garda made a similar application and was denied so this provision has been made specifically for one senior member of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I also received a letter from a constituent, with which I will shame the Minister of State by putting it on the record.  She writes:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have just been informed by my local tax office that I am not entitled to a PAYE credit of &euro;1,490 because I am an employee of my husband&rsquo;s business (section 472, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997).  I work as a dental practice manager.  My hours of work are Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the same as all other employees in the business.  I believe I am being discriminated against because of my marital <Col N="833"/>status and this is grossly unfair.  I am also not allowed to make PRSI contributions, for the same reason, and this means I have no social welfare entitlements, including sickness benefit, maternity, pension etc.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What about that woman&rsquo;s pension?  She would be glad enough with &euro;37,000.  The former Minister does not need his pension but forgot all about it.  It did not bother him and he did not notice it.  In addition, he thinks it is for a small amount.  If it is a small amount, let him give it to this woman.</P>
        <P>I wonder what happened to Fianna F&aacute;il, the people&rsquo;s party.  It is a very bad day for this country when we pass special legislation in the interest of one Member of the other House.  It is disgraceful.  Hesitation has been expressed on the Government side so I will give them an opportunity to put that into practice by calling a vote on this section.  I will also oppose the earlier signature motion this evening.</P>
        <P>I wonder if President McAleese, who is a lawyer herself, will feel comfortable signing this nasty little fiddle.  Any other citizen would be told that if they did not put in an application on time, they would be in trouble.  I have just paid my preliminary tax and received a letter from my accountant saying it had to be in the post to arrive in Limerick by a certain date or I would be fined.  I am an Independent Member and not part of the Government but could I, as a Member of the Oireachtas, get special legislation enacted to save me from the financial consequences of my carelessness or forgetfulness?  I am completely against the snout in the trough phenomenon and I will vote against the snout in the trough amendment.</P>

	<P>In supporting the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007, and the section we are now discussing, I am conscious of the fact that a pension is not an arbitrary payment, nor a gift.

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A pension is deferred pay and that is a fact of life.  It belongs to that person.  We are dealing with one section of the Bill which relates to a former Minister and other people who might find themselves in that situation.  Notwithstanding that, it behoves us to look at all sections to ensure that people who might miss out do not do so.  It is wrong to point the finger at this person.  I believe people should have all their entitlements and we should look at the issue because such people have worked for their pension and deferred their pay during their working life to make provision for when they retire or no longer do the job in question.  In the future, if people have certain entitlements they should be given a letter from the Department to advise them to apply within a certain date or their circumstances could become very difficult.  </P>
        <P>We owe the press a service for pointing out this matter.  The issue must be dealt with across the board to ensure equity because to prevent one person from getting a pension is wrong.  It has given us an opportunity to ensure equity across the board.  The Opposition has quite rightly spoken on behalf of a civil servant who lost certain rights but on Second Stage the Opposition did not even speak to the Bill.  Not only that, a Senator who has spoken on behalf of civil servants today called certain civil servants liars on the last occasion he spoke.  That took me by surprise because in the years I have been in this House, I have rarely heard anybody called a liar.  It ill became the Member to call civil servants liars on that occasion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and to deal with it on a logical and truthful basis.  The provision brings payment to Ministers into line with civil and public servants who make late applications for a preserved pension.  Whether or not an individual case arose, ministerial pensions must be brought into line, irrespective of whether they make a late application, in the same way senior civil servants, to whom we are aligned, can take up a pension if they apply late.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will deal with a number of issues that have arisen.  One concerns the application by the former Minister.  It is important to put on record the fact that arrears of pension for the period in question would amount to approximately &euro;75,000, as against the &euro;500,000 which has been touted in the media. A person who is still serving receives an abated pension.  It is a two-year issue that is at stake in this instance.  I want to comment on some of the terms which have been used during the debate on this case.  Words like &ldquo;morality&rdquo; and &ldquo;sneakiness&rdquo; have been used.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  When the former Minister made an application to the officials in the Department of Finance, it became obvious to them that there is an anomaly in the system as it relates to Ministers, as opposed to public and civil servants.  The departmental officials recommended to the Minister for Finance that the anomaly should be rectified.  The recommendation did not come from the Minister for Finance.  The former Minister did not make representations to the Minister for Finance in his own case &mdash; that is a fact.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the subject of transparency as it relates to the issue that has arisen.  It is clearly stated in the supplementary information that accompanies the Bill that this is the issue in question.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to note that this issue arose during the debate in the D&aacute;il.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was raised by Deputy Burton.  When she asked the Minister for Finance if these provisions apply to any former Minister, he specifically said that they do.  When Deputy Bruton was asked about this issue yesterday, he acknowledged that it had been discussed in the D&aacute;il.  Therefore, I can state categorically that nobody was trying to hide this issue.  It was a matter of public knowledge.  When Deputy Bruton was interviewed yesterday, he acknowledged that the issue had been debated in the D&aacute;il.  There is nothing underhand about it at all.</P>
        <P>If a serving Minister makes a late application for a pension, he should be entitled to receive it, just like all other public servants, including the senior civil servants to whom Ministers are aligned in all aspects of these matters.  It was agreed by both Houses that the pay and pension rights of Ministers, including pay increases, should be aligned with those of senior civil servants.  This measure extends those rights to provide for late applications.  Nothing underhand is going on.  This is very much above board.  Other than those who are taking issue with this proposal because they want to make political fare from it, everybody acknowledges that the former Minister in this case is entitled to equity and should be given his full pension entitlements, even though he made a late application.</P>

	<P>A number of other issues were raised.  Senator Boyle suggested that this issue could be dealt with in the forthcoming <Col N="837"/>finance Bill.  However, it could not be addressed in that Bill because it has the status of a money Bill.  Other Senators argued that this measure should not be attached to this legislation at all.  Given that some other issues are dealt with in the miscellaneous provisions section of the Bill, it is appropriate to resolve this anomaly in this legislation as well.  It would hardly have been worthwhile to introduce a separate Bill to cover this issue on its own, when certain supplementary issues were being addressed as part of this legislation.  The Minister for Finance has acted with absolute probity and transparency in everything he has done in this instance.  Equity is being applied to a former Minister in line with the guidelines covering all other public and civil servants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying a few issues.  I am not certain about one thing.  The Minister of State indicated that this proposal will bring the rules relating to ministerial pensions into line with the current practices for senior civil and public servants.  We heard earlier today about the case of a former senior Garda inspector.  I am worried about the distinction that has been drawn.  I presume that discretion will be the order of the day here.  While I am comforted somewhat by the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, he has not stated directly that an existing anomaly is being corrected, although he has implied it.  I do not like the fact that a senior public servant will not benefit, or be given an advantage, in the same manner as the former Minister in this case.</P>

In this Bill, the Minister for Finance is regulating to ensure that the same thing that applies to civil and public servants also applies to any Minister.</P>

	<P>What about the issue I raised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister&rsquo;s case is not comparable to the case of the garda that was highlighted in a newspaper article today.  The garda in question was dismissed from the force in 1973.  At that time, forfeiture of superannuation benefits applied in the case of dismissal.  Preservation did not become a feature of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na superannuation scheme until October 1976.  Under the terms of the scheme, therefore, the garda in question does not have any superannuation entitlements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not quite finished.  The Minister of State suggested in his reply that it is not necessary to deal with this matter today, which is something that was also inferred by Senator Boyle.  We need to make progress with the Bill, but that could be done even if this section were to be withdrawn.  I do not want to put ideas into Senator Boyle&rsquo;s head, but I am interested in the notion that this proposal could be withdrawn and discussed at a later stage.  The Senator made the very good point that it could be considered in the context of the Green Paper on pensions.  Would that be appropriate?  Surely there are currently no time constraints in the case of the individual.  Is the individual getting any money as things stand?  Would the Minister of State consider withdrawing this section of the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>He could allow the rest of the Bill to go forward and deal with this matter at some future time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister of State to explain the motivation behind this proposal and to outline how this section found its way into the Bill.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s comments about the finance Bill were right, but the provision relating to ministerial pensions could be included in the forthcoming social welfare Bill.  Perhaps it would not sit easily with the Government to include in that Bill, which will probably provide for social welfare increases of &euro;10 or &euro;12, a measure facilitating the payment of a pension of &euro;30,000 to a sitting Government Deputy who is earning more than &euro;120,000 per annum.  The Minister of State would probably find it very uncomfortable to slip a ministerial pension of this magnitude into a social welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>We wish to examine the motivation behind this section of the Bill.  I am sure there are many other anomalies with regard to pensions.  I refer to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who was dismissed in 1973 but the superannuation payments changed in 1976.  I am sure there are other <Col N="839"/>members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were somehow disadvantaged in the years to 1976.  I am sure many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have written to the Department of Finance over the past 31 years and would have received replies from various Ministers for Finance stating that the law could not be changed in favour of individuals.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to provide some background information.  I question whether this legislation was designed to be slotted in to deal with the case of one individual.  I note that some Senators and some members of the Government are taking umbrage because their little scheme has been exposed so beautifully in the <i>Irish Independent</i> .  We need to know how this provision found its way into this legislation.  I can understand how some other provisions found their way into this Bill whose initial eight sections were increased to 17 sections.  There is a significant issue with regard to sub-prime lending and mortgages and many other aspects of the legislation.  Some Members on the Government side of the House are acting like they are the only ones with any expertise on legislative issues.  I would be one of the first to admit and the first to acknowledge constructive criticism with regard to my knowledge.  When this Bill was discussed in the House last week, Senator MacSharry was very quick to state that those of us on this side of the House had limited knowledge.  I acknowledge that our knowledge was limited because these issues are being slipped into legislation and we are not being informed.  I remind the House that the general public reading newspapers such as the <i>Irish Independent</i> regard us as a crowd of gougers looking after ourselves.  We must ask for clarification when this is exposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Richard Bruton is a man of great integrity.  When he acknowledges that he did not know about this last week when he allowed this legislation to go through, he is attempting to preserve the integrity of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He allowed this legislation go through because he was not fully informed.  We are now fully informed as to what is happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>He was fully informed.  During the debate in the D&aacute;il it was asked if a former Minister was involved and the Minister for Finance said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Deputy Bruton acknowledged this yesterday in a radio interview.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was left at that, even though people on the other side of the House are usually quite good at giving far more information than just replying with a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  This is a serious issue and it is a recent happening.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to provide the background information to this section of the Bill. <Col N="840"/> When did the Department of Finance decide to include this provision in the Bill and what was the motivation for this provision?  Did the Department simply decide it had a bag of bits and pieces lying around waiting to be included in legislation?  This does not seem to be what happened in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to join with other colleagues who have paid tribute to investigative journalism in this case because these journalists have done us all a considerable service.  Colleagues will know that I was quite critical of the newspaper industry in the context of the defamation Bill.  Many Senators did not have the courage to say very much because they were afraid of the power of the newspapers but I am not afraid of them.  However, this instance shows there can be good investigative journalism and it happened without the passage of the defamation Bill or anything like it.  This was a case of good investigative journalism.  On the issue of the defamation Bill, I challenge the Minister of State to provide an example where investigative journalism was stifled because I do not know of a single instance. </P>
        <P>I refer to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill which is as clear as mud.  One would need one&rsquo;s attention drawn to this provision.  I agree that technically the Government is covered, but it is opaque.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the fact that his two junior partners in coalition are of the same view.  They made it clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>They changed the mind of one of my partners when she found out the true facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all seen horses getting close to the water but they can be a little bit reluctant to drink; there is a little bit of political hydrophobia hanging around this House.  At least she came to the brink of the trough.</P>

	<P>Jimmy O&rsquo;Dea will never be dead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is a good thing she did not shove the snout in because there are plenty of people around here who, at any available trough, whether it contains water or money, will shove their old snouts in for a good snuffle, hoping there will be dollars in it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the former Minister, the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which he receives a payment of &euro;20,000.  We should all be grateful because he did us all a favour, letting the Church off with a couple of hundred million euro and sticking the taxpayer with that amount.  We should all be delighted and grateful.  I am also grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s clarification of the amount which is <Col N="841"/>&euro;75,000.  This is a small amount, a flea bite, according to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a small amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are doing today is shabby.  It was an attempt to slip this provision in by sleight of hand and I am very unhappy.  I have made the point and others could produce dozens of examples of the anomaly between the way in which a Minister is treated compared with an ordinary citizen.  I thought this country was a republic but it is obvious we have an aristocracy which behaves as if it were in the days before the French Revolution.</P>
        <P>I have never exchanged a cross word with the Minister involved.  I have no problem with him but I have a terrible problem with slyness and greed.  I heard him remark that when one discovers anomalies in the law, one rectifies them.  We all know this is not the case and it is not true.  When the time comes for the budget, submissions are made by groups representing the disabled, the blind, cystic fibrosis sufferers and so on.  I refer to Susie Long, who died because she was sentenced to death for the crime of poverty, as I stated six months ago.  This was an anomaly in the health service but we did not rush.  It was not just a question of &euro;75,000 here or there or a small sum of &euro;35,000 which we did not notice until two years later; this was a question of life or death.  It is not correct to say that we as legislators have shown anything like the same alacrity in ironing out the anomalies that arise when they affect ordinary people but when they affect one of our own, my God, there is a sudden rush of draftsmanship and the introduction of legislation.</P>
        <P>This section should be withdrawn for further discussion and I ask the Minister of State to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The motivation behind this section of the Bill should be examined.  For the information of Members on the other side of the House, last week I examined the Bill in detail, particularly with regard to sub-prime mortgages.  While it is a technical Bill, those of us on this side of the House are well capable of examining such technical Bills.</P>
        <P>I question the inclusion of section 16 and the reason this provision was not included in a social welfare Bill.  People will be concerned that there seems to be one law for Members of the Oireachtas and another law for everybody else.  An anomaly in law exists between the general public and politicians.  Coming on the back of events of recent weeks such as pay rises, the people would be right to be sceptical and cynical and there is no argument against it.</P>
        <P>I have worked in the public service for a number of years and I have seen people struggle with their pension entitlements, particularly those who were cut off in 1978 regarding co-ordinated and unco-ordinated schemes.  I refer to those who <Col N="842"/>for family reasons left the workplace and then returned to work and who have struggled to have their pension entitlements updated.  There are many such scenarios.  There are a substantial number of anomalies in superannuation and pension schemes for public and civil servants and others outside that area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Such as Irish Shipping.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many anomalies.  The key question is whether they will all be dealt with.</P>
        <P>We need to know the timeline for the Bill.  On the representations made to the Department of Finance, while I accept the <i>bone fides </i>that it was done through Department of Finance officials rather than through the Minister, we need to know how long the Department of Finance had for drafting this and at what stage it decided to include it in the miscellaneous provisions part of the Bill.  We need to know that for a number of reasons.</P>
        <P>I presume the Department of Finance has had a number of other representations on pension entitlements at the same time.  We should ask anybody who has made representations to the Department of Finance for pension entitlements in the past six months or year to draw them to our attention.  Those of us in the House, especially on this side, might take them on board.  I suggest those people contact us and bring any such representations they may have made to the Department of Finance to our attention so that we can say to the Department that there is one law for the former Minister and another for a person who is not in receipt of his or her pension entitlement because of a similar anomaly.  In this scenario the Government will not give a person his or her entitlement but will fast-forward the entitlement one of its own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, for coming to the House and performing a great service by clarifying the matter in the way in which he has done.  Like other Senators, including Senator O&rsquo;Malley, I had certain reservations and some concern in regard to the possibility of creating a precedent that would specifically benefit one individual on whatever side of the House.  The Minister of State has made it clear that a precedent is not being created and that there are relativities at issue.  As one who was a teacher for much of my life and who was involved in some trade union negotiations, I am keenly aware that relativities in terms of some levels of employment are important and are embedded in the system of pay and remuneration.  I do not think it should be any different for the former Minister in question who, <Col N="843"/>in fairness, has given long and distinguished service.  If he is entitled to something he should be entitled to it the same as anybody else, no better or no worse.</P>

	<P>No interruption, please, Senator.  The Minister of State also has helped us to clarify the position whether this act was one of stealth or otherwise.  It is clear the Opposition in the D&aacute;il was not perhaps as wide awake as the Opposition in this House today.  Perhaps their forensic or inquisitorial skills were lacking on the day but, quite clearly, they were informed fully and it was up to them to deal with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister applied for the pension in September 2006.  The case was put to the T&aacute;naiste when this Bill was being prepared in March 2007 and a recommendation was made to amend the legislation in line with the legislation covering public and civil servants to do away with the anomaly.  The T&aacute;naiste agreed to this.  The Bill was published on 20 April 2007 and has been in the public domain since.  I <Col N="844"/>refer the Senator to section 16 which clearly outlines what the Minister for Finance intends to do in terms of pensions legislation.  It is there for all to see.  With courtesy to Opposition Members in the D&aacute;il, they specified the case and asked questions.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance was transparent in telling them it was part of the Bill and that there is a former Minister who would be given his entitlements under the changes made in this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there anyone else involved?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Not that I am aware of.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Senator allow the Minister of State to finish?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a right and an entitlement.  I am surprised that people such as my learned colleague would seek to deny the right of an individual to a proper pension.  He is entitled to it in the same way as anybody else.  Senior civil servants are entitled to it.  Deputy Michael Woods was entitled to it.  There was an anomaly in the law which he brought to the attention of the civil servants involved.  They made a recommendation to which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance agreed.  I specify again that there was no sneakiness.  Deputy Michael Woods never made any representations to the Minister for Finance on this issue.  He dealt specifically with the Department of Finance, pointing out the inequity in his case as against other civil and public servants.  It is important that be put in line.  The Government will not withdraw this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Two Senators have indicated.  We have given the Bill quite an airing having spent an hour and ten minutes on this section alone.  I call Deputy Twomey for a brief comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a retrospective element to this section in the sense that any Minister who served less than three years but more than two years prior to 1993 could also be in line for a pension.  Obviously that comes into the equation as well as what we have discussed.  The motivation behind all this is quite specific in that one is looking after ministerial pensions and not just for the former Minister, Deputy Woods, whom it may be unfair to name.  There may be a few more who will come out of the woodwork, especially those who served less than three years and more than two years.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is considered to be the fault of the Opposition that the Government serves the people so badly.  Let us get away from type of nonsense.  This section has obviously been slotted in to suit ministerial colleagues.  Given that the Government likes to boast about how long it has been in power, its members will obviously benefit most.</P>

	<P>As other Senators have asked, are there any other anomalies within the Department of Finance?  While I do not want to put the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials on the spot, it is obvious that this section was slotted into this important legislation.  Are there any other anomalies in the Department of Finance that should be dealt that?  A former Minister has benefited quite substantially from this because he slipped up.  No doubt there will be other former Ministers who will look forward to checking this legislation once it goes through the House.  The section caters for a defined group of people &mdash; former Ministers.  Perhaps the Green Paper on pensions is about them looking after themselves even more.  We want to know whether there are other anomalies &mdash; there clearly are &mdash; of which the Government is aware and why they are not being addressed.  Why has the Government singled out one of its Members for pampering treatment, which is why we have concerns?  The Government claims it is putting Ministers on the same terms and conditions as other public servants.  However, that is clearly not the case because a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a public servant.  There were clearly problems regarding the change to superannuation payments in 1976 for a garda dismissed in 1973.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are anomalies in the public service that have not been raised with the Government or that it does not feel the need to address.  We did our best to accommodate the passing of this legislation because we were told it needed to be passed by tomorrow or else there would be problems for the Government.  It might have been clever on its side to try to slip this one through at short notice.  Perhaps we should not be so accommodating.  We are insulted for not doing our job when we are trying to accommodate the <Col N="846"/>Government with what we are told is important legislation.</P>

Currently, a pension is payable if the former office holder applies for it within six months of becoming eligible for it; otherwise, it is payable from the date of application [that is the present state].  This amendment will allow for payment to be backdated to a date not earlier than the date of entitlement.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _cl11.7- ?>How, for God Almighty&rsquo;s sake, could it be backdated before the date of entitlement?  There may be some arcane reason for it that I do not understand.  It is clear that the Government is making a special case to backdate a pension that was not applied for.  The explanatory memorandum continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">It also brings the qualifying requirements for a Ministerial pension under the &lsquo;&rsquo;old&rsquo;&rsquo; (i.e. pre-1993) pension scheme into line with the pro<Col N="847"/>visions of the current pension scheme.  In effect, it provides for payment of a Ministerial pension to a member of the pre-1993 scheme who has more than two years service as a Minister.  This has been the position for members of the current scheme since 2001.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a separate item.  There is an attempt to blur that by running the two together in what is being said from the Government side.  It was interesting to hear the Leader of the House, Senator Donie Cassidy, trying another little rub that will show on the sleaze indicator.  He said to the Opposition: &ldquo;Ask your own crowd.  Were they the only ones?  Ask your own crowd&rdquo;.  In other words, there might be a bit left in the trough for a few Opposition snouts to get to work on.  That is the kind of politics we are at.  He appears to be laughing at the fact that the Opposition did not notice it going through.  It was the Opposition&rsquo;s fault.  It was asleep on the job, it did not have the forensic skills and asked the wrong questions.  However, he suggests not doing anything about it because there is a bit of gravy left in the trough for the Opposition Members to snuffle around in.  I do not regard that as very elevated morality, but who am I?</P>

	<P>I reiterate that there is absolutely no sleight of hand.  There are a number of miscellaneous provisions in the Bill including this one.  On Second Stage the T&aacute;naiste stated: </P>
        <P LI="1">Section 16 makes amendments to the provisions dealing with ministerial pensions, as follows.  First, former office holders &mdash; Ministers and Ministers of State &mdash; on leaving service are entitled to receive severance for up to two years.  Circumstances can arise where, through oversight or otherwise, a former officer holder does not apply for the pension within the specified time period, namely, within six months of severance payments ending.  The amendment would give the Minister for Finance the discretion to backdate the payment of pension in the case of an application made outside the six-month limit to the date of entitlement and reflects a similar provision which applies to Civil Service pensions.</P>

        <Decision><?oasys _is0p10- ?>Question declared carried.</Decision>
      </Vote>
        <P>Sections 17 and 18 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are related and may be taken together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed</P>
        </Speaker><P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 20, to delete lines 29 to 35 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;  &lsquo;credit&rsquo; means a cash loan (whether or not provided on the security of a mortgage or charge over an estate or interest in land), but does not include credit of a class specified in section 3(2) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995;&rdquo;.</P>
           <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary purpose of section 19 is to enable the Financial Regulator to regulate and oversee the conduct of business by firms in the non-deposit-taking lending sector, which lend to the general public and to small businesses.  It does so by bringing non-deposit-taking lenders engaged in retail lending within the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s authorisation and ongoing supervision regime by way of an amendment to Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.</P>
        <P>As indicated on Second Stage, the technical drafting of this legislation has presented significant legal and technical challenges, particularly in <Col N="850"/>the areas of the definition of credit and retail credit firms.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, is to address these difficulties in a way that ensures the Financial Regulator can focus as a matter of priority on any activities in respect of which there is a legitimate concern.  In addition, it ensures other entities, or credit activities, which are not intended to be the subject of these measures and about which the same concerns do not arise are not inadvertently brought into the scope of this aspect of financial regulation.</P>
        <P>To achieve this, &ldquo;credit&rdquo; in page 20 is being redefined as credit extended to individuals, including consumers.  This captures the core business of the firms that are subsequently defined as &ldquo;retail credit firms&rdquo; for the purpose of their regulation.  In page 21, I propose to delete lines 6 to 44, inclusive, and in page 22, to delete lines 1 to 11, inclusive.  These interpretations are no longer required as they refer to forms of credit now excluded from the definition.</P>
        <P>While it may be desirable to have a more comprehensive definition of credit extended to individuals and to encompass retail credit extended to small companies, it is not possible to do so without including a much wider range of wholesale financial transactions, which are not the focus of the current measure.  This would also open the risk that the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s time and resources would be taken up in dealing with applications and inquiries from people and firms who are not the objects of the proposed regulation.  It would divert the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s <Col N="851"/>resources from the core concern of extending the level of protection available to customers of firms dealing in cash loans and mortgage lending to vulnerable individuals.  It could also have the effect of constraining the normal availability of commercial and business-to-business credit provision to the detriment of the business sector and the economy generally.</P>
        <P>Several amendments to definitions are required on foot of the necessity to limit the scope to natural persons.  The definition of &ldquo;retail credit firm&rdquo; in page 22 therefore focuses on firms that are in the business of providing credit, as defined, to individuals.  However, it also includes those firms that have, for whatever reason, sought prescription as &ldquo;credit institutions&rdquo; under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This clarifies that credit provided by these lenders &mdash; which may be of a wider range than consumer credit &mdash; is governed by the general provisions applicable to consumer credit.  It is appropriate, therefore, that they fall under the definition included in this amendment.  The definition excludes several categories that are otherwise authorised or do not need authorisation on the basis that they do not interact with the primary customer or offer credit to the public.</P>
        <P>The amendment on page 22, after line 21, is also consequently necessary to ensure the scope of section 19 is confined to consumer lending.  The amendment inserts a new provision to allow the Financial Regulator to exempt from the requirement to be authorised individuals and categories of person whose transactions might in some circumstances appear similar to retail credit but which do not pose any real regulatory or customer protection concerns.</P>
        <P>These new definitions will bring non-deposit lenders engaged in retail lending into the regulatory system, particularly those firms and lending business in respect of which regulatory concerns have been raised, in a targeted, effective and proportionate manner without giving rise to unintended adverse impacts.  The Department of Finance will continue to liaise with the Financial Regulator as this new regime is implemented and to monitor developments in this area to ensure an appropriate regulatory regime is in place.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure it has taken weeks for officials in the Department of Finance to correct this legislation.  We, however, are expected to figure out what is involved in 24 hours.  It will not be surprising if other difficulties arise in due course, even though we are supposed to have debated the Bill thoroughly.  We are in the dark on many aspects of the legislation.  It is disturbing to see Ministers coming into this House to propose that entire sections should be deleted.</P>
        <P>The store cards offered by many large retail stores are effectively a form of credit for regular customers.  Will these stores be required, under this legislation, to obtain authorisation from the Financial Regulator before issuing such cards?</P>
      
        <P>Subsection (7) of section 29A, as inserted by amendment No. 4, states that lending institutions must &ldquo;publish in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> a notice of every exemption granted, and every revocation made&rdquo;. <Col N="855"/> However, subsection (8) goes on to state that failure to comply with subsection (7) &ldquo;does not affect the validity of an exemption granted, or a revocation made, under this section&rdquo;.  This is contradictory.  What is the point in asking banks to publish notice of exemptions or revocations if there is no sanction for not doing so?  Either subsection (7) or subsection (8) should be deleted so that the requirement is necessary or it is not.  It may actually work that way.  The excuse may be used that there may be an oversight on the bank&rsquo;s behalf in informing the relevant authorities and the exemption should be allowed to stand.  Why was the section put in this fashion?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I regret that it is very difficult for me to examine this matter deeply because I am unsure of what currently stands.  We should have had a <?oasys _dc18- ?>wider debate on the matter but this is the last time it can be discussed before<?oasys _dc0- ?> it must go through the D&aacute;il later this afternoon.

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on developments in the housing market and to hear the views of Members on a topic that is of great importance not only to my area of responsibility but to the overall economy.</P>
        <P>The past year or so has seen significant changes in the housing market.  A key point I want to make is that recent trends in aspects such as house prices and housing output involve, essentially, a return to a more normal and sustainable pattern and will not necessarily have negative results as some media comments might suggest.</P>
        <P>Why then one might ask is there so much talk about a housing market slump and pleas for the Government to reduce or abolish stamp duty?  Part of the answer is media hype, but many commentators have also made the mistake of comparing current data with the exceptionally inflated levels to which house prices, lending and sales had risen in 2006 rather than with more realistic longer-term trends.  Not surprisingly, particular interests that had become accustomed to very high returns from an inflated market are feeling some discomfort, which is being voiced in pleadings for Government concessions on stamp duty.  I will return to this later, but first I would like to present some facts and comparisons that provide a valid assessment of the current state of the housing market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding house prices,<b> </b>the official figures for the second quarter of 2007 &mdash; based on returns from all lending institutions &mdash; show that average second-hand house prices nationally fell by under 2% since the start of the year and that the new house price average increased by around 6%.  The Permanent TSB-ESRI index in August indicated an overall reduction of 3.3% in average house prices nationally since the start of 2007.  Sherry Fitzgerald estate agents recently reported that the average price of a second-hand property nationally had reduced by 4.5% in the year to date.</P>
        <P>A recent report by the Internet site <i>Daft.ie</i> showed a reduction of around 2% in asking prices <Col N="858"/>of houses generally since July but a very slight increase in the past 12 months.  <i>MyHome.ie</i> recently reported asking prices overall down 0.7% in the third quarter of 2007 on the preceding quarter and 1.4% below their peak 12 months earlier.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most important fact &mdash; which many commentators have missed &mdash; is that average new house prices nationally in the middle of this year were still 27% above what they were at the start of 2005 and second-hand house prices were 20% higher than the 2005 comparison.  Similarly, the Permanent TSB index at August 2007 was about 18% higher than at the start of 2005.  After some 12 months of a cooling in the housing market and endless prophecies of doom, there is no evidence to date of a collapse in house prices.  Instead, the statistics show a long-term trend that is strong but healthier now than last year.</P>
        <P>In regard to the volume of sales in the market, Members will have seen numerous claims along the lines that &ldquo;nothing is selling&rdquo;.  Returns to my Department from the mortgage lending institutions do not support this.  For example, during the first nine months of 2007, more than 66,000 mortgage loans were paid out and almost 76,000 new mortgages approved. These figures include around 33,000 payments and 32,000 approvals for newly built dwellings.  Adding purchases funded without mortgages or through commercial loans, it is evident that, although the volume of transactions has certainly reduced, the housing market is still very active and far from collapse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As with house prices, it is instructive to compare this year&rsquo;s lending figures with the trend prior to the explosion of lending in 2005.  The volume of loan approvals in the first nine months of 2007 was less than 5% lower than in the first nine months of 2004.  This suggests that the level of activity in the market is largely returning to a more normal long-term pattern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other key housing market indicator is the level of new house completions.<b>  </b>New house output to the end of September totalled more than 56,000 units, on target for an outturn in the region of the projection in the DKM construction industry review and outlook of up to 77,000 units this year.  If achieved, that would be one of the highest levels of output ever.  House building activity remains very strong, producing more than five times the rate of output of our nearest neighbour, the UK; our rate of output is 18 per 1,000 population compared with about four per 1,000 in the UK.</P>
        <P>Commentators predict further reduction in output in 2008, with forecasts generally ranging from 60,000 to 65,000 units.  That would represent a significant reduction on the 2005 and 2006 levels when output over the two years combined reached almost 175,000 units.  That rate was well above international levels and not sustainable on an ongoing basis.  However, as in the case of house prices and loan volumes, the anticipated future output trend is not out of line with the <Col N="859"/>longer-term pattern and what is likely to be a sustainable level of output, especially if allowance is made for the likelihood of a degree of over-curtailment by developers in the short term.  For example, it would be higher than anything achieved prior to 2003 and in line with estimates of around 600,000 residential units over nine years underlying the Government&rsquo;s policy statement earlier this year.</P>
        <P>What conclusions can be drawn from recent trends?  Some prophets of doom will claim, even if the housing market has not yet crashed, that it will do so in the future.  There are no certainties.  Economic performance will be the key determinant of the future development of the housing market and circumstances can change, but aside from the possibility of some significant economic setback, for example, in a global context, the prospects look positive.</P>
        <P>Several months ago, I commented in an article on the housing market that a transition to a more balanced and mature market in output, purchasing, lending and prices was under way.  The data I have quoted from a range of sources lend clear support to this analysis.  To assess accurately the current state of the housing market, it is necessary to see recent changes in the perspective of developments during 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 18 months up to the third quarter of 2006 saw dramatic house price escalation.  Underlying demand for housing was already high owing to strong economic performance and the high intake of workers following EU enlargement.  The impact of these fundamental factors on demand and prices was greatly magnified by a large expansion in mortgage lending since 2005, with 100% mortgages, 35 and 40-year terms and interest-only mortgages.  The buying frenzy was further fuelled by hype about buyers being excluded from the property ladder.  With the glut of credit in the market and many buyers bringing forward purchases to avail of 100% loans, it was not surprising that overheating occurred.</P>
        <P>Unprecedented levels of house prices combined with a doubling of interest rates seriously damaged affordability, leading inevitably to a weakening in the volume of purchases and in prices.  What happened over the past 12 months has, essentially, been an unwinding from unsustainable price levels and a rolling back of the irrational escalation that occurred during the previous 18 months.  Recent reported cuts in asking prices towards the higher end of the market merely show how inflated some segments of the market had become.</P>
        <P>The ESRI&rsquo;s latest quarterly economic commentary predicted the annual average price of a new house in 2007 is likely to be 3% lower than in 2006.  This would suggest that house prices generally at the end of the year could be expected to be in or around where they would have been had the market continued on a path of moderation in the 2005 to 2006 period.</P><Col N="860"/>
        <P>Amid hype and speculation about market slumps, crashes or hard landings, many commentators seem to have lost sight of the fact that moderation in house prices has given first-time buyers a welcome chance of owning a house without resorting to excessive levels of mortgage debt.  It is now a buyers&rsquo; market, which is good news for both first-time buyers and people trading up.</P>
        <P>Those who comment in negative terms about house price moderation should reflect on where a continuation of the price escalation that prevailed up to a year ago might have led.  I question comments about the value of people&rsquo;s homes being affected by market softening or uncertainty.  Such comments seem to imply that house purchase is some sort of speculative venture or, possibly, a source of paper wealth to fund consumer spending.  The promotion of 100% loans and interest-only mortgages also reflected an expectation of continuing house price escalation, with house purchase seen as a means of building up equity from a zero starting point.  There has now been a welcome retreat from these practices and recent events in financial markets globally should further discourage such attitudes from becoming embedded in the housing market.</P>
        <P>House purchase is fundamentally about getting a place to live.  The fact that house prices are no longer escalating does not create uncertainty for home owners, nor does the reduction in the average price index diminish the intrinsic value of any household&rsquo;s home.  Similarly, a person&rsquo;s home is not put at risk simply because average prices may have levelled off or even if they reduce somewhat.  The concept of negative equity is not relevant to most home owners.  Recent research shows the majority of first-time buyers do not intend moving from their homes in the short term.  Most buyers are not, therefore, likely to be affected, even if there is a short-term fall in house prices.  Even those trading up are better off in a climate of price moderation because the net additional cost will not be as great as it would be if there was still rampant house price inflation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Affordability of repayments is the key issue for most prospective and recent buyers and the doubling of mortgage interest relief in the last budget &mdash; to &euro;16,000 for married or widowed persons &mdash; has been very beneficial to them. The agreed programme for Government contains a commitment to provide, in budget 2008, for further increase in mortgage interest relief, bringing the ceiling as high as &euro;20,000 for couples and widowed persons.  These measures, together with indications of a levelling off in interest rates, provide a considerable measure of assurance to existing mortgage holders and make house purchase more attainable for prospective first-time buyers.</P>
        <P>House price moderation may not be such good news for those who charge fees for their services as a percentage of the overall house price or for institutions whose annual growth figures were boosted by the cycle of bigger loans, higher <Col N="861"/>prices, and further increased lending.  Auctioneers now need to sell the market more vigorously and get across the message that there is now better value to be had.  Builders will no longer find units flying off the plans.  They will not find people queuing outside their building sites.  Instead of focusing on how they can shore up prices, one hopes they will concentrate on providing good value through greater price resistance in relation to land, <i>inter alia</i>.  Mortgage lenders need to follow a prudent but reasonable approach rather than simply trying to boost growth figures in the short term.  At the same time, it would be unhelpful if any over-reaction by lending institutions were to contribute to cyclical weakening in housing output, just as it helped to fuel price escalation in the over-heated market of 2005-06.</P>
        <P>Owners trading up or down should realise that, by reducing unrealistic price expectations, they can gain at the other end of the transaction.  I expect auctioneers to play their part in delivering this message even if lower transaction prices will inevitably mean lower commission in the shorter term.</P>
        <P>Housing output is running at a lower rate than was expected at the start of the year.  Last January, the CIF was reported as expecting more than 90,000 units to be constructed in 2007, which would lead me to question the basis for recent forecasts from the same source that housing output next year could be well below what most reputable commentators are predicting.  Output this year is still likely to come in at a very respectable level.  It also should be noted that while output generally is down, it is quite strong in some key centres, with increases, for example, in Cork city, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and south Dublin, while some other areas of high demand are also performing above the national average.</P>
        <P>The industry needs to manage the adjustment in output in a measured, orderly way, avoiding a possible cycle of under-production and supply-demand imbalance.  It is important to distinguish short-term demand in the housing market, which is very susceptible to factors such as interest rate changes and price expectations, from longer-term underlying demand determined primarily by economic and demographic factors.  Recent reduction in house building probably has been influenced to a great extent by short-term factors, whereas the prospects regarding underlying demand for housing remain very strong.  Underlying demand should continue to be underpinned by economic and demographic factors and by reducing household size and scope to increase further a housing stock that is still below EU norms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The demographic trends are worth emphasising.  Projections for the purposes of the national spatial strategy indicate an additional 1 million in population within 15 years.  Census figures indicate that the population of those aged between 25 and 34 &mdash; the key household formation group &mdash; grew by more than 100,000 in the four years, <Col N="862"/>2002-06, an increase of 17%.  I am also informed that there is currently a new baby boom under way, at levels last seen in the late 1970s.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the next generation of Irish workers who may further boost demand for housing in the longer-term.  There are also a number of positive factors in the more immediate context.  The prospects for income growth remain positive.  Increased mortgage relief, first-time buyer stamp duty exemption, greater accessibility to the market as result of easing prices and the prospect that we may now be at or near the top of the ECB interest rate cycle, will all have a beneficial impact.  In fact, I understand that at present ten-year fixed interest mortgages of 5.5% are available.  Returns from investment in residential property have also improved.  Some commentators point out that strong demand in the private rental market, and what a major firm of estate agents referred to recently as &ldquo;continued resilience of investor demand&rdquo;, also confirm the strength of underlying housing demand. </P>
        <P>Those who predict a house price crash usually point to the scale of price increases in the past ten years.  However, this has been matched by unprecedented economic growth, with a doubling of employment and very strong increase in net after-tax income.  As a result, housing affordability as measured by the Department&rsquo;s affordability index remained favourable despite price increases up to 2005 but disimproved sharply due to price and interest rate escalation in 2005 and particularly in 2006.  The position has, however, improved again this year due to price moderation, income increases and doubling of mortgage relief.  Nationally, the figure is comfortably within acceptable affordability norms relative to net income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The possible wider economic implications of reduced house construction activity have received much attention.  As the Minister for Finance has said, the recent forecast of economic growth of 3.25% in 2008 is impressive by international standards and at a level of which many of our EU partners would be glad.  Housing activity contributes about &euro;10 billion to the economy or just over 7% of all economic activity.  However, this must be put in perspective.  Manufacturing and services activities combined &mdash; both of which are traded internationally and are growing well &mdash; make up more than 80% of economic activity overall.  I <Col N="863"/>was interested to hear a statement by the Small Firms Association in recent days welcoming what it sees as a rebalancing of economic activity, with less dependence on house construction.  Growth in other areas, both non-residential construction, boosted by national development plan expenditure, and other sectors, will help to compensate to a significant degree for reduction in house building activity.</P>
        <P>In so far as my Department&rsquo;s functions are concerned, infrastructural and planning requirements are in place to enable housing output to continue at a strong level.  There is a large stock of residential planning permissions in existence and permissions granted in the second quarter of 2007 rose by 26% nationally on the same quarter in 2006, with much higher increases in Dublin and the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The housing sector will be strongly supported by investment of &euro;21 billion under the national development plan, including &euro;18 billion to support the expanded social and affordable housing programmes &mdash; and will meet the housing needs of some 140,000 households over the life of the plan.  Record levels of activity are being achieved on the local authority housing programme in 2007 and overall output of social and affordable housing, at some 4,350 for the first half of 2007, is up 24% on the same time last year, while Part V delivery has increased by 51%.  Government policy in relation to the entire housing sector is being developed and implemented within the framework of the housing policy statement <i>Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, </i>published earlier this year.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed to hear pleas from some construction and auctioneering sources for a Government bail out in the form of further stamp duty cuts.  Budgetary policy, including stamp duty is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Finance and I have no intention of engaging in any speculation in that regard, as it would be neither appropriate nor responsible to do so.  However, I want to take issue with some of the assertions that have been made about the impact of stamp duty on the housing market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stamp duty on property transactions has existed for many years.  In addition to providing a valuable source of Exchequer funding, it enables the Government to maintain a wide and low direct tax base and it also helps keep other taxation at a relatively low level in comparison with other jurisdictions.  The rates of duty for second-hand purchases have been unchanged since 2001 and did not restrain the market surge in 2005 and 2006.  Recent cooling in the housing market did not originate from comments about stamp duty changes last autumn, as some claim, but rather from the decline in affordability due to house price escalation and the doubling of interest rates.  The first indication of a turn in the market came with a significant drop in mortgage approvals during the period July 2006 to <Col N="864"/>September 2006, in which the number of approvals dropped to 25,000 from 35,000 in the previous quarter.</P>
        <P>More important, a further reduction in stamp duty would not be likely to promote a significant increase in housing market activity.  This is because a net increase in market demand can come from two sources only, namely, investors and first-time buyers.  At the end of every chain of house purchase transactions, there must be a new buyer from one or other of these sources.  Stamp duty has been already abolished for first-time buyers and not even the stamp duty militants in the media are proposing that investor duty be reduced.  Returns to my Department show that there has been a slight increase this year in the proportion of investors acquiring properties, particularly second-hand dwellings.  Any reduction in stamp duty would, of course, have to be made up from other sources, both existing and new.</P>
        <P>The Government, by exempting all first-time buyers from stamp duty, has reduced the cost of purchasing a home for first-time buyers without any housing equity of their own while also restoring stability and certainty to the housing market.  The case for any further reform or updating of the system as a means of boosting housing market activity is not convincing.  Such a move would be tantamount to a subsidy for house prices and indirectly for professional fees.</P>
        <P>Future developments can never be predicted with confidence &mdash; and the track record of economic pundits is probably worse than racing tipsters.  However, the broadly positive prospects for the housing market are supported by some reputable independent sources, both domestic and international.  For example, the IMF, while pointing out in its recent report on the Irish economy that a sharper correction in house prices could slow economic growth significantly, commented that the slowdown of the housing sector had been gradual so far and would help to rebalance growth and contain inflationary pressures.  Moreover, a message highlighted at the outset of the IMF report was that Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance &ldquo;remains very strong, supported by sound policies&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In this economic climate, we should urge people to understand that affordability is better, that we are at the top of the interest rate cycle, that stamp duty has been removed for first-time house purchasers and that one bargains instead of paying the price being asked.  Until recently, buyers thronged through the doors of those selling houses but the latter must now learn again how to sell in a tough market.  It is now time for auctioneers and builders to put the shoulder to the wheel.  The past ten years have been outstanding for them and there is now a need to make an effort to persuade those who can afford to be in the housing market to take the opportunity to buy houses at a more affordable level than was the case heretofore.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  I have not had the opportunity to do so until now.  I thank the Leader for allowing time for this important debate on housing.</P>
        <P>It is important that we consider seriously not only the impact of the housing market on the economy but also the impact of housing trends on people&rsquo;s lives.  After all, housing is essentially about people and their necessity and basic right to have a roof over their heads.  It is not just about generating money and keeping developers happy, as some would like to believe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is obvious that the construction sector has been a key driver of growth and employment in this country.  In 2006, the sector accounted for around one quarter of value added in the economy and 13% of the labour force.  New housing surged as a source of tax to represent approximately 12% of all taxes.  Of the 530,000 new jobs created in the Irish economy between 1998 and 2006, more than one quarter were in the construction industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">House building alone accounted for 15% of GNP in 2006, compared with 6% to 8% in most other advanced economies.   The housing boom was financed by big increases in household borrowing, making Irish households on average among the most indebted in the world.  This is a very serious and stark fact.  Overall, half of the total stock of lending is linked to the property market and 75% of the increase in the year up to June 2007 was linked to the property market.  More than half of the permanent units distinguished in the 2006 census were built since 1971.  The period since 1996 accounts for 28% of the total housing stock.</P>
        <P>To date, the housing and construction sector has essentially contributed to and bankrolled a large percentage of Exchequer funding through the collection of associated taxes such as stamp duty, VAT, capital gains tax, development levies and income tax.  The Government has propagated a very high level of dependence on the housing and construction sector.</P>
        <P>All is not so rosy in the garden at present.  We may talk up the economy as much as we like &mdash; nobody wants it to crash &mdash; but we must realise that serious challenges lie ahead.  Despite the warning signals from many economic commentators that the housing market was about to face new challenges, both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste dismissed their legitimate concerns and labelled them as &ldquo;prophets of doom&rdquo;, which term I noted in the address of the Minister of State.  They sat on their hands hoping the good times would continue to roll on but now reality is beginning to bite and stagnation seems to be the order of the day in the housing market.  Any auctioneer will tell one this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The evidence, statistics and trends suggest that the Government now belatedly accepts there are serious consequences for the economy on the <Col N="866"/>horizon and this is now reflected in the spending cuts proposed in the pre-budget Estimates that are now before the Oireachtas.  Taxation from the housing boom camouflaged the sharp rise in day-to-day spending as a proportion of national income.  Prices and housing output peaked in 2006 and have fallen since, reflecting a combination of rising interest rates, declining affordability, tighter credit conditions, excess supply and declining household and investor confidence.  Largely as a result of the contraction in housing investment, in the recent pre-budget outlook the Department of Finance revised downwards projections for economic and employment growth.</P>
        <P>These forecasts are largely consistent with independent forecasts, such as those of the Central Bank and ESRI, which both assume new housing construction of 65,000 units in 2008, which represents a decrease from 78,000 this year and 93,000 last year.  The Construction Industry Federation forecasts that new housing will fall to 45,000, at most, in 2008.  This is more consistent with the latest housing starts data.  Every fall in new housing output in the order of 10,000 will knock an additional 1.2% off annual GNP growth.  Davy forecasts 45,000 construction job cuts by the end of 2008.  Independent commentators, rather than the Opposition, are making these comments and it is therefore time the Minister of State sat up and took notice.  It now seems the Government&rsquo;s reputation for competent economic management was built on very shaky foundations.  The debt-fuelled housing boom has now declined and the new challenges in the housing market must be faced up to.</P>
        <P>How does all of this impact on people?  In 2006 there was a housing unit vacancy rate of 15%.  I refer to the total vacant houses and flats and holiday homes as a percentage of the total housing stock.  Senator Larry Butler referred this morning to many local authority houses that are lying vacant.  Who is in charge?  Is it the managers and executives of local authorities or is it the Government, including the Ministers, who are elected to ensure people are served by the local authority managers and ultimately housed?  The circumstances that obtain serve as another example of the Government&rsquo;s abdication of its responsibility to the ordinary people of this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask Senator Larry Butler to use his influence as a Government Senator to request the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State responsible for housing, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to exercise their powers to ensure county and city managers have the necessary resources to ensure house letting is fast-tracked and that the houses are inhabited immediately by those on the waiting list.  It is not acceptable that these houses should remain vacant while individuals and families are on the list for years.  It is not acceptable that these houses are vacant while <Col N="867"/>individuals and families are on waiting lists for years.</P>
        <P>Thousands of families are indebted to banks and there are real concerns regarding their ability to sustain mortgage repayments in the face of rising interest rates and a drop in property values. The number of home repossession cases coming before the courts is on the rise, which is a serious and stark indication that families are now feeling the pinch financially.  In 2005, 65 mortgage suits were issued in the High Court and in 2006, the number increased to 74.  In 2007, the figure is expected to increase further.</P>
        <P>The provision of social and affordable housing is also way behind target and there is no consistency across the local authorities in terms of achieving their targets.  Is it Government policy that local authorities will no longer engage in the direct provision of social and affordable housing through their own building programmes and will rely increasingly on private developers servicing the housing list through their Part V obligations under the Planning and Development Act?  It is essential that local authorities be encouraged and properly resourced to build houses for those on the housing lists and not wait and depend on developers and builders to do so.</P>
       <P Just="Left">The urban and town renewal schemes introduced by the previous Government were announced to much fanfare.  The Government claimed they would change the face of Irish towns and urban areas.  How effective were the urban and town renewal tax incentive schemes in delivering value-for-money housing and accommodation?  I contend they were very ineffective and could cite several examples from my own county of Waterford.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to affordability.  Housing is fast becoming unaffordable, in both the private and public housing sector, for those who need to house themselves.  There is a clear link between interest rates and affordability.  Lower interest rates reduce the cost of mortgages, thus increasing affordability and consequently demand for housing.  Rising interest rates are putting home ownership out of the reach of many.  Affordable houses sold as part of the Part V arrangements in local authorities are also becoming unaffordable because the qualifying thresholds are restrictive and people are falling between stools and unable to reach the so-called affordable cost of the house they so badly need.</P>
        <P>The rental sector throws up some stark statistics.  More than 50% of new houses purchased are bought by investors for rental.  There is a strong rental market throughout the country but standards in rented accommodation must be examined and problems tackled head on.  Local authorities have a strong role in monitoring rental accommodation but it appears they do not have adequate resources to carry out their functions and responsibilities.  Only 36 cases were taken in 2006 against landlords who failed to meet housing <Col N="868"/>standards.  No single county council in the country took legal action against a landlord but nobody can claim that all the rented housing units under the remit of the councils are up to standard.  Vulnerable tenants are suffering because of the lack of proper inspection plans for privately rented properties.  Residents who live near these properties also must endure poorly kept and maintained properties.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State did not refer to land use, zoning and public services and their impact on property prices.  Lands that are zoned residential in many city and town development plans are set aside by developers who control the supply and cost of housing.  This issue must be addressed because it relates directly to the high cost of property.  Where lands are zoned and subsequently banked by developers, local authorities must take action so that housing is provided in a planned and sustainable manner for communities.</P>
        <P>Development charges also contribute significantly to the cost of housing.  Developers are being levied at an increased rate for the provision of essential infrastructure in local authority areas such as roads, water services and sewage treatment facilities.  All these costs are being passed on by the developer to those purchasing houses.  Ordinary people are funding through their mortgages the public services that should be provided by the State.  We should not promote a system that hangs a financial millstone around the necks of young families.  If we continue down this road, serious problems lie ahead.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are abdicating their responsibilities as service providers and allowing the developers to charge those who are purchasing houses.  We must take back control of the provision of public services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and this debate on housing.  It is very important that we ensure our people have proper housing.  As representatives of the Government, it is important we set out clearly what we intend to do over the next five years.</P>
        <P>The Government has doubled its social housing commitment to &euro;2 billion per annum, which is twice the level of six years ago.  In 2006, the output from the local authority housing programme was at its highest level for 20 years, with 6,500 homes completed.  The Government has ensured builders provide a portion of affordable and social houses when developing housing schemes.  It established the affordable homes initiative to provide 10,000 affordable homes by using State lands.  It also developed the affordable homes partnership to accelerate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area.  In short, the Government provided for the needs of 65,000 households through various social and affordable programmes during its last period in office.</P>
        <P>In terms of the future of housing, the structure of the forthcoming budget will be important.  Senator Coffey&rsquo;s point regarding the delivery of <Col N="869"/>housing to our people was a valid one.  In the forthcoming budget, the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers and those who bought their houses in the past seven years will be increased from &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 for single people and from &euro;16,000 to &euro;20,000 for couples and widowed persons.</P>
        <P>The Government will expand the delivery of social and affordable housing options to meet the needs of 90,000 households.  It will plan strategically for the needs of a changed population to reflect a more dynamic population which moves more often and includes new migrants.  It will also work to support the elderly in their homes.  A new focus will also be placed on quality in the provision of housing.</P>
        <P>The remit of the affordable homes partnership will be extended.  After only one year in operation, the partnership, which operates in the greater Dublin area, has proved very successful in engineering land swaps for affordable housing, identifying new lands for the provision of affordable housing, and in providing clear information to those interested in acquiring affordable housing units.  The remit of the partnership will be extended nationwide to cover areas where affordability is a problem.</P>
        <P>New urban design guidelines for building new housing developments will be introduced.  The new housing guidelines launched last March are a comprehensive revision of the 1999 social housing design guidelines and have been produced following a consultation process with all stakeholders active in the area.  The new guidelines focus on the process surrounding the delivery of quality housing for sustainable communities, improved settlement patterns and place-making in the context of promoting quality neighbourhoods.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The guidelines include sections dealing with site selection and urban design objectives in the provision of housing which aim to promote quality in design.  The purpose of these guidelines is to assist in achieving the objectives for delivering homes and sustaining communities as contained in the Government statement on housing policy, which focuses on creating sustainable communities that are socially inclusive.  This social inclusion would be brought about by promoting high standards of design and construction, higher standards of environmental performance and durability in housing construction, seeking to ensure residents of new housing schemes enjoy the benefits of first-rate living conditions in a healthy, accessible, visually attractive and easily managed and maintained environment.</P>
        <P>In the past, we have fallen down in terms of looking at how we manage and provide facilities for people in estates.  Mistakes have been made.  We now have an opportunity to correct the design and layouts.  Local authorities have been charged by both Houses of the Oireachtas, which provide finance, with responsibility to ensure better housing and conditions for people.</P><Col N="870"/>
        <P>On the Order of Business, I mentioned that 5,200 houses in this country are empty.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money has been used.  Senator Coffey said we have a responsibility.  We take that responsibility seriously but the county manager also has a responsibility.  Fine Gael councillors control most county councils, so Fine Gael and the Labour Party must take responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I did not interrupt Senator Coffey, so I do not expect him to interrupt me.  It is important to ask the Minister to audit the local authorities to ensure they get better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We can argue about how we do that.  Houses lying empty in Dublin alone cost &euro;1.1 billion.  It is my responsibility as a Senator and spokesman to ask the Minister to carry out an audit of each local authority to see how this can be addressed, especially when one considers that some people must wait up to ten years for housing.  That is not fair.  The county manager in each local authority has a responsibility to get better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money which we allocate to local authorities.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments that we should not interfere in the marketplace.  The market will decide and it is not for politicians to interfere in the market because it distorts it.  There is now competition in the marketplace.  The construction of 100,000 houses per annum is unsustainable in a country as small as this.  We have had a marvellous run and it is important to allow the market to adjust, which it is doing.  A year or two ago young people were under a lot of pressure to get a house and they will now have an opportunity to do so, which is good.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Doherty.</P>

	<P>I think he will be cut down to three minutes.  We have to keep the Shinners in their place.</P>
        <P>This shows lamentable signs of turning into a fairly dreary debate.  One of the reasons is that we are losing sight of the human issue and that housing is the single biggest expenditure for young people, either single or married.  Previous speakers referred to affordable housing.  Where is it?  What is affordable?  We are now in this range where people are expected to have a joint income of approximately &euro;75,000 to qualify for affordable housing.  The situation has become bizarre.</P>
        <P>I would like to put a pointer down to the Minister of State on the issue of affordable housing.  I know about it because two people close to me were involved.  One of them managed to get a house.  My partner, who is a nurse, is in the scheme.  People are never told when a draw is happening or the result.  Let us have a bit of honesty and openness.  Why do we not know this?  Why do people who have gone to the trouble of filling out and submitting forms not know when a draw takes place so that they know whether they have a house or whether they should look on the open market?  One of the problems is that the margin between so-called affordable housing and the open market is narrowing.  That is a very worrying trend, as is the fact this Government and its predecessor have allowed the building speculators to get away with murder and to buy their way out of the commitments given in respect of affordable housing.  That is a pretty disgraceful attitude.</P>
        <P>The root issue is the price of houses.  I am now getting on in years.  I am 63 years old and the first house I bought was &euro;3,500, and it was a bloody good house.  It was a four bedroom house in a nice suburb of Dublin.  I am astonished by the situation now.  It has all the hallmarks of a South Sea bubble and I have seen it going up and up.  I can assure Members that what goes up must come down.  I have no doubt whatever that there will be a fall.  Government intervention is necessary to ensure as many people as possible have a reasonably soft landing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I blame the banks, which have gone out of their way to push loans on unsuspecting young people.  Their advertisements are a disgrace.  I have raised this issue before and would like the Minister of State to take it up in the context of broadcasting and the way they push advertisements for loans, money and this, that and the other.  The health warnings are gabbled at a rate which makes them not understandable by the ordinary person.  They are almost entirely inaudible.  Those messages carry warnings because I have listened to them very carefully.  As they are required to do so, they say one may actually lose one&rsquo;s house.  I do not <Col N="872"/>know if other Senators have referred to it but we are now in a situation where there is a queue in the courts in the city for repossessions by the banks.  The irresponsibility of the banks is further underlined by a series of occasions where solicitors have made multiple borrowings on the same property.  Tens of millions of euro have been lost because the banks and other financial institutions were so greedy they could not even wait to check the bona fides of people.</P>
        <P>In the past week or two, there was a very worrying report from Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s which highlighted the risk to economic growth posed by vulnerable construction and property sectors in several European countries. The worst two countries were Spain and Ireland.  It pointed out the risk of a much deeper deterioration in the property market as being quite high in Ireland.  It suggested that it could push the economic indictors down to a 1% growth target for the year, which is very worrying.  That was picked up by Garret FitzGerald a distinguished economic commentator and former Taoiseach.  He concurs with this figure and that our growth could be cut to 1% if the downturn develops on a scale similar to that following the housing collapse in Britain where there was negative equity.  The same thing happened in Germany as part of the economic impact of reunification.</P>
        <P>I refer to an interesting paper produced by Professor Morgan Kelly of the economics department of University College Dublin.  The nub of his thesis is that, &ldquo;looking at house price cycles across the OECD since 1970, we find a strong relationship between the size of the initial rise in price and its subsequent fall&rdquo;.  That should be of concern to us because we have just had an enormous boom.  If the fall is comparable, we may well be in difficulty.</P>
        <P>Professor Kelly continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Were this relationship to hold for Ireland, it would predict falls of real house prices of 40 to 60 per cent over a period of 8 to 9 years.  House price falls tend not to have serious macroeconomic consequences, but the unusually large size of the Irish house building industry suggests that any significant house price fall that does occur could impose a difficult adjustment on the economy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He is taking a fairly positive view in suggesting that there is not necessarily an immediate and direct correlation between any house price collapse and the macroeconomic situation.</P>
        <P>Professor Kelly believes that the economy&rsquo;s undue reliance on the building sector could make things difficult.  He cites examples of international crises, mentioning that &ldquo;the real price of Dutch houses fell by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1987, while the price of houses in Britain relative to real income also fell by 50 per cent between 1948 and 1957&rdquo;.  He concludes that, &ldquo;internationally, house prices boom and crash frequently, as economic theory predicts they should&rdquo;.</P><Col N="873"/>
        <P>Professor Kelly then asks what triggers a house price collapse, which is a question the Minister of State has presumed to answer.  The Minister of State has argued that we will be cushioned by the strength of other economic sectors.  Professor Kelly mentions the damaging effect of being able to rent a house for less than the interest cost of a mortgage, for example.  He also cites sentiment as a crucial factor.  People get out of the market when they get fed up with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Norris f&aacute; choinne chuid d&aacute; am a roinnt liom.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil go leor le r&aacute; aige ar an &aacute;bhar seo agus t&aacute; m&eacute; iontach bu&iacute;och d&oacute;.</P>
        <P>Having listened intently to the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, I have to say I disagree with his outlook on the Government&rsquo;s housing policy.  It needs to change because it is fundamentally inequitable and unbalanced in a number of respects.  There has been an excessive emphasis on the financial gains to be made from housing at the expense of its social role, which is central to the well-being of the nation.  The private property speculator, developer and rental sectors are being hugely subsidised by the State at the taxpayer&rsquo;s expense.  The decrease in social and affordable housing is pushing people into the private rental sector, where they lack security of tenure, compelling them to engage in dangerously excessive mortgaging so they can buy, requiring them to live with their extended families in crowded accommodation, or in the worst case scenario forcing them onto the streets.</P>
        <P>The Government has reneged on its commitment to eradicate homelessness by 2010.  This problem is being exacerbated by increased rents and inadequate social housing provision.  There is a severe lack of emergency accommodation.  The Simon Community in Cork has to turn people away every night.  Adequate shelter is one of the most basic human needs and, consequently, one of the most important human rights.  Homelessness is the most acute form of denial of housing rights encountered in our society.  It is, to a large degree, a manifestation of social exclusion, poverty and the failure to supply an adequate amount of secure and appropriate social housing.  In this Celtic tiger economy, we should not accept any level of homelessness.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in believes in the development of an equitable, balanced and fairly regulated housing market led by the social or public sector.  This requires a strategic approach which should be co-ordinated on an all-Ireland basis.  It involves the expansion of the social sector until it can meet the needs of those on the housing waiting list and offer a valuable and attractive alternative to private home ownership.  Measures are also needed to tackle excessive land cost and speculation if we are to contribute to the stabilisation of house price inflation.</P><Col N="874"/>
        <P>In 2005, more than 40,000 households in the Twenty-six Counties were on the waiting list for social housing.  Almost 40% of them had spent over two years on the waiting list, while one in seven had been on the list for more than four years.  Approximately 30,000 households in the Six Counties were on the waiting list in 2005.  Although house-building activity in this jurisdiction increased in 2006, just 719 of the 21,894 houses which were built in the first three months of that year were local authority houses.  That demonstrates that the Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure the private sector makes a profit while those in need of social housing are left in dire straits.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to change the direction of its housing policy.  It cannot leave it at the whim of the market as it did when it provided for privatisation in the cases of Aer Lingus and the hospitals.  The Government, and Fianna F&aacute;il in particular, needs to adopt Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view that having a roof over one&rsquo;s head is a basic human right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The statements we have heard on developments in the housing market have been interesting.  We must admit that the construction sector has been one of the most buoyant areas of the economy over the past ten or 15 years.  The housing market has favoured developers and investors during that time.  When one considers that the average house price increased by 153% over the past ten years while building costs increased by just 41%, it is clear there were significant profits to be made in the building sector.</P>
        <P>The acknowledged slowdown in the housing market means it will be much more advantageous for buyers.  That will be a positive development for ordinary citizens trying to buy houses because houses will be much more affordable for them.  There has been a significant increase in the size of the housing stock that is coming on the market.  Approximately 25,000 residential units were completed every year between 1991 and 1996.  That figure increased to approximately 45,000 in the late 1990s, to 76,000 in 2003 and to 88,000 last year.  Such a significant increase in housing output must help to solve the problems in the sector.  The combined effect of the slowdown in the market and the increase in house completions will be to strike a better balance between supply and demand, which will act in the interests of buyers.</P>
        <P>The Green Party believes the new conditions in the housing market offer the Government an opportunity to increase social housing output.  The national development plan contains a commitment to complete 9,000 new social units each year.  If the Government continues to do a good job in trying to meet these targets and achieves them, it will help to soften the landing in terms of house prices.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="875"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party has changed its attitude in recent months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us who have served on local authorities are aware that waiting lists for social housing and housing in general remain stubbornly high.  The Simon Communities of Ireland reminded Members recently that 1,725 households live in unfit accommodation, 4,112 households live in overcrowded accommodation and 3,375 households are involuntarily sharing.  There are good grounds for the Government to continue to place an emphasis on increasing social housing output, which would have positive consequences for the housing market in general.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The introduction of much higher building standards has been another positive development on the part of the Government.  I pay credit to my party colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his Cabinet colleagues in that regard.  The improved building standards will have a positive impact on the new housing stock that comes on stream from this year.  Under the new regulations, the demand for heat energy in all new houses will have to be reduced by 40%.  The new guidelines will lead to much warmer houses that are much cheaper to run.  In 2015, the rules will be revised upwards to provide for a 60% reduction in the demand for heat energy.  This is a welcome development for those who will live in the new housing stock, especially those who will occupy social housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Urban renewal has also been mentioned during this debate.  As part of our urban planning framework, we need to start improving the way we plan our town and village centres.  We must look for smart growth as opposed to urban sprawl.  There is a tendency for the centres of towns to fall into decline, including commercial decline.  I do not believe there is a need for the zoning that is taking place on the outskirts of towns and where town boundaries are being pushed out as part of local area plans.  The focus should be on smart growth in which town and village centres are developed.  This usually means an increase in densities but good quality development will serve the interests of a town and its development.  The use of master plans by local authorities will mean proper forecasting of the transport, education and community needs of the town.  Many main towns have backlands which could be rezoned to consolidate the existing town centre.  Town centres should be made more suitable for walking and cycling and there should be pedestrian links from one part of a town to another.  Traffic congestion leads to town centres being full of exhaust fumes and not conducive as places where children can walk or cycle to school.  Adequate civic and open spaces should also be provided in town centres, which would provide social and ecological benefits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of higher density seems to be the way to go for smarter growth.  Apartment devel<Col N="876"/>opments should be of high quality.  I refer to studies undertaken recently by Dublin City Council that are very helpful in highlighting some of the issues in this regard.  Part 1 of the report, Successful Apartment Living, made recommendations on the minimum size for apartments.  We are all aware of the large quantity of new apartments which often leave a lot to be desired in terms of quality, both of construction and of size.  These apartments are not built for family living.  We are encouraging people to consider the rental option as an alternative to home ownership but it will be difficult if apartments are not being built to accommodate young families.  It is unfortunate that apartments are still being built to cater for the stereotypical childless couple thus making it very difficult for families who must rent apartment accommodation to be able to survive and manage in them.</P>
        <P>The reports by Dublin City Council are to be welcomed, the most recent of which reviewed 193 apartment schemes, consisting of almost 16,000 apartments.  It found the majority of these schemes did not cater for residents from childhood to adulthood and retirement.  The council also found the following: only three of the developments surveyed had designated outdoor play areas for children; there were cr&egrave;che facilities in just nine developments and eight of these had been built since 2000; just over one quarter of all developments had open space suitable for use by children; one third of the schemes had no lifts, despite having multiple floors; disabled access was poor; and 75% of the complexes had poor fire safety facilities.</P>
        <P>I will discuss with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, the introduction of a requirement on local authorities to ensure that the standard of design and management in apartment complexes being built as part of smart growth will be of high quality and suitable for family living.</P>
        <P>The issue of homelessness has been mentioned by other Senators.  We must recognise that there are 2,500 people who are homeless in the State.  In Dublin the number of homeless people sleeping rough is estimated to be anywhere between 50 and 100 per night.  The Government must promote sustained spending on programmes to tackle homelessness otherwise the numbers will increase due to pressure at the lower end of the market in both the rented and home-owning sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome back to the Chamber the Minister of State.  I appreciate the time given to a discussion of the housing market because the country is experiencing a housing crisis.  An entire generation of people in their 20s and 30s is finding it increasingly difficult to enter the housing market.</P>
        <P>Some Senators have spoken about the effect of interest rates on the ability of people to repay <Col N="877"/>their mortgages and other Senators have raised the issues of stamp duty and of homelessness and the importance of catering for the less well-off members of society.  Some Senators have referred to the downturn in the construction industry.  I wish to highlight the issue of social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 stipulates that 20% of homes in new developments are to be put aside for social and affordable housing.  However, many developers are buying their way out of this clause and giving money to local authorities in lieu of the provision of these housing units.  The result is fewer units of affordable housing are available for the people who need them most.</P>
        <P>My party wants to see that loophole closed and we urge the Government to take action in this regard.  We want an increase in the amount of social housing being built.  I receive phone calls every week from people who are desperately in need of social housing.  My office is aware of people who have been looking for housing for up to five years.  I know of mothers who are forced to share not only a bedroom but their bed with their children because they cannot get a local authority house.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler congratulates himself on the provision of an extra 6,500 units but this is not good enough.  A total of 2,000 people are on the housing list in County Meath.  I do not think his words of self-congratulation will do much for them.</P>
        <P>My party has also suggested the consideration of ways to facilitate the refurbishment of older estates.  The Alverno Heights estate in Laytown is in the constituency of Louth and was built 30 years ago.  It is desperately in need of refurbishment but the Department has limited the amount of its contribution to the refurbishment of local authority estates from 100% of the cost down to 50%, with the remaining 50% to come from the local authority.  At the same time, local authorities such as Meath County Council are not receiving the same amount of resources as other counties.  Meath County Council receives <i>per<?oasys _jy ?>capita</i> funding of 67% when compared with the national average.  I find it difficult to work out how the Minister expects these local authorities to find the money to refurbish estates such as Alverno Heights without the Minister giving more resources to the county councils or paying the total cost of the works to be carried out.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has suggested a begin-to-buy scheme to help people who have just started working to start on the property ladder by part-buying a home in partnership with the local authority.  It is expected that when they earn more in the future, they will be able to buy more of their home.  Such schemes would help to increase the level of home ownership among this generation and I ask the Minister to consider introducing such a scheme.</P>

	<P>In preparation for this debate I took a look at <i>Best of Times?  The Social Impact of the Celtic Tiger in Ireland</i> , which has a chapter devoted to housing and the housing boom.  It states, &ldquo;Despite its runaway appearance, the housing market in Ireland may be less precarious than in some other countries&rdquo;.  It cites three reasons for this.  The first is demographics.  We have a growing population and an increasing one because of immigration.  Second, rising affluence means more people have jobs and pay less tax and there is more disposable income.  Third, there are lower interest rates.  This third factor is no longer part of the equation as the price increases have declined somewhat.  This is welcome.  </P>
        <P>Senators opposite said this has nothing to do with the availability of housing.  Again I refer to this very worthwhile document.  The impression given is that the housing system in Ireland is appalling and that nothing is happening for people.  The document states that the housing system has also performed well in the sheer volume of new dwellings it has produced and the very large increase in the number of households <Col N="879"/>this has facilitated.  One forgets that.  Year on year there have been record numbers and outputs.  That is an irrefutable fact and one cannot deny that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue of homelessness has been dealt with in the strategy.  The strategy, which is a ten-year one, is well under way.  While a member of my local authority I chaired our strategic housing group.  That was one area where we had a problem because in my local authority area we have a problem with homelessness, much of which has to do with the cost of housing and so on.  Homelessness is not just about the absence of shelter or a home, it is a far more complex issue.  The strategy that the Government is pursuing is laudable.  It is an area in which we need to do more.  We need to focus on eliminating homelessness and in this I join with other colleagues who have spoken earlier.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Again it is the tyranny of consistency in that sense.  No Government gets everything right but one needs to recognise what is right and what strategies work <Col N="880"/>and not to talk down the market, as is being done, by calling it a crisis when there is a moderation in house price increases.  I am sure the Minister would acknowledge we have work to do in the homeless sector. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I echo Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s comments about the new building standards.  They are a credit to the new Minister who has introduced them and are extremely important in terms of building sustainable housing into the future.  It is a pity they were not introduced earlier because at this time of record levels of output we have harnessed people with homes that are less energy efficient and that is regretted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take this opportunity to speak about a new heart for Dublin which is a proposal my party was interested in driving.  It is about building new sustainable communities and particularly in Dublin high rise apartments.  Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to the importance of sustainable communities.<b>  </b>They are homes where people can live in apartments throughout their lives while rearing children and into older age.  The new heart for Dublin proposal and the public land available in the docks area provide us with the opportunity to build a whole new quarter for Dublin.  Rather than do as is being done in Galway, building housing estate after housing estate, and copying the mistakes of the past, we have the opportunity in Dublin to build a sustainable new city in the docklands area.</P>
        <P>On the question of stamp duty, the Minister has been consistent.  He has constantly told us he will not amend it.  I accept the point that it generates much income and contributes to the running of the country.  At the same time, when the stamp duty is equivalent to two or three times the average industrial wage we need to think twice about the level of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I shall respond to the points made by previous speakers beginning with Senator O&rsquo;Malley and her quotation of the book to which she referred.  I am lucky in that I have had the opportunity to read it.  What is striking not so much about the book but the commentary and reporting on it by many journalists and newspapers is that they criticise it for its excessively optimistic approach to many factors.  What has been consistent on the commentary offered is how over-optimistic the writers of different chapters have been about the issues to which they refer.</P>
        <P>For every point that somebody makes we could all produce a quote or a book to back it up.  With regard to the book referred to, I could produce volumes if I had the time to do it, by organisations such as Threshold and the Simon Community.  I could quote other publications of the Economic and Social Research Institute, which was involved in the production of the book, and publications from Focus Ireland that provide a completely different analysis of where we stand, <Col N="881"/>an analysis that is more in keeping with the experiences my colleagues and I have in terms of representing our constituents who are involved in issues such as this.</P>
        <P>The most formative experience I have as a member of a local authority is dealing with housing.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred to the fact that she is a former member of a local authority.  In the contributions I have heard from the Government side, particularly from the Minister, what was striking was that the issue of social and affordable housing is mentioned only once.  Nowhere in the entire debate has the issue of rental housing been mentioned.  If I am wrong I stand corrected because we are here to debate these matters.  We need to talk about the people who are struggling to buy their own home whether in Dublin or elsewhere and those who are at the fringes of the housing market and caught up in the rental sector.</P>
        <P>I wish to make two points in regard to the rental sector, an area that I only heard mentioned by speakers from this side of the House.  Too many of our citizens are being taken advantage of within the rental sector by a small number of unscrupulous and rogue landlords.  Some figures, to which Senator Coffey referred, indicate that last year the local authorities carried out inspections of 9,800 private rental properties.  Of those they found there were significant quality issues in 20% of them, which means one in five houses in the rental sector was not in keeping with the minimum standards for decent living accommodation.  Out of those 1,900 cases that were inspected legal action was taken against only 36 landlords.  I can name 36 properties in my own constituency that have such issues.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure that standards in the private rental sector are up to date.  I understand this aspect will be examined later in the year.  The local authorities are incentivised by central Government to do their job better in ensuring those standards are regulated.  The people in those properties need our support for a better standard of living.</P>
        <P>For God&rsquo;s sake let us provide an affordable housing scheme that is genuinely affordable.  Whole swathes of our population on low and middle incomes cannot afford to buy a house and do not qualify for the affordable housing scheme either.  The Minister of State can be consistent when he has had the privilege of being in Government for ten years.  We need to deliver on this area.  We do not need to talk about housing output all the time.  We need to ensure the houses being produced are affordable and that people can get into them.  That is the role of central Government through the local authorities.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State on those issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not need five minutes.  I congratulate the Minister of State, whom I have always admired very much as an independent, tough and clear-minded local politician, on the tough job he is doing.  I ask him to think outside the box on his watch.  One of the troubles of housing is that it has always been ideologically trammelled.  We have had two great historical interventions.  We had the great municipal buildings of the late 19th century into the 20th century.  We then had Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s powerful intervention in Dublin involving the clearance of the slums and we have had the great local authority schemes.  I am not convinced that social housing and affordable housing interventions represent the way to go.  There is a danger of antagonising people who have struggled hard.  There is no point in pretending that class antagonisms do not exist and trying to push them aside never works.  It creates all sorts of problems.  The trick always is to enable people to buy houses without social stigma.  I ask the Minister of State to encourage new thinking to allow interventions by the State to help people on a confidential and means-tested basis to get into the housing market without creating tensions and flashpoints, and all the carry on with affordable housing, which is basically being abused by builders and developers.</P>
        <P>The issue of stamp duty should be addressed firmly.  Correctives in the market are all very well.  However, the failure to reform stamp duty is dragging down the market.  To give the market a boost and help the small and medium builders, I ask the Minister of State to consider seriously talking to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance about VAT.  VAT has become so sacred that nobody ever thinks it can be touched.  A slight adjustment in VAT on building supplies to the building industry might give medium and smaller builders and the people who want to build for themselves the boost the industry badly needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the House for allowing me time to make a presentation on housing.  As public representatives we have a particular interest in it.  I thank the Senators for their thoughtful contributions.  I wish to reiterate a number of key points and to respond to a number of the issues raised.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey spoke about the CIF and targets.  I wish to put this into perspective.  The CIF issued targets for 2007 indicating that 90,000 residential units would be built in 2007.  It got it <Col N="883"/>wrong; it will be 77,000.  I fear the 2008 target of 45,000 does not correspond with the targets that we envisage or with the targets of what I would call reputable economists.  I am concerned that developers are cutting back and that it might be somewhat overdone.  I would say to developers that for ten years they have done exceptionally well under the good management of the economy.  There are signs of some developers being able to pull back at this stage.</P>
        <P>I would say to young people and first-time house purchasers that a frenzy was created in 2005 and 2006 to get on the property ladder and people felt if they did not do so they would never have a chance.  The result was inflated prices from two sources.  At the same time the banks were offering 100% loans with all the other add-ons that were part and parcel of it, all of which led to an intolerable situation that has come back to haunt us.  The last thing I want is for the prophets of doom to suggest this is not a good time to buy.  The mortgage interest relief given in the last budget equated to three ECB interest rate adjustments.  In addition stamp duty has been eliminated for first-time house purchasers and tax was reduced.  Houses are now more affordable because prices have reduced.  Therefore the climate is favourable for young people to purchase houses in the knowledge of the promise of further mortgage interest relief in the next budget.</P>
        <P>It should be the norm for young people to bargain about the asking price.  Good bargains are available for young people who want to buy houses at affordable levels.  I want to ensure that in 18 months we do not have underdevelopment in housing with an imbalance in the market leading to price inflation coming back to haunt us again.  The developers have a duty to young people from the profits generated over a ten-year period to ensure this imbalance and the apparent trend do not continue.  They need to play their part in ensuring adequate output.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey also mentioned the number of vacant houses.  The IMF report pointed out that the vacancy rate in Ireland is lower than the European norm.  We have also made wonderful strides in the area of private rented accommodation.  A great number of new housing units have been built.  In 2002 30,000 private rented accommodation units were registered.  By the end of 2006 that figure stood at 200,000, which is a marked increase.  To increase the number of inspections carried out we have increased funding to the local authorities by 50% in this year.  I will give 50% to cover those that are registered and I will give 50% in the first tranche to the objective they have placed which is the number of inspections they will carry out.  At the end of the period, if they have met their target of inspections I will reward them with the rest of the funding.  There is a dramatic improvement in the number of inspections carried out.</P><Col N="884"/>
        <P>On investigation we discovered that 80% of rented accommodation was of good quality.  I am not saying there are not rented units of inferior quality &mdash; of course there are.  However, if a local authority housing officer comes across accommodation that is below standard, the PRTB exists to report that.  Its duty is to ensure the standards are maintained and to take issue with any landlord who has inadequate accommodation, particularly those who are not registered.  A tax incentive is available for those landlords whose property needs to be upgraded.</P>
        <P>The factors relating to the output of housing will depend on the economy.  Growth in the economy for 2008 is predicted to be 3.25%, one of the highest in Europe.  All of the rudiments for the purchase of affordable houses are in place. The partnership, which has always been consistent with what we have done, should be adhered to in this instance.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe stated I did not mention social, affordable or voluntary housing or RAS.  However, I referred to the investment of &euro;21 billion in this sector by the Government under the national development plan.  It is envisaged 17,000 units will be delivered over a three-year period in that sector and, under the plan overall, it is hoped 140,000 social and affordable units will be delivered.  The Government is committed to capital projects and to local authorities building homes.  We would like to be as innovative as we can, whether that relates to social or affordable housing, and we are open to and will entertain other views to ensure social and affordable housing output continues to increase for our young people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I offer my sympathy to Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, his family and the Labour Party on the death of our late colleague, Joe Sherlock.  Joe was a proud Corkman who served for a long time and worked hard both as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He was first elected in 1981 to the D&aacute;il as sole representative of Sinn F&eacute;in the Workers&rsquo; Party.  He lost his seat in 1982, regained it in 1987, retained it in 1989 only to lose it again in 1992.  However, he won the seat back in 2002 and he served as a Member of this House between 1993 and 1997.  I had the great honour and pleasure of serving with Joe Sherlock, a very humble, decent and honourable man, during that period.  He won a seat on the Labour Panel, similar to myself.</P>
        <P>He was a man of great commitment and conviction and he always represented the poor and the underprivileged.  From a young age, he showed great commitment to the people of north Cork and to improving the lives of the less well off in the community.  His election to Mallow Urban <Col N="885"/>District Council in 1974 marked the beginning of a successful political career that spanned more than four decades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Joe Sherlock was a committed public representative whose dedication and loyalty to the people of Mallow and north Cork will be sadly missed.  They have lost a true champion who was passionate in his work on their behalf.  In his brief retirement, he was extremely proud of his son Se&aacute;n, who followed in his footsteps by being elected to the D&aacute;il this year.  Joe worked all his life to be elected to both Houses and to local authorities in Cork.  Se&aacute;n will follow in his footsteps and enhance the great reputation of the Sherlock family.</P>
        <P>I would like to extend my sympathy to Joe&rsquo;s wife, Ellen; his daughter, &Uacute;na; and his sons, Joseph and Se&aacute;n.  Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is an honour to pay tribute on behalf of the Fine Gael group to Joe Sherlock, a former Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to know him during my time as a Member of the D&aacute;il and I was always impressed by his deep commitment to the people he represented in the Cork East constituency and to the causes dear to him.  Throughout his 40 years in public life, Joe Sherlock demonstrated a deep and unwavering commitment to public service as a member of local authorities and both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, put it well when he said of Joe, &ldquo;He was an outstanding public representative whose dedication and commitment to the people he represented was an inspiration to us all&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I offer my deepest condolences to the Sherlock family, Joe&rsquo;s former colleagues in the Labour Party and, particularly, his son, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, who is continuing his family&rsquo;s tradition of public service in the Oireachtas.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is rather sad in a way to say goodbye to Joe Sherlock.  I, like the Leader, have happy memories of him in Leinster House.  He was a good, committed, regular contributor in this House and he always had a twinkle in his eye.  I seem to remember him smoking a pipe.  Perhaps I am wrong but I have an image of him fiddling with the pipe with his eyes twinkling away while he made a sharp, perceptive comment.  He was a man who was involved in the republican movement but he saw the light and opted for democratic politics.  He was in Sinn F&eacute;in the Workers&rsquo; Party and he was one of the architects of the move on the left that united the Workers&rsquo; Party and the Labour Party.  Shortly after he was elected as both the first and only representative of Sinn F&eacute;in the Workers&rsquo; Party in 1981, he said he hoped there would be a realignment of the left and that both parties would work in closer harmony.</P><Col N="886"/>
        <P>He was an honest, decent man of the soil.  He started life as an agricultural labourer and he had a lovely, easy swing of a walk along the corridors of Leinster House that marked him as somebody from a rural background, as my own people were, and I always liked that about him.  He was loyal to north Cork.  He fought for Mallow hospital and the sugar beet industry in which he had been employed.  He will be missed but he was extremely proud at the close of his political career that his son, Se&aacute;n, was elected to succeed him.  I met Se&aacute;n recently in the corridors and I asked him whether he was one of the new Members.  When he told me who he was, I was very pleased to shake his hand and say I remembered his father with great affection.  He will be a distinguished representative.</P>
        <P>When I told my colleagues in the office that we were having expressions of sympathy on the death of Joe Sherlock and I had been asked to say a few words about him, everybody, including the secretarial staff, commented on what a decent, nice man he was.  That is a rather good tribute.  On behalf of the Independent Members, I offer my sympathy to his wife, Ellen and his children, &Uacute;na, Joseph and Sean, who has followed him into the world of politics.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Labour Party, it is a sad honour to pay tribute to my late colleague, Joe Sherlock, a former Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As previous speakers said, Joe served for many years in public life and he gave strong public service throughout his career.  He was a deeply principled man who was truly dedicated to the people of Mallow and east Cork.  Like many of his generation, he did not have an easy upbringing.  He worked hard from a young age, initially on local farms and then in Mallow sugar factory.  He had a passion for all things Cork and all things local.  Mallow hospital and the sugar factory played significant roles in his contributions over many years and I recall, when I worked in the media, the very effective campaign he led to retain services in Mallow hospital, which are still there today.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>At an early age, Joe became involved in the trade union movement and he then took the political path.  He was a true republican who was proud of his country.  He recognised at an early age, as a member of a generation of republicans of that era, the need for effective political change.  He moved with the times and was proud ultimately to serve as a Deputy for the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>Joe was famous for the passion with which he spoke and for his particular style of oration.  People tended to listen to him regardless of whether they agreed with his argument, because they knew his words came from the heart.  He was impatient with bureaucracy and became frustrated when progress was not sufficiently speedy.  As public representatives, we are all aware of the frustration of awaiting a return telephone call or <Col N="887"/>written response.  He had a fiery temper and could occasionally deliver a sharp-edged response.  He used that fieriness to great effect to get his point across.  Inevitably, however, he quickly returned to his courteous self.  This is the person Senator Norris and others have called to mind today.</P>
        <P>Joe Sherlock&rsquo;s political career began with his election to Mallow Urban District Council.  He often reminded people that he was first elected in 1967 with 110 votes.  Few elections are won these days with only 110 votes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris will be pleased to know that I secured some 165 votes in the election.</P>
        <P>By the time he retired, Joe had accumulated 40 years of unbroken service in elected office.  This is a significant achievement in anybody&rsquo;s book.  He contested a D&aacute;il election for the first time in 1973 and continued to challenge for a seat until he was successful in 1981.  As the Leader said, he was re-elected in 1982, 1989 and 2002.  He was a type of Lazarus who kept returning, whether to this House, through the labour panel, or to the Lower House.  He served these Houses with great distinction throughout those years.</P>
        <P>When he retired earlier this year, he threw himself into the election campaign of his son and our colleague, Deputy Sherlock.  He was immensely proud that his son was successful in retaining the seat in Cork East.  It is sad that Joe did not get to enjoy a significant period of retirement.  As someone who contributed so much to his county and country and to politics in general, he deserved such a retirement.  He will be sadly missed in Mallow and elsewhere in east Cork as well as in the Labour Party.  He was a man of considerable integrity and passion.  As my party leader, Deputy Gilmore, said at his graveside, we are saying goodbye to a true political comrade, friend and patriot.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to join in the expressions of sympathy for a person who was not only a former Member of both Houses but also a Cork man.  I attended many political events with Joe Sherlock in the Cork area.  He was a person recognised for his assiduousness as a constituency worker in view of his involvement in campaigns such as those relating to Mallow General Hospital and to the sugar factory in Mallow.  He was also associated with the workforce in Mitchelstown Co-operative.  Mallow was where he built his political base but he was well known throughout north-east Cork, in towns such as Mitchelstown and Fermoy.  Senator Bradford knows Cork East is a constituency with a broad reach, stretching from Roches Point to Buttevant.  Anyone contesting that constituency must make <Col N="888"/>themselves widely known throughout its length and breadth.  Part of Joe Sherlock&rsquo;s achievement was that he did so successfully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Members observed, his 40 years of unbroken public service is a notable milestone.  Other speakers have outlined his political journey.  He was first elected as a member of the then Sinn F&eacute;in Party, which became Sinn F&eacute;in the Workers' Party.  He was elected as the first Deputy for that party in 1981.  It subsequently became the Workers' Party and then Democratic Left, which ultimately merged with the Labour Party.  What historians might consider political inconsistency was, in Joe Sherlock&rsquo;s case &mdash; and in the case of many others &mdash; a natural progression.</P>
        <P>I must confess I was part of a conspiracy that saw Joe Sherlock become a Member of this House.  He, along with two Progressive Democrats Senators, made history in February 1993 by becoming the first members of a non-traditional party to be directly elected to this House.  This came about as a result of an electoral arrangement between the Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left and the Green Party.  I was the fifth leg of that particular arrangement, having been deposited on the cultural and educational panel without being told I would need three times as many votes as I received.  I nonetheless managed to quadruple the Green Party&rsquo;s tally in that election.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a sad honour to remember the man Senator Boyle correctly described as a fine public representative.  It was a delight to serve with Joe Sherlock in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann during the last parliamentary term.  He was a dedicated, decent man and a true republican.  He was a man of and for the people, a person who never forgot his roots.  He truly brought great distinction and honour to the profession of politics.  It is a pity there are not more like him.  It is sad to consider that he did not get to enjoy his retirement for any length of time.  I heard of his death during the summer with great sadness.  As a man who had given so much time to public service, it seemed only fair that he should now enjoy the next period of his life in the knowledge of the contribution he made to advancing the country <Col N="889"/>he loved so much.  Sadly, he did not live to enjoy the fruits of his labour.</P>
        <P>I am sure it was a cause of great delight for him and his party to see his son, Deputy Sherlock, succeed to his seat.  I wish the latter well in his endeavours.  It will be difficult for him to go forward in seeking to hold the seat for his party without being able to rely on the guidance and advice of his father.  It was a privilege to have worked with Joe and I remember him fondly today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the words of tribute to the late Joe Sherlock and extend my condolences and sympathy to his family, all of whom I know personally.  I knew Joe Sherlock politically and personally for more than 20 years.  The word I most associate with him is &ldquo;determination&rdquo;.  If Joe had not been so politically dedicated, my own political career might have been smoother.  However, I hope we drew the best out of each other.  While we were electoral rivals for many years, there was never a cross word between us.  There were several occasions on which I offered electoral sympathy to Joe and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
        <P>In advance of the November 1992 election &mdash; in which, unfortunately, he lost his seat &mdash; I recall Joe was in hospital in Dublin to undergo heart surgery.  I visited him there and we conversed about life and politics.  We agreed there were greater battles than a political election.  Fortunately, Joe came through that surgery and enjoyed a good quality of life for many more years.</P>
        <P>People generally associate Joe with Mallow, where he was central to political life for almost 40 years.  He came from the village and parish of Kildorrery, which was his first love geographically.  Whether it was a GAA match in which<?oasys _jy ?>Kildorrery was playing or the annual Kildorrery carnival, Joe always loved to go back to his home village.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He has many political monuments and people have mentioned the hospital and sugar factory in Mallow to which he dedicated much of his political career.  He served for almost 40 years in local government and was the chairman of Mallow Town Council on many occasions.  He also served on Cork County Council and in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The political role with which he enjoyed being deeply involved was the old Southern Health Board.  I imagine he was a member of that board for almost two decades, being one of the strong voices when it had a real role in the health services in north Cork and throughout the region.  Whether it was a hospital in Mallow, Cork county or Kerry, or a query from a constituent from the health board region, he attended very sincerely to his duties.  The legacy he has left to Mallow, Cork East and the province of Munster is one of simple service, dedication and commitment. <Col N="890"/> Standing the political tests of four decades is a monument in itself.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sherlock had a significant interest in local government and on numerous occasions he raised the question of the charter of local government.  He was very happy at the time of the 1999 referendum which put local government on a statutory footing, a campaign with which he was very involved.</P>
        <P>I have the fondest of political recollections of my political neighbour, Joe Sherlock.  My office was only 200 yards from his front door and we met and spoke frequently.  As is the case with rural and political life, we were political rivals but I hope we were political colleagues and friends.  I will long and fondly remember him, as will all the people of Cork East and County Cork.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Senator Peter Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the tributes being paid to the memory of the late Joe Sherlock.  I can only endorse the fine words which have been expressed about him.  Without going into repetition I can say that Joe Sherlock was a man with a mission who served his people well.  He took pride in this for as long as we were together on Cork County Council.  My colleagues from Cork County Council will understand that when Joe Sherlock started a sentence with &ldquo;By Christ, Chairman&rdquo;, council members and the county manager would know very well he meant it.</P>
        <P>My comments on Joe Sherlock would be rather personal but I endorse everything said about him tonight.  I served with him for many years on Cork County Council and a person who serves that length of time as a public representative endorsed by the people election after election has something special.  He represented the people well.</P>
        <P>I recall when he became ill a number of months back and he rang me to discuss the problem, which we did.  I called to his house and we talked about it.  He bore his illness well and with great distinction and courage.  The moment of greatest joy for Joe Sherlock was when his son, Se&aacute;n, was elected and took the seat in the constituency.  I will finish by stating that one of the first telephone calls I received when I was elected to the Seanad recently was from a man called Joe Sherlock.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to pay tribute to the late Joe Sherlock, former Deputy, Senator and councillor.  I had the experience and privilege of serving on Cork County Council with the late Deputy Sherlock, as did Senators Callanan and Bradford.  I quickly became very much aware of his true devotion and vocation in life, which was to be in politics to represent those who are less well-off than others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Joe Sherlock was first elected to Mallow Urban District Council in 1967 and it was not until 1974 that he won his council seat.  He kept contesting election after election to become the sole Sinn <Col N="891"/>F&eacute;in the Workers&rsquo; Party Deputy in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1981.  With that election came significant responsibility as there was much political instability at the time.  A Government headed by the late Charles Haughey depended very much on his support and it was not easy for somebody without the resources of a modern day parliament and a large party to represent his constituents and chart a path in public life which was very cognisant of the political instability of the day.</P>
        <P>His political career spanned over five decades and my experience of Joe Sherlock was that if he had an issue, or a bone, he would chew on it.  Senator Callanan repeated the mantra that we heard so often on Cork County Council, &ldquo;By Christ, Chairman&rdquo;.  The officials stood up and listened at that stage.  If they did not, there was a &ldquo;By Christ, Chairman&rdquo; statement before the fortnight was out.  By Christ, the results were obtained.</P>
        <P>His political path took him from Sinn F&eacute;in to The Workers&rsquo; Party to the Labour Party.  He was always a beacon of representation for left-of-centre politics.  His trade union background ensured he was always in the broader Labour family and he was always associated with those who were less well-off.  He deplored pomp, officialdom and ceremony.</P>
        <P>I was not aware he smoked a pipe but smoke may have come from his famous temper rather than from a pipe.  When the merger of the Labour Party and Democratic Left took place in the 1990s, there were two D&aacute;il candidates in Cork East, John Mulvihill in Cobh and Joe Sherlock in Mallow.  Both had held that D&aacute;il seat on occasion and when they clashed swords on Cork County Council, by Christ there was much smoke.</P>
        <P>It was an honour to serve on Cork County Council with Joe Sherlock and it certainly was an experience.  We will never see another public representative like him.  He kept fighting elections until he was successful and he kept fighting on behalf of his constituents until he obtained results for them.  Ultimately, Joe Sherlock will be known for public service and his commitment to the people of north-east Cork.  First and foremost he was a Kildorrery man loyal to his constituents and constituency.  I extend my sympathy and that of other Members to his family.</P>
        <P>It is a great source of pride to the Sherlock family that Se&aacute;n is taking up the mantle in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is a great monument to Joe Sherlock&rsquo;s memory that his son now holds that D&aacute;il seat in Cork East.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very moved by the tributes to Joe Sherlock from his political colleagues here.  I did not really know him in that capacity and my knowledge of him is very different.  The Joe Sherlock I knew was much more steely, as he helped the republican movement come out of a cul-de-sac and into the broader stream of the socialist and constitutional struggle.</P><Col N="892"/>
        <P Just="Left">I knew him through ten years of very bitter struggle within the republican movement after the split and he was a man of steel in setting his face like flint against the northern campaign of the Provisional IRA.  He never feared to stand up to them or say what a real republican should be, a man who wanted to unite Protestant and Catholic in the centre.</P>
        <P>I do not wish him to go to his grave without reminding people that behind the warm public representative, the great man of the soil and the spalpeen &mdash; he came from the labouring class &mdash; was a man who played a crucial role in Irish politics by helping to bridge the great republican movement away from force.  That has only reached its final days in the very welcome decision of the Provisional IRA to call off its campaign and do business in Northern Ireland.  In that great, long, tortured, difficult and very noble project, Joe Sherlock played a significant part.  I pay tribute to that side of his legacy.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I had the pleasure of knowing Joe Sherlock politically and personally through my involvement with organisations in Cork.  As previous speakers said, he was a vigorous campaigner and, in many ways, was probably ahead of New Labour in that he invented the term &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; in a different dimension.  He was a very caring considerate man.  I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his family.</P>
        <P>He worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of Cork.  I was particularly struck by his ability to work below the radar on behalf of many organisations to deliver results.  Unlike perhaps many of us who seek publicity for some of our efforts, he worked quietly to secure results for people with disabilities and with learning support issues, with which I am familiar.</P>
        <P>As alluded to by Senator McCarthy, he gave his view forcefully on occasions.  Shortly after my election to Cork City Council in 2004, I met Joe in the front corridor of the County Hall.  He called me aside and I will never forget the words he said to me.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Now listen son, you may think you are on top of the world today, but you are only a very small way from being beaten again.  Never lose touch with the people who put you in here.  Always respect them and, more importantly, never forget from where you came.</P>

	<P>I would like also to be associated with the tributes to the late Joe Sherlock who, as has been said, was a Member of this House from 1993 to 1997, having been elected to the Labour Panel.  During his many <Col N="893"/>years of public service at local and national level, Joe made a major contribution to Irish political life.  He will be sadly missed by all his colleagues in the Oireachtas and especially by the people of east Cork whom he represented so loyally for so many years.  He was one of life&rsquo;s gentlemen.</P>
        <P>I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife, Ellen, his sons, Joe and Se&aacute;n, and his daughter, &Uacute;na, on their sad loss.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is a great pleasure to introduce this Bill.  It is vital for tackling the growing problem of gangland crimes and serious crimes here.  Although we have heard time and again about how serious crime is being tackled, the reality is that the problem appears to be getting worse.  This Bill is required to put a witness protection scheme on a statutory footing.  The need for the Bill is unquestionable.  We will seek agreement on it and approval for it from all parties to ensure it is enacted.</P>
        <P>While pick-pocketing might be on the decline, innocent men, women and children are being shot <Col N="894"/>on our streets.  While there might be a reduction in the incidence of petty vandalism, the hard fact is that drugs are still being imported and are available in every town and village.  Gangland crime is rising, but the Government appears to have no ideas as to how to deal with it.  Our Bill could significantly reduce the level of serious crime here.  It would provide a way out for criminals who want to give evidence on some of their colleagues and it would help to collapse crime from the inside.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to how such schemes work elsewhere, how the current Garda arrangements fall short and why such a scheme is desperately needed here.  I will outline some aspects of how the Bill will work in practice.  Many Members will be familiar with the concept of a witness protection programme.  When Robert Kennedy was US Attorney General, he worked with Gerald Shur who took evidence from Joe Valachi and, in the process, helped to expose organised crime in the United States.  His work with those witnesses led to the setting up in America of the witness security programme established under the Organised Crime Control Act.  Since that Act was introduced in 1970, 10,000 convictions have been obtained due to the operation of that programme.  Without it, many witnesses would never have come forward as there would have been fearful of the risk to their lives.</P>
        <P>This programme, and the one the Labour Party proposes, provides that when a witness gives evidence and prosecutions are made, witnesses simply disappear under the protection and supervision of the government &mdash; they appear to fall off the face of the earth &mdash; and in return hardened criminals are almost always convicted.  We have established that in nine out of ten cases convictions are obtained under the US programme.</P>
        <P>Some people might be concerned that some witnesses would reoffend.  In the studies to date, the recidivism rate is 17% compared to a rate of 60% for people who have been released from prison.  Similarly, some witnesses might be concerned that if they were found out, there lives would be put at risk or that they would be tortured.  No one who has carried out the rules of the programmes has ever been exposed by any of their former colleagues.</P>
        <P>In the US the programme has proven so effective that some of the larger states such as California and New York have set up their own state-based programmes for crimes that are not covered by the federal programme.  Schemes are also in operation elsewhere in the world.  Some 60 cases are currently going through under the programme in Poland involving 160 witnesses.  Such programmes exist in Lithuania, Bosnia, Australia and Canada.</P>
        <P>At a conference on this matter in the United States last year, 17 nations were represented.  These countries need such a scheme, as do we.  Despite assertions by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that when it <Col N="895"/>comes to gangland crime, we are seeing the last gasp of a dying wasp, the reality is that since he made that statements gun murders here have totalled 80.</P>
        <P>People who carry out gun murders here simply <?oasys _dc18- ?>get away with it.  The conviction rate is only 16%.<?oasys _dc0- ?>  Five out of every six gun murderers get away with it.  Detection rates must increase.  The level of confiscation of guns must increase.  Stopping the importation of guns must also increase and, most importantly, conviction rates must increase.  One of the most difficult achievements is to secure a conviction and testimony.  Such a programme would allow witnesses to give evidence safe in the knowledge that their lives and the lives of their families would not be threatened.  Witnesses often back out of promises to give evidence because they are concerned that they will be exposed and that their lives will be put at risk.</P>
        <P>This programme would prove to be fundamental in exposing the criminal gangs that blight our land.  Former gang members and victims of gangs would be able to give evidence in safety.  The programme also has the potential to see off the last stragglers of the terrorist organisations, such as the Continuity IRA, the so-called Real IRA and the INLA which continue in the proliferation of drugs and acts of brutality around the Border.  All it takes is for one person to step forward to give evidence under this programme and the Garda would be able to start an investigation and prosecution.</P>
        <P>The Garda programme was established ten years ago.  It is five years since it received a major setback when Paul Ward won his appeal against his conviction for the murder of Veronica Guerin.  In August 2003, the programme was strongly criticised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the John Gilligan case.  The court held that procedures followed by the Garda compromised the evidence of the two chief prosecution witnesses.  The Supreme Court stated there was no reason in law the State could not establish its own witness protection programme.  It insisted the terms of such a programme should be set out so participants knew what to expect when they entered it.</P>
        <P>As the programme stands, there are no statutory limitations, making it possible for witnesses to come forward to ask for more resources from the State.  It is not clearly laid down how far the State can go with the programme, raising the possibility that a defence lawyer could claim evidence was simply bought by the Garda.  There is no legal basis for the Garda to provide someone with a new identity.  The Bill proposes to establish a means where new identities can be provided to witnesses.  If we had a programme as effective as those in the United States, in recent years we would have put 40 so-called Mr. Bigs behind bars with 80 witnesses involved.  All Members know we are falling short of such success rates.</P>
        <P>Recently on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, Fr. Peter McVerry, who has done much good work with <Col N="896"/>disadvantaged young people, told of how weekly he puts someone on the ferry to England because they are trying to escape gang intimidation.  Will the Government stand up for these people?  This Bill can help crack these gangs and allow people to live their lives without fear.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for witnesses and their families to give evidence in safety without their lives being threatened.  It provides them with new identities if required.  It allows the Government to enter into arrangements with other jurisdictions where witnesses can re-locate and, in turn, other jurisdictions&rsquo; witnesses can re-locate to Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the mid-1990s, the Government got serious about tackling organised crime, with the establishment, for example, of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  These steps were successful and helped fight organised crime.  It is now time to examine serious measures to fight the ever-growing menace of organised and serious crime.  One effective tool in this would be a witness protection programme.  It has been proved elsewhere that it works.  Every day in the Chamber there are calls from both sides of the House for action on crime.  This programme will allow for a witness protection scheme to be established which will help fight the scourge of organised crime.  We need the support of all parties.  If Senators on the Government side of the House are serious about tackling crime, I ask them to support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to reinforce the Bill&rsquo;s proposals.  A witness protection programme exists in the State but the Bill proposes it be established on a statutory basis.  It would allow the Houses of the Oireachtas and the community to participate in understanding what the programme should entail and putting it into law.  It would also allow the programme&rsquo;s operation to have the wider confidence of the community.  It would also be more likely to withstand a court challenge.</P>
        <P>On a Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion on crime several weeks ago, I was in broad agreement with Senator Boyle, which may surprise him.  He reflected on the wisdom of the approach to the problem in this House and elsewhere.  He noted a cycle in which the Opposition attacks through condemnation and the Government responds, claiming there are no difficulties and that the Opposition is only stirring it up, looking for cheap political opportunities.

	<P>I note the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, is smiling.  It is an issue on which all parties could work together to ensure the cycle of violence in our community is addressed.  This is the spirit in which the Bill has been proposed and the basis on which we ask the Government side of the House to support it.</P>
        <P>I doubt the Bill, as drafted, is perfect.  It has not had the benefit of the draftsmen sitting behind the Minister of State or the experts he can draw upon to scrutinise legislation in detail.  It is, however, a carefully drafted Bill and merits examination by the Government side.</P>
        <P>There was a bad example of the type of attack and counter attack on this issue in the mid-1990s.  Then it was suggested any crime committed was the direct responsibility of the Minister for Justice, as the Ministry was then called.  No Member believes that.  We want a serious and proper debate on what can be achieved.</P>
        <P>Neither is it a case of simply throwing up generalised demands for legislation.  Sometimes legislation is not what is required.  There is a danger that politicians propose and enact legislation just to re-assure the public rather than it having any merit.  Much of the criminal justice legislation on the Statute Book has not even been used.  We must be more honest with the public.  This Bill is an exception which puts an existing witness protection scheme on a statutory footing.  This is the basis on which I ask Government Members to consider supporting this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court stated the witness protection scheme needs to be put on a statutory footing.  The Court of Criminal Appeal was deeply critical of the scheme&rsquo;s operation in the Gilligan case.  Why can we not use the basic template of this Bill and examine how it can be enhanced?  This would allow us to make progress as a group of responsible politicians rather than simply hurling brickbats in the Government and Opposition pantomime that characterises debates of this nature.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the matter of witness protection in the House.  I commend the Labour Party&rsquo;s efforts in drafting the Bill.  I do not doubt the intent behind it or the spirit in which it is being offered.  On many occasions I have said that far too often Governments are too quick in refusing proposals from the Opposition, either by way of amendments or legislation.  I like to think that will change but, unfortunately, <Col N="898"/>regardless of what Government has been in power, I do not believe the views of the Opposition have been exploited to the fullest degree.  It is a certain sign of maturity, however, that we can listen to the views of people on the other side of the House and take on board the good points they make.  Unfortunately, what is being presented today is not something the Government can accept and I shall explain why.</P>
        <P>This Labour Party Bill draws very heavily on Canadian law in this area, although the efficacy of some aspects of Canada&rsquo;s witness protection arrangements is a matter of public debate in that country at present.  Apart from a number of specific provisions, which I shall come to later, some of the contents are little different from those which the Government would include in such a Bill if it thought it necessary to legislate for the witness security programme.  For reasons which I will set out, however, the Government does not believe this Bill is necessary.</P>
        <P>In particular, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s advice is that not only is it unnecessary to place the existing witness security programme on a statutory basis, to do so could introduce an element of inflexibility which could hinder Garda efforts.  The flexibility of the scheme is vital.  The House will appreciate that I cannot go into detail about particular cases but the fact is that the witness security programme is being operated in a significant number of cases at present.  Put simply, the advice available to the Government is that this Bill would not help and could hinder its operation.</P>
        <P>I will put some context into this debate.  As the Supreme Court stated, in an ideal world there would be no need for witnesses in such a programme.  The development of the programme is a reflection of the society in which we live.  It is a society where, regrettably, there are people who will stop at nothing, including killing, to protect their drugs or other criminal activity.  In some cases where criminal prosecutions are taken, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to proceed without the evidence of accomplices.  These are people who themselves have criminal backgrounds.  Sometimes these backgrounds include the most serious criminal offences.  If accomplices are to be persuaded to give evidence, their lives and those of their families may well be jeopardised.  The answer to this dilemma is to offer protection.  The benefit to society is that very dangerous criminals are removed from our streets.</P>
        <P>Therefore, when we talk about witness protection in the context of the type of scheme envisaged, we are not usually referring to innocents unwittingly or accidentally caught up in gang crime, gun culture and drug dealing but about people with form of their own, so let us keep a sense of perspective.  A witness security programme is only for witnesses of a very special hue <Col N="899"/>&mdash; willing participants of the criminal underworld who, for whatever reasons, choose to turn on their erstwhile colleagues.  I make this key point not for academic reasons but because of the inevitable and inescapable conclusions that follow.</P>
        <P>People generally choose to enter witness protection programmes not because of the nature of those programmes but because there is something in it for themselves.  The reality is that every possible protection necessary for a witness and his or her family can be, and is already, provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including financial support, a change of identity, relocation and so on.  We do not need legislation for these types of protection measures.  In fact, they are already in place under the existing witness security programme.  The reason the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not receive greater and more frequent co-operation from gangland members is not because they doubt the adequacy of protection measures in place within the witness security programme, and still less whether it operates on a statutory basis.  Placing the programme on a statutory basis would be highly unlikely to have any effect on the willingness or otherwise of such persons to enter it.  The reason co-operation is not forthcoming more often is simply because these people do not want to give it, even when they may already have been the target of murder threats or even murder attempts.</P>
        <P>The cold, hard, unpalatable reality for us all is that gangland members live by a peculiar ethic, if I might describe it thus.  Respect is measured solely by one&rsquo;s willingness to mete out uncompromising lethal violence in defence of oneself, one&rsquo;s turf and one&rsquo;s criminal enterprises.  The only language they speak is the language of violence, the only authority they recognise is the authority of the gun, and the only disgrace they fear is the disgrace of not being seen as the hardest of hard men.  For them, life can be cheap.  They seem to have a special contempt for the institutions of the State, in particular the Garda, the courts and the criminal justice system.  This is not an attractive portrait, but Senators should not lose sight of the fact that it is the reality.</P>
        <P>While the Bill is not altogether flawed in its contents, it is at best unnecessary and, for this reason, the Government is compelled to oppose it.  Should anyone think I am being unduly dismissive of the Labour Party&rsquo;s efforts, I will highlight briefly how redundant most of its provision are.  The criteria for admission to the programme, the factors to be taken into account, the terms of protection, the termination of the protection agreement and change of identity are already part of the existing programme.  Furthermore, the prohibition on the disclosure of information about the identity or location of a witness is enshrined <Col N="900"/>in legislation by virtue of section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  That section even makes it an offence for a person to make inquiries or take steps to discover the identity or whereabouts of a relocated witness.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party claims the Bill is needed in these areas because of criticism by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It seems to miss the fundamental point, however.  The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the validity of the operation of the programme and the evidence accruing from it, as did the Supreme Court.  In other words, the witness security programme has not only demonstrably contributed to the successful conviction of major criminals but has withstood challenge in the courts.</P>
        <P>Following comments in the superior courts, a review by the Garda Commissioner resulted in some enhancements to the programme.  The witness security programme now operates according to international best practice in the balancing of the needs of law enforcement with the needs of the protected witness.  This necessarily includes ensuring a separation between those responsible for the criminal investigation and those involved in the management of the programme, including admittance to it.  In this regard, no member of the Garda crime investigation team has any involvement in the work of evaluating the appropriateness of admittance to the programme.  This is to ensure there can be no hint of a possible inducement being offered to the witness and to preserve the independence and consistency of decision making with respect to the operation of the programme.  I also have a concern that setting the operation of the programme in statutory stone would unduly interfere with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na capacity to respond quickly, flexibly and proportionately to the often very specific needs of witnesses.</P>
        <P>I now return to the two specific features of the Bill which cause me particular concern, namely, the role given to the Director of Public Prosecutions in deciding who to admit to the programme and the type of protection to be provided, and provision for the disclosure of information about a protected person.  In dealing with the first of these, section 5 attempts, quite inappropriately in my view, to assign to the DPP a pre-eminent position over and above that of the Garda Commissioner in deciding who to admit to the programme and even such clearly operational matters as the type of protection to be provided.  I cannot accept that this is a role for anyone but the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, such a provision would inevitably conflict with the statutory role of the DPP as the independent prosecution authority in the State.  It would undermine the separation of responsibilities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the DPP in the investigation and prosecution of serious crime. <Col N="901"/> Such a development would be neither wise nor necessary.  At present the DPP is consulted on the cases that arise under the present scheme.  That is a far cry from making him the deciding authority on all matters relating to the scheme as proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The second serious flaw I detect in the Bill arises in sections 13 and 14 which set out circumstances and factors that would justify disclosure of information relating to a protected person, including information sufficient to identify and locate him or her.  Let us be clear that these sections have the potential to set at nought the chances of encouraging individuals to enter the programme and give evidence against former comrades.  This seems an extraordinary proposition, particularly as any person admitted to the programme is unlikely to be without criminal baggage himself.</P>
        <P>The Bill is unnecessary in that most of its provisions already mirror existing non-statutory practices that have withstood legal challenge.  The few novel features of the Bill could not only damage the independence of the DPP but could also be likely to act in diametrical opposition to the whole <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre </i>of a witness security programme, namely, to encourage those with information to co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is seriously concerned about gangland crime, particularly in the aftermath of recent, shocking murders.  These events emphasise the continuing imperative to target responses where they will be most effective.  This Bill does not contribute to that response.  A functional and effective witness security programme is already in existence for those who wish to avail of it, but most choose not to, for reasons I need not repeat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A targeted response comes in many forms.  Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating serious crime, particularly murder.  The most recent figures received from the Garda Commissioner in this regard show that from the beginning of the operation in May 2005 to 14 October last, 784 firearms were recovered.  Over the lifetime of this and the previous Government, we will have increased the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 4,000.  The current programme for Government re-affirms the commitment to a Garda strength of 15,000 by 2010.  This compares well with the strength of any other police service throughout the world.  The Garda budget for this year stands at &euro;1.44 billion, compared to just over &euro;0.9 billion five years ago.  The organised crime unit, tasked with targeting organised criminals and disrupting criminal networks, has been strengthened.</P>
        <P>A package of crime investigation initiatives was recently launched by senior Garda management and these include the establishment of a crime investigation training faculty at the Garda College to provide a professional, comprehensive <Col N="902"/>training programme for those charged with the management of serious crime investigations.  Crucially, as a result of the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in a much better position to ensure that those involved in gun crime will be made accountable for their actions.  The Act intensifies further the fight against gangland activity on many fronts.  These include a tougher bail regime in drugs, firearms and other serious cases; post-release monitoring orders; enhanced penalties for repeat offenders; and changes to the laws of evidence.</P>
        <P>There is no point in pretending that the gangs involved in the drug trade, which show such callous disregard for human life, can be made go away overnight.  It will require determined, steady and relentless action on the part of everyone involved, and that is exactly what we will continue to support.  Unfortunately, however, the Bill before us adds nothing to this task and even risks jeopardising it.</P>
        <P>I thank the Labour Party for its work in preparing and presenting this Bill.  Everybody across the country would be happy to listen to this debate and would have views on the subject but, for the reasons I have outlined, the Government will not be supporting the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This Labour Party Bill is appropriate and opportune.  During the debate on crime two weeks ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, outlined his ideas on how gun crime and gangland crime might be counteracted.  There were no new ideas presented, only self-justification and congratulatory statements, and an amendment was tabled to the motion.  The motion provoked debate and today&rsquo;s Bill was presented in conciliatory terms, yet the result in each case has been exactly the same.  What is proposed on this side of the House is rejected on the other, for whatever reason.  There are always reasons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of putting the witness protection programme on a statutory basis, the Minister of State said we still use the existing programme.  However, he did not outline how effectively it is being used such that we could make an assessment thereof.  It is of fundamental importance to place witness protection on a statutory basis and in this regard I support the proposal of the Labour Party.  The exact formulation of the Bill is another matter.</P>
        <P>The European Convention on Human Rights obliges signatories to protect witnesses.  Resolutions on the protection of witnesses were made by the Council of the European Union as long ago as 1995 and they encourage member states to adopt witness protection programmes.  Europol has 100 experts on witness protection in five continents and there is therefore a co-operative <Col N="903"/>framework within Europe to enhance witness protection.  The extent of the statutory schemes that exist in other jurisdictions has been pointed out and these schemes conform with international best practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State said the witness protection programme should not be put on a statutory basis because the Garda Commissioner does not believe it is a good idea.  The Commissioner should not be the legislator because it is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide on appropriate legislation.  His advice is helpful but the Minister of State did not outline the reasons he, the Commissioner, considers it inappropriate to place the scheme on a statutory basis.  A statute of the Oireachtas, accompanied by clear operational guidelines, could set out the nature of the scheme and the Minister could delegate responsibility therefore.  It is facile to say we do not need to place the scheme on a statutory footing because the Garda Commissioner said so.</P>
        <P>The existing witness protection programme, established in 1997, was subject to serious criticism in the courts and it is not correct to say it did not result in the overturning of judgments pertaining to the most serious criminals in the country.  It is because of the manner in which the programme was operated that this was the case.  The establishment of the necessary framework and the detailed guidelines is fundamental.</P>
        <P>Following the calling into question of the programme, an internal review was conducted by the Assistant Garda Commissioner.  It was due to be published in 2005 but I have not seen it and do not know whether it is available.  As the Minister of State correctly stated, changes made in the Criminal Justice Act 1999 addressed the giving of evidence by way of video link and established a new statutory offence of intimidation of witnesses.  There is a need for a more comprehensive statutory framework for witness protection.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We know the most serious problem concerns securing detection, prosecution and conviction and that the dramatic fall in conviction rates results from the fear, intimidation and collective amnesia that apply in certain cases.  The Taoiseach spoke last week about establishing special criminal courts to prosecute those involved in gangland crime.  However, the problem lies not with the court system but with acquiring evidence in the first instance.  Unless a scheme is put in place that is widely understood to have a statutory basis with the full endorsement of the State, there will not be sufficient participation.  It should be funded and resourced properly.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Last March Fine Gael proposed that the witness protection programme be put on a statutory footing.  It was one of the key features of its election manifesto.  The party proposed the establishment of a special witness protection unit, a wit<Col N="904"/>ness protection hotline and draft guidelines for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on how to use the programme.  If witnesses fail to give evidence because they fear for their safety, it is very clear that criminals will not be detected or convicted.  This leads to a complete loss of public confidence in the police and the courts system.  That loss of confidence in the areas which are most affected by gun and gangland crime is the most serious problem we must tackle.  Those involved in policing have informed me they simply cannot get witnesses to testify because of fear and intimidation.</P>
        <P>It is inappropriate for the Minister of State to say this Bill does nothing to advance matters.  I welcome the Bill, which reflects Fine Gael policy, as outlined earlier this year.  However, certain features of the Bill need further work to ensure it reflects international best practice and the tried and tested statutory provisions which apply in so many other jurisdictions.  Emphasis must be also placed on the framework within Europe, through EU co-operation at judicial, prosecution and policing levels to advance the area of witness protection.  It is disappointing this issue was not mentioned by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform two weeks ago during the debate on gun and gangland crime.  The response from the Minister of State this evening is also disappointing in rejecting, out of hand, the proposal put forward by the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Labour Party on introducing this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It is good that such Bills are coming before the House with more frequency than in the past.  In an earlier debate, Senator Dan Boyle made the point that we should approach issues of national importance on a more constructive, all-party basis.  He was met with a hail of derision from Senator Regan&rsquo;s party, if I remember correctly, which was predictable.  </P>
        <P>Having read the Bill and the reasons put forward in the explanatory memorandum for its introduction, perhaps there is merit in underpinning the current system with legislation.  I am not 100% convinced that there is no merit in doing so.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, there is already in place a functioning witness protection scheme. For very good reasons,  we do not have much information relating to its operation but one would hope it is used as comprehensively as possible.  It can be a very effective tool in bringing to justice people involved in very serious criminal activity when the evidential barriers are set very high.  In such cases, unless witnesses co-operate, convictions become very difficult, if not impossible.</P>
        <P>In many instances, the witness protection programme does not simply apply to the individual witness but also his or her family.  It involves a change of identity, relocation in the case of very <Col N="905"/>serious crimes and, as a consequence, financial aid.  Representatives of the courts in this and other jurisdictions have occasionally argued that such a financial inducement may compromise the witness and the prosecution.  It is a complex area and for that reason it may be difficult to legislate in a way which makes a witness protection programme more effective than the current non-statutory operation.</P>
        <P>There is no disagreement in the House about the utilisation of the witness protection programme.  The question is whether it should be put on a statutory basis and I do not know the correct answer.  However, the programme should be kept under review to ensure that if statutory support is required in the future, it will be forthcoming.  The danger of potentially inhibiting the operation of the scheme by making it statutory is illustrated by the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on sections 13 and 14 of the Bill.  Those sections propose to make information on participants available in certain controlled situations. However, under the current system even to make an inquiry about the identity or whereabouts of a person in the witness protection programme is an offence, not to mention actually disclosing such information.  I am sure it is difficult to attract people into the programme and potential participants must be absolutely certain of confidentiality and have confidence in the protective measures that will be taken on behalf of themselves and their families.</P>
        <P>We must take note of the view of the Garda Commissioner.  While I accept the point that the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government have a responsibility to legislate, in an area as sensitive as this it would be imprudent to proceed against the clear advice of the Garda Commissioner.  I have no doubt that the operation of the current system has been tested to ensure it is proceeding reasonably satisfactorily.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One aspect of this issue, which is referred to in the memorandum accompanying the Bill, surprised me.  It relates back to the famous Gilligan case.  The Court of Criminal Appeal heard a case in August 2003 and criticised aspects of the witness protection programme.  The review that was then undertaken by the Garda Commissioner is only now coming to fruition.  Perhaps there were good reasons for such a delay, but in the absence of information in that regard, it must be said that four years seems an inordinate amount of time to review an area which should be a pivotal plank in our fight against crime.  The reasons for the delay must be examined.  I am aware that there was an appeal to the Supreme Court in 2005, which may have been a contributory factor.  Nevertheless, it behoves us to act promptly to buttress our systems in order that they address the reservations of the Judiciary and are as effective as possible.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>The witness protection programme is only one aspect of the fight against crime.  We also have the Special Criminal Courts and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The latter has proved a very effective tool.  If the CAB was set up to allow us to inter the assets of criminals and we can already identify many of the serious crime lords, why can we not use the CAB principle to inter them as well as their assets?  People who commit murder, rape and other very serious crime have impinged very seriously on the human rights of others.  If they make a decision to act thus, the corollary is that they should automatically forfeit a considerable amount of their own human rights.</P>
        <P>I refer to the infiltration of gangs by garda&iacute; which is an effective tool for tackling serious crime in many jurisdictions.  It is difficult and dangerous work and I ask that it be considered here.  I am sure it is happening but I am unclear as to what extent.  I hope provisions will be included in legislation in the not too distant future to grant immunity against prosecution to garda&iacute; who, due to the fact they have infiltrated these gangs, find themselves involved in certain crimes.  It works in other countries.  In Canada, for example, there is legislation granting immunity to police unless they are involved in crimes of a sexual nature or murder.  We should bring to Cabinet quickly any armour we can to tackle these crime lords.</P>

	<P>Why is the Minister of State saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  Is it a partisan reason because this is what happens every bloody Wednesday in this House?  Is it that the Government has really considered the substance of the Bill?  I do not imagine it has really considered it.</P><Col N="907"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to some of the things the Minister of State said.  He suggested that it was a tiny minority and that it was a very special few.  That may very well be but they are there.  Every week we see this.  Only in the past few days a fellow in Limerick was sentenced for perjury.  Having agreed to give evidence, he withdrew or changed it because he was terrified of his former associates.  That man was sent to prison despite the sympathy of the judge.  This happened in the past couple of weeks.  Let us not hear this is some kind of academic thing.  It is real and very much part of the current situation.  We have a problem where witnesses are very clearly intimidated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also have a situation where people are killed.  It is now becoming a feature of gangland warfare in Dublin at least that if there is one of these murders &mdash; I will not call them killings or executions because they are cold-blooded murders by hired assassins &mdash; and somebody happens to be present, that person is just dispatched as a witness.  There has been a number of such cases.  It is not just a question of intimidation.  These people are ruthlessly prepared to cut down and exterminate civilians who are innocent of any involvement.  The situation is very serious.</P>
        <P>Witness protection programmes have existed in other countries and have been reasonably successful.  There are great difficulties involved and I very much welcome that counselling and placements are considered in this Bill.  Even if people go along with it, it is a hell of a wrench.  People often return at great danger to themselves because they find it difficult to tear themselves away from their backgrounds.  We have seen this in the North with both the republicans and loyalists.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Labour Party has examined the question of plea bargaining because that could vitiate everything.  If it was felt someone was being offered an inducement to give certain types of evidence, there is no doubt that would vitiate his or her evidence to an unacceptable degree.</P>
        <P>I strongly support and commend the Labour Party in this regard.  It is clear that the protection of witnesses should be undertaken in the public interest because they are being got at.  It disturbs justice that people can be made retract or not give evidence at all.  It is the rule of the jungle.  What actions are the garda&iacute; taking &mdash; I am not being critical of them but it is essential we get to the nub of the issue &mdash; to find those people who are perverting the course of justice by witness tampering?  That used to be a very serious offence.  I would like the law and Garda action strengthened in this regard.</P>

        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has no real problem with this Bill as the current witness protection programme is fairly<i> ad hoc.</i>  Given the potential for wrongly handled witness protection arrangements to corrupt criminal proceedings or result in miscarriages of justice, Sinn F&eacute;in agrees this matter should involve clear guidelines underpinned by primary legislation.  However, we are not that naive to think a witness protection programme is the key to tackling serious crime.  Anybody whose sole focus in terms of fighting crime is to promote a witness protection programme shows themselves to be devoid of real solutions.</P>
        <P>The impact of this legislation will be near negligible in the fight against gangland criminals.  Communities want to be protected from criminals through effective on-the-ground policing and not through being hidden away from family and friends with a false identity.  If society is to seriously tackle drugs and gun crime,  it is essential the garda&iacute; work in genuine partnership with communities using the resources available in the most effective manner.  This means the civilianisation of administrative Garda tasks to free up approximately 4,000 fully trained garda&iacute; to be redeployed into the fight against crime.  Illegal drugs chains must be disrupted with the proceeds of drugs-related crime being channelled back into the communities worst affected by the drugs crisis.</P>
        <P>Community input should be sought through the joint policing committees and the community policing forums to the Garda drugs units with a view to rolling out campaigns such as the dial to stop drug dealing campaign.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in, as the Minister of State knows, has produced a comprehensive set of proposals to tackle serious drugs and gun crime which it has presented to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Some of our proposals have been merged in the latest recommendations for the Garda Inspectorate.  If implemented, we believe our proposals will have a major impact on the fight against crime.</P>
        <P>I commend the legislation and reiterate that we support it.  However, we need to go much further if we want to seriously tackle drugs crime.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I acknowledge the atmosphere in which it is being held and the earlier contribution of Senator Alex White.  It is important when dealing with the issue of serious crime that we all acknowledge that we have genuine concerns individually and within our respective political parties about its existence and on the need to remedy it in order that it occurs as infrequently as possible.  We should <Col N="909"/>never resort to the glib as a political response to these issues.</P>
        <P>There is a value in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It comes on the tenth anniversary of the existing programme which is managed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is in our interests to examine how that works and how, as public representatives, we could suggest how it could work in the most effective way.</P>
        <P>The real question is not whether there should be a witness protection programme or whether it can be made more effective, the purpose of the Bill is whether it should be put on a statutory basis.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s case was well made.  It pointed out the existence of similar legislation in other jurisdictions.  The Minister of State responded and there are reasons there would be difficulties, not least because putting it on a statutory basis would be seen to perhaps unnecessarily interfere with operational matters in the Garda and how it tries to provide the most secure service as possible.  Having said that, the opportunity afforded to us by this debate, even if we have limited time, should be used to examine wider issues.  We should not confine ourselves to the existence of a witness protection programme.  As Senator Doherty has suggested, we are admitting our failure as a society when we force people to leave their communities and assume new identities.  We have to consider the wider issues of how the forces of law and order get information, act on it and use it to ensure there is as little crime as possible.</P>
        <P>To be fair to the Labour Party, it has a commendable track record in this area.  Its Deputies have produced Private Members&rsquo; legislation relating to whistleblowing, for example.  Civil servants have advised that the best way to tackle whistleblowing is to deal with it on a case-by-case basis, rather than addressing it in a comprehensive Bill.  That advice is being taken on board as various Bills come before both Houses.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that a moral distinction is often blurred when people are offered protection by the Garda because they have information that is of value to the force.  I refer to the Garda&rsquo;s use of touts when gathering information.  We often hear anecdotally about crimes committed by people who are of value to the Garda, some of which can be quite dangerous, being overlooked.  The people to whom I refer may be involved in theft and other types of crime.  I would have thought we should consider the wider picture as part of any debate on witness protection.  People can find themselves in difficult circumstances, such as having to act as whistleblowers or participate in the witness protection programme.  The greyest of these three areas &mdash; the extent to which the Garda relies on sourcing information from unreliable people who are part of the problem of crime in Irish society &mdash;  is also the least likely to <Col N="910"/>come up in public debate.  If we do not address such issues in debates of this nature, we will let ourselves down as legislators and fail in our duties as representatives of the people.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I welcome the opportunity presented by the Labour Party&rsquo;s introduction of this Bill.  As Senators Alex White and Hannigan said when commencing the debate on the Bill, one encounters many difficulties when one proposes Private Members&rsquo; legislation.  One works in a kind of lacuna as one tries to produce an effective Bill.  One does not have the benefit of the civil servants, such as the officials in the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, who are available to Ministers when they initiate legislation.  One has to deal with restrictive rules &mdash; for example, one is not allowed to include provisions which would impose a cost on the Exchequer.  Any future legislation dealing with the witness protection programme will have to be well defined, in terms of how the programme can be funded on an ongoing basis and how its cost to individuals can be met.</P>
        <P>This debate might reveal the need for the Oireachtas to examine the witness protection programme on a regular basis &mdash; perhaps even on an annual basis.  Now that the committee system is up and running once more, a joint committee could be made responsible for asking valuable questions of the Garda Commissioner or his representative.  The committee could ask about how much the programme is costing, how many people benefit from it and the extent to which it fulfils its remit of limiting crime in our society.  We should constantly seek ways to improve the programme.  Sadly, we have to accept that even though the programme is deemed to be necessary, its existence and the involvement in it of individuals who have committed crimes is an acknowledgement that society is being defeated in one respect.  We should seek ways of ensuring it is used as little as possible and, when it is used, as effectively as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to give the House a brief overview of the sections of the Witness Protection Programme Bill 2007, before I say a few words on it.</P>
        <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, outline the definitions of specific and key terms to be used in the Bill.  They give the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the power to make regulations appropriate to the Bill.  The sections also explain the purpose and meaning of this legislation.</P>
        <P>Sections 4 and 5 provide for the establishment of the witness protection programme and set the levels of responsibility to be given to the Garda Commissioner and the director of the programme.  Sections 6 and 7 specify the circumstances in which a witness can join the programme and explain the factors to be considered <Col N="911"/>in admitting a person to the programme. Importantly, section 8 places an obligation on the protector and the protectee in the form of a protection agreement. Section 9 allows the director of a programme to terminate the protection in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>Section 10 sets out the procedures to be applied when it is decided to refuse admittance to the programme, or to terminate protection under the programme.  If protection is to be terminated, notice of termination and reasons for termination must be given to the protectee in writing.  Section 11 outlines the steps to be followed when changing the identity of a witness.  This provision is vitally important because the Garda is not currently empowered to make such a change, even if it happens under the present programme.  A new statute is critically required in this instance.  Section 12 states clearly that public bodies must co-operate with the Garda Commissioner in running the witness protection programme.</P>
        <P>Section 13 prohibits the disclosure of information on a witness in the programme, such as his or her location, identity, etc.  It also provides that the director of the programme can disclose information about a protectee only with the permission and full consent of that person.  Section 14 gives details of the specific circumstances in which a disclosure can be made in line with section 13.</P>
        <P>The vital section 15 provides for agreements to be struck between the Minister in Ireland and his or her counterparts in other states, or international courts and tribunals, to admit witnesses from other countries.  Section 16 provides that certain agreements of protection which have been reached before the day the Act comes into force will remain in force.  Under section 17, the director of any programme of witness protection may be required to provide an annual report on the progress of the programme.  Section 18 is self-explanatory.</P>
        <P>This Bill is being introduced on the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the witness protection programme.  It seeks to establish in statute the aims of the current Garda programme &mdash; to legally protect the victims of serious crime while exposing the criminals involved.  Along with the victims of organised crime, the former accomplices of criminal gangs can also seek protection under this legislation.  I refer to people who want to leave behind a dark life of fear and coercion and expose their former partners in crime by ensuring they are behind bars, which is where they belong.  As my colleagues have said, the Supreme Court has insisted that a statutory basis is required for the witness protection programme.  We are providing the Government parties with such a statute.  After years of little or no action on organised crime, I hope the Senators <Col N="912"/>opposite will take the initiative and support the Bill, which is supported by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The background to this Bill is clear.  All Senators will agree there is a need for the witness protection programme.  We need to consider whether the programme is best served by being placed in a legal format, as proposed in this legislation.  The evidence available to me, which is anecdotal but quite reliable, suggests that substantial amounts of money are associated with the drugs trade in this country.  The presence of such moneys leads to gang activities like turf wars, murders and intimidation.  I have heard that wheelie bins full of money are being put away.  I have been told that criminals have forgotten where they have put some of the bins in question.  When I asked a garda about his role recently, he told me that a plastic sack with money in it had been delivered to the station where he works.  When one of his fellow officers asked him to estimate how much money was in the sack, he guessed that there was &euro;300,000 in it because it looked quite large.  He was informed that it contained &euro;2 million in cash.</P>
        <P>Given that we are talking about circumstances which prevailed in America long before they were encountered here, we have a template from which to work.  The life cycle of those who work for criminal gangs on our streets can be as short as two years &mdash; if they start at the age of 24, they might be out of existence by 26.  Those who operate such gangs, who often live overseas, know how to use the legal system.  A witness protection programme exists because it became necessary.  There is no need for anybody to become too excited because this Government supports the witness protection programme; we all support the programme.  The only question is the basis on which it goes forward.  The witness protection programme, in its current form, has gone before the Supreme Court and has been found to be in order.  It was tried and tested ten years ago and this gives me confidence in it.  Operational flexibility is a requirement and this is another reason for my support of the Government.  The Opposition has put forward this Bill and there is no doubt some group, such as a civil liberties group, will test it in conjunction with video evidence.  This could throw into doubt the operation of the witness protection programme and this is a risk that cannot be taken.  A group could produce a witness and say, &ldquo;This witness felt intimidated.&rdquo;  This could cast doubt on the whole Bill and is another valid reason for not meddling with something that could be tested and <Col N="913"/>could be found to be unconstitutional, in conjunction with some other aspect.</P>
        <P>There is no basis for believing that putting the current Garda-operated witness protection programme on a statutory basis would have any effect on the willingness or otherwise of persons to enter the programme.  The rationale for such a programme is the willingness of persons to enter it.  The Garda Commissioner does not consider that legislation governing the operation of the programme is desirable at this stage.  The present arrangements are an operational matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is best placed to assess whether a person should be admitted to the programme.  If placed on a statutory basis, it may prove too inflexible to take account of the unique nature of individual cases.  Removing that flexibility may result in individuals being unable to be accommodated in the programme.</P>
        <P>For the reasons outlined, I cannot support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Hanafin for sharing his time.  </P>
        <P>I will vote against the Bill but I do so reluctantly because it has one huge merit, the indication to involve the Director of Public Prosecutions in the programme.  I say this as a matter of principle because I would like to see the DPP and the new prosecuting judges involved much more deeply in the prosecution of crime.  However, I do not wish to become bogged down in that detail but rather look at the wider picture before returning to this very meritorious Bill.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Alex White&rsquo;s call to make this a non-party issue.  I thought the recent debate in the D&aacute;il was very poor and it antagonised the public very deeply, whereas the debate in the Seanad has been far superior.  The public simply cannot understand why, when what needs to be done is so clear, it is not done.  At the detection level, the garda&iacute; need to have a dedicated gang-bursting force; at the legislative level, they need to have new forms of legislation that accept we are living in new times.  To talk about using old British common law procedures is like fighting the First World War and staring agog at a tank when the tank is proposed.  The tank that was proposed a long time ago to the old rainbow coalition by Proinsias De Rossa was that we adopt the continental model of proactive prosecuting magistrates with significant powers to proactively go out and smash the gangs rather than waiting in the British common law tradition for them to commit crimes and then try to attack them.  At the third level, we need Special Criminal Courts because courts can and have been intimidated in the past.  The Special Criminal Court in the 1970s did not have flawless hands.  The Director of Public Prosecutions needs to be involved and there is a need for a number of pro<Col N="914"/>secuting judges and a new office of investigating magistrates with wide-ranging powers and a continental approach to these matters.</P>
        <P>This is needed in particular because of a culture that has grown up in all parties.  When I speak to members of the public they ask me why we cannot have police powers and why a police superintendent cannot swear a person is a member of a gang.  They ask why there is so much objection to selective internment of gangland bosses.  I do not have an answer for them but the answer lies in the culture of three parties.  It lies first in the culture of the left, which sees the criminals as victims, forgetting George Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s great aphorism that all Tories are criminals and all criminals are Tories.  This romanticising of the criminal drags down the left-wing approach to crime and I am glad to see the Labour Party solidly parting company with this approach in recent times and taking a tough attitude to crime.</P>
        <P>Second, there is a tradition within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael of carrying a kind of legalistic baggage, Law Library baggage, the baggage of lawyers.  I know that within the rainbow coalition in the mid-1990s it was mooted that the CAB would be a gang-smashing unit but in fact it was parlayed down to mean merely a criminal assets bureau.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that a three-part strategy is needed.  Like the public I am tired of bitty things.  I am all for this Bill in principle and I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s reservations but there are merits in the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for the DPP.  However, I deplore the tone of defensiveness.  Twice in my lifetime I have seen Ministers for Justice go on radio and television and tell the public that things are all right because the gangland crime level is not the same as it is in Philadelphia or elsewhere, or fall into the hands of criminologists who try to tell us that things were worse in Hamburg in 1982.  This attitude makes the public very angry because the public knows we are in a new form of warfare.  This is not the trench warfare of the First World War but instead it is the warfare of the Second World War and the world of the tank.  We need different kinds of law, different kinds of detection and a different and tougher approach to the rights of criminals.</P>
        <P>It is not the first time we have faced this threat.  Gangland lords are much closer to the kind of subversives we faced in the 1970s and 1980s than to any kind of ordinary decent criminal.  The experience of politics should be used against them and that means Special Criminal Courts and Garda superintendents swearing them to be members of gangs, the use of the full panoply of the law and standing hard down on them as a threat to the security of the State.  This should be done as part of an all-party strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre.  I congratulate and commend the Labour Party on this Bill which in many ways reflects the Fine Gael position adopted as part of our manifesto before the general election.</P>
        <P>There has been a growth in gangland violence and Senator Harris in his eloquent remarks made reference to this growth.  I come devoid of any Law Library baggage.  As a humble public servant who lives and works in a community, I am aware of the growing need for all of us to face up to the fact that we must take on these crime lords and we must take them out, by whatever means.  Senator Harris may be correct that we need to be creative in our approach to crime and in our tackling of the issue.</P>
        <P>This Bill seeks to encourage witnesses or those involved in crime to come forward with critical information and to give evidence.  Senator White in his remarks made this point very well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are living in an era of intimidation of epidemic proportions.  I refer to some of the issues affecting the city of Limerick and the criminal trials which have taken place there.  Are we saying we will condone perjury in the courts and that those who perjure themselves will get away with it?  Are we sending out a message to young people in schools that it is all right to be involved in crime and to put one&rsquo;s hand on the Bible in court and tell lies?  This is what is happening.  There is a need to have a fully resourced witness protection programme to protect innocent people and to encourage people to come forward with information and be willing to give it.  We do not condone crime and illegal activities.  We are not talking about law and order in a television programme or &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo;, but about modern day Ireland.  The Labour Party Bill before the House is a serious attempt to tackle the issue of crime.  I am disappointed the Minister of State has rejected the Bill, and in saying that I am not being political by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The courts have told us the scheme should be on a statutory basis.  Why does the Minister of State not recognise this?  Why can it not be put on a statutory basis and have a strong witness protection scheme which is desirable for a functioning criminal justice system?  We can have all the theories and hypotheses we like, but if one goes back to the fundamentals &mdash; Senator Harris spoke about detection levels &mdash; the Garda needs information as part of its ability to solve crime.  Coming back to the most fundamental point of community policing, the neighbourhood watch scheme, why can we not take it a stage further?  Why can we not encourage this to counteract the perception that we are doing little or nothing to stop the intimidation of witnesses?  We need to encourage people to testify and to come forward.</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Harris on the need for a complete revolution regarding tackling crime.  How best can that be achieved?  If one lives in fear of devious people one will not come forward.  One will go into court, put one&rsquo;s hand on the Bible, tell lies and perjure oneself.  We need to set up a system to encourage people to come forward.</P>
        <P>We can quote all the figures we like for the past five months or five years, but serious criminal activity is increasing.  I am not that old, but if a Garda was shot when I was growing up it was a huge story.  It is still a huge story today but it has become more commonplace, which is unacceptable.  Will we as legislators give in to fear and intimidation and allow drug barons and gangland bosses to control our streets?  Is that what we want?  If so, we may as well put up our hands, wave the white flag, surrender, go back into the trenches, put our heads in the sand and pretend everything is fine.  Unfortunately, it is not.  I agree with Senator Boyle that all of us as legislators have a responsibility to legislate and to put forward solutions.  One way to do that is by means of the Bill before the House where we can offer protection on a statutory basis.  It has worked in other countries, why can it not work here?</P>
        <P Just="Left">A fear has been expressed in some quarters that we are giving an amnesty to criminals.  We are not doing that.  We need partnership and co-operation.  At a different level, the Bill offers an opportunity for people to come forward and give information and evidence.  We desire to bring to an end the gangland crime and warfare that is taking place in many parts of society.  If we want to continue a partnership in crime between the kingpins and their associates that is fine, but we have an obligation to bring forward legislation, which the Labour Party has done.  I do not mean to be critical of the Garda but is it the job of the Garda Commissioner to be the legislator or is it ours?  He says &mdash; if I am wrong I stand corrected &mdash; we should not have witness protection on a statutory footing yet the courts say we should.  That is a question that needs to be answered because I think it is our job as legislators to put forward legislation and in tandem with that to resource and enhance the Garda at every level.  Perhaps we are not doing that adequately.  Irrespective of whether we like it, in many parts of the country &mdash; this is not politicisation &mdash; there is fear and intimidation.  By the same token, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, it is a great stumbling block in tackling crime.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  No matter what its flaws it is a serious attempt to tackle this issue.  We need to be honest in our approach and to stand up and be counted in regard to tackling gangland crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State and colleagues for their contributions, including those who said it was a meritorious Bill but could not find their way to vote for it.  That is one of the curious experiences one has as a newly elected Member.  It is a pity that when one sees merit in something, one cannot find it possible to vote for it.  I do not make that as a personalised remark to anybody in the House but my party and I would support legislation brought forward by the Government in circumstances where the legislation made sense and addressed a fundamental problem.  I hope the day will come when Members on the Government side will reach the same conclusion.  Perhaps the thing to do is to support a proposal it fairly acknowledges has merit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened carefully to the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  He said there was no need to put the scheme on a statutory footing, notwithstanding the trenchant criticism in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court, but especially the Court of Criminal Appeal which said we do not really have a system but an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and it needs to be put on a statutory footing in order that everybody can understand it and see it being implemented.  At one stage in his contribution the Minister of State said &mdash; I thought it quite amusing &mdash; the Bill is not altogether flawed in its contents.  He said one thing that troubled me and I have had an opportunity to check it.  It seems the issue of which he is most critical is not all that clear.  As Senator Hanafin and everybody else has said, we should have a scheme, the only issue is whether it should be put on a statutory footing.  The Minister of State said there is no need to put it on a statutory footing because the Garda Commissioner is not of the belief that should be done.  Senator Regan is right about that.  We all take seriously the advice and guidance of the Garda Commissioner, particularly in this area.  The Garda Commissioner has a role to play but we also have a role to play as legislators.  It is for the legislators to determine the contents of a scheme and not, with respect, the Garda Commissioner, valuable and important as is his advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I turn to what the Minister of State said about sections 13 and 14.  This is an example of the criticism he has put forward, which is not real criticism.  It masquerades as criticism but when one studies it, the Minister of State does not bring forward any criticism.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The second serious flaw I detect in the Bill arises in sections 13 and 14 which set out circumstances and factors that would justify disclosure of information relating to a protected person, including information sufficient to identify and locate him or her.  Let us be clear that these sections have the potential to set at nought the chances of encouraging individuals <Col N="918"/>to enter the programme and give evidence against former comrades.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The explanatory memorandum gives a fair summary of those sections.  Section 13 prohibits the disclosure of information relating to the location or a change of identity of a protectee.  However, it sets out some exceptions about which the Minister of State claims to be so concerned.  The prohibition does not apply to a protectee or former protectee who discloses information about himself or herself, if the disclosure does not endanger the safety of another protectee or former protectee and does not compromise the integrity of the programme.  It does not apply to a person who discloses information that was disclosed to the person by a protectee or former protectee, if the disclosure does not endanger the safety of the protectee or former protectee or another protectee or former protectee and does not compromise the integrity of the programme.  These are major restrictions on the circumstances where disclosure is allowed.  The Minister of State gives the impression that a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude is being taken and for this reason, if for no other, the Bill should be rejected.  The criticism he suggests to be valid adds up to nothing.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Hanafin appeared to criticise the Bill on the basis that if it became law it could be open to challenge.  With all due respect to Senator Hanafin, it is extraordinary for any legislator to suggest not introducing legislation because it might be tested in the courts.  What state have we arrived at that we do not have the self-confidence as legislators to introduce legislation?  By all means have it scrutinised &mdash; I am quite happy for this legislation to go through the wringer in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

    <Title>Ambulance Service. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to the House.  All emergency services should be given our fullest support.  I am concerned, however, that inadequate resources are being allocated to the ambulance service.  In recent weeks, several persons working in the ambulance service have contacted me to raise their concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>Since the imposition of an embargo on the recruitment of staff by the HSE and the associated cutbacks, a situation has arisen where the ambulance service is engaged in ferrying patients between hospitals.  At Nenagh Hospital, for example, there is a cap of 75 on patient numbers and the 76th person is ferried into Limerick.  The ambulance service is obliged to ferry patients in this way while also being available to deal with emergencies.  Those operating the control room of the ambulance service are thus placed in a difficult situation.</P>
        <P>The ambulance service is there to deal with emergencies but, because of the embargo, it is effectively functioning as a taxi service because patients are not being accepted in their regional hospital of choice.  This is a serious and lamentable development.  It could be a matter of life and death if ambulance service staff are unable to attend the scene of an accident in good time because they are engaged in taxi services.</P>
        <P>The ambulance service is under great pressure.  In Nenagh, one ambulance is available from 4 p.m. until 8 a.m. daily.  This is simply not good enough.  Likewise, only one ambulance is available to serve Roscrea and Thurles.  If a serious accident were to occur in Nenagh, the cover is not there to cope because of the pressure on the ambulance service to ferry patients between hospitals.</P>
        <P>The ambulance service is meant to carry two emergency medical technicians, EMTs, who operate the ambulances.  A number of patrols do <Col N="922"/>not have two of these EMTs and in two scenarios I know of in the mid-west, there is a nurse on board.  These personnel are doing their best but the situation is unacceptable, as EMTs are specifically trained in protocols and techniques with regard to roadside emergency scenarios etc.  Will the Minister of State explain why this is happening and what will be done about it?</P>
        <P>Training programmes for advanced paramedics were promised, with one such paramedic operating in each ambulance station per shift.  In reality, between 240 and 320 advanced paramedics are needed in the country, given there are 80 stations.  Where are these located, as I understand the training programme is way behind schedule?  As a result of the embargo, a number of these trained advanced paramedics are moving into private health care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ambulance personnel are working long hours.  The chairman of the Ambulance Association of Ireland, Pat Hanafin, recently stated that many are tired and some ambulance services are not being manned because of issues relating to rosters, sick leave and working hours that are too long.  It is dangerous for us not to have the required personnel to run the service.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State clarify the matter of new ambulances being brought in by the HSE?  I understand a quantity is on order, which I welcome.  There is an EU directive on the standard of ambulance that should be used and I look forward to their introduction into service.  An issue exists, however, and I hope it will not provide a &ldquo;Port Tunnel&rdquo; moment for the Government.  The new ambulances are to be one-stretcher ambulances and because we have two-stretcher ambulances currently in operation we require twice the amount of ambulances to meet capacity.  We also need twice the number of personnel to man those ambulances.  Is the Government fully aware of this matter and if so, will it guarantee the required resources of ambulances and personnel will be available?</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the state of ambulance stations.  In a number of cases these stations are in a very good state, with one in my own constituency in Roscrea being a state-of-the-art facility.  In the same constituency there is a more ugly case, with the ambulance station in Thurles at times in a ridiculous state because of dampness and infestation.  That is not good enough in this day and age.</P>
        <P>Ambulance personnel need our full support and we are only too aware, as legislators, how important these people are in conjunction with other emergency services.  The events in Bray in recent months confirm this.  We should support these people fully and I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Government does this by answering the queries I have brought to the House.</P>
        <P>The support given should not relate to the HSE being run by budget instead of demand.  Such a system would take these people for granted, <Col N="923"/>which should not happen because they provide such an important service to all of us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kelly for his kind wishes, although I have had the pleasure of being here on a previous Adjournment matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, I did not realise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>As part of the development of the Health Service Executive a national ambulance service was established in 2005.  This new organisation replaced the eight regional ambulance services that existed under the former health board structure.  The objective is to provide clinically appropriate and timely pre-hospital emergency care and patient or client transport services.  This includes working closely with other health-care professionals in order to achieve the most suitable integrated health-care service.  As part of the process, modern technology and clinical practice guidance are used and this will continue to be a feature as the service develops.</P>
        <P>The service operates from 94 stations located throughout the country and is controlled from 14 command and control centres.  There are approximately 1,350 staff involved in the provision of services.  A wide range of vehicles is used and their suitability is constantly being reviewed both in terms of European standards and developing models of pre-hospital emergency care and patient transport in line with identified international models of best practice.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on the pre-hospital and ambulance service has increased significantly in recent years.  In 1991 expenditure was &euro;25.8 million, with this figure increasing to &euro;48.6 million in 1997.  In 2007, the allocation to the national ambulance service has increased to over &euro;122 million.</P>
        <P>There is a full commitment to the expansion and development of the national ambulance service, which to date has seen investment both in revenue and capital funding.  This has realised the purchase of 67 new ambulance vehicles in 2006 and 65 new vehicles in 2007.  There has also been refurbishment and development of new ambulance stations; continued education and training for advanced paramedics; introduction of rapid response vehicles; development of services as part of emergency care networks; and the development of a national partnership which is effectively dealing with the change agenda required to develop the service in a manner which will deliver high quality mobile health care.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is aware of the continued increased demands placed on the service and is currently conducting a national spa<Col N="924"/>tial analysis identifying the demands across the country.  The analysis has already provided a draft report for the north-west and will have the north-east finished within the next month.  The service is prioritising the next areas to be analysed.  This analysis will identify the optimum shift patterns which historically have been developed in line with historical demands within the former health board areas.  The analysis will also identify optimum ambulance station locations and identify the appropriate skill mix of staff.</P>
        <P>The inception of the Health Service Executive has removed the former operational boundaries throughout the country and therefore resources can be deployed based on demands.  In some areas, as a consequence of spikes in demand and staff absences, this can impact on resources and mean that staff will be asked to cover these additional shifts on overtime.</P>
        <P>The service is prioritising workload and is increasing its capacity to deal with demands.  It is in the final stages of contracting private ambulance companies to assist where necessary.  In addition, following a selection and recruitment process that commenced in July of this year, 37 staff have been offered employment subject to Garda clearance and former employer references.  The Health Service Executive is continuing to examine the issue of staff recruitment and is currently considering a number of options.  The Minister has every confidence the measures being taken to improve the ambulance service are on track to achieve this effect as speedily as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some short questions and I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Are the 37 staff being offered employment advanced paramedics or EMTs?  Is there any information on the training programme in place, such as the numbers involved?  Is there any information on the number of ambulances being purchased?  Are they to go to areas replacing two-stretcher or one-stretcher ambulances?</P>

    <Title>Citizenship Applications. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome back to the House.  This matter concerns a citizenship application, which is currently a troubled area, with 17,000 people in the queue awaiting citizenship.  On average, every application takes about 30 months.  That is a broad picture.</P>
        <P>Within this picture there are certain particular anomalies.  We are told today that a function of <Col N="925"/>politicians is to address anomalies and eradicate them.  This was done extremely speedily in the case of Deputy Michael Woods, a former Minister.  We were very quick to address that anomaly and I hope we will be just as quick to address this.  I will put it theoretically before the House and then outline the particular case.</P>
        <P>In order to apply for Irish citizenship, an applicant requires at least 60 months of what is termed &ldquo;reckonable residence&rdquo; in Ireland over the past five years.  The period when a foreign national is resident in Ireland on a student visa is not regarded as reckonable residence.  When the Bill covering this was going this House, I remember the reason given for that provision was fair enough.  The authorities were concerned that people &mdash; I believe it was Chinese people in particular although not only Chinese but other nationalities &mdash; would come here, attend fly by night language schools and use such time spent as a justification for building up the time required to qualify for citizenship.  This was seen as a back door approach and not strictly honourable.  The authorities wanted to clamp down on that.</P>
        <P>The exclusion of time on a student visa from reckonable residence calculation creates an unfair situation in certain cases.  I will outline the case in question.  For example, if a foreign national comes to Ireland as a minor with his or her foreign parents or guardians, he or she is resident here as a dependant and has no choice in the matter.  This period as a dependant counts as reckonable residence.  However, once a person turns 18 and goes on to third level education, he or she is resident here on a student visa and such time is excluded from reckonable residence.</P>
        <P>The results of the exclusion of student visa time from the reckonable residence calculations are, first, that the person would need to stay up to eight or nine years before he or she could apply for citizenship.  Then he or she would experience about a three-year delay before possibly getting citizenship.  That means that a person would have to wait 11 to 13 years in total for citizenship.  Second, after completing third level education, he or she would only be able to remain in Ireland on a work permit.  There is no certainty that the person would get such a permit.  Thus, a person who comes to Ireland, puts down roots here and becomes integrated into Irish society may not be able to continue to live here after being here for up to seven or eight years.  That is manifestly unfair.</P>
        <P>The policy of excluding student visa time from the residence calculation is to stop people who come here as students deliberately remaining until they have reached the six-month period required, but this is not the case in the anomaly to which I  referred.  I ask that there should be a change of policy not only in this case but generally to provide that time spent here on a student visa should count as reckonable residence if the applicant comes to Ireland as a dependant minor of a non-national parent or guardian and legit<Col N="926"/>imately remains here during his or her dependent and student periods.</P>
        <P>The particular case I wish to raise concerns a South African man who was head-hunted by the Government.  Its officials actively recruited him in 2001 in South Africa and brought him over here to work for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a planning inspector.  He arrived here in August 2001 and was seconded to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as a planning inspector.  His legal status is that he is here with a work authorisation visa.  He came to Ireland with his wife and youngest daughter.</P>
        <P>His daughter went straight into transition year in a secondary school near where they live.  She finished her leaving certificate in 2004, completed a year at post leaving certificate level in Inchicore College and then started a three-year veterinary nursing diploma course at UCD.  Recently she got her results and passed all her second year subjects.  It is a requirement of the course that students work for at least a certain number of hours each week in a veterinary practice.  For the past two years she has held a part-time veterinary nursing position in a local surgery.</P>
        <P>Having all been here together with the same status for five years, they applied together in November 2006 for Irish citizenship.  They got a response from the Irish Nationalisation and Immigration Service regarding their applications.  In the case of the man who was head-hunted, there is no difficulty.  He is sailing through, if one could call it that, and is on the right track even though the procedure is extraordinarily slow.  While his application is being processed, it will take the usual 30 months to process and the officials are only examining the applications lodged in 2005.  If all goes well, it will have taken three years for his application to be processed, which is what tends to happen in such cases.  As the man said, it is hardly greased lightning but they can live with it.</P>
        <P>In his wife&rsquo;s case, the authorities have discounted the nine months from the time the family arrived until the time in 2002 when her passport was stolen.  They seem to be incapable of having the machinery to investigate the fact that her passport was stolen.  It was perfectly well known that she was here with her husband as his wife and living in the family home, he having been recruited by the authorities in this land.  This means that she does not have the length of time here to qualify to make an application.</P>
        <P>The worst aspect is the daughter&rsquo;s position.  The Nationalisation and Immigration Service has discounted all the time for reckonable residence since she left secondary school, in other words the period she studied in Inchicore College and in UCD.  This means that in practice she cannot get the required 60 months reckonable residence in the near or even medium term future.  It appears it is Government policy not to include time spent studying at tertiary level when totting up the time legitimately spent in Ireland, even <Col N="927"/>when the young person had no choice.  She was brought here as part of a family unit and did most of her schooling here.  At the end of this system she has been told she does not have the required period to qualify.  She will have to wait for 11 to 13 years.  If this position is not rectified, this girl will have to leave this jurisdiction in a few months&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>This is a complete nonsense and a farce.  It is, as the former Minister, Deputy Woods, might term it, an anomaly.  It needs to be rectified.  Deputy Woods indicated that we as politicians are here to rectify anomalies.  We head-hunted this man and brought him to this country with his family. We had difficulties with his wife&rsquo;s application and could not understand how in holy Catholic Ireland a passport could be stolen and the implications of that.  His daughter is here but the authorities do not calculate any of the time she has spent here as reckonable residence because she was a student.  The provision in the legislation is perhaps understandable in the case of people who are not bona fide students, but in the case of this person, something should be done.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I could list all the distinguished posts this man has held, the work he has done and the way in which we were proud to have him representing us at international level, but from a party and Government that is everlastingly caterwauling about family values, the family and all the rest of it, it is a bit thick that they should have no concept of the family as it affects this person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this matter.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is otherwise occupied.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions are that the applicant must be of full age or by way of exception be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the <Col N="928"/>prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purpose of study and periods granted for the purpose of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way that preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who are suitably qualified.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is fully completed.  It should be noted that approximately one third of all applications for naturalisation received are not completed correctly, necessitating the return of the forms and accompanying documentation to the applicants with an explanation of the problems involved.  Valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and inquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.</P>
        <P>Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, more than 1,500 applicants have been found to have had insufficient residency in the State for the purposes of naturalisation.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to re-apply when they are in a position to satisfy the residency requirements of the aforementioned Act.</P>
        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the three persons referred to by Senator Norris were received in the citizenship section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 20 December 2006 and acknowledgements of said applications were issued to the applicants on 2 January 2007.  The first named applicant, whom I will refer to as the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; entered the State on 5 September 2001 and registered with the immigration authorities in Wicklow where he was given the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State for two years.  He renewed this permission in November 2003, allowing him to remain until August 2005.  He further renewed the permission in September 2005 giving him permission to remain until August 2007.  These various permissions were identified from stamps in his national passport.  At the time of lodging his application for a certificate of naturalisation in December 2006, he had accumulated a period of 62 months reckonable residency and his application was therefore deemed eligible.  The individual concerned was informed in May 2007 that his application was being placed in chronological order and it was <Col N="929"/>likely that it would be processed in approximately 30 months.</P>
        <P>The second named applicant, whom I shall refer to as the &ldquo;daughter&rdquo;, similarly entered the State in September 2001.  As she was 16 years of age at the time of entry, she was obliged to register with the Garda immigration authorities which she duly did.  She was given the permission of the Minister to remain unconditionally in the State until June 2004.  However, in August 2004 she was given a stamp 2, which is issued to non-nationals who are pursuing a course of study, which extended to June 2006.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, periods of permission granted for the purposes of study are not recognised in the calculation of periods of residence in an application for naturalisation.  In addition, the individual concerned did not have a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of her application as is required by legislation.  In accordance with these statutory provisions the application was deemed ineligible and this decision was communicated to her on 30 May 2007.  The individual was, however, invited to submit a new application when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements of the Act.</P>
        <P>The third named applicant, whom I shall refer to as the &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, submitted her application at the same time as her husband and daughter.  The documentation which she submitted with her application as evidence of her immigration history in the State indicated that her total reckonable residence in her application for a certificate of naturalisation amounted to 49 months, thereby rendering her 11 months short of the total requirement of 60 months.</P>
        <P>This fact was communicated to her by the official who examined her case in May 2007.  The lady in question wrote to the Department on 23 September 2007, providing further corroborative evidence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirming that while for a period when she had no residency stamps on her passport as the passport had been stolen, she was in fact registered with the immigration authorities as being legally resident in the State for the period concerned.  There was also a further deficit of two months legal residence but this shortfall was explained in that the individual moved from one county to another.  There was subsequent confusion as to which Garda district should be responsible for her immigration registration.  On foot of further corroborative evidence received on 23 September, officials in the citizenship section reviewed her application.  They deemed that she did satisfy the statutory requirements pertaining to reckonable residency and have now re-instated her application alongside that of her husband.  A letter will issue to her presently confirming this position.</P>
        <P>Officials in the citizenship section of the Department are currently processing applications received at the beginning of 2005 and have approximately 11,200 cases to be processed <Col N="930"/>before those of the individuals concerned.  It is likely therefore that further processing of these applications will commence in the second half of 2009.</P>
        <P>I hope I addressed the Senator&rsquo;s concerns about these individuals and have clearly demonstrated that correct procedures were applied at every stage of the process by departmental officials.</P>

I am asking him to take this response back to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, a rather decent man, and inform him I am not satisfied with it.  Apparently, the daughter is disposable.  The officials who recruited this man were aware at all times of the family situation.  They were recruited as a family but now the daughter is disposable.  The Minister has accepted they were wrong about the wife.  The Minister claims he has demonstrated that correct procedures were applied.  Really?

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the efforts being made to attract major employers into the north west and to secure existing employment that will impact on County Donegal given the ongoing employment difficulties since the decline of the textile industry and taking cognisance of the recent plant closure announcement by Seagate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I empathise and sympathise with the workers of Seagate in the Limavady plant.  As a Member for over a decade I am too familiar with the decline of the manufacturing industries.  Primarily, in Donegal it was the female-dominated textile industry.  Fruit of the Loom was good to workers and generous in its redundancy packages.  The same cannot be said for companies such as Clubman Omega.  The redundancy package can assist people in the immediate fallout from their job loss but also can be the key to some people beginning their own initiatives.  There is some evidence of this in Donegal after the decline of the textiles industry.  I offer that as some small comfort to those in the north-west directly affected by this week&rsquo;s announcement by Seagate.</P>
        <P>There are more involved than the significant figure of 930 workers.  There are their families and the service industries in the region.  Each have thrived on the fact that paid employment gave families a disposable income.  Nearly 1,000 workers being laid off in a city like Dublin would have a big impact.  Can any Member really contemplate how that number impacts on a small rural community?  We in Donegal know of it at first hand.  This situation is compounded by the fact that the company has a sister plant in Derry and the obvious question, despite assurances to date, is how safe are those jobs?</P>
        <P>Some may ask what have Limavady and Derry to do with Donegal?  There is proximity geographically and politically through the north-west region cross-Border group.  The same issues concern all of us, namely, attracting employment into the region, training employees and ensuring the word &ldquo;access&rdquo; is delivered on.  Last week on the Adjournment I raised the need for a direct train service from Dublin to Derry to improve access to the area.  I was basically told we had air access and a road under construction and given that we had an hourly bus service a train was not needed.</P><Col N="932"/>
        <P Just="Left">I should like the Minister of State to convey to the senior Minister that the time for platitudes to the north-west must end.  We have had F&Aacute;S training and some important changes to the back to education allowance, as well as innovation for some as regards support towards going back to education and investment in addressing early school leaving.  We also have had improvements in basic infrastructure.  However, we must recognise that the north west should not be without a train service if the rest of the country is entitled to one.  We have to overcome issues that are of a cross-Border nature.</P>
        <P>I am pleased Senator Doherty is a Member of the House because we have issues such as the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in standing over the introduction of third level fees in the North which is disenfranchising Donegal and other Border students.  We must recognise, financially, the effects the Troubles have had on Donegal specifically and the west of the Bann, in Ulster terms.  We have woken up to a new dawn &mdash; there is relative peace; there is a local Administration in the Six Counties but in the nine-county Ulster there is an historical deficit of investment.</P>
        <P>This new dawn links into the ongoing march of progress in the east, whereby other regions and counties are wealthy enough, through their business bases, to contribute in kind to ongoing infrastructural development.  We in Donegal are expected to turn around with no oars the tide of historical under-investment in infrastructure.  The yachts on the rest of the island can rise to that challenge.  The reality of where we are coming from must be faced.</P>
        <P>I spoke of under investment.  Let us call a spade a spade.  For decades we did not have an input into, for example, the A5 being upgraded or an air service linking east Donegal with Dublin via Derry.  The trains were more often blown up or threatened than running.  Businesses could have been described as brave or foolish to consider investing.  This has all moved on.  We now need a strong and real commitment to provide real jobs in our region and not have a movement of existing businesses over the Border and back again.  We have a movement of people to and from locations for work on construction sites.  Should the building trade slow, as is forecast, even that source of opportunity will dry up and this needs to be pre-empted for the males involved.</P>
        <P>Results to date have not been encouraging.  The Minister of State is new to the portfolio and I am aware that he knows about the recent investments that have taken place as regards jobs.  I have spoken to him about locations abroad where he has met people who were employers in Donegal.  I ask him to take an interest in the north west region.  I ask him to commit tonight to turning the tide around with a strategic view of what needs to be done, in co-ordination with the relevant bodies.  Together the north west can bounce back but only when that &ldquo;together&rdquo; is an all embracing all-Ireland priority and focus.  I like to <Col N="933"/>believe that focus will be gained under the Minister of State and Deputy Martin, the senior Minister.  We talk about North-South ministerial councils and the brand new dawn.  We want to see this brand new dawn yielding something that transcends borders.  The Border has been blurred by many things that have occurred in recent times, but there is an east-west divide in this country that also needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>As regards housing, we talk about location, location, location.  For business and investment it is access, access, access.  I hope the Minister is able to outline what is going on and what can be done to ensure we get what we are entitled to, namely, the same chance as everywhere else on the island of Ireland to attract investment and ensure employers come to the north west, where they will have a better quality of life and potential than in many other regions.  I ask the Minister to give that commitment tonight in order that the north west may recover from the effects of such awful announcements as were made this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his welcome and I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter on the Adjournment.   </P>
        <P>While it is recognised that Donegal has suffered particular difficulties in the past due to the demise of traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing and textiles, there is clear evidence that the county is successfully engaged in a transition to the new economy.  Live register figures at 8,340 and 8,370 for September 2006 and 2007, respectively, are lower then any year going back to 1993.  The interdepartmental group report on Donegal, which my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, launched last year, identified the various infrastructural developments required to support enterprise development in the county.  The report noted, not just that much progress had been made, but also that there were financial provisions available to complete major infrastructural projects, especially new roads, to equip Donegal further as an attractive location for enterprise development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Donegal is a key target location for IDA Ireland, with the county now competing for a different type of business from labour-intensive manufacturing, on which it relied successfully in the past.  The overseas investor is now seeking locations for more advanced manufacturing or office-based solutions, to a great extent depending on high skill and doing high value work.  This has required a significant change of strategy by IDA Ireland with a focus on a limited number of key locations nationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To encourage interest in Donegal, IDA Ireland has developed a new business park in Letterkenny with modern building solutions capable of competing with other locations nationally and <Col N="934"/>internationally.  IDA Ireland has been working with the third level sectors in the region, at Letterkenny Institute of Technology and in Northern Ireland, to offer the necessary courses aimed at its target areas of medical technologies, international financial services and high end engineering.</P>
        <P>Over a number of years, progress has been made in securing new investments from PacifiCare, Pramerica, SITA and Abbott Diabetes with approximately 1,200 new jobs being added in the county by overseas firms in the past five years.  These companies continue to recruit and are actively seeking new staff.  Pramerica Systems is expanding its services centre in Letterkenny to create 70 new jobs in software development and testing operations, call centre and financial services with added capacity to recruit a further 80 personnel.</P>
        <P>Abbott, one of the world&rsquo;s largest healthcare companies, is establishing a manufacturing facility for its diabetes care products in Donegal town with the creation of 155 high quality jobs at full production.  Abbott has taken possession of its plant from Hospira and recruitment of key executives is underway along with the redevelopment of the site to meet the needs of its new occupant.</P>
        <P>SITA will expand its software operation in Letterkenny, leading to the creation of 123 high quality software development jobs.  Zeus Industrial Products has made a capital investment of more than &euro;7 million, principally in state-of-the-art premises, production machinery and equipment.  There are currently 71 permanent staff members employed in the firm and recruitment is ongoing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to the Enterprise Ireland input in County Donegal, during the years 2004-06 a total of 1,156 jobs were created in the agency&rsquo;s client companies, as against job losses of 980, leaving a net gain of 176 jobs.  As the Senator mentioned, in recent times I have met with a company from Donegal in Dubai and we are supporting it in its efforts to gain a stronger foothold in that market.  In that context, in terms of trade missions, I shall continue to focus on that area and support companies that come forward through Enterprise Ireland. The following are some specific Enterprise Ireland initiatives in County Donegal.  The agency supports the CEIM Enterprise Platform Programme, in partnership with Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the Institutes of Technology in Sligo and Border Action in providing a training programme for entrepreneurs wishing to set up their own businesses.  This programme is now going into its fourth year.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with Invest Northern Ireland and the Special EU Programmes Body, commenced recruitment for Transform, a new cross-Border enterprise incubation programme, in May 2007.  The programme was launched in September 2007 with a total of <Col N="935"/>43 participants, nine of whom are from the north west region.  In 2006 Enterprise Ireland approved support of &euro;650,000 for the provision of enterprise space in Carndonagh and Donegal town, as part of the community enterprise centre scheme.  The agency has approved an amount of &euro;2.54 million to extend the business development centre at Letterkenny Institute of Technology to cater for increasing demand.  The building work is due to commence in 2008.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of its funding offer &mdash; whereby funding for existing company expansion and start-up businesses is biased towards regions.  The maximum grant level is higher than in Dublin and the mid-east and a higher proportion of this funding is non-repayable.  Donegal County Enterprise Board, funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, provides support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s other comments on the region to the attention of the Minister in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  One of our difficulties will be to secure <Col N="936"/>matching funds for infrastructural development because we do not have the business core of other regions.  Perhaps the Minister of State will bring this to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is a question of matching the funding locally but the rate base is not the same as that of other counties because we have not had as much business.  Some 52% of the rate base in Buncrana was derived from Fruit of the Loom and when such a company is taken out of the equation it makes it very difficult for the council to have the same disposable income as an urban council or county council.  I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive answer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a particular interest in the SME sector and the work of Enterprise Ireland.

I will make the Minister aware of the Senator&rsquo;s views and ensure she receives a reply and that action is taken.</P>
