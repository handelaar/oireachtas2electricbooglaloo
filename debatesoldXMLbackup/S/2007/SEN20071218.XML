	<P>I have received notice from Senator Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to outline the current status of the report on music and education, which was the second focus of the sub-committee of the Arts Council set up under the Arts Bill and which was due to report earlier this year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>I was delighted to attend a reception yesterday at which our colleague, Senator Norris, handed over his personal archive of papers to the National Library.  These document his campaign for equality and gay rights in Ireland.  I echo the words of the former President, Mary Robinson, who at the reception commended his courage in illustrating the discrimination felt by gay people at a time when it was difficult to speak out about gay rights.  Senator Norris said he intended to continue to contribute to the archives.  It is not the end of the story as the campaign for gay rights is an unfinished one.  As the Taoiseach said, sexual orientation cannot and must not be the basis of a second-class citizenship.  It is appropriate to pay tribute to Senator Norris on this occasion.</P>
        <P>Since the session began, I and many other Senators have raised the issue of mental health <Col N="238"/>services.  We had a debate on the issue and plan to have another.  In view of the tragic circumstances in which a young man lost his life over the weekend, I wish to raise the issue of our approach to funding mental health services and the implementation of plans in A Vision for Change.  It is getting to the point that we cannot believe words from Ministers.  There appears to be a complete discrepancy between what is promised and what is delivered.  The Leader and Deputy Leader must examine this issue seriously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this year&rsquo;s budget, funding promised for mental health services was reduced.  It has been the Cinderella of the health services for a long time.  As the base is poor, development slow and the move from institutional care to community care has been only recent, there is a moral obligation on us to pay more attention to this area in budgeting policy.  One in four people will experience mental health problems.  We must bring the services to the point at which those people have access to the community services they need, as well as inpatient services.  Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Barry said this sad and unfortunate incident was a crisis waiting to happen.  She said the drastic reduction in the number of hospital beds for mentally ill patients had created major problems for those  working in the front line.  It would be appropriate in the new session to have another debate on mental health.  Will the Leader talk to the Minister for Finance to discuss the budget for implementing A Vision for Change?  The Government&rsquo;s blueprint was to ensure that the kinds of community care services needed would be in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This week we heard about a young man going to three outpatient clinics and community care services were not able to reach him.  It is a sad and serious issue about which everyone in the House has spoken, yet there has been another reduction in funds for mental health services in the budget.  If the Leader takes action on this he will reflect the views of Members on all sides of this House.  According to the statistics available to me, children aged between 13 and 17 years were admitted to adult psychiatric beds in October and November of this year.  This scandal must end.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Frances Fitzgerald for her gracious words and confirm this will be a continuing archive.  I quoted John Donne to the unfortunate librarian yesterday,  &ldquo;When thou has done, thou has not done for I have more&rdquo;  and there will be more.   I will put down the domestic partnership civil registration Bill for Private Members&rsquo; time early in the new year which I hope will give us an opportunity to discuss this aspect of the work with which we are concerned.  </P><Col N="239"/>
        <P Just="Left">I also support Senator Frances Fitzgerald&rsquo;s words on the mental health services.  Although we are enhanced by the presence of Senator Bacik, we are diminished by the absence of Senator Henry who, gently but trenchantly, always mentioned mental health reports, the report of the inspectors of mental hospitals and so on.  A young man attempted to get into three outpatient departments and Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Barry said that because of lack of investment these records are almost invariably handwritten and are not transmitted between hospitals.  One hospital, therefore, would not know the man had in desperation tried to get into a couple of others.  Investment is essential in order that hospitals can perform their functions.  The man concerned felt there was a difficulty, his wife had experienced difficulty and was being protected by the police, yet he was released to wander around.  I should not comment too much on the case because I am not even sure that the man has been arrested.  I understand the Garda detained him and he is receiving treatment for conditions that are &ldquo;not physical&rdquo;.  It was said on a radio programme that the Government has not lived up to its investment commitments and is at least &euro;25 million behind what was promised in the programme for Government.  This must be examined.</P>
        <P>In the new session, could we have a discussion on adult literacy?  Highly intelligent people are often abashed and ashamed, and must conceal from their children that they have difficulty reading and writing.  While I do not wish to violate the rules of the House by seeking a vote of sympathy or whatever for the late Christie Hennessy, it would be remiss of me not to mention that remarkable gifted musician who gave so much pleasure.   He was a gentleman, a great entertainer and left school illiterate at 11 years of age yet forged a wonderful career.  We could have a debate on the subject of adult illiteracy as a tribute to the late Christie Hennessy early in the new session.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to join Senator Fitzgerald in warmly congratulating Senator Norris on the handing over of his papers to the National Library yesterday as the occasion was a great tribute to him.  Senator Norris has been associated with the fight for gay rights for many years but he is not a one trick pony and he has made a huge contribution to a range of debates in this House and outside.  The presentation of his papers yesterday is a fine tribute to him and will allow the wider community understand the various issues in which he has been involved.</P>
        <P>Both of the previous speakers raised the issue of mental health and the events of recent days.  I have been involved in a number of debates in this House on the success story known as the Celtic tiger but I feel if a person were to visit this country today and see the newspaper headlines of the <Col N="240"/>past 24 hours he or she would be astonished to be told the country is regarded as a success.  How can a country be described as successful when a single truck overturning at 6 a.m. in the capital city can bring traffic in there, and 20 to 30 miles outside, to a standstill and cause mayhem?  Can a country be described as successful when parents of primary school children, of whom I am one, who spend such a large part of the year raising funds to keep schools operating, are told they must face further increases in expenditure in the form of water charges?</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senators Norris and Fitzgerald on psychiatric services.  Can a country be described as successful when not only Opposition politicians seeking to attack the Government but professionals in the field say that psychiatric services are being dismantled?  It is not a question of services merely being under funded but rather actively dismantled.  At St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, ten of the 24 secure beds have been closed.  Is this indicative of a successful country?</P>
        <P>Can the Leader find a Minister to take some responsibility?  In the case of water charges in schools perhaps the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, could take responsibility rather than blame Europe and local authorities.  Can the Leader find a Minister or member of the Government to facilitate a debate in this House on how the so-called success of this country is measured?  As it is the season of goodwill, when the Leader is responding I ask him to refrain from giving us the weekly lecture on young Senators on the other side of the House getting uppity.  I ask him to address the real issue, which is finding a way to measure the so-called success of our economy.  What should the true measure be?  Surely the three aforementioned issues bring into question the application of the word &ldquo;success&rdquo; to Ireland today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to compliment Senator Norris on the presentation of his papers to the National Library as they reflect the wide range of areas in which the Senator is involved.  I wish him every success in handing over the next batch.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that a debate is needed on the issue of mental health early in the new year.  Examples of mental health issues were given yesterday and they can lead to suicide.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that psychiatric services are the Cinderella of the health service and we must examine how best to improve services in community care.  We must also endeavour to create policies that reflect the society of today.  Mental health problems will not simply disappear and they seem to be increasing, for whatever reason.  I am concerned that this <Col N="241"/>issue is being ignored and I would like it debated in the House.  Adult literacy is a serious issue that must be taken into account in programmes for lifelong learning and schemes such as the vocational training opportunities scheme.  I support the calls for a debate on this issue in the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in asking the Leader for an urgent debate on the mental health sector.  The strategy document, A Vision for Change, was launched amid much fanfare but we have seen no matching commitment by the Government to implement change.</P>
        <P>We have had debates in this House on health and education.  On both occasions, the relevant Ministers were, to say the least, making it up as they went along.  I bring Members&rsquo; attention to the situation in Cork where the chest pain clinic has been closed.  The Minister informed the House there would be no cutbacks in health service but they are there to be seen.  The Minister informed Senators there is plenty of money for the health service.  We are told on the one hand of a &euro;9 million underspend while, on the other, this is contradicted by a Health Service Executive official.  We must have a debate on budgeting in the health service.</P>
        <P>I understand the Joint Committee on House Services is meeting this afternoon to discuss matters relating to the water framework directive.  There must be an urgent debate on the provision of capitation grants to schools and on the issue of whether schools should have to pay for their water supply.  The current situation is incredible.  I received an e-mail recently from a school principal which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Capitation does not cover heating, lighting, insurance, cleaning and maintenance.  The capitation grant does not arrive in schools until January and most principals are seriously embarrassed by the level of debt and are continuously dealing with calls from creditors.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government, as led by the Leader&rsquo;s party, is putting school principals to the pin of their collar.  The last debate we had on education took place before the budget.  Another debate must take place given that the picture has changed entirely since then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate in the new year on local radio?  A new phenomenon is arising whereby one radio station seems determined to take over all other local radio stations throughout the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Newstalk.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>

	<P>There is no chance of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>The ethos of local radio is being attacked.  No single local radio station should be allowed to control other local stations.  One group controlling three or four stations is not in the interest of local radio, nor is it in the best interests of communities which depend on local radio to air local grievances and issues.  I note that programming is being changed by the new owners, especially in the case of my local station.  I call for a debate on this issue as early as possible in the new year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the attention of the House to two decisions in the European court this morning in cases relating to the Schengen Agreement.  Ireland and the United Kingdom opted out of that agreement with the exception of certain provisions, but both have applied to partake in two aspects of the agreement.  One relates to the EU agency, Frontex, which is concerned with co-operation on external borders.  The other is standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents.  These are two areas of activity of the Union that are important in fighting crime.  The European court has ruled that at this stage, neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom can participate in these areas of activity.</P>
        <P>There is a price, therefore, for opting out of treaty provisions of the EU.  We are doing the same in respect of some elements of the Lisbon treaty.  The reality is that we are now handicapped in two important areas of crime-fighting.  I ask that we in the House review our participation in the Schengen Agreement in the new year.  Such a review is called for in light of these judgments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask for a debate on drug driving and request the Leader to address it to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  We have provisions in the Road Traffic Acts for drug testing but I notice that this week, a former drugs officer in Sligo referred to the difficulty of detecting drug driving.  We all know that given the prevalence of the use of drugs, this is a serious danger to safety on the roads.</P>
        <P>Specific legislation, the Road Traffic Act 1994, has provisions that allow for testing, although most garda&iacute; simply do a breath test.  If a garda finds an individual is over the limit on alcohol, he or she is prosecuted for the offence.  Very few go the next step and take samples for drugs.  There is also an infirmity in the legislation in that there is no analysis of the extent to which an individual may have consumed drugs, which creates a problem in the courts for proving that the extent of drugs taken renders the person incapable of driving.</P><Col N="243"/>
        <P>I will not go into the details of this because they are for the debate.  I ask, given the cases which have arisen and that we are now more aware of the extent of the use of drugs, and cocaine in particular, that the Minister address the legislative infirmity and the necessary testing and sampling facilities in the country to combat drug driving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Some weeks ago I called for a debate on car insurance as there is evidence to suggest the authenticity of some of the insurance discs is very questionable.  This has been noticed because some cars with such discs have been involved in accidents.  If that is the number we know about, how many do we not know about?  I will not discuss it now but I ask for an early debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>The murder of a young man from Offaly by a person who is clearly mentally ill is very worrying, bringing into focus the fact that some people in our community suffer from psychiatric illness and need to be treated in a secure environment, sometimes involuntarily.  Senator Norris and others were involved in an Independent motion which discussed inappropriate bed occupancy in psychiatric hospitals, which is another feature we should touch on in debate.</P>
        <P>In many cases, people are using psychiatric hospitals, geriatric hospitals or even accident and emergency departments as hostels, which is clearly an abuse of facilities.  I have scant details on the people who interviewed this man.  If the individual is as ill as it seems, questions must be asked.  Was he interviewed by a consultant or an non-consultant hospital doctor?  I am sure all the details will come out in the fullness of time, when the debate takes place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other colleagues in congratulating Senator Norris on the launch of his archive.  I attended the event yesterday, which was a great occasion.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I wish to raise two issues on which we have held debates before and which I hope may be debated this week.  The first is a motion seeking the release of &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt, which I believe has all-party agreement in the House.  If it could be laid before the House this week we could agree it before Christmas.  &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt has been detained by FARC guerrillas in Colombia for some years and is facing into another long time in detention unless strenuous international efforts are made to secure her release.  It is vital for us to play our part in that by putting this motion together and resolving it before Christmas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I deeply regret that the Climate Protection Bill I introduced in Private Members&rsquo; time on 3 October has not been given time for debate this week.  I have had communications with the Deputy Leader and the Leader of the House about the matter.  It is very disappointing especially for groups such as Friends of the Earth <Col N="244"/>and the Stop Climate Chaos coalition which have been campaigning so hard for legislation on the issue.  It is most disappointing, especially in the wake of the Bali talks, that the Bill cannot be given Government time this week as we were promised.  When will we get Government time to debate that Bill?  Colleagues will remember that 20,000 e-mails supporting the Bill were sent to us by individual members of non-governmental organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Kelly may have got some more.  I do not want to precipitate such a flood of e-mails again.  However, there will be real concern among the groups supporting the Bill.  We can blame the Leader and not me if that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for an urgent debate on our return in January on the issue of future policy on child care.  This issue has been mentioned a few times in the past two months.  The new community child care subvention scheme proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, is intended to ensure reduced fees are charged to disadvantaged parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a U-turn coming?</P>

	<P>Allow Senator Mary White to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know the Minister of State asked the community child care groups for their views on the proposed scheme, which is intended to help disadvantaged parents.  Some 90% of the groups returned their data.  I said last week to Senator Bacik &mdash; n&iacute;l s&iacute; ag &eacute;isteacht liom anois &mdash; that the Minister of State would resolve the matter quickly.  He has announced that he has increased the subvention for social welfare parents from &euro;80 to &euro;100 per week and for family income support parents from &euro;30 to &euro;70.  He has also introduced a new band C covering parents not in receipt of social welfare or family income support, who will get &euro;45 per week.  The Minister of State, like a good politician, did not carve his original policy intentions in stone.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a minimum grant of &euro;20,000 per year which will be of <Col N="245"/>particular benefit to small community child care providers, especially those in rural areas and the islands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be in the Finance Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, and the Taoiseach.  The Minister of State is a good politician.  As I have said before there is no point in simply introducing policies.  They need to be revised if more relevant information becomes available.  He was right to adjudicate on this policy because it was initially intended to benefit disadvantaged parents.  It is my pleasure to inform those who are interested, including Senators Fitzgerald and Bacik&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I join other Senators in passing my good wishes and congratulations to Senator Norris on donating his archive to the National Archives of Ireland.  I am pleased to hear that additions will be made and that it is not complete yet.</P>
        <P>I wish to develop the points raised by our leader, Senator Fitzgerald.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to arrange an early debate yet again on the mental health services and to convey our concerns to the relevant Minister.  This recent incident is a horrendous Christmas tragedy for the family of a fine young man from County Offaly who was engaged to be married and was building his new home.  Our hearts go out to his family, as does the sympathy of the House.</P>
        <P>It is shocking that the man involved had on three occasions sought admission to psychiatric care.  I agree with Senator Glynn that there is a need for an immediate rigorous examination of the procedures to ascertain who he approached for help, why he was released and why he was not admitted. It was disturbing to hear the chief <Col N="246"/>executive officer of the Mental Health Association of Ireland saying on national radio this morning that there is not sufficient funding for the implementation of A Vision for Change and that there is 50% less than the amount required.</P>
        <P>Mental health remains the Cinderella of the health services.  This should not be the case in a civilised society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to my point.  It should also not be the case in a Celtic tiger Ireland.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to raise the following issues with the Minister and to have a debate on a number of specific points.  There has been too dramatic a move from institutionalisation to community care and there is still a need for a sufficient core number of institutional places.  The move has been too dramatic and without sufficient back-up community care.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to have a debate on the question of isolation and loneliness.  Many people suffer from loneliness and isolation and are in great need.  I ask the Leader to find out why there are not enough hospital places available for young people with anorexia nervosa; there are only three available places in the entire country.  That is not enough.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to establish what steps are being taken to ensure the mental health services are in sufficient shape to absorb the tragic consequences of substance abuse which is all too prevalent.  I also ask him to treat this request as an urgent priority and to ask for an instant reaction from the Minister in terms of a response to the House by tomorrow.</P>

	<P>In answer to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s request for debates this week, the Leader of the House will respond to the status of the motion relating to &Iacute;ngrid Betancourt and I will take responsibility for responding to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill on targets for climate change.  Contrary to what is being said elsewhere, in particular by Friends of the Earth in current e-mails, it was not a promise made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but rather a promise made by me as Deputy Leader in this House.  It was a question of awaiting the results of the Bali conference which, while encouraging, have not been what many of us had hoped for.  There was still a hope we could address the issue this week.  I made this promise not fully realising the legislative pressure that would be made on the House this week.  The Leader has said there is a slim possibility of having statements on the Bali conference but it is more likely the House will need to address this issue at the first opportunity in the new year.   I have explained to the Senator the technical difficulty in that Standing Orders do not <Col N="247"/>allow anyone to speak more than once on Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The common theme that emerges in this debate, which echoes the discussions we have had on mental health care, is that the policy is in place but the money is not available to implement it.  Other speakers have made this point in previous debates on child care.  The budget did not provide an increase in funding for child care.  Regarding Senator Mary White&rsquo;s announcements, we have to know where is the money coming from to make this happen, to ensure that another cloth is not being thrown over the eyes of the people who are trying to deliver good child care who will find that later in the year they do not have the money to deliver it.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the delivery of public services.  This issue has been touched on previously in terms of mental health, suicide and other issues.  The Government has made many attempts in the past to compile reports on how we can better fund the delivery of public services.  Under a programme called the expenditure review initiative, an attempt was made in 2002 to examine how money could be freed up to deliver better public services.  That collapsed with only one in five reviews in the programme completed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The successor to that initiative was announced in 2006, namely, the value for money review.  A total of 66 reports were due for publication in December.  Some 40 have not been published and not a single report can identify how additional funding or savings can be made to free up more <Col N="248"/>funding for the delivery of front-line services.  We heard many times in the past, and we heard again in the recent budget, about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to spend taxpayers' money better.  Given that the last two attempts to do this have completely failed, why should we believe the third attempt will be any different?</P>

The reason we have not fully embraced this is because of the common travel area and the adverse effects it could have on travel between the North and the South.  I agree with him that it is time to examine this matter.</P>
        <P>My second point relates to water charges.  It is popular for Members in this House and local authority members to jump on the bandwagon and say there should be a derogation for schools.  I do not believe that should happen.  It may well be the case that resources would be made available to schools by the Department of Education and Science but it is a fact that there is a lot of waste.  There is a disparity between the manner in which schools manage their water supplies.  In some cases of which I am aware, leaks in schools have been allowed to continue during the summer when nobody was there.  A significant wastage of water can occur.  There is no way any of us, including the local authorities, should tolerate this.  It is totally against everything we stand for on conservation.  I am not in favour of that.</P>

I do not know whether it is the responsibility of the Dublin Transport Authority or whoever else but we should ensure some mechanism is in place to deal with these situations rather than face what happened yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White inquired how we should measure economic success.  There are those who say that perhaps it should be by means of GDP.  Others disagree and say that GNP is a better mechanism.  Others would argue that our unemployment rate of 4.6%, which is half that of France and of Germany, is another good measure.  Could I proffer to Senator White another one, the significant inflation in legal fees which, I presume, is a reflection of the economic success of those who are willing to pay them?</P>

        <P>I join with the other Senators in support of the call for a debate on psychiatric services.  I, too, am appalled at the terrible situation of that poor man being mowed down in the prime of his life.  I ask that the psychiatric services would not be treated in such a dismal manner, that funding would not be cut to such an extent and that we would recognise the dignity of people suffering with psychiatric illness and treat them accordingly.  If one takes on the closing down of services and institutions, one should provide community care facilities to help these poor unfortunate people who are suffering from depression.  One in four people will suffer from some form of psychiatric illness in their lifetime, and it is a live issue.  The cut in funding for prevention of suicide seems to <Col N="250"/>have gone unnoticed in the budget.  It is a serious issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the new monopoly which is creeping in to local radio because this runs counter to the rationale which underpinned the setting up of these stations originally.  The idea was to give an independent opportunity to local communities to reflect their talents, ethos and aspirations.  Prior to the advent of these stations, RTE sent an outside broadcasting unit throughout the country, gave communities in each area one week, and provided resources and the training in order to test the waters.  What is happening now is a reversal of what RTE set in train at that time in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
        <P>The same trend is happening with local newspapers.  In my area alone several newspapers have now been acquired by Scottish Radio Holdings.  I believe the same is happening throughout the country.</P>
        <P>If that is happening &mdash; no doubt it is happening by stealth &mdash; it runs counter to the debate in this House seven or eight years ago when we were trying to get away from that monopoly.  The House could serve a purpose by putting down a marker and perhaps asking the appropriate Minister to look at the legality of the matter.  If there are legislative constraints required, they should be brought in at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the comments by numerous Senators today on mental health.  I will not dwell on or repeat them, except in one area.  I was in agreement with Senator Glynn on the issue of the way in which mental health services are being used by people who should probably be using other forms of treatment, for example those who are suffering in some cases from drug abuse.  In areas where I suppose the figures are not as high, and particularly in rural areas, often there is a mix-up of services.  I have seen this directly in a tragic scenario, similar to the one reported today and yesterday, in my constituency in recent months where a person was wrongly sent to a mental health institution.  Tragedy ensued.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
        <P>Detoxification is also an issue.  Sometimes people who are sent to drug treatment clinics must be nine days detoxified before they are admitted to programmes.  There is a question to be asked with regard to the time they must wait before they get treatment.  These people are so vulnerable that it is questionable whether they can stay away from drugs for that length of time.  The crossover between drug treatment and mental health is an area that needs to be addressed urgently because in many cases people are being sent to the wrong place for help.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that RTE returned to its high standard of production with its programme on fuel smuggling.  Some contributors to the programme stated one of the reasons authorities may <Col N="251"/>turn a blind eye towards this smuggling is because it does not involve a loss to taxpayers in the Republic, although it did some years ago.  It was also suggested the reason for turning a blind eye was to facilitate discourse relating to the peace process.  Turning a blind eye is a concern.  Despite the fact there is not a loss to the Exchequer, it is worrying that fuel smuggling continues and is not addressed as it should be.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader give us any update with regard to a debate on tourism, particularly with regard to structures?  We talk about the public service, but we have multiple tourism organisations with multiple HR and IT departments.  I would welcome debate on this in the near future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader provide an update on the debate on gender equality, which I requested at the beginning of this session?  Today&rsquo;s report from the Equality Authority, which demonstrates we have not advanced in the gender equality field, makes worrying reading.  Senator Buttimer said the women of Ireland had spoken out on the issue of child care.  That comment proves the need for debate on the issue of gender equality because child care is not a women&rsquo;s issue, but a children&rsquo;s or parental issue.  We should include issues such as child care, parental and paternity leave and domestic violence in our debate, because until we address these issues women will not return to the workforce, nor will they play a political role.</P>

The debate should focus on the implementation of A Vision for Change.  In its briefing last week, the HSE informed us that it <Col N="252"/>hoped to have a draft implementation plan by the end of December.  It is unacceptable that it is talking about a draft implementation plan two years on from the adoption of A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Can we have some clarification on what happened to the moneys allocated for mental health services in budget 2007?  Comments made this morning by people involved in the area mentioned that moneys allocated to mental health ended up elsewhere.  It is urgent to ensure that moneys allocated in a budget for a specific project are spent on that project.  There is agreement in the House that mental health is a priority issue.  Any moneys allocated to the area should be spent on it.  It is urgent that there should be some accountability to the Seanad and to the Minister for Finance with regard to where the moneys allocated for mental health services in budget 2007 went.</P>

	<P>On many occasions during this session, Senators called for the facilities in the west and south to be opened.  As a result of the important expansion of this worthwhile service, initial screening will be made available to women so that breast cancer can be diagnosed at an early stage.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harney, even if this development is long overdue.  When she came to the House on two occasions earlier in this session, Members argued forcefully for the expansion of the service.</P>
        <P>Many Senators, including Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White, Ormonde and Buttimer, paid tribute to Senator Norris, who has donated 40 boxes of archival material to the National Library.  The Senator has made a huge contribution over the years.  I would like to look through some of the boxes to learn more about how difficult the Senator has found it to get elected to the Seanad, particularly on the Trinity College panel.  I do not mean to trivialise the donation Senator Norris has made, as I have great admiration for him.  I thank him for his great gesture, which will be appreciated by everyone in the country.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Norris, Alex White, Ormonde, Glynn, O&rsquo;Reilly, McFadden, Kelly and Corrigan expressed their shock and horror at the death of a young man in Dublin at the weekend.  As Leader of the House, I wish to send the condolences of the Seanad to the family of the man in question.  He was a near neighbour of the Cathaoirleach, who knew him well.  This dreadful and terrible tragedy should not have happened, <Col N="253"/>and we all wish it had not happened.  Action has to be taken to ensure things like this do not happen again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I served on the former Midland Health Board with the Cathaoirleach for over 18 and a half years.  Senator Glynn was a member of the board for much longer than that.  During that time, huge changes were made to the health care system in the midlands.  There was a change in the attitude to people suffering from mental illness, for example.  We all took part in that process.  I was on the tenders committee for County Westmeath for 18 years.  We acquired many comfortable residences in counties Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly and used them to care for patients in the community, as citizens of the community, with respect.  That system has been an outstanding success 90% of the time.</P>
        <P>I agree with the comments of my near neighbour from County Cavan, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, about the core care that is needed in the mental health area.  The development of such care in the midlands has been an incredible success story.  As Senators Glynn and Corrigan have worked in the mental health profession, they know these problems at first hand.  I respect the views they have expressed to the House today.  We can set time aside for a debate on the matter.  The annual health budget, which is currently &euro;16 billion, is four times greater than it was ten years ago.  When unfortunate tragedies of this nature occur, we have to do whatever we can to assist those working in this field.  When we have an opportunity to discuss this issue in the House, we will need to give the Minister advice.  I assure the House that I will set time aside for such a debate in the early days of the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris passed on his condolences to the family of the late Christie Hennessy, whom I knew well.  I had the honour and privilege of paying tribute to Christie Hennessy on the airwaves.  To say he was a genius would be an understatement.  He came up the hard way before making an immense contribution to the music and entertainment industries.  His biggest hits were &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Forget Your Shovel&rdquo; and &ldquo;All the Lies That You Told Me&rdquo;, which gave Frances Black her first number 1 hit single.  However, the song I most remember from Christie Hennessy&rsquo;s shows was &ldquo;I Am a Star&rdquo;, for which he received a standing ovation and an encore every time he sang it.  The title of that song sums up the man &mdash; he was a star and he will continue to be a star.  It is sad that he died at the young age of 62.  I want to be associated with the tributes which Senator Norris led here today.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer expressed his views about the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  While the Senator is a good colleague and friend, I do not agree with him on this occasion.  He is following in the footsteps of a lifelong friend of most of those of us who have been in the Seanad for a long time, the former Senator Dino Cregan.  He has a very high standard to live <Col N="254"/>up to.  He has the ingredients to do it, but whether he has the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">However, in the spirit of goodwill at Christmas, I must remind all fair-minded Senators that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, came to the House on two occasions and made outstanding contributions.  She did not need anything written down for her.  She had it all at the tips of her fingers and had a hands-on approach.  I have seen politicians on all sides, not just from one political party, whose images are completely different from their personalities when they are at their desks and doing their jobs, whether Minister or Taoiseach.  I have every confidence in Deputy Harney in her portfolio and I wish her well.  Her two outstanding contributions in this House within weeks of each other and under very difficult circumstances were admired by Senators on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and Walsh spoke about school capitation grants and water charges.  I will set aside time for a debate on education in the next session.  Senators Ellis and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for an urgent debate on local radio and the abuses that are occurring at present.  Those of us who fought so long and hard in this House for the legalisation of local radio are extremely disappointed that agencies outside the State will now control the local airwaves.  That was never intended when the Oireachtas enabled the establishment of local radio.  We set it up to provide local content to communities.  The danger is that it will drift even further.  The big advantage of local radio is that it serves local communities.  I will arrange to have this debate in the first or second week after the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and Walsh expressed their views on Ireland and the UK finding themselves outside certain European agreements, and the effect of this in terms of fighting crime.  I will see what the Minister has to say about this and I hope to contact the Senators directly with this information.  Senator Regan also mentioned the portfolio of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the matter of drug use by people driving motor vehicles, whether private or commercial.  There is a difficulty with detection, as we found in our investigation of the insurance industry during the last session.  We may be able to adopt best practice from New Zealand or America, where this difficulty has been overcome.  Perhaps the Senator has some knowledge in this regard.  I have no difficulty in allowing a debate on this issue and I will pass on the views of Senators to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Thirteen Senators met in my office last week to discuss an all-party motion on drug abuse and <Col N="255"/>particularly the serious abuse of cocaine that is going on at present.  This could be highlighted in the contributions of Senators on the motion.  We will allow all Senators to make a contribution on this serious challenge for the Government and for society.  Senators are pushing an open door in this regard.  We will do anything we can to assist in dealing with the challenge of drug abuse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Glynn called for a debate on car insurance.  I will set aside time for this.  There are many abuses occurring in this area.

        <P>On the other matter mentioned by Senator Bacik, which was dealt with by the Deputy Leader, this is a legislative week in the House and always has been.  Legislation must come first.  Senators Mary White, Donohoe, Walsh and McDonald expressed their views on the development of child care policy.  Senator Mary White was strong in her vote of congratulations to the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time to discuss this.  We will probably have many such discussions in the lifetime of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe spoke on the radio yesterday about the delivery of public services and value for money.  Everyone can fully support him in this and agree with the thrust of his argument, which is that we need a better return on taxpayers&rsquo; money in this regard.  This will be debated at the earliest opportunity in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden called for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss health services in the Midlands.  I have no difficulty with this.  I know the Senator will want me to welcome last week&rsquo;s allocation of the dormant account funds from RAPID.  A total of &euro;5 million was allocated.  The Department of Education and Science has announced that St. Joseph&rsquo;s College in Summerhill, in the Senator&rsquo;s home town of Athlone, is to receive a significant allocation to upgrade its existing facilities.

Families also receive child benefit for almost 1.2 million children.</P>
        <P>The 2008 social welfare budget package significantly improves the position of the spouses and partners of contributory pensioners who receive the qualified adult allowance.  It continues to make significant progress towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s target rate for social welfare contributory pensions.  It strengthens the framework of supports for family carers and it ensures that the real value of all social welfare payments is maintained and safeguarded.</P>
        <P>The social welfare budget package ensures that decisive steps are being taken in implementing commitments in the programme for Government, Towards 2016 and the national action plan for social inclusion.</P><Col N="257"/>
        <P>The Government is committed to achieving a pension of at least &euro;300 per week by 2012.  As a first step towards achieving this target, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has increased the contributory State pension by &euro;14 to &euro;223.30 per week.  The non-contributory State pension is being increased by &euro;12 to &euro;212 per week.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that much of the current debate on pensions is focused on the challenges to be met in the decades ahead as our population ages.  These are major issues for our society which must be faced.  However, we must not forget those currently living on pensions and the need to ensure that today&rsquo;s pensioners have a decent income in retirement.  The increases in State pensions over many years have been one of the major achievements of the Government.  Since 2002, the level of the contributory State pension has increased by more than 50% from &euro;147.30 to &euro;223.30 following this budget.  This level of improvement has had a marked impact on the living standards of older people enabling them to face the future with security and dignity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This improvement is shown clearly in the numbers of older people deemed to be at risk of poverty, measured on a relative income basis.  The most up to date figures from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, which were published recently, have confirmed the steady improvements of recent years.  The risk of poverty for older people has fallen from just under 30% in 2003 to 13.6% in 2006.  The fall last year was 6.5 percentage points from the previous year, and that is before the substantial improvements in social welfare pensions in 2007 and 2008 are taken into account.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to increasing the pensioner qualified adult allowance to the level of the State non-contributory pension and to increase the numbers of people eligible for this payment.  A major step forward in this regard was taken in this year&rsquo;s budget and the Bill provides for an increase of &euro;27 per week in the qualified adult rate, which brings it to &euro;200 per week or 94% of the target.  This measure will benefit all qualified adults aged 66 or over, including those on reduced rates of payment who will benefit on a proportionate basis.  This increase will be of particular benefit to women who do not have an entitlement to a contributory pension in their own right because of home responsibilities in the past.</P>
        <P>As a result of these changes in the personal pension rate and the qualified adult rate, more than 42,000 pensioner couples will see their household incomes increase by up to &euro;41 a week or nearly 11 % next year.  The total social welfare support provided for a contributory pensioner couple receiving the fuel allowance will exceed &euro;23,000, an increase of almost &euro;2,200 over their pre-budget position.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has also lengthened the fuel season, in respect of which the fuel allowance of &euro;18 a week is paid, <Col N="258"/>by one week to 30 weeks with effect from April next year.  This measure will be of particular benefit to older people.</P>
        <P>Despite the major improvements for pensioners in the past number of years, the Government has concerns for the long-term future of our pension system.  Given our experience in the past ten years, it is entirely appropriate that we should now review our overall approach in order that we have in place a pension system which is sustainable in the long-term and which will deliver an adequate retirement income to all retired people.</P>
        <P>On 17 October last, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs published a Green Paper on Pensions.  It addresses all of the challenges we face in the pensions areas and puts forward a number of options for tackling them.  The purpose of the Green Paper is not to recommend any particular course of action but rather to set out clearly the current situation and the economic and social implications of the various courses of action that have been suggested.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are aware that progress has been slow in ensuring that those in employment have an occupational or private pension. The National Pensions Review target is to ensure that 70% of those aged over 30 in employment have such a pension but we remain at 62%.  Also, there are concerns that the contributions being made by individuals to their pension schemes may be too low.</P>
        <P>Women continue to have a lower coverage rate than men, although the gap is narrowing, and certain sectors of the economy such as hotels and restaurants, agriculture and retail continue to be extremely difficult to reach.  Despite the progress we are making, there are still upwards of 1 million people who will rely exclusively on social welfare provision for their retirement income unless action is taken.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper on Pensions addresses all of these challenges and puts forward a number of options for tackling them.  We have choices, as set out in the Green Paper, on the way we can address the many issues arising.  At EU level, a number of common approaches are emerging to address the pension challenge, including supporting longer working lives and active ageing; balancing contributions and benefits in an appropriate and socially fair manner; and promoting the affordability and security of funded and private schemes.</P>
        <P>In an Irish context, some or all of these same principles can be applied.  However, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, or the Government, to champion any particular approach at this stage as that would focus the debate in one direction and diminish the consultation process being undertaken.  We must be clear, however, that good pension provision is costly, whether it is done through personal contributions to private pension schemes or through the State by way of PRSI contributions or taxes.</P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>Pensions policy is of major importance and should be of interest to everyone in the country.  Given the growing significance of pensions in coming decades, it is important that we have an informed public discussion and debate on the subject.  The Green Paper is a key part of that process of informed debate.</P>
        <P>It is also not just about our pensions system.  It is about all of us &mdash; our priorities both as individuals and as a society, how long we live, our expectations for retirement and the prospects for our children.  It is of relevance to anyone with an interest in the shape of Irish society in the decades ahead.</P>
        <P>Our ambition must be to create a pensions system that can be financially, economically and socially sustainable in the face of demographic change.  We face a significant challenge and some difficult choices if we are to realise this ambition.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund was a judicious and far-sighted initiative.  The fund, which currently has a market value of some &euro;21 billion, will go some way towards easing future funding concerns.</P>
        <P>The challenges outlined in the Green Paper are not unique to Ireland.  They are at the heart of the debate on pension reform in many countries, particularly where the pace of demographic change is more advanced.  The good news is that because our demographic situation will remain relatively favourable for some time, we have a reasonable but by no means indefinite period to learn from the experiences of other countries and decide how best to address them.</P>
        <P>The consultation process will allow all interested parties the opportunity to contribute towards shaping a framework for addressing the pension&rsquo;s agenda over the longer term.  It will be important that all stakeholders participate constructively in this process as we work towards the achievement of a pensions system that can meet the needs of those currently in retirement and those of future generations.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs looks forward to moving the debate forward in this area during the coming year.</P>
        <P>We all agree that carers play a critical role in ensuring that our older people, people with disabilities and those who are seriously ill can remain in their own homes for as long as possible.  Supporting and recognising carers in society is a priority of the Government and has been since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for the carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  Recent reforms of the scheme allow people in receipt of certain social welfare payments, who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person, to retain their main social welfare payment and receive a half <Col N="260"/>rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The amount paid varies depending on the person&rsquo;s means.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of these improvements there are now more than 34,000 carers in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit.  A total of 42,000 people also received a respite care grant in 2007.  The numbers availing of these schemes continue to increase.  The improvements to the carers' schemes have been made in the context of continued developments in areas such as needs assessment and home care packages, which are also designed to facilitate the care of people in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>One key Government commitment in the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 is the development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the programme for Government.  One recommendation of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs on the position of full-time carers was that such a strategy should be developed.  I am pleased the Department is in a position to act on that recommendation.</P>
        <P>This strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite, health and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be addressed fully.  For that reason, all relevant Departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, is being established to draw up the strategy and to manage the consultation process.  It is expected the strategy will be completed by the summer of 2008.  The development of a national carers' strategy provides an opportunity to build further on the improvements made to the scheme to date and to consider other areas where further progress can be made.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for further improvements to the income supports available to carers which build on the significant improvements made in recent years.  As in previous years, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has increased the rates of payments for carers.  The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance will increase by &euro;14 from January, bringing the rate for carers over 66 years to &euro;232 a week and the payment for carers under 66 years to &euro;214 per week.  The rate of carer&rsquo;s benefit will also increase by &euro;14 to &euro;214.70 per week.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Minister has provided for an increase of &euro;200 in the rate of the respite care grant to &euro;1,700 from June 2008.  This will allow more than 48,000 carers next year to have a well-deserved break from their caring duties and is a positive step towards the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the grant <Col N="261"/>to &euro;3,000 per year over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
        <P>The level of the income disregard for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been increased to &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and to &euro;665 per week for a couple.  A couple can earn up to &euro;60,150 per annum and still receive a reduced rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Similarly, the income threshold for carer&rsquo;s benefit has been increased to &euro;332.50 per week.  These improvements in the income supports available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, together with the improvements in home care and related services in recent years, represent a further realisation of the Government&rsquo;s vision of a co-ordinated approach to services and supports for carers in the community.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to maintaining the value of the lowest social welfare rates in keeping with the commitments in the programme for Government and the national action plan for social inclusion.  The rates of payments to people with disabilities, the unemployed, widows and those parenting alone, to mention some of the groups to benefit, have increased by &euro;12 or approximately 6.5%.  The value of the qualified adult allowance for these payments is also being increased by &euro;8 a week.  As a result of the budget, a couple dependent on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, with no other earnings, will be more than &euro;1,000 better off next year, while a single unemployed person will gain by more than &euro;650.</P>
        <P>These increases are ahead of projected increases in both prices and earnings.  For the fifth year in a row, social welfare rates will have grown more quickly than prices and earnings.  The lowest social welfare rates have increased by 58% since 2004 compared with cumulative price increases of 15% in the same period.  The lowest social welfare rate of payment in 2004 equated to 24% of gross average industrial earnings.  It now stands at 30%.  These are significant achievements which the Government is determined to consolidate and continue to make further progress.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for an increase in the widowed parent grant by &euro;2,000 to &euro;6,000.  This is an important measure for the families concerned giving them a timely financial boost at a time of bereavement and great personal loss which, frequently, is also compounded by economic uncertainty and concerns about the future.</P>
        <P>The social welfare package sets aside nearly &euro;148 million, or &euro;194 million when the early child care supplement is included, to improve the range of supports provided for children.  The budget has provided increases of 6% or above in overall child income support through a combination of child benefit, qualified child increases, back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the early child care supplement.</P><Col N="262"/>
        <P>The impact of these measures is best illustrated by way of an example of a social welfare dependent family with three children, one of them under six years of age, one over six and less than 12 years and another over 12 years of age.  As a result of this year&rsquo;s budget, the combined value of child support payments to that family will increase by &euro;718 in a full year, bringing their total child income support to more than &euro;12,000 next year.  This equates to an income support payment of &euro;77 per child per week and represents an increase of more than 6% in the value of their current payments.  In the case of a social welfare dependent family with four children, one under six years, two over six years and less than 12 years and one over 12 years, the total value of child support payments will increase by &euro;940 in a full year, bringing their total child income support to almost &euro;16,000 next year.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for payment of an additional &euro;2 per week in the qualified child increase, formerly called the child dependant allowance, which is paid to all social welfare recipients with children.  It also provides for increases in the threshold for family income supplement, FIS, by &euro;10 per week for each child which will result in payments increasing by &euro;6 a week per child.</P>
        <P>Research has shown that poverty is likely to be more concentrated in larger families.  The new FIS thresholds, while substantially increasing all payments, concentrate additional resources on larger families.  This improvement continues the re-focusing of thresholds towards larger families, thereby further targeting resources at low-income households.  The change in FIS thresholds, together with the qualified child increase, represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.  These improvements will benefit some 26,500 existing families and entitle a further 2,700 families to the payment.</P>
        <P>Adequate income support, while important, is only part of the solution for people and families living in poverty.  They need a lasting solution to their difficulties and the necessary supports to help them make their way to a more promising future.  That is why activation and participation in employment, education, training and personal development opportunities have become an increasingly important part of the Department&rsquo;s activities.</P>
        <P>To improve the effectiveness of these measures, it has been decided to amalgamate two initiatives run by the Department and to increase significantly the funding provided to them.  The revamped activation and family support programme will have a budget of &euro;6.5 million next year.  It will provide funding for projects run by third parties to assist welfare recipients and members of their families to enhance their employability through education, training and personal development.  It will also provide or co-<Col N="263"/>fund training and development programmes for particularly disadvantaged social welfare customers and their families, including young lone mothers, other parents rearing children without the support of a partner, carers, Travellers and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Provision has been made in the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget for the deployment of an additional 30 facilitators with clerical support staff next year as the first stage in a radical development of activation supports provided by the Department.  This programme, funded under the national development plan, will provide for the individual case management of all social welfare customers of working age who are not progressing into employment or accessing training or employment opportunities.  The approach will be directed specifically towards those who, because of their personal or family circumstances, face particular difficulties in engaging with the labour market.</P>
        <P>The budget provides for other measures which are designed to assist people in the progression from welfare to work.  These include an increase in the upper income threshold for entitlement to one-parent family payment and a reform of the method of assessing earnings for that scheme by disregarding social insurance and other employment related contributions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Sections 2 and 3, together with Schedules 1 and 2, provide for increases in the rates of social welfare payments.  These include an increase of &euro;14 per week for persons in receipt of a State contributory pension and for recipients of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension and deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit who are over 66 years, and for recipients of State pension transition or invalidity pension aged 65 years and over, bringing the weekly payment to &euro;223.30.  Recipients of carer&rsquo;s benefit will also receive an increase of &euro;14 per week bringing their new weekly payment to &euro;214.70.  The Bill provides for an increase of &euro;14 per week for persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance who are over age 66.  An increase of &euro;14 is provided for recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance who are under age 66.  These increases will bring the weekly rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance to &euro;232 for recipients over age 66 and to &euro;214 for those under 66 years of age.</P>
        <P>Provision is made for an increase of &euro;12 in the weekly personal rate of the non-contributory State pension, giving a new rate of &euro;212.  The rate for widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pensions is being increased to &euro;197.80.</P>
        <P>An increase of &euro;12 is also provided in the personal rates of illness benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, injury benefit and health and safety benefit bringing the weekly rate to &euro;197.80.  An increase of &euro;12 per week is provided for in all other social insurance and social assistance payments where the recipient is under age 66 and for recipients of invalidity pension under age 65.  The personal rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, pre-retirement <Col N="264"/>allowance, farm assist and disability allowance are being increased to &euro;197.80.</P>
        <P>An increase of &euro;27 per week is being provided in respect of qualified adults of recipients of invalidity pension, where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.  An increase of &euro;27 per week is also being provided for qualified adults aged 66 years and over where their spouse or partner is receiving a contributory State pension, or is receiving a State transition pension, with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for those on certain reduced rates.</P>
        <P>Recipients of the contributory State pension, and the State transition pension, receive an increase of &euro;9.30 where the qualified adult is under age 66.  The increase in the invalidity pension is &euro;8.60 where the qualified adult is under age 66 and in the case of the non-contributory State pension, the increase is &euro;7.90 where the qualified adult is under age 66.</P>
        <P>An increase of &euro;8 per week is provided for all other qualified adult payments.  The rate payable in respect of a qualified child is being increased by &euro;2 per week to &euro;24 per week.  These increases will take effect from the first week in January 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the weekly income thresholds used to determine entitlement to family income supplement.  The new thresholds range from &euro;490 in the case of a family with one child, to &euro;1,170 in the case of a family with eight or more children.  This measure will take effect from 3 January 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for an increase from &euro;48,800 to &euro;50,700 in the annual earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by employees.  The section further provides for an increase in the amount of weekly earnings below which PRSl is not payable, from &euro;339 to &euro;352.  These provisions come into effect on 1 January 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for an increase in the earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by optional contributors, from &euro;48,800 to &euro;50,700 with effect from I January 2008.  Section 7 provides for a &euro;2,000 increase in the widowed parent grant, bringing it to &euro;6,000.  This increase is effective from budget day, 5 December 2007.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for an increase in the health levy exemption thresholds from &euro;480 per week to &euro;500 per week and from &euro;24,960 per annum to &euro;26,000 per annum.  This measure will take effect from 1 January 2008.</P>
        <P>Pensioners who are paid by electronic methods will receive their increase in full from January 2008.  Increases for recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, illness or maternity benefit, one-parent family payment, family income supplement, farm assist and supplementary welfare allowance will be paid in full from January 2008.  Recipients of certain long-term payments such as pensions, carer&rsquo;s allowance and invalidity pension will receive their increase in mid-February back<Col N="265"/>dated to January along with their new payable order books because of the lead-in time involved in the production of personal payable orders.  Increases for certain other long-term payments, such as State pensions and disability allowance, will be paid by a special once-off payment in mid-February to cover 12 weeks&rsquo; payment to the end of March when new payable order books will be issued.</P>
        <P>This Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports, and focuses the allocation of resources on those most in need.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to welcome the Minister of State to the House and to meet her for the first time, and I thank her for taking the time to deliver an informed speech.  The new budget increases the rates for carers by &euro;14 per week.  There are 161,000 carers saving the State &euro;2.1 billion per annum.  In return for this service the budget increase amounts to just over &euro;2 million although they save the State ten times this amount annually. </P>
        <P>The 2006 census recognised that there are 5,433 carers between the ages of 15 and 19 in the State.  Budget 2008 has failed to provide anything for these young people.  Adolescence is a time when teenagers need as much support as possible for their education, personal development, socialising and holidays.  Take Bridget, for example, who sat her leaving certificate last summer and has decided to defer her college place to selflessly dedicate her teenage years to providing full-time care for her 84 year old grandfather.  She asked me to urge the Government to take the issue of young carers to heart and to implement the commitment made in the national agreement, Towards 2016, to research the needs of young carers in Ireland and provide a programme for specific supports.  By acting as carers, these young people are experiencing role reversal.</P>
        <P>In Towards 2016 the Government promised to deliver a national carers&rsquo; strategy by the end of 2007.  The Minister of State said this has been pushed back to next summer.  I hope it will be not be any later than that and I look forward to seeing it.</P>
        <P>The increase of &euro;12 in the non-contributory State pension and &euro;14 in the contributory pension reflect increases of 6% and 6.7% respectively.  Inflation, however, is running at 5%, which cancels out any benefit from the budget.  In its programme the Government promised to increase the basic State pension by 50% by 2012.  The small increase in pensions, however will make it difficult for the Government to reach the proposed targets.  Adequate pension provision has now slipped down the list of Government priorities.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Government has failed to increase fuel allowance despite an increase in the price of oil and gas.  Many elderly people will not <Col N="266"/>be able to meet their fuel costs.  Instead, that must come out of their pension, and an extra week per annum is not a worthwhile increase.</P>
        <P>The level of child poverty in Ireland is one of the worst in the European Union.  One in nine children lives in consistent poverty here.  The Government is already behind its schedule to eliminate consistent child poverty by 2007.  Under the national anti-poverty strategy, the Government promised to reduce the number of children in consistent poverty to below 2%.  This target has been postponed until 2012.  It is now anticipated that it will be at least 2016 before these targets have been met, and even that target date is hopeful.  Budget 2008 provided the Government with the opportunity to reduce child poverty but it has failed to deliver.   Does the Government not have a moral and social obligation to reduce and eradicate child poverty, rather than stand idly by as the nation&rsquo;s children freeze and starve on the streets this Christmas?  It is important to note that children are not considered poor in their own right but that they are poor as part of a family.  Almost a third of all households at risk of poverty today are headed by a person with a job.  These families are the working poor; despite having at least one partner in full-time employment they live below the poverty line.  The only effective way to combat child poverty levels is to target these families.  If our constitution recognises the family as the &ldquo;natural primary and fundamental unit group of society&rdquo;,  why is this Government ignoring their most basic needs?  The Government should be protecting these families rather than exposing them to the harsh reality of the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>More than half of all households at risk of poverty are headed by people in the labour force and such low-income families do not pay income tax or PRSI.  This means they do not benefit from changes in the budget and the most effective way to help low-income families is to make tax credits refundable.  At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs last week, Fr. Sean Healy of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, called for this measure to be introduced. It would allow low-income families feel the full benefit of their tax credits.</P>
        <P>I now wish to address the issue of habitual residency as the number of children that are being deprived of the most basic and fundamental necessities, such as food, clothing, school books and medicine, is approximated to be at least 3,000.  Parents in these cases cannot afford to purchase necessities for their children primarily because they do not qualify for child benefit under the habitual residency condition.</P>
        <P>Existing Government policy excludes the children of those living in direct provision from receipt of child benefit.  This is grossly unfair to children, directly contradicts the Government&rsquo;s policy towards the reduction of child poverty and is also in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland <Col N="267"/>ratified in 1992.  This convention promises to protect the rights of all children within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, including any prejudice based on their parents&rsquo; status.  Furthermore, article 26 of the convention states that every child has a right to benefit from social security and this should be without condition.  Children who do not qualify for child benefit under habitual residency are expected to survive on &euro;9.60 per week.  This, according to Robin Hannan, chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council, is not only pushing people into poverty and isolation, but also has been extremely dehumanising and has caused a lot of stress and, in many cases, depression.</P>
        <P>It is extremely depressing, considering that it has been estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of paying child benefit to all children, including those currently outside the entitlement, would be less that &euro;6 million euros.  Moreover, it is disappointing that the Government did not use budget 2008 to restore child benefit as a universal payment.  The refusal to grant this payment is contrary to international law and the Government&rsquo;s own policies on child poverty.</P>
        <P>Homelessness is an issue that greatly concerns me and one need only walk down Molesworth Street or Dawson Street to witness it.  It has become one of the biggest problems facing this society and is a recurring theme in debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which we too often ignore.</P>
        <P>Recently, there have been stories that people are being forced to sleep in wheelie bins in cities around the country.  This was brought to media attention only through the tragic death of Kevin Fitzpatrick, whose body was found in a refuse recycling centre in Limerick after he tumbled into a compact lorry during collection and was crushed.  This is only one story and there are thousands of other harrowing accounts of what homeless people have had to experience.</P>
        <P>Among a host of others, I wish to acknowledge the work of charities such as the Simon Community and Focus Ireland in fighting homelessness.  However, without sustained spending on programmes to tackle homelessness, as well as changes in rental supplements, there is a strong possibility that the number of homeless people will increase.</P>
        <P>I welcome the increased allocation for social housing provision and feel it will go some way towards helping those suffering and in need of a home.  However, Focus Ireland maintains that the Government has failed to live up to previous ambitions outlined by the Taoiseach earlier this year at the launch of the Government&rsquo;s National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  He referred to an ambitious agenda for social change that guarantees to make a significant impact on poverty reduction for the future.</P>
        <P>We are discussing some of the most vulnerable people in our society and it must be pointed out <Col N="268"/>that they would not be homeless if they could access the necessary resources.  Many have other problems beyond homelessness, including drug and alcohol problems, which continue to contribute to the situation, and I urge that these also be addressed.</P>
        <P>The last area I will address is the issue of lone-parent families as they still cannot compete in the world today.  There are huge pressures and strains on parents and it is estimated that the number of lone-parent families in the State has increased from 153,000 in 2002 to 189,000 in 2006.  This represents a 23% increase and lone-parent families now account for 18% of all families living in the State.  There has been a 41% increase in the number of lone-parent families with children under 18 years of age.  It is important to note that this number is continuing to rise.</P>
        <P>It is a shame that I must now conclude because I have more to say but I hope to have another opportunity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, to the House and thank her for discussing the Bill in detail.  I also commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Martin Cullen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, on the skills they used to frame this Bill.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the various support agencies that exist because they played a huge part in the composition of this Bill.  The Minister met 30 groups that made invaluable submissions and many of these influenced the framing of the Bill.  As the last speaker mentioned, Fr. Sean Healy of CORI made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs last week.  He made the point that he had some reservations about aspects of the Bill but, in general, was quite satisfied.</P>
        <P>There are many other such organisations including Combat Poverty and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which plays a significant role in providing information and advice to social welfare recipients.  In my area, Coolock, Colm Daly is in charge of free legal aid and we also have the Northside Centre for the Unemployed.  All of these groups provide important services for the community and for social welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>We may ask for evidence that the Government prioritises the less well-off in society.  This Government has always given priority in budgets to social welfare recipients, especially the elderly.  They built this great nation when times were bad and many of their children were forced to emigrate to America, Britain and elsewhere.  They sent back money earned building tunnels and motorways in England to support those at home.  Thankfully that situation no longer prevails and emigrants have returned to an Ireland that some argue is the second richest country in the world.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>The Minister has shown skill in framing this Bill.  It is great that we are in a position to provide increases for social welfare recipients.  I recall a previous Government that reduced social welfare payments and another which granted an increase of only &pound;1.75.  I do not say this to make a political point but simply to make the comparison between then and now.</P>
        <P>Social welfare expenditure has increased substantially from &euro;5.7 billion in 1997 to &euro;17 billion in 2008.  Almost half of all additional current Government spending announced in the budget for 2008 will go to social welfare.  Welfare payments directly benefit 1.5 million people weekly.  There is a &euro;14 increase in the contributory State pension and the carer&rsquo;s allowance, while all other personal rates are increased by &euro;12 per week.  Payments to qualified adults in respect of those in receipt of a contributory State pension are increased by up to &euro;27 per week.</P>
        <P>The level of the contributory State pension has increased by more than 50% since 2002, from &euro;147.30 to &euro;233.30.  This is a significant and warranted increase.  The real value of all payments has increased.  Senator McFadden referred to the homeless.  I congratulate the Homeless Agency on the tremendous work it has done since its establishment in greatly reducing the numbers of homeless.  The Senator also referred to child poverty.  There has been a &euro;194 million increase in the provision for child income support services, including the early child care supplement.  I pay tribute to Senator Mary White who, since becoming a Member of this House, has played a major role in drawing attention to this issue through her various submissions on child care.  Her heart is in the right place on this issue and she continues to make a contribution.</P>
        <P>The lower and higher rates of child benefit are increased to &euro;166 and &euro;203 per month, respectively, benefitting 1.2 million children.  The 2008 budget provides improvements in schemes aimed at families with children, including increases in the threshold for family income supplement of &euro;10 per week for each child, resulting in payments increasing by &euro;6 per week per child.  Improvements in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance are welcome, as is the enhanced funding for the school meals programme and the increase in the income threshold for entitlement to one-parent family benefit.</P>
        <P>Tackling the poverty that unfortunately exists in some sections of society must be given priority.  The level of increases provided in the 2008 budget, in conjunction with the increases provided in the period from 1997, demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to safeguard and enhance the living standards of the most vulnerable in society.  The Government is tackling poverty in a co-ordinated and joined-up way to ensure better results both for the people supported and in terms of the substantial resources allocated.  The new national action plan for social inclusion incorporates a range of <Col N="270"/>actions on employment, social welfare, education, health, housing and disability.</P>
        <P>Personal income tax changes announced in the budget mean workers on the minimum wage pay no income tax, while those on the average industrial wage will pay no tax at the higher rate.  The PRSI employee entry point is increased to &euro;352 per week and the health levy threshold entry point is increased from &euro;480 to &euro;500 per week.  Overall, the poorest one third of the population will receive an income boost of 1% to 1.5% from the 2008 budget as most welfare payment rates have increased slightly faster than the expected rate of wage growth.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has informed me that he continually considers submissions on the various aspects of the social welfare system.  He is a person, along with the Minister for Finance, who has his ear to the ground.  It is important we have an ongoing interaction with all the agencies working with vulnerable members of society.  A Minister who is connected to the issues in the manner the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has shown himself to be will be able to keep a good handle on the needs of those who are less well off than most of us.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the role played by the departmental officials in bringing forward this Bill.  I do not say this from the perspective of a former civil servant but merely to emphasise the part they play in devising legislation and framing budgets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to the House and congratulate her on her appointment.  In this season of goodwill, I do not wish to be the person to spoil the party and rain on the parade of Members opposite, of whom I am fond.  However, this Bill calls to mind Ebenezer Scrooge and Bad Santa.  We were promised before the general election that there would be substantial increases in social welfare.  That has not been the case.  We hear instead words such as &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; and we are reminded of the change in the budget outlook from surplus to deficit.  That is the backdrop to this Bill.</P>
        <P>In her fine contribution, the Minister of State does not take cognisance of the reality that there is a growing divide in society.  This growing divide is not between rich and poor but between the poor and those in the middle.  The evidence of this is everywhere.  Any social welfare increases are welcome but they must be put in perspective.  Energy and food costs are rising consistently, as are the costs of education and many other services.  With inflation running at 5%, people are struggling.  The reality for many is that these increases are gone before they even come.  Child poverty remains a cause for serious concern.  One in nine children lives in consistent poverty and one third of children are at risk of poverty.  With 21% of the overall population at risk of poverty, Ireland has the third highest rate in Europe.  An <Col N="271"/>analysis of the budget shows it has failed to tackle child poverty.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the need for a national carer&rsquo;s strategy and there has been much talk from the Government about recognising carers.  Members were informed that the carer&rsquo;s strategy would be in place by the end of this year but there is no evidence of that.  Will the Minister of State clarify this?  Carers make a valuable contribution to society.  There must be a blueprint and plan to ensure the provision of services, supports and entitlements is as efficient as possible.  I will read from a letter I received this week from a constituent who is a full-time carer.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am a full-time carer with my own disability caring for my 90-year-old disabled dad, a stroke sufferer since August 2000.  On Saturday morning I had to call a doctor at 2 a.m. for Dad, who was greatly agitated and had a high temperature.  Fearing pneumonia, which dad had in August, I was afraid for a relapse.  Dad was admitted to CUH at approximately 3 a.m. to 3.30 a.m. and was put on a trolley.  I stayed with him until 7.30 a.m. and when I left, he was agitated, frightened and very distressed.  Dad finally got a bed at 3 p.m., after 12 hours on the trolley.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Despite the assertion by Government that it can be a pleasurable experience, it was not so.  After ten years of the so called Celtic tiger, why is this so?  I have spent almost 21 years caring firstly for my late mother, who often had to spend 12 to 14 hours on a trolley ten years ago, and nothing has changed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The letter concludes:</P>
        <P LI="1">Without carers the health system would collapse.  Please do not patronise me by saying that the system will improve, that the proposed and aspirational centres of excellence will change things.  Until you replace the 5,000 hospital beds closed down in the bad old days, the situation will not improve.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That letter was from a constituent and carer concerned about quality.</P>
        <P>Fuel prices have risen but we have received a minimal increase in the fuel allowance.  Some people in Cork and many other parts of the country are opening doors wearing coats, scarves, hats and gloves because they are afraid to put on heating.  A rise of 62 cent a week is not the most luxurious increase.  Come the end of spring, St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations will have received hundreds of calls regarding heating and energy bills.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden mentioned pension increases of between 6% and 6.7%, with inflation at 5%.  It is not a great increase.  I look forward t the comments of Senator Boyle and others in the Green Party, who when in Opposition last year spoke on the pension increases introduced then.</P>

	<P>Will the Government commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government be met, given the modest increases mentioned today?  Will the Minister of State guarantee this commitment or will there be another roll-back of Government policy?</P>
        <P>Why does the St. Vincent de Paul state it is very concerned about the modest increases in the adult social welfare rate?  Welfare payments will fall below 30% of the average industrial wage.  I wonder do people, particularly those in Government, keep forgetting the cost of food, rent and education has increased significantly, yet this has not been mirrored in this Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that my time is nearly up, I will consider the matter of pensions.  I welcome the Green Paper input but there has been ten years of Government inactivity on the issue.  The Minister of State rightly stated in her speech that women are falling behind and I appeal to her to give that issue priority.  Women who worked at a certain time are now being left behind with regard to social welfare payments and we must address that imbalance.</P>
        <P>It is important that we remember the most vulnerable in society at this time of the year.  I appeal to those listening to or reading this debate to visit people regularly at Christmas and be particularly cognisant that those who are lonely and vulnerable need help from all of us.</P>
        <P>This Social Welfare Bill has done very little to tackle the poverty in this country.  I concur with Senator McFadden&rsquo;s remarks and I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me the time to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am especially grateful to be able to respond so soon to Senator Buttimer, who seems very anxious to hear what I have to say in this debate.  The Social Welfare Bill builds on the announcements made in the budget, and Senator Buttimer and others are correct in that I have had the opportunity for the past five years of being an Opposition spokesman trying to dissect proposals and make better ones.</P>
        <P>This has never been a particularly easy job but some budgets, such as those of 2002 and 2003, were occasions when arguments on the Opposition side could be made very easily.  I have remarked in previous contributions that the Combat Poverty Agency has done a number of analy<Col N="273"/>ses of budgets since 1997.  They have outlined that the first six budgets were socially regressive and the seventh was neutral.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>This year&rsquo;s budget is regressive, according to CORI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The four budgets introduced by this Minister for Finance have started to address this.  Each one has been more balanced to the more needy in our society, and that has not always been the case.  Given the budgetary choices available, I am glad this budget has erred on that side of the social equation as well.</P>
        <P>The increases granted are the maximum which could have been sanctioned given the existing economic circumstances.  They have been given in a climate where I have been glad that promises in the programme for Government on tax cuts have not been met.  I would always look for social welfare payments to be made before tax cuts in any case.  The Minister for Finance has addressed that reality and the increases of &euro;14 and &euro;12, under current circumstances, are relatively good.</P>
        <P>They do not address the total needs of people in our society and there are still too many people living on an edge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Senator has said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with regard to proper wealth distribution in our society.  I have had many arguments in the past regarding the definition of poverty.  Although Government policy is that we should use the measurement of consistent poverty, the concept of poverty is relative.  We are a relatively rich society but the extremes of wealth and those without in our society is still unacceptable.  We should always aim to have policies to put that balance into a proper perspective.</P>
        <P>We are doing that.  A number of choices were made in this year&rsquo;s budget and are being followed through with this Social Welfare Bill.  They address certain sections of society and how their needs should be addressed.  I am especially happy at the move in adult dependant allowances making as much progress as it has.  Those who are most discriminated against in our social welfare code are women, as a result of this distinction.</P>
        <P>By choice or economic necessity, sometimes underlined by legislation, women have at times been forced to stay in the family home and contribute their working abilities that way rather than having the choice to work in the general economy.  It is only a generation ago when we were forcing people out of the Civil Service and the banks were forcing people out of their employment in order to conform with some kind of social etiquette which dictated that women should not be economically involved.  As a result, people&rsquo;s social welfare and pension entitlements have been affected, and it is only now we are beginning to address that imbalance.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>There are other areas, particularly relating to children, which are being considered more kindly.  Last year&rsquo;s movement on child development allowances was extended again this year.  Looking at how such payments can be brought together with similar payments bodes well to how we deal with the role of children, in particular, with social welfare.  The difficulty in the past has been that the debate has solely been structured on child care elements, but this may have been out of necessity.  This has included the child benefit and supplementary child care payment.</P>
        <P>If we are to properly tackle the key issue of poverty among children it must be through particular payments such as child development allowances and the role of family income supplement.  I would go further and I know I am going beyond the scope of Government policy in this regard.  I believe that only by considering the taxation and social welfare systems and introducing the concept of refundable tax credits can we fully address most of the poverty traps that exist.  We need to be more proactive in this area because while we have not rewarded those with the most means in society by way of tax cuts and we have rewarded those who are dependent on the State in terms of social welfare, those who are neutral in this budget are of necessity, because we have no means and we have chosen to have no means, those largely on low incomes.</P>
        <P>There have been some changes in family income supplement and other supplementary payments.  However, the sector of society that needs most direction and assistance in terms of income maintenance and improvement is the working poor, as they have been described, people who are in employment but not earning the type of remuneration that allows them to advance either individually or in terms of their families.  I would like to see more attention paid to this sector of the population in coming years.</P>
        <P>People have been doing their maths on the pension increases and by dividing the difference between &euro;300 and &euro;208 by five years have suggested that &euro;14 is somehow a decrease in what had been promised.  However, people tend to forget that in the intervening years of the term of the Government there will be economic growth.  There will be a rise in inflation, regardless of how large that might be.  The likelihood is that the increases from here on will not be &euro;18 every year but some variant of it, maybe &euro;14 this year, &euro;16 next year and perhaps &euro;22 in the fifth year.  The target will be reached.  It is a commitment of Government and I am confident it can be reached.</P>
        <P>In the wider sense of where we are on the question of pensions, the publication of the Green Paper shows the policy direction we should be following.  We will have the benefit of wider debate in the next year because the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has promised the publication of a White Paper after the completion of a consultation process that will be completed in <Col N="275"/>June and July of next year.  Once we have that information we can not only review the State pension and meet that target, but we can also consider the more important issue of how everyone in a rapidly ageing society can look forward to a lifetime of security by ensuring access to pensions for all is supported through effective Government policies.  I am confident that can and will be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I wish to take up some points already mentioned by my colleagues in the House.  The increase in child allowance to &euro;24 per week will not help.  There are 96,000 children under 14 living in consistent poverty, that is in a low income household that is unable to afford heat, clothing, substantial meals or other key basic necessities.  Child poverty is increasing.  Government policy in this area is based on outdated research, and perhaps the whole area is over-researched.  What policy benefit has it had?  Has it stopped parents taking up employment and if so, where is the proof?  The reality is one in nine children live in consistent poverty, which is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>While I am not suggesting that income support is the only solution to the problem, it is one of the principal ones.  Welfare improvements for pensioners in recent budgets have shown what can happen when income maintenance measures are directed at specific groups.  We should now show the same focus on children.  The rate of increase in child benefit in respect of the first two children is less than the current rate of inflation.  The improvements on the back to school clothing and footwear allowance were paltry.  It shows a complete disregard for the costs faced by low-income families.  Even within available resources, it would have been possible to match the qualifying criteria to those of family income supplement.</P>
        <P>The issue of paternity benefit was not mentioned in the Minister&rsquo;s Budget Statement.  I understand a working group to examine the issue has not yet been established.  Like so many promises it seems that nothing will come of this proposal.</P>
        <P>The standard rating of some tax credits could have been managed under the old system.  The Government has basically changed the method of calculating income tax rather than changing the calculation itself.  Without applying tax credits on a refundable basis, the move to tax credits has been largely meaningless.  Without a refundable tax credit system, people outside the tax net, typically those on low wages, in part-time work, in seasonal work or term-time work, lose out on every euro in tax relief available to those inside the tax net.</P>
        <P>PRSI tax credits are not the only tax elements of the budget that deserve our attention.  A detailed report on the Social Insurance Fund clearly showed that the surplus was running out, and the promises of &euro;645 million worth of cuts in <Col N="276"/>PRSI rates and up to &euro;2 billion worth of spending on contributory pensions could not be kept.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 represented a missed opportunity on supplementary pensions.  The issue was not mentioned once in the Budget Statement, indicating an alarming lack of urgency.  The Government should have indicated clearly in the budget that from next year, the existing pension tax relief system would end and be replaced with whatever is recommended in the Green Paper.  If this really is a budget that is concerned with securing our future, it is astonishing that paying for it, in terms of pension provision, does not deserve a mention.</P>
        <P>Social welfare rates have generally been increased by &euro;12, which perhaps unsurprisingly is almost half of the amount by which they increased in election year.  I cannot agree with the Government or the social partners that benchmarking the lowest social welfare rates to 30% of gross average industrial earnings is sufficient.  To do that is to suggest that &euro;197.80 is enough to live on for a person who is single, suffers from a disability or is otherwise out of the workforce.  In an Ireland with grocery inflation at 4.4%, fuel costs rising at a rate of 17%, and the average electricity bill approximately &euro;150, &euro;197.80 is not enough.  I would not be able to live on that amount.</P>
        <P>I welcome the increase in State pensions.  It is a most important issue and I acknowledge this good increase.  However, the increase in pensions is considerably less than expected.  If it was to address the pleas from those representing older people, the Government should have front-loaded the promised rate increase.  Even if the increase was to be spread evenly across the five years, it should have been &euro;18.14 despite what Senator Boyle said.  Again there is a shortfall in this regard.</P>
        <P>For the 14th consecutive year the living alone allowance has not been increased.  Traditionally pitched at approximately 7% of the maximum State pension, it is now at less than half of that.  If it had have kept pace, the weekly payment would now be about &euro;15.50, or approximately double the current payment of &euro;7.70.  Claimants are effectively losing out on an additional &euro;7.70 per week as a result.  Almost 160,000 people receive the living alone allowance.  Their costs are substantially higher than for couples because the same heating, maintenance and electricity bills need to be met out of one income instead of two.</P>
        <P>In the programme for government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party promised to award the over 80s allowance to pensioner spouses.  The cost of this provision would have been less than &euro;3 million.  However, this has not happened.  The lack of progress on supports for lone parents is equally disappointing.  The recent EU SILC statistics showed that one in three households in consistent poverty were lone parent households and that the rate of poverty among this group is rising.  The evidence I witness in my clinics would support that.  I am getting constant calls from people <Col N="277"/>especially at this time of year when there are competing demands and parents are being bombarded by advertising, etc., and are finding it very difficult to meet their needs and to meet the continuing costs of child care.  Last year I was mayor of Clonmel, which had a mayor&rsquo;s fund.  Local businesses contributed and fundraising events were held to help people at Christmas time.  The fund was oversubscribed and we were unable to help 425 people.  We tried to work with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  There is genuine poverty.</P>
        <P>Members of lone parent families have the highest deprivation levels at 64.7%.  Almost 41% of lone parent households have experienced problems with debt.  I would like to see some activation measures for lone parents but I would also like to see key support services put in place so that it is actually feasible for lone parents to leave welfare.  It would be good to see an end to the rule on cohabitation as it makes no sense for the State to be actively encouraging parents to liveapart.  This is a serious issue.</P>
        <P>The situation of carers is only very marginally improved by this budget and they are still waiting for the great leap forward.  A total of approximately 29 million hours per week are worked by carers.  The Government has already reneged on a commitment to publish a national carer&rsquo;s strategy by the end of this year.  I ask the Minister of State to inform the House on this commitment.</P>
        <P>The recent figures produced by the CSO highlighted a number of issues in relation to carers and these issues are not being addressed by income maintenance policies or by services.  The census recorded 161,000 carers of whom fewer than 42,000 currently receive a payment from the Department.  Likewise, while 50,000 carers work over 29 hours and 67,500 work over 15 hours per week, only 21% of all carers are receiving a weekly payment.  More than half of all carers indicated their principal economic status was as being at work, suggesting that none of these would be entitled to a weekly payment under current rules.  I empathise with Senator McFadden&rsquo;s story about her friend as I can identify similar situations.</P>
        <P>Under the current rules, carers who care for two people continue to be discriminated against.  The means test for back to school allowance counts a carer&rsquo;s allowance as part of the qualifying material, whereas family income supplement does not count in the same calculation.  People who move to carer&rsquo;s allowance are not awarded credits on that allowance if they had not been paying credits for the two years previous to their claim.  This deprives carers of credits which mainly affect them in the calculation of their pension.</P>
        <P>I await the response of the Minister of State to the issues raised today.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill and I thank the Minister of State for her attention.</P>

I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Martin Cullen, for securing a social welfare budget of almost &euro;17 billion for 2008 and for receiving almost half of the extra &euro;1.7 billion that has been made available since the publication of the pre-budget Estimates.</P>
        <P>Overall, 31% of the country&rsquo;s gross current expenditure in 2008 will be accounted for by social welfare spending and this is a measure of the level of priority the Government attaches to this area.  Ireland has an excellent social welfare system that guarantees a minimum level of income and a basic standard of living for every citizen in the State.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs who provide an outstanding service to public representatives and to the public.  There are fine information services available to the public, in particular the outstanding website, information leaflets, telephone lines and citizens advice centres around the country.</P>
        <P>I often find that it becomes our task as politicians to inform people of their social welfare entitlements because many members of the public do not know their full entitlements and need information to allow them apply and benefit from schemes.  In this regard I welcome the extra allocation of &euro;1.8 million in the 2008 budget to the Citizens Information Board.  This will allow for the enhanced availability of resources and information services in the year ahead.</P>
        <P>We have a duty to ensure a decent quality of life for elderly citizens.  I welcome the increase in the contributory and non-contributory State pension.  Elderly people who have made enormous sacrifices in more difficult economic circumstances, must be taken care of.  Many of them worked abroad for long periods and have returned home for their retirement.  It is important they are provided with a level of income that allows them to live out their days in dignity and with a degree of self-respect.</P>
        <P>I welcome the progress made towards the commitment to a State pension of &euro;300, at a minimum, by 2012.  I also acknowledge the improvements in recent years in the household benefits package, electricity, fuel and telephone allowances and the provision of free television licences and the lengthening of the period for the payment of the fuel allowance.  These measures take some pressure off older people.  It is interesting to note the recently published findings of the EU survey on income and living conditions which confirm that the rate of a risk of poverty for older people has fallen from just under 30% in 2003 to 13.6% in 2006.  While it might seem cold and impersonal to speak in statistical terms about poverty, it is <Col N="279"/>important to benchmark the progress being made. It is necessary to have an independent analysis of our efforts to address poverty among older people.</P>
        <P>The Bill is to be welcomed for providing an increase of &euro;27 per week in the qualified adult rate, which brings the payment to such persons to &euro;200 per week.  This represents 94% of the target figure which it is hoped will be achieved in full next year.  The term, &ldquo;Qualified adult rate&rdquo; should be abolished as it is perceived as being anti-woman.  An individualisation of the pensions system should be implemented so that all adults are afforded a full independent pension provision in their own right.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the progress in adequately recognising and rewarding the work of the thousands of carers throughout the State.  Their sacrifice and dedication ensures that their loved ones can remain in their own homes.  Their work is done out of love and we must ensure they are supported in every way.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment to improve their lot further by way of the carer&rsquo;s strategy contained in the programme for Government.  I refer to issues such as access to respite and education and training which it is hoped will be contained in the report which is due to be published by next summer.  We must drive on with this issue because carers are waiting for progress and I note the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieve it.</P>
        <P>The weekly income disregard for carers is increased in the Bill by &euro;12.50 per week, or &euro;25 for a couple, to &euro;665. It is important to make the public aware that a couple can now earn more than &euro;34,500 per annum and still qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance under the means test.  Several people have told me they were unsure whether they would qualify for the allowance. In many cases, however, their income is such that it meets the qualification criteria.</P>
        <P>We must continue to highlight the improvements in the income thresholds and disregards.  One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, is the development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy.  I welcome the progress in this regard and look forward to its expected completion next summer.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the greater emphasis being placed by the Department on encouraging and facilitating people to move away from dependence on welfare towards participation in the workforce.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of a revamped family support programme with a budget of &euro;6.5 million in 2008 is a significant initiative.  This will provide funding for projects run by third parties to assist welfare recipients and family members to enhance their chances of employment through education, training and per<Col N="280"/>sonal development.  The Minister has also provided for the deployment of an additional 30 facilitators with clerical support staff to further the work in this area.</P>
        <P>These programmes will complement the schemes already in place, including the back to education and back to work allowances.  There is a role for everybody in the workforce.  People of working age who are physically capable of work should be required to make some practical contribution to their local community.  This will afford immense benefits for themselves in terms of self-esteem and will also benefit their communities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the improvements in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and the increase in the widowed parent grant from &euro;2,000 to &euro;6,000.  This is an overdue improvement for which I commend the Minister.</P>
        <P>I have memories of other budgets, under other Governments, where benefits to social welfare recipients were less than generous and often unsatisfactory.  Since Fianna F&aacute;il entered Government in 1997, it has introduced significant incremental changes and benefits for those who need them most.</P>
        <P>Throughout the recent period of unprecedented growth in the economy, social welfare payments and the associated thresholds and entitlements have increased on an annual basis.  I cannot claim that this will always be the case.  We live in a global economy and this will dictate our future growth.  In the current economic circumstances, the substantial rate of increase of recent years has to slow down and this has been recognised in the budget.  I commend the Minister for the continued progress on this matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; m&eacute; iontach bu&iacute;och go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  When debating this Bill there are important figures we must keep in mind.  Some 290,000 people are living in consistent poverty in this State, many of them children.  Some 770,000 people are at risk of poverty, many of them also children.  Two weeks ago the Government had the opportunity to make decisive progress towards meeting the national target of reducing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012 and to eliminate it completely by 2016.  However, it failed to take it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In the lead-up to the budget and this Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in called for an overhaul of the social welfare system.  We urged that the many anomalies that cause difficulties for people, which prevent them from returning to work from welfare and prevent them from even applying for welfare, would be addressed.  We also called for new criteria for benchmarking of welfare rates so that they would reflect the current expense of living in this State.  We sought a simplification of the application forms used for social welfare purposes.  For example, the 12-page application form for family income supplement should be discontinued.  We suggested that a flagging system should be put in place, perhaps <Col N="281"/>through the taxation system, to advise persons of their welfare rights.  We also sought the introduction of steps to ensure a smooth transition from welfare to work by, for example, not raising income thresholds for rent allowance supplement, which allows an individual to earn very little before they lose their ability to pay rent and potentially their home.</P>
        <P>We called for an end to the qualified adult status as a method of payment, as it is both hugely underpaid and discriminatory.  We also called for the system of activation to be overhauled.  It does not make sense to pay a jobseeker a benefit that reflects nothing of what he or she earned before losing his or her job, then shunting him or her onto a F&Aacute;S course after three months.  Although they were supported widely by anti-poverty and social groups, none of our proposals were accepted.  Instead, we had the usual drip-drip of paltry increases for our most vulnerable in society, and in some cases, no increases at all.</P>
        <P>While debating this Bill last week in the D&aacute;il, my colleague, Deputy Morgan, became engaged in an argument with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, about the state of the economy.  Deputy Morgan indicated he was conscious of the slow-down in the economy and for that reason he believed the social welfare system should be overhauled to allow for effectiveness and value for money.  The Minister attacked my colleague and replied the economy was as good as ever.</P>
        <P>This is an example of the Government&rsquo;s hypocritical approach to Members of these Houses and the public.  If the economy is doing so well, why are pensioners only getting &euro;14 extra a week?  One can also ask why we have not increased the fuel allowance and why does direct provision remain at &euro;19.10 per week?  Either the economy is in slowdown, in which case we should have used last week&rsquo;s budget allocation more effectively, or the economy is still thriving, in which case this should have been the year when we exceeded the back-dated system of benchmarking welfare payments and gave our dependent citizens something more substantial to live on.</P>
        <P>At the same time as these low increases were made, we witnessed again the increase in stealth taxes; of which accident and emergency charges and hospital stay-over charges are just two examples.  To these we can add the huge rate of VAT people are forced pay and the ability of local authorities to set rent and refuse charges at will.  Any respite that should have been offered against these charges, in the form of this Social Welfare Bill, will mean nothing now.</P>
        <P>The Bill fails to ease the burden on the working poor.  Almost a third of all households at risk of poverty are headed by a person with a job.  The minimum increase in the FIS income threshold is a prime example of how little concern the Government has for this group.  These are the people we should be targeting for a medical card. <Col N="282"/> Instead, there was no increase in the medical card threshold and the threshold remains lower than the smallest social welfare payment.  This fails to improve the living standards of pensioners.  The Government lauds itself on the fact that it is on-track to increase the pension to &euro;300 by 2012.  Given that the average industrial wage is currently between &euro;570 and &euro;670 a week, one can question the value of &euro;300 in 2012.  Pensions should have been increased by at least &euro;20 this year.</P>
        <P>The Bill does nothing for children.  The early child care supplement does not solve the child care problem.  The failure to increase maternity leave and to introduce paid paternity leave, shows how little the Government is committed to solving the child care problem.  The back-to-school allowance does not reflect the true costs to families of sending their children into our not-so-free education system, where school books alone can cost anything up to &euro;500.</P>
        <P>The failure to increase the fuel allowance is a disgrace.  Just this week the Institute of Public Health, IPH, said a fuel poverty strategy, similar to a model in the Six Counties, needs to be developed in the South.  It revealed people in 227,000 properties, 18.4% of the total, were forced to live in cold, damp, and thermally inefficient houses.  A total of 652 deaths was directly linked to poor housing standards.  Fuel poverty predominantly affects elderly people and lone parents.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in submitted amendments to the Bill that called on the Minister to review a number of payments and the method by which they are paid.  The Minister argued against them last week.  We did not make amendments to the Bill for the sake of showing up the Government.  We made them because we want adequate care to be given to our most vulnerable people.  We support the Bill, purely on the basis that any increase in welfare has to be welcomed, but we do so with the proviso that we want the Minister to get on with the job he is paid handsomely to do, and make our social welfare system work.</P>
        <P>The year 2010 is the European year for combating poverty.  The Government must try to get the social welfare system in order by next year&rsquo;s budget if we are not to be ashamed in 2010 by the indecent levels of poverty in the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the very healthy debate we have had this afternoon on the Social Welfare Bill.  I listened attentively to the contributions that were made and I will address them as best I can.</P>
        <P>One of the areas that was raised was the carer&rsquo;s strategy, which is of particular interest to me as Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  The strategy was promised earlier this year and its introduction is planned for the summer of 2008.  It involves a cross-departmental <Col N="283"/>interaction and engagement with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children.  Officials from these Departments have met and I was present at a meeting to draw up the plan.  The meeting was chaired by an official from the Department of the Taoiseach.  The terms of reference are currently being drawn up and the strategy will be in place by the summer of 2008.</P>
        <P>One of the key commitments in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, is the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy.  This commitment is reiterated in the programme for Government.  It will focus on supporting carers in the community, both formally and informally.  We are currently working on this strategy.  Carers are an important part of the strategy on older people.  Work will continue in the new year on the introduction of the strategy in 2008.</P>
        <P>The issue of young carers was also raised.  Senators are no doubt familiar with the report, Caring Before Their Time, which was researched and published by Barnardos and the Children&rsquo;s Research Centre in September 2004.  It was found that approximately 3,000 young carers are currently providing some care and more than 300 carers aged between 15 and 17 years of age provide full-time care.</P>
        <P>The report also considered that further research should be undertaken to ascertain the number of young carers.  One recommendation was that the Department of Health and Children should be the lead Department to examine this area and to support young carers to ensure they receive an education, namely, school if they are of an age and college if they choose this option.  I understand my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Smith, intends to commission a study in 2008 following consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies.  Although the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, will not take the lead role in this initiative, he and his officials will no doubt be involved in the report and in examining the issue of young carers.  This issue will also be addressed in the carer&rsquo;s strategy.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden and others referred to habitual residence.  The purpose of the habitual residence condition, HRC, which was introduced in May 2004 was to allow access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are legally resident in Ireland, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.  Persons without a right to residency in Ireland, such as asylum seekers and those awaiting a residency decision, are not considered to be habitually resident in the State.  Among the factors considered in deciding whether a person is habitually resident is a person&rsquo;s future intentions to live here.  If a person has not yet received permission to reside in Ireland, he or she is not considered able to establish his or her future intentions to live in the country.</P><Col N="284"/>
        <P>Those who do not satisfy the habitual residency condition because they are in the asylum process have direct provision available to them.  In certain cases they may also avail of exceptional needs payments from the local health board for the period that their asylum application is being processed and in this manner the rights and welfare of the child is protected.  As soon as refugee status or right to remain is granted to such persons, they are accepted as habitually resident and they therefore are entitled to child benefit in respect of their qualifying children.  That may clarify the position in that regard.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the expected price and wage increases and inflation, and the Government being accused of not addressing inflation in the budget.  The budget provides social welfare dependent families with increases of at least 6% in overall child income support through the combination of child benefit, qualified child allowance increases, back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and early child care supplement.  These are well above the anticipated increases in prices and earnings for 2008.</P>
        <P>The increase in pensions over many years has been one of the major achievements of the Government.  Since 2002 the level of the State contributory pension has increased by over<?oasys _jy ?>50%, from &euro;147.30 to &euro;223.30 following last week&rsquo;s budget.  During this five-year period the prices in the shops increased by but 15%.  This clearly shows that inflation is not an issue of concern in the context of the announced budget increases proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>On the review of the level of statutory entitlements, Senator Prendergast mentioned paternity leave.  Under Towards 2016 the Government and social partners are committed to a review of the level of statutory entitlements to maternity and paternity leave before the end of 2008.  A working group will shortly be established, led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to progress this commitment.  The work of the group will be informed by the commitment in the programme for Government to over the next five years increase paid maternity leave by five weeks, make all leave after the first 26 weeks available to either parent and examine the possibility of introducing a statutory entitlement to paternity leave and shared parental leave.</P>
        <P>Another issue raised was the living alone allowance.  Senators mentioned it was not increased in this instance.  The living alone allowance is an additional allowance of &euro;7.70 per week made to people obviously living alone.  As people grow older, thankfully, most of them are able to remain at home but need the support of the family, which means that they lose the living alone allowance.  If the allowance was to continue to be increased and then taken from them when they enter into the family setting it would create difficulties, therefore, it was a much more prudent and wise decision to continue to increase the pension over the years so that all pensioners benefit rather <Col N="285"/>than those just getting the living alone allowance.  The allowance was intended as a contribution towards the additional costs that pensioners face when they live alone but so many of them move into the family setting as time goes on.  It was a more prudent move in that context.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>I have addressed most of the issues raised and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Title>Report on Music and Education. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the sub-committee on education and the arts under the Arts Act 2003.  The Acting Chairman knows well that when in the last session we were looking at the Arts Bill and discussing the needs of all the various art forms, there was intensive debate, particularly over traditional music but also over the role of music and the education system.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Arts Act coming into force there was an agreement made by the then Minister that sub-committees would be established to look at special areas of interest.  The first sub-committee formed examined the traditional arts.  I was delighted with the results of that sub-committee in that it established, not only the priority that should be given to the traditional arts but also a funding mechanism of &euro;3 million.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs earlier this year with the Arts Council, the continuing role and importance of the traditional arts was underscored by the chairperson of the Arts Council, Ms Olive Braden.</P>
        <P>The second sub-committee established was the sub-committee on arts and education.  The report of that sub-committee was to be finalised in May last.  I and many others involved in the arts would see the link between arts and education as extremely important.  My background is in pursuing this issue of how having young people involved in music changes the shape of their brain, and their ability to cope with life and with education.  In later years, having had the exposure to music gives them a better ability to cope with both disease and with syndromes that might affect them as they grow older.  One cannot overstate the role of music in personal development.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I have been anxious to know what has come out of the sub-committee on arts and <Col N="286"/>education.  As far as I am concerned, there needs to be a joint approach from the Arts Council and the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, and the Department of Education and Science.  If, until this sub-committee was formed, one asked a question of the Minister for Education and Science about the arts she would reply it had to do with the Arts Council and if one asked it of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, he would reply it was an education matter &mdash; it went from Billy to Jack.  What I am looking for is a report that will have the imprimatur and acceptance of both Departments.</P>
        <P>In the same way that traditional arts, which had been in a never-never land to some extent but had existed, got a formal focus and acceptance, it is vital that the results of the sub-committee are published and the implications pursued jointly between the two Departments.  Ultimately, it is not a situation where the Arts Council can impose its will on the education system and at the same time the education system, having done various reports on the arts, cannot provide all the expertise needed in the music system.</P>
        <P>I underscore that by saying that music is supposed to be part of the curriculum in primary school.  It is a subject for the leaving certificate.  Beyond that, it provides an important opportunity for personal development for people like myself.  I declare my interest, that I have a BMus, MPhil, PGCE, LTCL and as many letters as one probably would want.  Music provided me with a career opportunity and although it need not provide a career opportunity for everyone, it provides the opportunity to improve the quality of life of people, both now and in the future.</P>
        <P>It is important the results arrived at by the sub-committee, which was set up following a brave battle, are disclosed, published and followed up on.  I understand the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism is unable to be here and appreciate the fact the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor, is taking this matter.  I hope there is some good news in the Minister&rsquo;s response.  If not, I would like to receive good news for the new year.  This is an issue that cannot be left aside any longer.  The decision was made to set up the committee and priority was given to traditional arts.  The committee did well in that regard and I hope the second sub-committee will have as good an impact on arts and education as the first did on the position of traditional music in Ireland.  Both areas are of serious merit and importance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious I am in the company of two Senators who have made enormous contributions in this area, Senator Cecilia Keaveney and my Tipperary colleague, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I am happy to be able to deliver the response of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>The Minister assumes the Senator is referring to the arts and education report, which the Arts Council was due to present to him during the summer of 2007.  The Arts Council has presented him with a copy of the report and he has studied its contents, but as the report has not yet been published it would be inappropriate to comment on its recommendations at this stage.  The background to the report is that in 2004, a steering committee, which involved representatives from the arts and education field, the Arts Council and the Department of Education and Science, was set up to develop guidelines and principles for good arts in schools practice.  The committee met on numerous occasions during 2004.</P>
        <P>In 2005, Towards Best Practice, a publication of a comprehensive set of principles and guidelines to enable the arts community, teachers and schools to work more effectively together grew out of the discussions of the steering committee.  In October 2006, the Minister directed the Arts Council to establish a committee to advise on matters relating to arts and education.  Having regard for the statutory functions of the Arts Council as set out in section 9 of the Arts Act 2003, and in accordance with section 21 of that Act, a special committee was established to advise the Arts Council on how best to align the council&rsquo;s strategies for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The members of the arts and education committee included Mary Nunan, chairperson and Arts Council member; Jerome Morrissey, National Centre for Training in Technology; Pat MacSitric, assistant chief inspector, Department of Education and Science; Mr. Derek West, chair of National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals; and Orlaith McBride, Arts Council member.</P>
        <P>In its deliberations, the committee had regard to the wide ranging demands on the school curriculum, bearing in mind that responsibility for determining the content of the school curriculum rests with the Minister for Education and Science, and to the need to prioritise and cost its recommendations.  These recommendations must have regard both to the resource implications for the Arts Council and the fact that the budgetary resources likely to be available over the next four years to the Minister for Education and Science for the development of services in the education sector must be allocated to fund existing policy commitments.</P>
        <P>The committee also had regard, subject to the prioritisation and costing of its recommendations, to the identification of what additional sources of funding, if any, might be available to fund its recommendations, and to the roles and partnerships that are appropriate for relevant State and other agencies and bodies in this context, includ<Col N="288"/>ing the Department of Education and Science, the Arts Council, vocational committees and local authorities.  The focus of the special committee&rsquo;s remit was to make specific deliverable recommendations for implementation over three to five years.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes that it is important to promote an appreciation of and engagement in arts and culture from early education and that this should be a lifelong learning experience.  Primary and post-primary schools are key education sites in providing for children and young people&rsquo;s education in the arts.  Early exposure to the arts is essential to develop and nurture the young person&rsquo;s creativity and imagination, traits which are essential to becoming a rounded well-balanced individual.  A society&rsquo;s wealth and well-being should not be measured by, or be dependent on, its economic prosperity alone, but also by an appreciation and understanding of arts and culture.  The fact that the Government will spend over &euro;200 million in 2008 on the arts and cultural sector is testament to its commitment to this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is currently considering the report further and will discuss it with his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and with the Arts Council.  His officials have already had bilateral discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council to discuss it.  All three parties are due to meet in the new year to discuss its recommendations in further detail.  As those discussions are ongoing it would be premature of him to comment further at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, but I am disappointed that money seems to be the pertinent issue.  I urge the Minister of State to bring the message to the Minister that while the Government will spend &euro;200 million in 2008 on the arts, it will spend &euro;15 billion on health.  If, as we say, music is very important to young people&rsquo;s development, it must be given priority within education and the arts.  I hope the discussions in early 2008 will bear fruit in this regard.  The cost of this is a drop in the ocean compared to what is being spent in the annual budget.  I trust this message will be brought to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Keaveney on this.  I appreciate the sum required is a drop in the ocean compared to other funds.  The importance of music in schools has not been fully realised.  People who find expression in music have fewer emotional and intellectual difficulties.  It is important that funding is put in place for this for the future.
