	<P>I have received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:  </P>
        <P LI="1">the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the action she is taking to restore confidence to the system producing cervical smear tests following the revelation that a number of such tests which were sent to the US for analysis had to be further reviewed when discrepancies and errors in the results came to light; and the action she intends to take to ensure that patients can have absolute confidence in the tests and their results.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I also received notice from Senator Dominic Hannigan on the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">the need for the Minister for Transport and the Marine to instigate procedures whereby train station car parks are included within the Minister&rsquo;s regulatory powers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe on the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">the need for the Minister for Transport and the Marine, in relation to the Metro North, which is the largest infrastructure project in the history of the State to confirm the proposed cost and to make public the cost benefit analysis of this project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">the need for the Minister for Finance to give an update in relation to the site acquired in a location (details supplied) and the current status of each of its three constituent parts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators Fitzgerald, Hannigan and Donohoe.  They will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senator Keaveney <Col N="274"/>may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Coroners Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  A Seanad party spokesperson may speak for 15 minutes while other Senators may speak for eight minutes.  Members may share time by agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed in the House last week the need for an all-party motion on Burma.   I would like to hear what progress the Leader has made.  All of us will have seen the television images of the death of the Japanese photographer and the ongoing struggle of the Burmese people.  An all-party motion from this House would be important.</P>
        <P>Does the Leader agree with comments made by the former Leader of this House, Senator Cassidy&rsquo;s constituency colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, when she said yesterday that she was quite astonished and astounded at the removal of the Minister and the Department of Health and Children from the day-to-day running of the health services, and that it was quite a morass?  This comment echoes what was said on this side of the House yesterday about political accountability with regard to the health cutbacks.  Yesterday I spoke about our public services and the need to manage them efficiently.</P>
        <P>Today I want to talk about education.  Many of my colleagues asked that the Minister for Education and Science attend the House and discuss a variety of issues.  In particular I want to focus on the provision of schools at local level, particularly in the fast and growing communities around the country.  The focus has been on primary schools but I see an ongoing problem in the provision of secondary schools, where there are bulges in primary school populations and the secondary schools are not in place.  This issue needs attention.  What initiative does the Minister plan to bring together the Department of Education and Science, the local authorities, the Office of Public Works, and the providers, particularly in light of the bishops&rsquo; comments about their future role to the effect that they intend to play a lesser role?  I would like the Minister to attend the House and outline the action she is taking to put that sort of planning in place.  At a public meeting the other day, a woman asked me if there was any point in carrying out a census, and being aware of the figures, if no action is taken on planning.  Many of the Members on this side of the House would welcome an opportunity to debate the issues with the Minister for Education and Science.  I ask the Leader to invite her to the House to discuss this and the many issues my colleagues raised in recent days.</P>

	<P>I re-echo the point made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I confirm that the Leader&rsquo;s office is co-operating with the various groups to agree a motion.  I hope the Leader will confirm that a motion acceptable to all is close to being agreed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">D&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir Fitzgerald gur c&oacute;ir don Aire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta theacht isteach chugainn le gn&eacute;ithe &aacute;irithe oideachais a phl&eacute;.  T&aacute; rud amh&aacute;in eile gur c&oacute;ir di a phl&eacute; linn chomh maith, an t-achrann at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l faoi l&aacute;thair idir Ghaelscoileanna agus an Aire f&eacute;in maidir le m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna sin.  An modh at&aacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id faoi l&aacute;thair n&aacute; tumoideachas, an immersion method of teaching.  Is modh m&uacute;inte &eacute; at&aacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id ar fud an domhain &mdash; there is nothing different about it.  Even groups like Linguaphone for example, uses this method to put forward its point of view.  It is a perfectlly sustainable and correct method.  Ar an dtaobh eile den sc&eacute;al, t&aacute; an tAire ag r&aacute; gur c&oacute;ir go mbeadh B&eacute;arla ar am-chl&aacute;r na scoileanna chomh maith.  Her worry is that if it is just complete immersion in Gaeluinn without any formal teaching of English, that does not reflect the timetable.    T&aacute; mise ar thaobh na nGaelscoileanna san arg&oacute;int seo, c&eacute; go dtuigim go bhfuil arg&oacute;int l&aacute;idir ag an Aire.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom go bpl&eacute;ifeadh s&iacute; &eacute; anseo linn.  It should not be something on which we take sides.  I would like to hear the views offered from both sides.  The Minister is in a perfectly understandable position.  I do not fully agree with her on it, but I accept the strength of her arguments.  We could have a situation where a child might be immersed in Gaeluinn for two or three years and the idea in the Gaelscoil method is that they would then pick up on the English from there on in.  That is very understandable, but you could have a situation where a child could have left before being exposed to the teaching of english.  I see that from the point of view of the Department and the Minister.</P>
        <P>Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar an &aacute;bhar seo agus tuiscint againn ar cad t&aacute; ar si&uacute;l.  N&iacute; h&eacute; go bhfuil aon duine m&iacute;cheart ach caithfimid teacht ar an seift is fearr do dhalta&iacute; na scoileanna sin.</P>
        <P>There is one other issue I wish to consider.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach knows that I have raised this time and again.  It is something that always bothers me and it started again yesterday.  My two colleagues from Donegal raised Donegal issues.  However, the problem is that we need to discuss the entire west of Ireland, from Malin to Schull.  What always happens here is that people are focused on their own constituencies, and we lose the big picture.  It is hard to believe but for years it was difficult to get co-ordinated support for the western rail corridor.  People conveniently forget this but it is the truth.  People did not see the value of the rail corridor because they were not looking at the whole issue.  As an Independent who will never stand for the D&aacute;il, with no vested interests, I have a serious concern that the voice <Col N="276"/>of the west will be lost when constituency reviews take TDs from the west and move them to the east, chasing the population.  Logically, that is what will happen.</P>
        <P>The only way to deal with this is to look at it from a different point of view.  I will be shot on sight by the media for saying this but even if it means increasing the number of TDs, we must ensure the voice of the regions of the west is fully articulated and heard.  I wish to have a debate on this issue in the House, without any vested interests.  This process is happening already.  There was a time when there were six TDs in Cavan-Monaghan.  There are six in Kerry at the moment, but it will be reduced to five.  This is happening all along the west coast.  From a disinterested point of view &mdash; it makes no difference to me personally or to anyone in this House from any party &mdash; I think this is wrong and we need to consider and focus on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday we agreed to the Order of Business as set out by the Leader who agreed to a further debate on the issue of health.  I do not know whether he said this directly to the House but it was stated that a debate would take place on Shannon before long.  Members will be grateful for this.  However, there is a serious question mark over the coherence and credibility of the Government on a range of issues, including these two.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Leader prefers the Order of Business to be conducted on the basis of questions to him, I will repeat the question asked by Senator Frances Fitzgerald in case the Leader lets it go.  Does he agree with the position articulated by the person who sat in his chair last year who said she was astounded at the removal of the Minister for Health and Children from the everyday running of the health services?  Does he agree with her view that the presentation of the Government on these issues is all a morass? Those are the words of the former Leader.  Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke made those comments.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is a member of the Government and subject to collective Cabinet responsibility, said that he cannot make head nor tail of the Health Service Executive and finds it impossible to deal with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What is happening in the Government?  Where has democracy in this State got to when Government Ministers can face in two, three or four different directions at the same time?  How are we, as Senators, to take seriously any Minister or member of the Government who comes to this House to articulate the position of the Government on such an important issue when they spend their time disagreeing with each other publicly and undermining the position of people such as Professor Drumm who, for all the faults <Col N="277"/>of the HSE, is clearly doing his best?  How is he supposed to feel when a member of the Government, subject to collective Cabinet responsibility, says that he cannot make head nor tail of the organisation and that he finds it impossible to deal with?  Credibility and coherence are demanded by the people, and by those in any democracy, of their Government.  In this country, the day seems to be long gone when people resigned over issues they supposedly felt strongly about.</P>
        <P>On the issue of Shannon, we now have the extraordinary situation that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, has been reported to be guilty of abusing individual citizens of this country who have the temerity to raise with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should know better with his background.  That is an allegation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the question of his position.  These people have just given a clear account of what happened.  The behaviour of the Minister &mdash; again, a Minister subject to collective Cabinet responsibility &mdash; is nothing short of a disgrace and he should make a public apology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The only thing wrong with the Senator&rsquo;s party is that they do not have any Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>If he really felt so strongly about the Shannon issue, and all of the dancing that he engaged in with his colleagues in August&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was a performance worthy of the Rose of Tralee, rather than what we would expect of a Minister.  After all that posturing, what happened at the end of the day?  Absolutely nothing.</P>

	<P>Where is the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot take them seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he calling for a debate?  Where is the question?  This is a speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot take any Government seriously if its members cannot maintain a coherent position on fundamental issues as articulated by them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate it if people would ask questions.  The problem is that a large number of Senators wish to speak.  We <Col N="278"/>have a time limit, and when we reach the end, people who have a valuable question to put to the Leader will not be able to.  Therefore, I ask people to put questions.  There are other forums for speeches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will respond to the questions that have been raised by the leaders of the other groups.  I wish to raise an issue that follows on from yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  A number of Members asked that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the house to speak about employment in Donegal.  In light of the indefinite postponement of the opening of the Amgen facility in <?oasys _jy ?>Carrigtwohill, County Cork, we should take the opportunity to discuss the wider issue for a number of reasons.  First, this announcement is obviously disappointing and the Minister will have an opportunity to talk about the confidence of IDA Ireland that a replacement industry can be found.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Minister comes to the House, I wish to ask him about the manner in which job announcements are made.  Historically, all Governments have made announcements regarding the creation of jobs three or four years into the future once a company is up and running.  This originated at a time of high unemployment to create expectations and hope.  This is no longer necessary and it is unfair on local communities.  Job announcements should be limited to jobs that are already in place and are paid from day one.  Everyone in the political process should examine ways in which these announcements can be better made in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to interrupt the Order of Business by moving a vote of condolence, but it would be appropriate for us to recognise the death of Tony Ryan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I say this as somebody who does not particularly admire Ryanair, but Mr. Ryan was a very remarkable businessman.  In addition, he rescued one of the most magnificent 18th century houses in this country and did it with attention to detail, loving care, and professionalism.  He started on the road as an entrepreneur in very difficult times &mdash; in the 1970s &mdash; and built up an international business, and then ploughed money back into the cultural life of this country.  I was a guest in his home a number of times.  I certainly mourn his passing and I am sure other people do too.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.4- ?><P>It is my intention to be as helpful as possible to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to the Government.  Senator John Hanafin yesterday raised the question of reform of the Seanad and the university seats, and the distinguished Leader also referred to the university Senators.  In addition, on the first day of the newly convened Seanad, there was a <Col N="279"/>bit of a spat and it was once more suggested that the university Senators were dragging their heels and obstructing reform in this area.  For that reason, and in the most positive and constructive way possible, I move an amendment to the Order of Business.  I propose that we take No. 7, motion 15 in the name of most of the university Senators: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann urges the Government to implement the recommendations of the 2004 &lsquo;Report on Seanad Reform&rsquo; by the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform&rdquo;, immediately after the Order of Business as the first item, that we pass it, and that we immediately start to implement the very clear proposals, which were endorsed by the Government and which include radical changes in the university system.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to what Senator Alex White stated, issues will be debated.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will always debate issues freely and openly and will not be suppressed by former members of The Workers Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour, Democratic Left or anybody else.  The Labour Party is still smarting from the Mullingar accord or disaccord.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but it is difficult for a united and cohesive party to listen to this.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, to discuss the new European reform treaty?  As the Government spokesperson in the Seanad on European affairs and integration policy, I wish to see the Seanad more involved in discussing the important issue of Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe.</P>
        <P>The European Council meeting of 21 and 22 June decided to convene an intergovernmental conference to finalise the details of the reform treaty.  It is important that the Seanad plays a role in this.  This Seanad is made up of enlightened people with broad views.  This issue will face the Irish people as a referendum is likely to take place in 2008.  The concept of a constitution was dropped because it was not acceptable to most <Col N="280"/>member states.  It would have caused problems in this country because we have a constitution and the name &ldquo;reform treaty&rdquo; is appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for this matter has tremendous involvement in Europe and his involvement in the Nice treaty was successful.  Deputy Dick Roche will be welcome to the House and I ask the Leader for the opportunity to discuss this issue.  Perhaps the Seanad can take a lead role in pushing through the referendum in 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Along with other colleagues, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House to discuss an announcement she made in August.  Many Senators know she plans that parents will receive reports on their children&rsquo;s progress in school at the ages of seven and 11.  As the new spokesperson for education and science, I welcome this move.  However, I would like her to tease it out.  Has she fully considered the implications in terms of resources?  I fear it will open a can of worms.  It is a can of worms which needs to be opened but I am not happy with the amount of resources in place, especially with regard to children with learning difficulties.  I have first-hand experience in this area.  At this time of major prosperity, a pupil in a primary school of 200 children who requires psychological assessment qualifies for one to two assessments.  This means a parent must spend &euro;400 to have the child privately assessed.  Many colleagues and friends who are parents have experienced this.  Providing parents with reports on their children will further exacerbate this need.</P>
        <P>I join my colleague, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, in asking that the Minister come to the House to address the matter of school provision and forward planning at primary and second level and advance the Adamstown model.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht faoi m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge mar a d&uacute;irt an tSeanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole.  T&aacute; fadhbanna againn le m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge and it is time that we addressed the teaching of the language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss the census of 2006?  Will the Minister conduct an early review of the electoral area boundaries?  The last review was ten years ago.  I would like the results of such a review to be in place in time for the local elections of 2009.  We experienced major demographic shifts since the last review.  This should be up to date to address the population needs as they exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call for a debate on the important issue of a university for the south-east region.  Waterford Institute of Technology is ready to become a university.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science to the Seanad to debate this matter?  Approximately <Col N="281"/>40% of the workforce of my home county of Wexford is dependent on the construction industry.  It is unhealthy for any area to be overly dependent on one industry.  A university in the south-east would help attract new and diverse employment and would also act as a spur to raise all boats.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I was appointed spokesperson for justice, equality and law reform with particular emphasis on and primary responsibility for equality and law reform.  In this regard, I join calls made over the past two weeks by Senators Fitzgerald and Bacik for a debate on equality to discuss issues such as the participation of women in the workforce at boardroom level and in politics.  As politicians, we must take the lead in this matter.  The last time I checked, we were ranked 78th in the world behind countries such as Sudan and Israel.  Collectively, we should be ashamed and should address this issue.  The Seanad is a perfect forum for this debate.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his elevation to the role and I look forward to working with him.  I am delighted to be here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will undertake a review of investment in broadband.  As spokesperson on community and rural affairs, I am pleased to see any measure to improve life for rural dwellers.  Despite promises to the contrary, as a country we still lag behind when it comes to broadband access in rural areas.  Broadband has long ceased to be a luxury item.  It is now an essential part of daily life.  Will the Leader request the Minister to come to the Seanad to outline his policy for improving broadband access in rural areas?</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A related issue was raised by Senator David Norris who called for a debate on Seanad reform.  My party supports this and would welcome such a debate.  We disagree with certain aspects of his proposal but we would welcome the chance to debate it.  I would like to see noise limitations introduced.  It gets loud when sitting between Senators Alex White and David Norris and I would not mind if we introduced legislation to limit it.</P>

	<P>Bh&iacute; suim agam sa mh&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an tSeanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole faoi d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht i dtaobh na ngaelscoileanna, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r st&aacute;das an Bh&eacute;arla iontu.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht le hurlabhra&iacute; &oacute; na gaelscoileanna ar an raidi&oacute; agus chuaigh s&iacute; i bhfeidhm go m&oacute;r orm.  Thug s&iacute; le tuiscint nach raibh taighde ar bith d&eacute;anta go proifisi&uacute;nta ar an gceist seo maidir le B&eacute;arla sna gaelscoileanna.  Bheadh s&eacute; cabhrach d&aacute; mbeadh an tAire in ann teacht isteach leis an gceist seo a phl&eacute;.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>This morning we held an all-party meeting with Mr. Leonard Orban, the European Commissioner for multilingualism.  I found it an exceptionally good meeting.  He gave us an undertaking that he would ensure the equality of the Irish language as a working language in Europe would be entertained.  We had the opportunity to point out to him some positive promotion of Irish, including the new legislation on Irish, the official working status of Irish in Europe, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and TG4.  One of the main items we were able to bring to his notice was that of the gaelscoileanna.  There is no doubt that development which has come without any great official prompting was one of the reasons we all had new confidence in this regard.</P>
        <P>I find the present debate a little disturbing because the people who headed up the gaelscoileanna were the pioneers at the time.  It would be much better if the debate and the consultation took place in a more private setting rather than in public.  We owe that to the gaelscoileanna. I listened to one of their spokespersons who made the point that as far as she knew, there was no professional or basic research done on the issue of an immersion system for Irish and bringing English into that situation.  It would be most helpful if the Minister for Education and Science could come to the House and discuss that issue with Members because she is one of the great pioneers of the promotion of Irish.  We all know of her great love for Irish and how supportive she is.  I would prefer if the debate were taken from the airwaves and into this House where we would have the opportunity to discuss it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of Amgen and join Senator Boyle in asking that the Minister come to the House to discuss the issue of job creation.  It is especially disappointing in the Cork region to hear of the loss of the proposed jobs in Amgen.  In particular, the Minister should explain how much the Government, his officials and IDA Ireland knew prior to the general election about the decision of Amgen to postpone indefinitely locating its jobs in Cork.  The project had been announced with much fanfare.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to discuss her proposals for teachers in difficulty?  It is disingenuous that we are drip fed the Minister&rsquo;s new proposal by the Government.  It behoves us all to enhance and support teachers who face difficulties in classrooms and education.  It is wrong to label them as problem teachers.  We must support and nurture our teachers who are one of the primary movers in educating our young people.  If they are having difficulties, an enhanced support structure for them should be in place and not the school principal wielding the axe and being the judge and jury.</P>

	<P>On a point of clarification, a call was made yesterday for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to discuss the job situation in the north west, which seemed to broaden out to asking the Minister to discuss IDA Ireland.  I had made a separate call that we examine the north-western Border region, the new dispensation that exists and the opportunity to develop regional balance.  I do not know which Minister is appropriate for that debate but there is a need to broaden it out.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear Senator O&rsquo;Toole speak about the western rail corridor.  I am not sure if it ever got as far as Donegal.</P>

	<P>Every time I saw the advertisement, I never saw reference to Donegal in it.  I believe there is a new dispensation in the north-west Border counties that needs to be maximised.  It has new potential and it involves the jurisdiction in the Six Counties.  Therefore, we must find some mechanism to develop discussion, debate and interaction to maximise that potential.</P>
        <P>Far be it from me, coming from the other House, to make a suggestion.  In the D&aacute;il, Ministers take questions on a rota basis and one knows when they will take questions again.  Is there any mechanism in this House whereby Ministers would come to it regularly for a particular period?  If there were, we would know when to debate the issue of underperforming teachers, gaelscoileanna and so on and we could gear our discussion towards the relevant Minister.  At present, everybody is asking that every Minister come to the House.  Unless there is a certain framework, it will be difficult for everybody to deal with issues.  It will be difficult also for any Minister to deal with every issue on a specific day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call from Senators Boyle and Buttimer that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the House at the earliest possible time to debate the Amgen company&rsquo;s decision not to locate in east Cork.  The Leader will be aware that one of his party colleagues, a Government backbencher, has already stated that his own Government misled the people of east Cork over the past two years and that Amgen had no intention of locating there.  I cannot comment on whether that is correct but it is important to discuss job creation in east Cork.</P>
        <P>The context of discussing job creation and job losses is different from that which pertained some months ago.  In the run-up to the general election, a myth was created that the outgoing Government had sole ownership of some magic formula that would keep the economy growing strongly.  The winds of economic change we have witnessed in recent months give lie to the view that the <Col N="284"/>Government has ownership of some formula which will keep Ireland growing at 5%, 6% and 7% per year.  The country faces major economic challenges and cutbacks in Departments are threatened.  That is the new economic situation facing the Government and it needs further debate.</P>
        <P>From the point of view of job creation in east Cork, the promised 1,000 jobs would have transformed east Cork and there would have been thousands of spin-off jobs.  It is a huge blow to the region.  We need to hear from the Minister what he knew in recent months and, more importantly, what he proposes to do to respond to this disappointing news.</P>

	<P>Again I ask the Leader for a debate on reform of the Seanad.  The reason for asking for the debate is the inadequate suggestions made prior to this.  It is for this Seanad to come forward with suggestions and that is why I have asked for a debate.  It is no harm to remind ourselves because it was suggested in certain parts that it was a less than democratic method of election.  Some people carried their election very heavily on their shoulders.  Let us not forget that some 1.2 million people voted for us to be here in this manner.

	<P>A European Council meeting on 18 and 19 October will finally adopt the reform treaty which will be put to a referendum here.  At the previous European summit which dealt with this, an issue arose in regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in which the Taoiseach indicated that Ireland might exercise some opt out from that charter.  That was subsequently clarified when there was a certain reaction.</P><Col N="285"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.4- ?><P>One other issue concerning that discussion which will be finalised in a matter of weeks is the exercise of an opt out in the area of policing and judicial co-operation in criminal law matters, and the work of the European institutions and the European Union in that area.  It is evident there is a split in Cabinet on this issue because the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has stated publicly he is against the exercise of this opt out.</P>
        <P>It appears this matter has not been discussed in the D&aacute;il or in this House and has not been the subject of any discussion by the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I ask for a debate on this matter before a decision is taken.  It falls to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to clarify the position now.  I hope he will be in the House later this morning.  It is appropriate to invite him to clarify the issue.  We will all play a part in the reform treaty referendum campaign and we should know the basis on which these decisions are being made.  The decision will be made on 18 and 19 October.  The lower House had a debate on policing and judicial co-operation yesterday.  We are well aware of the transnational character of crime and criminal organisations.  The Government needs all the help it can get from Europe and we should play our full part in the efforts of Europe in this area.</P>

	<P>I ask Senators to consider Standing Order 108, which clearly spells out those to whom we may pay tribute and give expressions of sympathy.  If a motion of sympathy is to be taken it should be moved by the Leader following which others could join in.  I do not want to have to do this and I have no disrespect for any deceased person.  However, there are rules and regulations with which I and all Members must comply.  We will take on board what the Senator has said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I was prompted by Senator Norris&rsquo;s expression of sympathy.  I would like to be associated with what has been said and is now on the record.  Tony Ryan was an entrepreneur of great vision who had a very beneficial impact on the economy in the past 25 years or so.  He brought new frontiers to the aviation industry in Ireland.  May he rest in peace.</P>
        <P>I seek your guidance, a Cathaoirleach, as to what options are available to Members of this House to initiate and lead an all-Ireland debate on the economy.  We are all aware of the current economic climate and the global situation.  I listened with interest to some of the contributors on the opposite side of the House who made comments, worthy as they are, about issues needing attention such as Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s mention of <Col N="286"/>the importance of broadband and the concern of Senators Buttimer and Bradford about the postponement of the development of the Amgen plant in Carrigtwohill.  However, other issues are coming down the stream such as the planned EU single corporate tax rate and the implications it may have for Ireland.  Some interesting comments have been made such as those by the chairman of the Ulster Bank on merging the authorities on the island with responsibility for the development of industry and our economy.  What options are available to us to invite people who have made comments, like Dr. Gillespie and others, along with the policy makers and the political leadership, to have an all-island debate on the future of the economy?</P>

	<P>I apologise for speaking out of turn earlier.  I second the motion proposed by Senator Norris to have a debate on Seanad reform.  I thought Senator Hanafin might have got there before me when he spoke in favour of a debate on Seanad reform, but he seemed to refuse at the last hurdle and not second Senator Norris&rsquo;s motion.  We had much discussion on the matter on the first sitting day of this Seanad.  The Leader among others was very vocal on the need for Seanad reform and it is important that we give it more than token attention and have a debate.</P>
        <P>I also thank Senator McDonald for again calling for a debate on gender equality, an issue to which I intend to return.  From looking around this House and the other House it is clear that women&rsquo;s representation in Ireland is very poor.  It is an important matter for a further debate.</P>

	<P>I also wish to raise the issue of the jobs at Amgen.  It is no great surprise to people in the Cork region that Amgen has finally announced that the planned development of the Carrigtwohill plant will now not proceed.  Several questions need to be asked on this announcement.  Who knew what?  When did they know it?  What exactly did they know?  Prior to the general election it was common knowledge in Cork that Amgen would pull the plug and that the announcement would be delayed until after <Col N="287"/>the general election for very obvious reasons.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, said at the time that &ldquo;any rumours were outrageous&rdquo;.  They are not so outrageous now and Cork East is without a 1,100-job facility despite the fanfare and aplomb that heralded its announcement several years ago.  I would like the Leader to arrange to bring a Minister to the House to account for this announcement and to investigate the roles of the employment agencies of the State.  What role does IDA Ireland play in Cork?  As far as I am concerned it does not exist in west Cork and it is clearly not working in east Cork.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The calls from the Independent benches and Senator Hanafin for Seanad reform and the call from my fellow east Galwegian Senator Healy Eames on electoral reform relate to the engagement of the public with the political process.  While I know the House has debated electronic voting in the recent past, it would be timely for the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to engage in debate with us in the House once more on the issue, particularly in the light of the latest developments in The Netherlands.  In the past month an official report has criticised the transparency of electronic voting there and a Dutch judge has found that the use of electronic machines in the recent election in The Netherlands was unauthorised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was sickened to hear time and again from members of the Government in recent years that Ireland would be the laughing stock of Europe if we did not introduce electronic voting.  Never was there a more pathetic excuse of an argument for introducing electronic voting.  While it might not be the most popular thing to say in this House given that we have all been through the difficulty of long election counts, our system of electing people has a great benefit in helping people engage with the political process.  Any debate in this House should focus more widely on the importance of improving the image of politics in the eyes of the public.  Our voting system is a help and not a hindrance.</P>

ASIST, which stands for applied suicide intervention skills training, is a two-day course to prepare individuals to provide emergency interventions to help people at risk of suicide.  More than 40 of these programmes have been cancelled.  While we have cutbacks in health, these types of cutbacks are totally unacceptable.

He transformed Ireland and gave us the opportunity to create the Celtic tiger.  He achieved much in his lifetime and he has given generations an opportunity.  He was an innovative person.

        <P>With regard to the comments by Members on the HSE, I will have to allocate further time to debate health issues.  The Minister for Health and Children was in the House two days last week to bring us up to date on the situation at the time.  The challenge she faces is formidable and she needs the backing and support of all colleagues.  Up to &euro;15 billion is allocated for health services annually and the way it is being spent is a serious concern to Members, some of whom have vast experience in the health services.  Their views must be taken into account because they know what they are talking about.  The issue is whether the State is getting value for money for its massive allocation to the HSE, whose running costs increased by 17% in the first eight months of the year.  Mullingar Hospital is ranked No. 1 in the State for hygiene standards and No. 2 for value for money.  Other hospitals that face difficulties should take a lead from the administrator and staff in Mullingar Hospital, where good people are doing a good job.  I have no difficulty allocating time for a further debate on the HSE.</P>
        <P>An all-party motion on Burma will be put on the Order Paper and I thank the leaders of the various groups for their co-operation and understanding.  I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his outstanding contribution at the United Nations last Tuesday in the name of the people of Ireland, of which I was proud.

Practically half of our D&aacute;il constituencies will lose one or two seats in every constituency review.  I have discussed this with three experienced Members in both Houses and serious decisions must be made regarding what will happen along the western seaboard between Kerry and Donegal.  I could not agree more with the sentiments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole in this regard and a debate will be held on this issue in the next three to four weeks.  The Boundary Commission is an independent body and it is currently sitting.  However, no one knows better than I what can happen, as I lost half my county to another constituency, similar to what happened in Leitrim.  Following past constituency reviews, at least one seat has been lost along the western corridor every time.  This is leading to a shift of power with two thirds of the electorate residing on the eastern seaboard.  The western seaboard will be denuded of its democratic right to have representatives in both Houses.  Thankfully the Seanad is a more democratic House in that regard.</P>

When I replied, I included the request for a debate on the BMW region by Deputy Healy Eames and the challenges and workings of the IDA.  Many Senators have expressed serious concerns about the challenges ahead.  If we are all honest about it, the greatest challenge facing the Government and ourselves, as parliamentarians, is competitiveness.  As a former chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I visited many countries that had advantage on Ireland, but we have been the world leaders in turning around an economy.  All political parties played their part and all of us can taken kudos from that but now we must ascertain where we will go for the next ten or 15 years.  I intend to bring the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House for a half day debate so that he can listen to the views of Members who may be able to assist in framing policy for the next ten years.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald called for a debate on investment in the south-east.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Coroners Bill 2007 and to outline its main provisions.  The Bill provides for a fundamental change and improvement to the coronial death investigation process in Ireland.  The comprehensive reform measures proposed will transform the existing legislation &mdash; the Coroners Act 1962 &mdash; and structures which govern the work of the coroner and provide for the establishment of a new coroner service.  These two elements are interdependent and together are critical to the achievement of the successful outcome of the planned reform of this vital public service.</P>
        <P>The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the working group on the review of the coroner service in 2000 and the coroners rules committee in 2003.  The Bill also has regard to recent developments in terms of jurisprudence and to ongoing reform of coroner services in other common law jurisdictions such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The death of a loved one &mdash; whatever the circumstances &mdash; is, self-evidently, an event of major trauma.  However, where the circumstances of a death require further investigation, the coroner plays a vital role in providing explanation and, <Col N="295"/>hopefully, some comfort through his or her inquiries to the families and friends of the deceased person at a very difficult time.  Coroners are required to achieve that delicate balance between performing their statutory function in ascertaining the cause of death while also remaining sensitive to the grief of the family and close friends of the deceased person.</P>
        <P>The coroner service is one of the oldest public offices of state.  The origins of this office can be traced back almost a millennium to the 12th century.  Historically, the main duty of the coroner was to protect the interests of the Crown in criminal cases hence the name coroner was given to the position.  Over the years, many and varying duties have been imposed on coroners and these have been refined in modern times into the critical role of inquiry into deaths.</P>
        <P>While the role of coroner has been always connected to unexplained deaths, the complexity and importance of the modern coroner bears little resemblance to his or her historical predecessor.  Today&rsquo;s coroner has a very wide range of duties involving investigatory, administrative, judicial, preventative and educational functions.  The coroner operates as an independent judicial officer required to establish the &ldquo;who, when, where and how&rdquo; of an unexplained death.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that the coroner is not permitted to consider or pronounce on civil or criminal responsibility in respect of a death.  The role of the coroner is, to the best of his or her ability and based on the evidence available, to establish the facts.  The new coroner legislation must also meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The European Court of Human Rights has, through several judgments, validated the important and primary role of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest in fulfilling this State&rsquo;s obligations under the convention to investigate any death involving public authorities or institutions.  The court has also interpreted Article 2 of the convention as providing for a more extensive investigation of the circumstances of death and has indicated that an extension of the scope of the inquest is effectively required to meet the obligations of the convention.  I note that in its report on the Bill, the Irish Human Rights Commission welcomed the approach adopted as meeting our obligations under Article 2.</P>
        <P>The current legislation dates back to 1962.  However, in substance, the law and structures have changed little since the middle of the 19th century.  If a coroner from that era was to return today, he would recognise without great difficulty the current situation.  I do not exaggerate when I say that this reform is not of an incremental nature but rather involves a jump of about 150 years.  The law in this area is in need of considerable updating to ensure Irish coroners are equipped to <Col N="296"/>conduct the best possible death investigation and are provided with the necessary administrative and technical supports to carry out their functions.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents the effective culmination of a significant period of reflection and consideration on this matter.  In 1998, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, began the reform process when he established an expert working group to review all aspects of the coroner service.  The review group comprised representatives from my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Coroners Society of Ireland, other Departments and offices, representatives from the health authorities, the medical and legal professions and other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The group conducted the first far reaching review of all aspects of the coroner service in Ireland.  It examined equivalent services in appropriate comparable jurisdictions.  Following a broad consultation with interested parties, it identified issues which needed to be addressed to ensure the coroner service provides the best response to present and future requirements.  The group was greatly assisted in its task by the submissions it received from all stakeholders and particularly so from the submissions made by families who told of their experiences with the coroner service.</P>
        <P>The report of the working group, entitled &ldquo;Review of the Coroner Service&rdquo;, was published in December 2000.  It contained 110 recommendations covering a wide range of issues.  The work of the group was complemented by the subsequent report of the coroners rules committee, which was published in November 2003.  The recommendations of the review group and the coroners rules committee have formed the basis for the formulation of this Bill.</P>
        <P>There has been only one change to the law since the Coroners Act of 1962.  Some Senators may recall that the Government supported a Private Members&rsquo; Coroners (Amendment) Bill, which was enacted in December 2005, as an urgent interim measure.  It abolished the restriction on the number of medical witnesses at an inquest and increased sanctions for reluctant or non-cooperative jurors and witnesses.  The provisions of the 2005 Act are subsumed into this Bill in sections 63 and 64.</P>
        <P>The Bill was introduced earlier this year by my predecessor, Michael McDowell.  It represented the culmination of these extensive consultations with relevant Departments, the Office of the Attorney General, statutory bodies, the Coroners Society of Ireland and other stakeholders.</P>
      
        <P>The Bill has two critical elements.  These are the widening of scope of the inquest and the extension of the remit of the coroner and the development of optimum structures and administration for a modern coroner service.  The Bill <Col N="297"/>provides a statutory framework extending the scope of an inquest, from investigating the proximate medical cause of death, to establishing in what circumstances the deceased met his or her death.  The current law in the 1962 Act, and as interpreted by the courts, provides for a restrictive approach as to the examination at inquest of how a person died being limited to the proximate medical cause of death.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The coroners review group recommended the extension of the remit of the coronial investigation to encompass the wider circumstances surrounding a death.  It recommended it be expressed in positive terms in any new legislation.  In addition to its recommendation, the developing jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights necessitated an address to this extension of remit.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>A death under investigation by the coroner involves the continuation of an already traumatic and stressful period for any family and friends of the deceased.  However, the coroner service, as the review group noted in its report, is &ldquo;a service for the living&rdquo; which in recognising the core value of each human life seeks to provide an explanation for a sudden or unnatural death.  In that regard, I highlight the important provision in section 36 which sets out for the first time in statute the rights of a family to the fullest possible information as to a coroner&rsquo;s investigations.  This critical and necessary feature will be certainly welcomed by families concerned.  The provision also helps to better fulfil our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out explicitly new provisions in the duty of the coroner to investigate a reportable death and the powers of the coroner in conducting the investigation into a death.  It provides the coroner with the necessary supports in law to carry out his or her functions properly.  Not all death investigations by a coroner necessarily lead to the holding of a formal inquest.  The cause of death may be readily discernible without the need for an inquest.</P>
        <P>Where an inquest is required, the Bill sets out the procedures for the conduct of an inquest by the coroner.  In the case of situations where there is a mandatory requirement to hold an inquest, the Bill provides for more explicit provisions to deal with those situations.  These include deaths in custody situations or of children in care where the State or its institutions have an involvement.</P>
        <P>These new provisions on the investigation by the coroner and on the inquest, taken together, are intended to ensure the primacy of the role of the coroner.  The Bill, however, also seeks to respect the roles and responsibilities of other statutory bodies and agencies involved in specific types of death investigation, for example, when a workplace or travel-related incident is involved or where the State or its agents may be involved.  There is a delicate balance to be maintained in <Col N="298"/>this regard.  It is not my intention to create any unnecessary tension or diversion of investigative resources.  We must be mindful to retain an overall coherence of approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To that end, section 90 makes provision for necessary protocols of co-operation and information sharing between the coroner service and organisations such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Ombudsman Commission and statutory bodies with responsibilities under other enactments to investigate accidents, incidents or diseases resulting in death.</P>
        <P>I expect this co-operative approach, which respects the prerogatives of the bodies concerned, while retaining the central role of the coroner to properly conduct his or her inquest, will ensure the best and most coherent approach to complex death investigations, without recourse to any further legislative intervention.</P>
        <P>The other main objective of the Bill is to establish a new full-time coroner service.  The review group was concerned about the need to ensure a high quality coroner service with proper resources and supports available to it.  It recommended an evolution to a regionalised structure where there would be fewer than the current historical provision of 48 coronial districts.</P>
        <P>The approach proposed in the Bill provides for the transformation of the existing part-time coroner service, administered by individual coroners in conjunction with local authorities, into a co-ordinated national service under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is proposed the new coroner service will comprise a chief coroner, deputy coroner, a certain number of full-time coroners and a fewer number of part-time assistant coroners.  The service will be organised on a regional basis with the number and extent of the regions to be prescribed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, taking into account certain determining factors for an optimal service.</P>
        <P>Provision has been also made for the employment of coroners&rsquo; officers to assist the coroner in carrying out his or her duties under the Bill.  A director of the coroner service will be appointed and will be responsible for its day-to-day administration.</P>
        <P>The transition from the existing somewhat fragmented service into the new co-ordinated and national service will require considerable planning and preparation.  The Government has approved the establishment of the coroner service implementation office which will commence the necessary arrangements for the new service.  In line with Government policy on decentralisation, it will be based in Navan, County Meath, and will be reconstituted as the headquarters of the coroner service upon establishment.</P>
        <P>Section 8, provides for the establishment of a coroner service.  On the establishment of the <Col N="299"/>service, full responsibility for coroners, including financial responsibility, will rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the involvement of local authorities will cease.  Section 11, provides for a director of the service who will administer the service and be responsible for the management and general control of the administration of the coroners service.  No less than two coroners, on a full-time basis, and no less than one assistant coroner, on a part-time basis, will operate in each dedicated coroner region, as prescribed under section 12.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A chief coroner will, under section 13, give professional leadership and direction to the coroner service.  Deaths as specified in sections 25 and 26 and the Third Schedule must be reported to a coroner and the persons required to report the death are also specified.  The inquisitorial nature of the coroner&rsquo;s investigation, his or her independence in performing functions under this Act and the requirement to have regard to the European Convention on Human Rights are explicitly mentioned in section 27.</P>
        <P>The duty of the coroner to investigate a death is set out in section 28.  Section 31 sets out the procedures for coroners to investigate certain deaths which may occur outside the State.  The coroner, under sections 34 and 35, may issue a certificate of fact of death which will authorise disposal of the body and act as proof of the death in regard to any claim for entitlement, for example certain types of State payments.  This new certificate of fact of death is not to be confused with the death certificate, issued ultimately by the Registrar of Deaths, but an interim solution designed to meet the needs of families affected.  This will be welcomed by Members because of the practical problems many have encountered with this matter.</P>
        <P>For the first time in legislation, the Bill sets out in section 36, the duty of the coroner to provide full and clear information concerning all stages of the death investigation process to the family of the deceased person.  Coroners have powers, under sections 33, 37 and 38, of custody and removal of a body, and if necessary for their investigations, of entry and inspection of premises.  Where the premises are a private dwelling, the authority of a District Court judge will be required.  Coroners may seek, under section 41, directions of the High Court on a point of law.  There are detailed provisions in sections 43 to 46, inclusive, on the circumstances where the coroner is required to hold an inquest, on the coroner&rsquo;s general power to hold an inquest and the express purpose of the inquest.</P>
        <P>Section 46 provides for widening the scope of the inquest from investigating the proximate medical cause of death to establishing, in so far as practicable, in what circumstances the deceased met his or her death.  This is the exten<Col N="300"/>sion of the remit of the coroner.  Detailed provision is made in sections 47 to 53, inclusive, as to the proper and efficient conduct of inquests and the procedures to be followed with a view to establishing best practice, efficiency and transparency in the matter.</P>
        <P>Section 54 provides for a new feature, the power for the inquest to make recommendations designed to prevent future similar deaths and other hazards to life and to bring these to the attention of appropriate persons.  Where a recommendation is addressed to a Department, a local authority or a statutory body, there is a formal requirement on them that a written response be made to the coroner no later than six months from the date of receipt of the recommendation, indicating the measures, if any, taken on foot of the recommendation.</P>
        <P>Where criminal proceedings are being considered or are under way or certain other investigations are being carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other mentioned public or statutory authorities, the coroner must under sections 57 to 59, inclusive, adjourn the inquest.  There are provisions in sections 63 to 73, inclusive, relating to witnesses and the involvement and functions of juries at inquests.  Juries will continue to be required in certain defined circumstances.</P>
        <P>There are provisions in sections 74 to 77, inclusive, relating to the conduct of post mortem examinations and other special examinations on behalf of the coroner.  These are designed to inform and reassure the families of the deceased regarding the procedures involved.  There are also provisions relating to the approval and conduct of exhumation which may be required for a coroner&rsquo;s investigation.</P>
        <P>There is provision in sections 80 to 82, inclusive, for a range of offences concerning failure to co-operate with an inquest or with a coroner, including offences by bodies corporate.  On summary conviction of offences, persons may face fines of up to &euro;3,000 and up to 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment or both.  Larger fines are provided for in respect of conviction on indictment.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides in section 83 that the coroner service will publish an annual report on its activities.  Of particular importance is that the Bill provides in section 86 that the Legal Aid Board may arrange for the granting of legal aid in proceedings before a coroner where a person has died in, or resulting from being in, State custody or in certain institutional care situations.  The effect of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights &mdash; confirmed by the Irish courts &mdash; is that there must be provision for legal aid in cases where there is involvement of the State in the circumstances of the death.</P>
        <P>Section 90 provides for the necessary co-operation and information-sharing arrangements to be developed between the coroner service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Ombudsman Com<Col N="301"/>mission and appropriate statutory bodies with responsibility for the investigation of accidents, incidents or diseases resulting in death.  These latter include primarily the Health and Safety Authority, the Road Safety Authority, the Railway Safety Commission and the Air Accident Investigation Unit.</P>
        <P>There are four Schedules to the Bill.  In particular, Schedule 3 sets out the categories of deaths to be reportable to a coroner and Schedule 4 relates to conditions of jury service at an inquest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Coroners in Ireland have done an excellent job over the years in serving their communities and have gained the respect of the public.  The debate today affords me the opportunity to express on behalf of the Government our appreciation for their efforts.  I am sure Senators will want to join me in expressing such appreciation.  This new legislation will reinforce the role of the coroner at the centre of the death investigation process.  The new system proposed in the Bill, incorporating legislative and structural and administrative reform, will provide a better service to the families of deceased persons and to society at large in explaining deaths and in alerting us to public safety and health issues.</P>
        <P>This reform, when fully implemented, will mean an improved service, greater consistency of approach to death investigations and better and more timely information to families involved in the process.  I look forward, with the support of the House, to the passage of the Bill and implementation of the associated organisational and structural reform.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As the Fine Gael spokesman on justice, I am delighted to address this Bill.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has listed this legislation among one of his priorities.  It was listed in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for 2003-04 and then it was to be available in 2005.  The report of the working group on the review of the coroner service was produced in 2000, so this is really an important Bill which should have been available quite some time ago.  I therefore welcome the fact that the present Minister is moving on this issue with despatch.</P>
        <P>We welcome the Bill.  It puts a professional and transparent structure on this whole service.  In the context of inquests that arise, it involves issues in the most varied of circumstances which cause extraordinary distress to families of the deceased.  The provisions in the Bill that deal expressly with notices to families of inquests and the involvement of families and interested persons in the process is to be welcomed.  It is evident that the legislative basis of inquests had to be adjusted and updated in the light of European Court of <Col N="302"/>Human Rights jurisprudence, and this is reflected in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The widening of the scope of the inquest is a fundamental change and one we also support.  Then there is the provision for legal aid in certain circumstances, again as required by the European Court of Human Rights.  There is also the issue of inquests into deaths that occur outside the State.  There have been cases where that has been an issue and it is good that this is reflected in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, it is an effort to adopt a professional approach to providing this service.  Establishing a full-time service is the way to go and while we will deal with specific amendments on Committee Stage, the real issue is whether the resources will be put in place to implement the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, especially in terms of the transition to a full-time coroner service, the prompt conduct of examinations and tests and the reporting on tests to the interested parties.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  I am also concerned that there should be a smooth transition from existing arrangements to the full-time service and that the Coroners Society of Ireland should facilitate that transition.</P>
        <P>The Minister has sought the co-operation of all the Members and parties in this House.  He will have the co-operation of Fine Gael in progressing the Bill.  It is important legislation and we will give him our full co-operation in that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House, and I welcome this legislation.  The issue has been raised previously by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights in reports on some of the investigations and inquiries held into people killed arising from British collusion in this jurisdiction during the Troubles of the past 30 years.</P>
        <P>It is an initiative that has been sought by the Coroners Society of Ireland, the Coroners Review Group and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003.  It is to equip coroners to conduct the best possible investigations into death.  Perhaps as we explore the Bill we can bear this in mind and see whether it achieves that.</P>
        <P>There are two broad parameters to the legislation.  One is to widen the scope of the inquest and the remit of the coroner from investigating the proximate cause of death to establishing the circumstances.  Then there is the development of the structures and administration within the coroner service.  In that regard, it is important we seek to ensure there is no possibility of any intrusion into the independence of coroners&rsquo; investigations and how they make their decisions.</P>
        <P>It will be a new full-time coroner service, co-ordinated at national level under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  As the Minister said, it is intended that it will be done regionally.  I note Senator Regan <Col N="303"/>has welcomed the fact that it is to be a full-time service and I have no doubt there is a need for a move in that direction.  However, will all coroners need to be full-time?  We have a system which, despite its flaws and shortcomings, operates with reasonable success on a part-time basis.  There is also the question of expertise which may be lost because we are moving from a part-time to a  full-time service.  This is something that might, perhaps, be examined.</P>
        <P>There is a statutory entitlement in the Bill for a coroner to receive assistance from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A garda can carry out a direction of the coroner only if the Commissioner accepts it is not in conflict with any given by the Commissioner.  To some extent, that perhaps impinges on the independence of the coroner.  Perhaps there will be cases in which it will be necessary to address that.  Section 21(5) states: &ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall not act as a coroner&rsquo;s officer in any investigation by a coroner into a death of a person in or immediately after being in Garda custody&rdquo;.  I see reasons for that but how does the coroner fill that void?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the qualifications.  To become a chief coroner, an assistant coroner or a coroner, one must have ten years&rsquo; experience either as a barrister or a practising solicitor or be a registered medical practitioner.  What is the practice internationally in that regard?  To the best of my knowledge, this provision would not debar any existing barristers.  However, that a coroner may come from one of two professions indicates there will be a deficit in the expertise of a coroner in one of the disciplines.  I accept that person can fill that deficit through other means.  The corollary is that a person who has a deficit in both disciplines could, if he or she had the aptitude and ability, do the job effectively by filling both of those deficits.  A person who is a medical practitioner would obviously have a greater understanding of the results of a post mortem.  That a coroner can come from one of two professions shows that if he or she does not have the expertise, compensatory mechanisms can be put in place.</P>
        <P>To some extent, we are talking about two very sheltered professions which have not really been tackled from a competition point of view and I suppose I come with that baggage to this debate.  We have been very remiss in not addressing that issue.  I compliment the Minister for Health and Children for her courage in taking on vested interests in the health service.  I have not seen the same enthusiasm for taking on the vested interests in the legal profession.  The country could benefit from doing that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under Part 3, the Minister may make regulations providing for coroners&rsquo; rules.  It struck me that should be mandatory rather than discretionary and, presumably, it will happen.  Part 4 deals with reporting of deaths to the coroner and the various categories of deaths.  I see the logic behind that in regard to suicide, suspected suicide and suspected assisted suicide.  However, where death occurs from natural causes, which are obvious to everybody, there is no need for an inquest.  Why is there such a requirement where it is patently obvious a suicide has occurred?  I am prompting a little discussion on that because it is often a very sensitive issue for families.  What is the logic behind that requirement?</P>
        <P>In regard to unnatural stillbirths and intra-uterine deaths, I notice there is no reference to an aborted foetus, for example.  The Constitution provides for the equal right to life.  Should that matter be addressed in the Bill?  It is an issue of which politicians tend to steer clear because it is controversial and fraught with many legal complications and issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully understand why if a person is under Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, military or prison custody at the time of death or immediately before his or her death, it must be reported.  That leads me to an issue which arose last week which is not entirely related but, nonetheless, connected where there was an intervention by the Garda Ombudsman into an inquest.  Such interventions should be addressed given that the function of the Garda Ombudsman is now being rolled out.  We must have regard for people who might be under the microscope as the Garda was in this case.  Where a complaint is made, there should be some discretion.  There should also be some time lines in respect of an intervention.  I appreciate that in this case the Garda Ombudsman is a new functionary within the system.  No time lines are mentioned in the Bill in regard to the holding of inquests.</P>
        <P>For time to time, there have been complaints by families about delays encountered in establishing inquests.  At a time of great trauma for families, that seems unfair and unjust.  Perhaps that will be improved now that we are moving to a full-time situation but there should be an obligation to operate within certain time lines.  I appreciate the difficulty in that the complexity of an investigation will have a bearing on when an inquest is held.  However, the Bill should provide that inquests are held as soon as possible.  That would conform with the broad thrust of the European Convention on Human Rights to which the Minister referred.</P>
        <P>Part 7 relates to the conduct of the inquest and the mandatory notice of 14 days.  Section 47 states: &ldquo;A coroner shall, whether by post or such other means as he or she considers suitable, arrange for the notification of any or all of the <Col N="305"/>following persons&rdquo;.  Does that mean there is an obligation to inform the family?  Another section provides that where an investigation is undertaken, there are mandatory obligations on the coroner.  However, section 47 states a coroner is required to notify &ldquo;any or all of the following persons&rdquo;.  If he or she notifies one or two of the three mentioned, that meets the requirement.</P>
        <P>In one of the inquiries held by an Oireachtas sub-committee &mdash; I am not sure if it was the inquiry into the murder of Seamus Ludlow &mdash; there were strong complaints by the family in regard to the conduct of the inquest.  The family was only notified on the morning of the inquest that it was taking place.  We were all <i>ad idem</i> that should not be the case.  I presume it has been corrected in the Bill but if it has not been, perhaps the Minister might respond.</P>
        <P>I referred to the adjournment of cases.  A broad spectrum of bodies can seek an adjournment.  People representing the Coroners Society of Ireland have expressed some concerns in this regard.  The spectrum is much broader than heretofore.  This should be considered because intervention such as that of last week should not be used as a last-minute response to a complaint.</P>
        <P>One point made by the Coroners&rsquo; Society of Ireland concerns the powers of the chief coroner.  The society is concerned about the extent to which these might impinge on the independence of individual coroners.  It is imperative that whatever procedures are in place do not allow this to happen.  Ultimately, this is under the control of the Department.  Any development that impinges on the control of a coroner would be unwelcome and any mushrooming of agencies that could impede the speed of coroners&rsquo; inquests should be avoided.</P>
        <P>A point was made on the over-centralisation of death investigations and the Coroners&rsquo; Society of Ireland seems to be under the impression that the service would be centralised in Navan.  The office will be in Navan but it would be a little incongruous if all death investigations were conducted therefrom.  Local investigations could be more expeditious and effective.</P>
        <P>I am aware this Bill was published last April and that, as a consequence of the election, there has not been much time for full consultation.  The Bill has not been discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  There should be an opportunity for committees and the Coroners&rsquo; Society of Ireland to engage with the Minister to ensure the changes he rightly says are long overdue are made in a cohesive way that ensures significant improvement to existing services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba bhre&aacute; liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire agus tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis as an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am go mbeadh a leith&eacute;id de reachta&iacute;ocht os &aacute;r gcomhair.  This is a very important Bill and the Minister is to be commended on introducing it.  It proposes to replace legislation that has been in place for 45 years.  The Coroners Act 1962 came into effect when Charles J. Haughey was Minister for Justice.  Despite the one amendment alluded to by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, there has been no other significant legislative reform.  I note what the Minister said on the review sponsored by his Department.  The review group reported in 2000 and made a number of recommendations, and it has been a long journey to this point.  The original Act had 59 sections while the current substantial Bill has 92.  The proposed reform of the coronial system is very welcome and long overdue.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to reflect on why a new arrangement is proposed.  For a significant number of people, the only forum in which the circumstances of a death can be investigated is through a coroner&rsquo;s inquiry.  Most cases do not result in civil or criminal proceedings and it is therefore important to reflect on the public importance of the coroner&rsquo;s role.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister stated, to comply with the requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, there must be provision for an extensive inquiry system like that proposed.  It is a significant advance on what was in place previously and its importance might be recognised in light of our Constitution&rsquo;s guarantee to vindicate the right to life of the person.</P>
        <P>I have but a few observations and concerns regarding the Bill.  Sections 13, 15 and 17 provide that the chief coroner, deputy chief coroner and coroners would be appointed by the Executive, by warrant of the Government.  It is to be noted that heretofore coroners were appointed by local authorities.  There were good historical reasons for doing so.  If a coroner was to rack up charges on ratepayers, he or she had to be answerable locally.</P>
        <P>One must ask whether the new provision regarding the appointment of coroners by the Executive will affect compliance with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Is there sufficient arm&rsquo;s length to allow full compliance with the convention given that the Government will appoint coroners and that its interests might be involved?  It is probably not a problem bearing in mind that judges are Government appointees.  Judges, too, must review Executive actions from time to time.  Nonetheless, one must ask why there is a departure from the previous arrangement.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P>It is clear that the Bill streamlines the Coroners Service.  At present, there are part-time coroners who are doctors, solicitors or barristers.  Under the new legislation, full-time coroners will be appointed for different regions.  It also provides that there will be a threshold requirement concerning the duration of previous practice in one&rsquo;s profession.  Section 23 stipulates that, once appointed as chief coroner, deputy chief coroner or coroner, one cannot continue to practise as a solicitor or barrister.  These provisions do not apply to doctors.  Is it contemplated that medical practitioners, who are also entitled to be appointed to these positions, will be required to give up their medical careers?  Will the Minister enlighten us as to why there is a distinction between members of the legal profession and those of the medical profession?  Is it contemplated that it would be impossible to get doctors to take on the job if they were required to give up their existing medical practices?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 24 provides for coroners&rsquo; rules in a very welcome way.  We had no previous rules of court and Appendix J of the Review of the Coroner Service sets out minimum requirements in this area.  No doubt these or similar rules will commend themselves to the Minister, who will have the power to make rules.</P>
        <P>Section 27(3) makes specific reference to the European Convention on Human Rights and the fact that the coroner shall have regard to the provisions thereof.  The urging of coroners to have regard to these rights is very welcome, particularly in light of our constitutional context.</P>
        <P>Let me address some specific matters of concern.  Section 31 deals with deaths outside the State.  I am aware that when British military personnel are killed on active service abroad, the coroner in the place in which the deceased would normally have resided in Britain may inquire into the circumstances of the death.  In the United Kingdom there have been a number of high-profile cases involving friendly fire.</P>
        <P>It could never be desirable that parents or family members would find themselves up against a wall of silence where a death abroad is concerned.  One cannot obtain the findings of an Army inquiry when somebody dies in the field and therefore the only way in which a family might get answers is by way of a coroner&rsquo;s investigation.</P>
        <P>The provisions of section 31 appear to be conjunctive and I wonder whether they are not supposed to be disjunctive.  There is a strong case to be made for a domestic coroner to be empowered to inquire into the death of a member of the Defence Forces or a garda overseas.  Are all the provisions in the various subsections of section 31 supposed to apply before such an investigation can be opened or are they meant to be disjunctive?  The coroner ought to be empowered, as of <Col N="308"/>right, to open an inquiry on the application of an interested party.</P>
        <P>Section 34 provides for the giving of a certificate of the fact of death, reflecting the <i>de facto</i> practice that is currently done on an informal basis.  I wonder if such a certificate is now necessary or sufficient to get a State benefit or to make a claim under an insurance policy.  For that reason, I welcome the new provision, which seeks to reflect the <i>de facto</i> practice, especially as delays are often encountered in the system when people try to secure rights and benefits.  I also welcome section 41, which provides for a consultative case to be stated by the coroner for the opinion of the High Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The next main issue I would like to flag concerns post mortems, which are dealt with in Part 10.  Section 74 provides that a coroner may ask a medical practitioner to conduct an examination or post mortem.  I am aware of a coroner in the north east who was unable to secure the services of a pathologist locally, which gave rise to particular problems and unnecessary delays in completing necessary post mortem examinations.  It resulted in bodies being moved around the State to different hospitals to conduct post mortems, thereby causing unnecessary distress and grief to family members.  This proposed legislation seems to contemplate that this unfortunate set of circumstances will be perpetuated.  A coroner should be entitled to invoke the assistance of local publicly-funded pathology services on a statutory basis.  If industrial relations issues need to be addressed, the Minister should address them with some urgency.  This problem was flagged seven years ago in the report of the working group.  Section 74(1) should state that the coroner &ldquo;shall direct&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may request&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 10 also provides that a coroner is not required to investigate any death that occurred more than 70 years ago &mdash; prior to 1937.  If the chosen year was 1932, when Fianna F&aacute;il came into government, cynics might question the creation of this exclusion zone.  Why has such a specific cut-off point been chosen?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I apologise to Senator Ross for not giving way.  The other Senator with whom I had intended to share time is absent from the Chamber.    I am concerned that the provisions for granting legal aid are too uncertain.  There appears to be too much vagueness about the circumstances in which legal aid might be granted.  It should be made clear that legal aid is available on a means-tested basis, rather than being decided on by the coroner in a vague manner that might give rise to inequality.  I apologise again to my colleagues with whom I am sharing time.  I <Col N="309"/>commend the Bill, with the reservations I have mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I broadly welcome the thrust and idea of this reforming Bill.  I understand the motivation for it.  I do not doubt that the attempt being made to modernise the coroners office is well founded and necessary.  I am sure the principles which underpin this legislation will be the subject of all-party agreement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The response this Bill has received from certain vested interests has not been completely unanimous and uncritical, however, in contrast to the response that was given to the review group&rsquo;s report in 2000.  I wonder whether the coroners, who are somewhat involved in this matter and were represented on the review group, were properly consulted before the Bill was drafted.  There is some discontent among the coroners about what is happening in this Bill.  It is regrettable that the last Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was unable to meet the coroners before this legislation was drafted.  It would have been appropriate if he had done so because it would have made the Bill a little less contentious.  On foot of that difficulty, Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I intend to propose some amendments when Committee Stage is taken to reflect some of the coroners&rsquo; worries about this Bill.  It is obvious that their concerns were not directly put to the Minister or his predecessor before the Bill was brought to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the coroners office should be modernised.  I welcome the obvious concern to ensure that the needs of the families of the deceased are paramount.  There is an obvious desire in the legislation to ensure that families are kept informed and better informed about what is going on.  That concern is human rights-led rather than local-led.  Families should be given full information at all times about what happens when there is an inquest &mdash; they should be comforted to some extent.  The Bill reflects the need to ensure that coroners&rsquo; inquiries are held for the bereaved and not for anybody else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to highlight some of the coroners&rsquo; worries.  I ask the Minister to reflect on them and to consider amendments aimed at addressing them on Committee Stage.  The coroners&rsquo; main worry is an understandable one.  They have done an effective job in difficult administrative circumstances without any back-up, but they have real concerns about the introduction of these new State agencies.  As I understand it, the agencies are being established to allow for the future widening of the remit of the coroners&rsquo; inquiries.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  In the past, such inquiries were really only concerned with establishing the cause of death.  Their remit will now be widened to explain and investigate the general circumstances surrounding the death.  I presume this legislation has been introduced on <Col N="310"/>the basis that the expansion of that remit to allow coroners to report on the general circumstances of a death necessitates the establishment of new agencies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The problem outlined by the coroners is that this legislation will result in many delays.  The Minister said earlier that he hopes there will not be any great tensions between the various bodies.  If there are many State agencies with different agendas, presumably they will all seek adjournments from time to time for various reasons.  It is certain that the agencies will have their own agendas, even if they are laudable agendas.  There has been a tradition of almost inevitably granting an adjournment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if it asks a coroner&rsquo;s inquiry for such an adjournment.  If bodies like the Health and Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman are, like the Garda itself, able to play separate parts in coroners&rsquo; inquiries, they may take a long time to conclude.  That would extend the difficulties of the families of the bereaved, to some extent, which is not the purpose of the Bill.  The Minister might think of a way around this problem.  I do not know whether he should contemplate having two separate types of inquiry which each pursue the two goals which are moulded together in this Bill.</P>

I will summarise the remaining matters about which the coroners are concerned in the 35 seconds of speaking time which are left to me.</P>
        <P>Failure to separate the administrative and investigative quasi-judicial functions in this Bill is a cause for concern.  This Bill is primary legislation and there is a concern that it is over-prescriptive.  Some of the regulations and clauses in the Bill could well be left for the regulations governing coroners rather than be contained in primary legislation.  I also note the lack of transitional arrangements in the Bill, which has caused <Col N="311"/>a great deal of concern to coroners.  I acknowledge the Minister is new to this portfolio and it is not his fault.  I ask him to give greater consideration to the views of coroners when taking amendments to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive overview of the Coroners Bill 2007.  The Green Party welcomes this legislation because, as the Minister has pointed out, the legislative changes proposed within it represent a major reform of the law dealing with the investigation of deaths and the overall role of the coroner.  The Bill will allow the coroner service, which, as the Minister said, is one of the State&rsquo;s oldest public services, to be transformed from a part-time service administered by individual coroners in conjunction with local authorities to a modern, co-ordinated national service.  The purpose of the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and the replacement of the Coroners Act 1962 is to take into account the contemporary jurisprudence of the Irish courts and the European Court of Human Rights.  The Green Party is of the view that this Bill has succeeded in doing this to a quite satisfactory extent.</P>
        <P>The Green Party regards certain provisions of the Bill as being significant, such as the ability of an inquest to examine the circumstances of a death and not merely its medical causes.  This will provide an improved service to families of deceased persons because it will help both to explain deaths and to draw attention to possible public health and safety issues surrounding deaths.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Green Party also welcomes the fact that the Bill specifically defines a death from MRSA as a reportable death.  This is significant because fear of litigation often prevents hospitals and other institutions from carrying out such reporting.</P>
        <P>Other significant provisions in the Bill include stronger powers for coroners to enter premises and seize documents on foot of a court order; the lifting of the current restriction on the number of witnesses coroners may call to an inquest; the introduction of new offences for those who refuse to give evidence and the introduction of High Court orders to oblige them to do so; new powers for the coroner to call expert witnesses; and the granting of free legal aid in certain cases involving a death while in the care or custody of State institutions.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised a concern about the proposed independence of the appointments process and the Green Party echoes those concerns.  Independence is one of the very necessary criteria for an effective investigation.  Senator Ross also queried the failure to separate the investigative and judicial functions of the coroner and the Green <Col N="312"/>Party also has concerns about this issue.  The investigation and decisions made regarding a death should have practical independence from those implicated and there should be a lack of institutional connection between the complaints body and those being investigated.  This applies in particular to deaths while in Garda custody and the death of a person while in hospital or in another State institution.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this point.</P>
        <P>The Green Party also notes the provision to retain the use of juries at inquests, unlike the trend in other common law jurisdictions.  Will the Minister explain the reason for this decision to retain the use of juries at inquests?  I note the mandatory use of juries in the case of death by road accident has been dispensed with.</P>
        <P>Another speaker referred to the issue of suicide.  While I would not expect a technical Bill such as this to go into the details of how an inquest would treat deaths by suicide, I wish to make a personal appeal to the Minister.  I am involved with the<b> </b>Bray suicide support group and I am very aware of the anguish experienced by families.  The inquest is often held well after the death and this reactivates the pain and anguish experienced by the family and friends of the deceased.  The conditions and circumstances in which the inquest takes place are far from sympathetic or appropriate, given those circumstances.  The <i>ad hoc</i> and somewhat informal nature of the coroners service to date means that families have found themselves in the public gaze and having to listen to the accounts of other families who have been through equally difficult circumstances as a result of a death of a loved one through suspected suicide.  Given the growing number of young people dying by suicide, perhaps the Minister would consider providing for sensitivity in the procedures and the circumstances in which such inquests are carried out.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill which the Green Party sees as essential in modernising the coroner service and ensuring the service operates in a way that reflects the principles of contemporary human rights legislation and good international practice.  We acknowledge the resourcing of this service will be vital and we hope to be part of a Government that provides for that effectively.  The process of transition from the current to the planned service will be challenging and will require careful and effective planning.  The Green Party hopes to support the Minister and his Department in carrying out this process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  I am relatively new to this issue although many of us will have personal experience of the coroner service, as I have over the years on sad occasions.  I have also professionally represented families before coroners.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>I am dealing with this issue in the round for the first time and I commend the drafters of this Bill on the clarity of language largely to be found in the Bill.  Legislation is often criticised for arcane, difficult and sometimes indecipherable provisions and wording, but this Bill as drafted is a model of clarity and it is relatively easy to navigate one&rsquo;s way around it.  That is not to say we agree with every element of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I agreed with the Minister when he stated that society and the community owe a great debt of gratitude to coroners who have served over the decades.  They have provided an invaluable public service in such a sensitive area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the 1962 Act is well beyond its time for review and needs to be repealed and replaced by this legislation.  It has only been subject to amendment on one occasion and I am proud to note that such amendment was done by my party two years ago when private Members&rsquo; legislation was required to be introduced to deal with a specific issue at that time.  It is now time to deal with the wider Bill and the issues it deals with.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Without prejudice to our entitlement to introduce amendments on Committee Stage, I note the provision which broadens out the investigation which a coroner is required to undertake.  The who, where, why and how those of us practising in that area are all familiar with will be augmented by the provision that the coroner will also be required to look at the wider circumstances leading to the death of the individual concerned.  This will give a broader remit to the coroner and is to be welcomed.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>As a number of speakers have said, it is vital that the coroner is independent in the conduct of his or her duties.  This is emphasised in the Bill but it should also be noted in this debate.  In Senator Walsh&rsquo;s thoughtful contribution, he queried whether it was necessary or appropriate that coroners should operate in a full-time capacity.  I believe it is, as it is consistent with the requirement that they be independent in the conduct of their duties and that they have no conflicts of interest.  With regard to conflicts of interest, the worry is never actually about a conflict but about the perception of a conflict.  It appears to be consistent with a requirement which flows from the European Convention on Human Rights but which in any event is proper, that a coroner should be absolutely independent in the manner of his or her appointment and also in the conduct of his or her duties.  To act part time or to have to work elsewhere to earn money is not consistent with that requirement.  I would respectfully disagree with any suggestion that this element of the Bill might be changed.</P>
        <P>Section 25 deals with reportable deaths, which are listed in the Schedule.  We will examine this in more detail on Committee Stage but reportable deaths should only be determined in the context of what the Bill is seeking to achieve.  The <Col N="314"/>resources available to a coroner should never enter into the calculation of what is a reportable death.  Either a death is properly reportable in the public interest or it is not.  There should be no question of resources or the absence of them entering into that calculation.</P>
        <P>A coroner is required to arrive at and publish a verdict.  It might be worthwhile to look again at the different types of verdict.  We are familiar with the different verdicts in the coroners rules that currently apply but they might bear further analysis and consideration.  Will the Minister consider defining and clarifying the different types of verdict in the primary legislation?  I welcome the reference to the recommendation.  We are familiar with cases where a jury might make a recommendation, often in the case of a death that occurred as a result of a public health failing.  There is a welcome provision in the Bill that rather than a recommendation being made, and perhaps forgotten, the public body concerned must respond within a specified period and indicate what, if anything, it has done in respect of the recommendation.</P>
        <P>Section 57 in respect of adjournments has been somewhat controversial.  It was mentioned by Senator Walsh.  The section makes it abundantly clear which bodies shall be entitled to apply to an inquest for an adjournment.  The Oireachtas has established a Garda Ombudsman Commission and it is entirely appropriate that the commission should have the power to seek an adjournment of an inquest.  That power should not be watered down or varied by the Minister during the passage of this legislation.  It is important to have a Garda Ombudsman Commission and to protect the interests of persons who make complaints to it.  When a person makes a complaint it does not necessarily follow that the complaint will be upheld but the person is entitled to the due process which the Garda Ombudsman Commission will apply to the complaint.  Other powers and responsibilities have been given to the Garda Ombudsman Commission which it must carry out in the public interest, and it is entirely appropriate that it have this power.</P>
        <P>There was a controversy last week into which I will not stray, but comments were made in the House in respect of that incident.  It is inappropriate to suggest that it ought never to happen or that it should not happen.  It is all very well for Senator Ross or the coroners or other bodies to say there is a proliferation of public agencies but an agency such as the Garda Ombudsman Commission was established for a reason.  If there is to be joined-up public service and administration, it is right that the commission should have that power of intervention.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Walsh&rsquo;s comments in respect of timely interventions and that perhaps there should be some restrictions regarding the timing of such interventions.  I would be happy to con<Col N="315"/>sider any suggestions made in that regard once they do not disturb the fundamental position, namely, that the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the other bodies mentioned ought to have the power to ask the coroner to adjourn an inquest.  If it is right for the Garda to do it, why should it not also be right for the Garda Ombudsman Commission or other similar bodies to do it where they are investigating a complaint?</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in section 63 relating to witnesses.  It is a clarification and extension of the power of the coroner to call witnesses, and gives the coroner appropriate powers to ensure that witnesses attend and give evidence.  There is also a welcome provision regarding legal aid.  Some Members said that the circumstances in which legal aid might be granted were not sufficiently clear.  Perhaps the Minister might respond to that.  The Bill sets out various types of deaths in respect of which legal aid could be granted to somebody who wishes to attend an inquest, rather than the aid relating to the means of the person.  That, perhaps, refers back to the legal aid provisions so there might be a relationship between the two provisions which we can deal with later, if necessary.</P>
        <P>The Irish Human Rights Commission proposed to the Minister that garda&iacute; ought not act as coroner&rsquo;s officers where an inquest is dealing with a death that took place in Garda custody.  That proposal has been incorporated in the Bill.  However, the commission also suggested that garda&iacute; should not act as officers where the death had occurred as a result of Garda operations.  That has not been included in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would reconsider this.  Where a death occurs arising from a Garda operation it would not be appropriate for a garda to act as a coroner&rsquo;s officer.</P>
        <P>The important aspect of the legislation is that it sets up a professional service which will operate at a high standard.  We ought to have such a service.  I agree with Senator de B&uacute;rca that it must be well resourced.  Many of us have attended coroners&rsquo; courts where the facilities are inadequate, to say the least, which makes the process even more stressful for the people concerned.  The Minister should ensure that the coroners&rsquo; courts and their facilities are at a high standard so the highest quality service can be provided to the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill.  Unfortunately, unexplained deaths, murders and accidental deaths have become commonplace in our society. There were days in the not too distant past when people would have been shocked and the whole country would have reeled at the circumstances of such deaths.  Nowadays we have become more and more attuned to modern day <Col N="316"/>living and accidental deaths.  It is obvious that reform of the current system is long overdue.</P>
        <P>The Minister said in his speech that he could jump back 150 years.  Certain parts of the system are medieval to say the least.  Last year coroners dealt with 11,142 cases, and from them we had 2,085 inquests.  That adds to the argument that we need a full-time coroner&rsquo;s service.  In that regard I welcome this Bill.  The coroner service must be professionally run.  The aspects of the Bill that deal with administration and so on are overdue, but are widely welcomed.  Members of the public do not feel that they are dealt with professionally in the Coroner&rsquo;s Court.  This Bill redresses this situation and for that it is welcome.</P>
        <P>The coroners are concerned that we appear to fail in this Bill to separate the administrative, investigative and quasi-judicial functions of the coroner.  That is something on which I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment.  Perhaps the coroner&rsquo;s rules could address this area.</P>
        <P>However, this legislation represents a comprehensive overhaul of the system.  I welcome the fact that this will be regionally based and I would ask that the coroner&rsquo;s appointed will have local knowledge.  If the coroner appointed is no longer the local person appointed by the county councils, we must ensure that a coroner with local knowledge is appointed.  That is very important.  When we are moving from 42 offices to a regional basis we need to be mindful of that.</P>
        <P>The greater powers the coroner will have to investigate the wider circumstances of a death, as opposed to the narrow powers currently there are welcome.  It will bring a whole new facet into the investigation.</P>
        <P>The process whereby the coroner will be allowed to make a recommendation is a very welcome development in this Bill.  It will allow the coroner to comment.  Senator Walsh mentioned suicide in his thoughtful submission on the Bill.  It is very important that we can comment on certain aspects of suicide cases, to suggest for example that this should not happen again or to speak on matters of public importance.  The example that springs to mind is the example of the Wexford coroner commenting on the aspects of the deaths of the Grace family, Sharon Grace and her two little daughters.  He was widely criticised for it.  However, it is important  the coroner has that power because it can ensure that certain suicide cases will not happen again.</P>
        <P>The most important point, when we bring everything together in this Bill is that family members are given a status and the coroner is obliged to keep them informed of developments.  It is humane and certainly within the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights.  A criticism of the current system is that families are not briefed.  Ultimately, the ability to impart more information to families will assist in what is a tragic circumstance for any family.</P><Col N="317"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Walsh when he says that perhaps we could look at the timeframe and include time limits into the Bill.  It would be a cause of concern for the ombudsman, the Garda and so on, whose involvement is crucial, that matters would be delayed.  Such delays in inquests mean that family members suffer because they cannot get on with their lives.  We need to guard against that and I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on it.</P>
        <P>I hope the interim measure of a certificate of the fact of death will be accepted by insurance companies, banks, etc. as a substitute until the death certificate is issued.  This issue was raised by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  I have queries regarding the Legal Aid Board in the context of the Bill on which I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>Remuneration of barristers, solicitors, medical practitioners and such people is vital to ensure they partake in the process and to avoid a situation where we cannot recruit coroners for the posts.  Budgetary aspects must be examined to ensure a smooth transition.  I will welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the aspects of this that have been agreed.  It is important given that, in being asked to take on the role of coroner, people are being asked to forgo what could be potentially a lucrative career.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a fundamental change and improvement of the current coronial death investigation system.  I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Frances Fitzgerald.  I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for staying to listen to Members&rsquo; contributions.  I am aware of his busy schedule.</P>
        <P>In my brief contribution, I wish to emphasise and focus on the impact on families of the deceased.  I have seen at first hand, as I am sure have many public representatives, the stress and trauma families suffer when a family member dies in tragic circumstances and during the fulfilment of the inquest process.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael welcomes the general thrust of the Bill which certainly will streamline and modernise what has been and <i>ad hoc</i> system to date, the excellent service coroners have given notwithstanding.  It is important in passing legislation to provide the resources to deliver on its provisions.  There is no point in doing otherwise.  Unless we deliver to the families, where it matters, there is no point in legislating in this area.  It is excellent to have the Bill before us but we should see proper resources given to coroners to carry out the functions given to them under this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The post mortem process needs to be subject to serious analysis.  Senator Jim Walsh and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen said there were significant delays in results being returned from post mortems, which causes much unnecessary stress for <Col N="318"/>families.  I am aware where people were told it could take up to nine months to have toxicology reports returned.  This is unacceptable.  The circumstances were tragic and thanks to the intervention of the Ombudsman, the reports were returned within two months.   A genuine attempt is being made through this legislation to address these problems.</P>
        <P>The legislation has the potential to be excellent in that it gives coroners the resources they require to provide a professional and more modern service.  We should remember that the coroner service is one for the living, for those left behind.  I am glad to be a Member of the House to see the legislation being passed and I will watch it carefully in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his new portfolio and wish him well in it.  There is a specific issue to which I draw his attention in the context of the Bill and in which I ask him to take a particular interest to see what he can do through the legislation that would be of assistance.  The issue is suicide recording practices.  The Bill is relevant to this and perhaps the Minister and his officials would examine the legislation in this context to see whether any amendments to it are necessary or whether it is a question of practice.  In addition, during his discussion with the coroners, he should examine what would be helpful in this area.  As we know, suicide and self-harm is a significant public health issue.  For example, 493 deaths by suicide occurred in 2004, and nearly 11,000 episodes of self-harm were recorded in our accident and emergency departments.  This is a major issue, and there are many agencies dealing with it &mdash; the Irish Association of Suicidology, the National Office for Suicide Prevention, and the National Suicide Research Foundation &mdash; and much work being done.  We also have a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention.  There is currently a proposal to establish a national inquiry into suicide in Ireland, in which the coroners could play an interesting and useful role.  There is also discussion of a pilot project involving a number of coroners in Cork.  The Minister&rsquo;s Department should encourage this and make sure the project takes place.</P>
        <P>The new Coroners Bill and the management structure proposed within it offer the opportunity to collect more robust, systematic data on suicide at a personal level, and aggregate it nationally so that better figures are available.  This would provide more information from a socio-demographic point of view, which could be used to plan proper prevention programmes.  The type of systematic data collection that is made possible by this Bill would thus allow for a more uniform approach to inquest hearings, which would be extremely helpful.</P><Col N="319"/>
        <P>There are several questions which the Minister might consider and return to at a later stage.  Does the Bill allow for the collection of psychological autopsy data, as suggested by the NSRF scoping study, which could then be passed on and aggregated at a national level?  This would be extremely helpful.  The question of increased support for the bereaved is also mentioned in the Bill.  Will the chief coroner, for example, have the ability to select appropriately qualified staff to undertake this sensitive task?  Another issue the Minister might consider is that the coroners currently work to a criminal definition of suicide, which requires establishment beyond reasonable doubt.  A more socially relevant civil law approach would be the test of balance of probabilities, which would allow more actual suicides to be recorded as such.  Would the power of the chief coroner under section 14 allow him or her to make such a submission to the relevant Minister?  There are a number of ways in which, either by amendment to the legislation or perhaps a guide to practice, a useful contribution could be made in the area of suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>Section 9 contains the phrase &ldquo;contribute to the enhancement of public health and safety&rdquo;.  Would the Minister consider an amendment along the lines of, &ldquo;by facilitating the use of information obtained in inquests for the purpose of a national inquiry into suicide deaths and other deaths leading to a coroner&rsquo;s inquest&rdquo;?  Such an addition would be helpful at that point.  In addition, the Minister might consider amending section 48 so that an inquiry is allowed if it would be helpful at an individual level for the next of kin or, at a more general level, for public health and safety.  This would also present an opportunity to collect useful data and it would be helpful if the criteria to allow coroners to do so were built into the legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider these issues when the Bill reaches Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was following the debate in my office and I had not intended to contribute, but there are a few points I would like to make.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  As someone who was unfortunate enough to have had to attend the Coroner&rsquo;s Court when my husband died a number of years ago, I have first-hand experience in this area.  I wish to put on record the excellent service of coroners all over the country &mdash; those professional men and women who, under very difficult circumstances, deal with people such as myself.  Senator Paudie Coffey mentioned the terrible delay in obtaining post mortems, and he is right.  People must wait for the post mortem while they are torn apart with grief.  They are in another world, and suddenly they are caught up with all of this.  It is a terrible time for people who are going through it.  It is the loneliest thing in the world to get into <Col N="320"/>one&rsquo;s car in Sligo and drive to Dublin to obtain a death certificate, particularly for people who are left with young children or mothers and fathers who lose a son or daughter.  It is a terrible time in people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to consider incorporating in the Bill a provision for support services, as mentioned by Senator Frances Fitzgerald, in order that people who are going through this process will have an idea of what lies ahead on the morning of the inquest.  People who are not familiar with a court set-up are completely ignorant &mdash; they do not even know who they will meet in the court, and they are not familiar with the surroundings or with the people who will be there.  From that point of view, it would be helpful if people who are going through this could have an idea of what is going on.  In my case, the coroner concerned had a word with me a couple of weeks before the inquest and told me what was going to happen.  I was lucky in that my case was dealt with quickly, simply because there were not many other cases, but in this day and age there are many more cases because of the society in which we live.  It is part and parcel of what we have to go through.  A process should be introduced by which people in this predicament can obtain support and information on what is happening.  I did not know there would be a jury, and I did not know that anyone from the Live Register could serve on a jury.  There is a panel, but if they cannot fill the jury from the panel, they go out on the street and bring in people.  It would have been helpful for me to know this.  It is worth bearing in mind this sort of thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for the broad welcome they gave this measure.  Many good points were made, and they can be made again on Committee Stage.  I propose to examine with care what the Senators have said between now and Committee Stage, and investigate how the concerns of different Senators, although some of them were conflicting, may be addressed.</P>
        <P>In a sense, the whole thrust of this legislation is to address concerns such as those raised by Senator Geraldine Feeney.  The Bill is designed to provide more backup for coroners, as well as a modern code of legislation under which to operate.  These are the two essential features of this legislation.  Senator Eugene Regan brought the debate off to a good start by welcoming the Bill and, like the good counsel he is, observed the Second Stage convention.  He did not dwell on the details of the Bill, but raised one pertinent point echoed only by Senator Paudie Coffey, which is the matter of resourcing.  Indicative figures of the type of funding involved are given in the explanatory memorandum, and I intend to engage in a detailed analysis, with my officials, of how we can <Col N="321"/>fund this operation.  As always, it is not just about the allocation of resources, but also the efficient use of our public service resources.  These issues must be considered in the context of the implementation of this Bill.</P>
        <P>As I do not intend to go through all the points raised, I hope Senators will forgive me if I do not touch on everything.  Senator Jim Walsh mentioned the appointment of coroners.  It has been traditional to appoint coroners from the medical or legal profession.  However, the ideal coroner would be qualified in both.  It has been the experience of many practitioners that a coroner who has a qualification in both of these areas is very well suited to the position.  That said, we do not require it because few people in the country have both qualifications and of those who do, some engage in extremely lucrative occupations.  It is difficult to find someone who has both qualifications.  In the case of a person with legal qualifications we should examine how the deficit on the medical side can be made up and for a person with medical qualifications how the deficit on the legal side can be made up.  This is highly skilled work and requires a professional qualification.</P>
        <P>The coroner will receive the support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when required.  At present, coroners are dependent in an informal way on the services of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  One purpose of the Bill is to ensure that a coroner&rsquo;s staff do the work relating to the summonsing and notification of witnesses and jurors.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh raised the issue of suicide which has always been a reportable death and will continue to be so.  Senator Fitzgerald asked whether we can structure this legislation to ensure information about this topic is available to those valuable research bodies which engage in social research on this subject.  I will consider it but I am not sure whether it requires a formal statutory setting.  At a minimum we must ensure the legislation does not inhibit such research and that such information can be made available.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised a number of points better addressed on Committee Stage.  One point both he and Senator de B&uacute;rca raised was the independence of coroners in the performance of their functions, which the Bill ensures and enshrines.  We can review the Bill on Committee Stage if Senators are concerned this principle is not entrenched to a sufficient degree.  It is my intention in tabling the Bill to ensure coroners have independence and there is no question of it being interfered with.</P>
        <P>On an associated subject, Senator de B&uacute;rca asked why juries will be retained when the tendency in many common law jurisdictions is to dispense with the requirement for a jury.  The European Court of Human Rights insists that in certain circumstances we should have this element of public participation in the inquiry.  Other common law jurisdictions such as New <Col N="322"/>Zealand and Australia are not parties to the European Convention on Human Rights and are freer to legislate in this area than we are.  A case can be made for not having juries but a position was arrived at in Strasbourg and I propose to respect it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ross referred to consultation with coroners.  I am advised they have been in extensive and on-going consultation with the Department on the shape and content of the Bill and that my predecessor met the Coroners Society of Ireland on a number of occasions to discuss the reform.  I am open to discussions with them about it and I have no difficulty with it.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White commended the coroners as did Senator McDonald, for which I thank them.  In discussing legislative reform and improving practices one may sound as though one does not acknowledge the tremendous work done under difficult circumstances by coroners.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White also raised a number of other issues.  One matter of substance and current controversy which he touched on is the issue of the adjournment of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest at the instigation of a statutory body.  A balance must be struck and it is important that we get it right in the Bill.  It is important that statutory bodies with inquiries to conduct can conduct them.  It is also important that in appropriate circumstance coroners can get on with their business.  Senator Alex White summarised very well the need for this balance.  I am prepared to examine the details of the legislation on Committee Stage to see whether we can calibrate this balance correctly.</P>
        <P>I have gone through most of the points of substance.  Many points were made which would be more appropriately addressed on Committee Stage.  I propose to read the transcript of this debate and revisit these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  Last week, Fine Gael used its Private Members&rsquo; time in the Seanad to debate health.  We focused on the need to restore confidence in cancer services.  In a number of instances patients were misdiagnosed, errors occurred in mammograms and we had questionable treatment practices in some hospitals.</P>
        <P>A somewhat worrying situation was reported in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> and elsewhere regarding the accuracy of cervical smear tests.  The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> reported that a number of cervical smear tests which were sent to the United States by the HSE for analysis had to be sent back for review after staff at Cork University Hospital discovered at least two patients were at risk of cervical cancer.  The smear test for one of these patients was previously diagnosed as negative.</P>
        <P>The HSE has had a business link with Quest Diagnostics in Texas since last January.  I understand this arose because laboratories in Ireland could not deal in sufficient time with the volume of cases and tests sent for analysis.  Women had to wait a long time for results and the solution was to go to Quest Diagnostics in Texas.  What is the cost of this exercise?  It was predicted that approximately 25,000 tests would be processed in total.  The contract signed by the HSE stated 2,000 slides at a time would be sent to Quest Diagnostics from Cork University Hospital, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  This involves tests from throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In principle one might argue there is nothing wrong with this until one realises the method of rescreening slides in the United States differs significantly from Irish methods.  In the United States only 20% of negative cases are rescreened whereas the recommended procedure in Ireland states all negative tests are rescreened.  This means the HSE allowed the safeguards put in place to maximise the accuracy of results and increase patient safety to be diluted in this business deal.</P>
        <P>Through a freedom of information request the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> established that problems with translating the results sent back to the United States also arose earlier in the year.  This was due to the difference in testing and reporting methods in the United States and Ireland, a matter I raised some months ago.  If we send tests away we must be careful to ensure the methodologies used are the same.  General practitioners <Col N="324"/>had difficulties assessing the results which came back.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State outline to the House what action the Minister for Health and Children has taken on this matter?  Are tests still sent away?  Have concerns been raised about the difference in the way the tests are done in the United States and the different criteria used for retesting and analysing the results?  It could lead to misunderstandings and has the potential to put women&rsquo;s lives at risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising this important issue.  I will reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who is unavoidably absent.</P>
        <P>To address unacceptable delays in processing smear tests, from January this year, the Health Service Executive outsourced the processing of more than 35,000 smear tests to a fully accredited United States laboratory.  Quest Diagnostics Corporation in the US is College of Pathologists and clinical laboratory improvement amendment approved.  This means that its laboratory facilities are inspected and accredited by the College of Pathologists which is a deeming authority recognised by the federal authorities to visit and inspect every two years.  It has stringent and detailed quality monitoring processes and is internationally recognised.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed the Department of Health and Children that these tests were all processed and reported on by the end of June.  The HSE has confirmed that all laboratories are achieving a turnaround time of four to five weeks in the reporting of smear tests.  In all laboratories, before a result is issued, a rapid 60 second review of every negative and unsatisfactory smear is done as part of normal quality assurance procedures.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that a smear test is not a diagnostic test.  The limitations of cervical screening are such that there may be false negative and false positive results.  It should also be noted that more than 80% of smears taken are reported negative or no abnormality detected, requiring no follow up for the client.  Since the introduction of liquid-based cytology, the rate of unsatisfactory reports has dropped on average from 10% to below 3%.  All Irish public laboratories have converted to liquid-based cytology with the exception of Cork University Hospital where this process is under way.  Medial laboratory scientists sign out negative smears and pathologists sign out all the abnormal cases.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  The Minister allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;5 million to the national cancer scre<Col N="325"/>ening service this year for the roll-out of the Irish cervical screening programme, and an additional 30 posts have been approved. The programme will commence national roll-out in January 2008.</P>
        <P>The national cancer screening service plans to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme &mdash; call-recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy<b> </b>and treatment services &mdash; will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.</P>
        <P>Roll-out of the programme will be based on a turnaround time of four weeks for programme smears.  The service is developing new contractual arrangements for tests in 2008 which will include service level agreements to achieve this objective.  It has the Minister&rsquo;s support in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for leave to speak on this issue.  It came to light in recent weeks when the imposition of a car parking charge at railway stations led to an increase in the cost of commuting by 40% for some train users.  Last week, the cost of commuting at Stamullen, County Meath, increased by &euro;250 per year owing to the imposition of a car parking charge at that rail station.  Similar charges are being introduced across the country.  Charges have recently been introduced in Mallow and Ennis and one is imminent in Arklow.  I accept these car parks have recently been upgraded, paid for in part by a subsidy of &euro;150 million to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  My question is not about the concept of car parking charges <i>per se </i>but about the unregulated and arbitrary way in which car park charges can be announced on a Friday, introduced on a Monday and increased a few short months later.</P>
        <P>Stamullen is a new commuter village which has little employment.  Therefore, people&rsquo;s focus is on travelling to and from Dublin every day.  For those who want to use the train, driving to the coastal station of Gormanstown, two miles away, is part of the commute.  It is not just about getting the train.  It is about getting the car, parking the car and boarding the train.</P>
        <P>Last December, the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, was asked to provide a 10% increase in CIE fares.  He virtually laughed the company out of the office and granted an increase of 2.75%.  At the time, his Department said that in reaching his decision, the Minister said he wanted to encourage and support passengers who choose public transport as their commuting option.  Clearly his policy was to try to encourage the use of public transport at a reasonable cost.  Given that the cost of driving to the railway station and car parking charges at the station <Col N="326"/>form part of the commute, it is clear he wanted that policy implemented and fares kept down.</P>
        <P>It is unclear whether car parking charges lie outside the remit of the Minister and if they form part of the fare regulation regime.  I seek clarification whether car park charges form part of the fare-setting process.  If they are not regulated, there is nothing to stop Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann increasing car parking charges in December by 10% or 20% at railway stations such as Stamullen, Mallow or Ennis.  What I seek is a statement from the Minister on car parking charges.  Are they part of the fare regulation regime and, if not, does he intend to make them part of that regime to keep the cost of commuting down and encourage the use of public transport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Hannigan for raising this issue.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is unavoidably absent.</P>
        <P>The provision and management of car parks is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I can see no value in introducing a new layer of regulation providing for ministerial control in this area. New facilities are being provided to public transport customers at a very reasonable price in line with the Dublin Transportation Office guidelines.</P>
        <P>The modest charges recently introduced are significantly lower than that charged by local authorities for on-street parking, for parking at local authority and private facilities adjacent to rail stations or the fee for Luas commuters, which is &euro;4 per day.</P>
        <P>It must be borne in mind that in many instances where parking is free, it is abused.  People who are not rail users are taking up spaces at railway stations to avoid paying parking fees imposed by local authorities and-or private operators.  This gives rise to rail commuters having to park in residential areas some distance from rail stations, causing a nuisance for residents.  It can also discourage people from using trains because they cannot park in a safe, secure car park at the station.</P>
        <P>Where these new improved services are opened, a minimal charge has been introduced of &euro;2 per day or &euro;5 per week to cover operational and security costs, to discourage non-rail users from taking spaces and to reserve spaces for those who must use a car to access the station.  The charges are in line with the guiding principles for the implementation of rail-based park and ride developed by the Dublin Transportation Office.  These provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that rail users only should use park and ride spaces and may have to pay to use them.  Rail fares generally should not be increased to pay for park and ride.  Those who benefit from park and ride should contribute to the cost of it.</P><Col N="327"/>
        <P>As part of its upgrade of the railway system, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has embarked, with Exchequer support, on a major programme of upgrading its park and ride facilities to benefit its customers.  Park and ride facilities can and do have a positive impact on public transport use and have an important role to play in encouraging people to transfer from private cars to public transport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In considering whether to impose charges for the use of park and ride facilities, providers are expected to take into account a variety of factors, and these would include consideration of the likely impact of charges on use of the facility and, by extension, on public transport use.  Where Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has provided new parking and introduced modest charges for it, there has been no reduction in usage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and appreciate he is responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  The issue was not specifically about the concept of charging for parking but how we can ensure that the car parking charges are regulated and do not increase year by year.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to consider including car parking charges in his remit to control fare levels within inflation levels?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>From reading the script, I understand that the provision and management of car parks is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Surely Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which has the remit of maximising the usage of public transport, should not put a deterrent in the way of customers coming to access its service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not always the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the business concepts will gel and meet together and that maximum use will be made of the public transport facility which has been provided at great cost by taxpayers.  There has been a major upgrade of the rail system in recent years.  I understand it is a day-to-day matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We all want to reduce the layers of bureaucracy and administration rather than adding to them.  However, I will take the issue raised by the Senator back to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>My motion relates to the metro north project.  Before addressing the point, I stress the principles I seek to have addressed, which are first, accountability &mdash; we need to know who is responsible for major <Col N="328"/>decisions about the taxpayers&rsquo; money, and second, transparency &mdash; we need to be clear how the money is being spent and the purposes for which it is being spent.</P>
        <P>The history of metro north is very clear.  The need for such a project was identified in 1992.  It then became part of the Transport 21 initiative in 2005 with its funding identified in the current national development plan.  The total funding provided in that plan for public transport is approximately &euro;12.6 billion, which leads me on to the cost of the metro project.  The last time such figures were made clearly and proactively available by the Government was in 2002 when the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, identified the cost at approximately &euro;1.2 billion.  Since then, successive Ministers have refused to confirm or deny such a figure.  It was only earlier this year that a freedom of information request seemed inadvertently to obtain a figure of &euro;4.6 billion.  If this figure is correct it would make the metro north project the largest single project ever undertaken in the history of the State.  As such the degree of debate and scrutiny on it needs to be heightened.</P>
        <P>The second relevant piece of information on the matter came from the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, recently, when he identified that he expected 34 million passengers to use the metro every year and for approximately 41,000 cars to be taken off the road.  In placing the motion before the House I have simply joined those pieces together to raise a number of points in need of response from the Government.  If the &euro;4.6 billion figure is correct &mdash; the Government has neither confirmed nor denied it &mdash; the cost per taxpayer will be at least &euro;22 per trip based on work I have had done independently.  If that is correct the cost will be more than five times the equivalent trip on the Luas.  That point needs to be discussed and teased out.</P>
        <P>The passenger figures released by the Government of 34 million trips per year indicate a degree of success that are multiples of what similar projects enjoy in other countries.  If the figure was correct and the figure of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, of 41,000 cars being taken off the road by the metro was correct, it would mean that 42% of car trips in the vicinity of the metro will go into the metro.  If that is true, the nearest figure we have for other metro projects in Europe are for Madrid, which estimated 22% and Sheffield, which estimated a similar project at 21%.  Many other projects across the UK have a displacement rate of approximately 12% to 13%.  The assumption we have on the numbers of passengers who will use the metro are at least twice the best performance of a similar project elsewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All those points lead to three simple questions addressed in the motion and on which I would appreciate a response.  These are all policy issues and not operational matters for the RPA.  Can <Col N="329"/>the Minister of State confirm that the cost of &euro;4.6 billion is correct?  If that cost is correct this will be the biggest project the country has ever undertaken.  Taxpayers and Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to know that figure.  Can the Minister of State confirm whether a cost-benefit analysis of the project has been completed and whether the Government will make it available to public and Oireachtas scrutiny before a planning application is lodged by An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the end of the year?  Can the Minister of State give a commitment on behalf of the Government that as the project really heats up the RPA&rsquo;s commitment to working with the local community and sharing relevant information in a timely fashion will be deepened.  The local community in the area where the metro will be located is concerned about many aspects of the project and wants these matters addressed.</P>
        <P>I am looking for a response on these policy issues as to how taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent on the largest project we have ever undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond on behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, who is unavoidably absent.  Metro north is a core part of the investment strategy set out in Transport 21 to provide a modern, high quality and high capacity public transport system to address the transport needs of the greater Dublin area.  It is a critical project not only in meeting existing transport needs but in providing the transport infrastructure required to provide for future growth.  Current projections are that the population in the Fingal area is set to double in the next 20 years and the absence of the high capacity transport infrastructure provided by metro north would represent acceptance of rapidly increasing congestion and deterioration in the Dublin area as a place in which to do business and live.</P>
        <P>Metro north will provide a rapid, high-capacity, high-frequency link between Dublin city centre and Swords via Dublin Airport.  Initially, an estimated 34 million passengers a year will travel on this service, with trains every four minutes and the estimated journey time from the city centre to Dublin airport will be less than 20 minutes.  It will address a major deficit in public transport infrastructure in north Dublin by providing a high-capacity rail-based connection from the central Fingal area to the city centre.  It will significantly enhance transport access to locations such as Dublin Airport, Mater Hospital and DCU and play a key role in the provision of an integrated rail-based public transport network through interchanges with Luas at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and with suburban rail at Drumcondra and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  Metro north, together with the Luas green line, also provides a new north-south spine to the rail infrastructure in Dublin, with a much wider catchment area than the DART.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>It will provide park and ride sites at key locations along the route.  This means metro north will benefit people from far beyond its immediate catchment area.  There is a clear decision-making process laid out for major projects like metro north.  All of these projects must comply with the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s capital appraisal and public private partnership guidelines.  This has been done in the case of metro north.  A statutory railway order process is then followed so that the relevant powers to build these projects can be obtained from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Work is now well under way by the Railway Procurement Agency on the preparation of an environmental impact statement and the documentation required to support an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a railway order.  There will be a full opportunity for people to object or offer views and there will be a public hearing to air all the relevant issues.  It will be entirely a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to decide whether to grant a railway order.</P>
        <P>Metro north must also follow a rigorous EU-mandated public procurement process.  Only when this process is complete will we be aware of the full and final likely cost of the project.  It is also important that the State&rsquo;s capacity to obtain full value for money from a competitive procurement process is not prejudiced by setting out in advance what we may be prepared to pay for such infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Last month the Railway Procurement Agency announced the outcome of the first stage of the procurement process for metro north which involved the selection of those candidates who have been pre-qualified for the tender stage of the project.  In all, 14 candidates have passed the pre-qualifying stage &mdash; four infrastructure providers, five rolling stock providers and five operators.  Qualified candidates have until 2 November to form bidding groups.  When the outcome of the statutory approval and public procurement processes are known the final business case for the projects will be submitted to Government for decision.  The Government will judge all the factors &mdash; cost, economic evaluation results, land use and transport rationale when making its decision.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government will publish full information on the business case for these projects and the factors taken into account in making decisions on them in due course.  This will be done when there is no danger that it will have a negative impact on the State&rsquo;s ability to get best value for money through the public procurement process.  The basis for the Government decision will be transparent but it will be handled in such a way as to avoid compromising the State&rsquo;s commercial interests and, by extension, the interests of all taxpayers.  Therefore, while I am confident Transport 21 includes an appropriate budget provision for the implementation of metro north, I cannot release details <Col N="331"/>of the cost or other commercially sensitive material relating to the project.  To do so at this stage would impact on the procurement process and potentially prejudice the State&rsquo;s capacity to derive maximum value for money from such a competitive procurement process.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  My party and I are deeply committed to the concept of superb public transport and we recognise the role of the metro in this regard.  The Minister of State said the detailed business case process will commence following the completion of the planning process when the outcome of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la application will be known.  That work should be done <Col N="332"/>now to ensure the correct criteria are laid down for those who will tender for the project.  Ways must be found to ensure the Oireachtas and the public are informed regarding the cost of major projects that will be paid for by many generations to come without commercial interests being infringed.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State conveyed to the Minister for Transport and the Marine my desire that the RPA work as collaboratively and transparently as possible with the surrounding communities because that is badly needed.</P>
