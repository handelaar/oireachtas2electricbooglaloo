	<P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding for Choices Local Enterprises, a community service that provides transport to elderly people to enable them to collect pensions, visit doctors, socialise and engage in shopping.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brennan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on a request for assessment on Old Monastery CBS buildings, Adare, as part of future education needs of Scoil Naomh Iosaf, Adare, County Limerick.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reasons the automatic entitlement of 2.5 resource hours per academic week for children diagnosed with Down&rsquo;s syndrome on entry to national school was withdrawn; who recommended the withdrawal; and if the Minister recognises that children denied this previously automatic right regress in their formative years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prioritise Granard, County Longford, as a location for a new factory, to advance its development and meet the needs of the increasing population.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Norris, Brennan and John Paul Phelan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. <Col N="766"/> Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Defamation Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5 p.m.; No. 2, National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude no later than 5.45 p.m.; and No. 3, Building Control Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 5.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 8 p.m., with spokespersons having 15 minutes, other Senators having ten minutes, and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree with the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader.  The rescheduling of the debates makes sense in terms of the time allocation.</P>
        <P>I raise the tragedy that came upon 24 year old Derek O&rsquo;Toole in Lucan last Sunday morning.  I do not wish to comment on or prejudice the ongoing investigation and the possibility that charges may well arise from the case.  I raise the issue in terms of how the media dealt with the case.  Senators will recall that Mrs. O&rsquo;Toole, the young man&rsquo;s mother, appeared on radio and television rightly lambasting some element within either the Garda or the media who put it about that her son was well known to the Garda and that he had criminal convictions.  When such cases come to the public attention we need to realise the trauma that is visited on the family, and whoever is engaged in such insidious spinning behind the scenes must take responsibility for his or her actions.  It is outrageous that kind of spinning machine was put in place against that young man who, tragically, died in Lucan last Sunday morning.  While everyone wants to get to the truth of this matter and everyone encourages that independent investigation to continue until its conclusion, we all have a responsibility to condemn in absolute terms that insidious spinning machine that took place against that young man over 12 or 24 hours on Monday.</P>
        <P>I have repeatedly asked the Government to come forward with a view on the potential of the forthcoming referendum on children.  I note from today&rsquo;s newspapers that the Government is considering asking all parties to commit to a referendum in the autumn period rather than before the election.  It is important the Government make a statement in the House this week and that a period of, say, an hour would be provided for the Minister with responsibility for children to make a statement on whether there will be a referendum.  The cat and mouse game has to end.  I ask the Leader to provide time for such a debate in the course of this week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the first point raised by Senator Brian Hayes except that I do not believe it was a spinning machine but rather bad media coverage.  It was not just a young man who was supposed to be known to the Garda but there was also supposed to be a drunk Garda off duty.  The reporting of the incident was wrong in all sorts of ways.  In the first report I got the clear impression that a young man who had a criminal background was chased by a Garda who was drunk.  It was quite appalling in terms of what we know now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; Seachtain na Gaeilge le bheith ann an tseachtain seo chugainn, agus ba mhaith an rud go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar aon pholasaithe i leith na Gaoluinne ar mhaith leis an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.  T&aacute; ruda&iacute; curtha i gcl&oacute; aige le c&uacute;pla m&iacute; anuas nach bhfuil aon d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht d&eacute;anta orthu.  For instance, there are ten progressive steps, ruda&iacute; ar ch&oacute;ir a dh&eacute;anamh don nGaoluinn, agus ba mhaith an rud go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar na molta&iacute; sin anseo.  It would be appropriate to do so now in recognition of Seachtain na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks I have called for a debate on a number of issues in relation to education, including the lack of funds in that area.  We had a useful debate last week on a report which concerned many people.  The Leader will recall difficult times in education in the late 1980s when it was necessary to have certain cutbacks, particularly in the area of general purpose rooms and PE halls.  People understood there was a difficulty at the time and they put up with it.  In the intervening period this matter became a priority and it was being dealt with, as we thought, until we saw this report yesterday.  We now find there is an appalling lack of PE facilities in primary schools throughout the country.  Some 80% of schools in Donegal do not have a PE hall or access to indoor PE facilities of any description, while 63% of schools in Clare and 70% of schools in Kerry lack such facilities.  It is appalling that we cannot develop the curriculum at a time when we are worried about obesity in children and children being too sedentary.  At a time when there is not enough activity or enough safe areas for activity, the need for PE facilities, PE halls and general purpose rooms in schools was never so important.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Children outline to us her plans on this matter.  There appears to be a reversal in the programme for Government on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Government published the bio-energy action plan for Ireland.  I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have a debate on it, in advance of the publication of the White Paper, because some useful suggestions could be made by Members.  We have a responsibility, as we look to the future to protect our environment, to take steps such as those outlined by the Minister in the bio-energy action plan yes<Col N="768"/>terday.  I would appreciate if we could have a debate on this as a matter of urgency.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the report by the National Economic and Social Forum on improving the delivery of quality public services, which was published a little over a week ago.  We need to raise standards in a significant number of areas, as outlined in that report.  A crazy situation exists with regard to the quality of services delivered to the public.  Answering machines have taken over and a huge lack of courtesy is shown to the public in this area.  This is particularly evident in respect of Eircom, which I tried to contact last week about an elderly person who experienced a fault with their telephone line.  I spent three quarters of an hour trying to get through.  The same situation arises with the HSE and the ESB and when one is trying to obtain bus timetables from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Answering services are provided everywhere and there is no accountability to the public.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>What will we get when we call the Senator?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue must be addressed, as it has been in the NESC report.  What came across very clearly is the existence of a huge deficit of courtesy shown to the public.  There needs to be a better relationship between the providers and users of public services.  The Government has seemingly washed its hands of this issue and nobody seems to take control and deliver a better service to the general public.  What is happening is a blight on our country.  When one speaks to people from other European countries who come here, one discovers that the situation in these countries is not the same.  There is some degree of courtesy and there is a limit with regard to the length of time it takes to answer a person.  Eircom is one of the worst performers in this area and the way in which it treats the public is annoying.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point is adequately made.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I also saw the television interview with Mrs. O&rsquo;Toole and heard her heartfelt appeal for fair play for her son and his memory.  I think everyone would agree that she spoke as a loving mother and it was clear that she was devastated.  She told her story without any embellishment.  She did not hand out blame to anyone but she wanted the truth.</P>
        <P>The idea that somebody would spin that story before the truth came out and suggest that in some way that young man was, as they put it, &ldquo;known to the garda&iacute;&rdquo; questions the entire justice system in this country.  It also questions the responsibility of some sections of the media.  I know some of the relatives of Mrs. O&rsquo;Toole in my part of the country and I can attest that they are decent, respectable people.  It should not be for<Col N="769"/>gotten that professional people who came forward to mention this young man also mentioned his charity and the manner in which he went about helping others who had the same disease.  This matter should not be put on the long finger but should be dealt with urgently, not just for the sake of Mrs. O&rsquo;Toole and the memory of her son but for all concerned citizens in this country.  If this is allowed to continue, we will no longer trust what we hear from certain sources.  Nor will we trust sections of the media after what has happened in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to raise the tragic death of Derek O&rsquo;Toole and how it is being dealt with by the Garda.  What happened took place in Lucan in my constituency and Derek O&rsquo;Toole was, and his family are, constituents of mine.  There is a need for an independent element of any investigation carried out into Derek O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s death, all the circumstances surrounding it and the media coverage of it.  Such an investigation is needed because of the questions that have been raised.  Senator Brian Hayes referred to this matter.  For example, the fact that the parents were given so little information and the blackening of Derek O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s good character by the phrase that he was known to the Garda.</P>
        <P>The mere fact that a garda was involved in a fatal road collision means there should be an independent element to any investigation.  Yesterday, I looked at reports on the website of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  That office routinely carries out investigations into fatal road collisions in which members of the PSNI have been involved.  Perhaps this case would merit that type of investigation by the new Garda Ombudsman Commission.  This would ensure public confidence in any investigation carried out.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission was set up over a year ago.  I read in the <i>Evening Herald</i> yesterday that it will be up and running in two months&rsquo; time.  Is there a possibility it could have a role in regard to this investigation?  With all the questions that have been raised about this case, there is a need for an independent element to any investigation that takes place.</P>
        <P>An article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on a report by the expert group on future skills which refers to the need for 500,000 workers to progress by at least one level of their educational attainment by 2020.  The Government needs to give more priority to this issue.  Our economy is too dependent on factors which are not sustainable, for example, the construction industry, which appears to be artificially maintained at its current level.  We must examine providing the workforce with proper skills, especially older workers.</P>
        <P>My inquiries on behalf of a constituent will be of interest to Senator White and other Senators.  He is over 65 years of age and is in receipt of the State pension.  In view of this he is not entitled to the back to education allowance that is available <Col N="770"/>to people on many other social welfare payments.  This is discrimination and it should be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The national skills strategy report has raised some fundamental challenges which I am sure will be embraced with enthusiasm by the Government and turned into opportunities.  If one takes the main elements of the report and the key challenges that have been identified, initiatives are already significantly under way to address them in the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Examples include the determination to increase the participation level of students in higher education from 55% to 72% and to ensure that all students, to the maximum extent possible, do the leaving certificate or its equivalent.  Many initiatives have also been pioneered by the City of Dublin VEC, such as the ESOL programme and other literacy programmes that are funded by the Government to help foreign nationals.  In some cases, these programmes cater to 28 different nationalities.</P>
        <P>I accept the lacunas identified by Senator O&rsquo;Toole in different counties need to be addressed.  Tomorrow night will afford an ample opportunity for us to address them.  A related issue is the manner in which parents drive their children to school in the city and the countryside.  They insist on taking precedence at the school door.  This is a bad habit for parents to form as they are the primary educators of children.  I say this in particular in the context of obesity and other related issues.</P>
        <P>I would welcome an opportunity to have a discussion on the national skills strategy report.  It would be most illuminating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with colleagues in expressing my revulsion at the way in which the story of the young man who tragically met his death in Lucan was treated in the media.  It was stated authoritatively that he was known to the police, which he was not, and that he was a convicted criminal, which he was not either.  His family, so traumatised by this, has no recourse in action.  This afternoon we will deal with the Defamation Bill.  No clause in the Bill covers libelling of the dead, despite the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that this be included, thus allowing close relatives of the deceased to take action with a limit of a period of years.  I propose to table an amendment at the appropriate time to ensure this happens.</P>
        <P>This is not the first time this has happened.  The Leader raised a similar case in tones of horror when a young man, a relative of a sensational murderer, was photographed cycling through the front square of Trinity College.  His name and degree course were printed.  He had done nothing wrong and it was not his fault that his father had a psychopathic past.</P>
        <P>Another case is that of Mr. Liam Lawlor.  Newspapers claimed he was killed in the com<Col N="771"/>pany of a prostitute.  The young woman was fortunate to survive and I hope she mulcts all the newspapers in damages.</P>
        <P>We are approaching International Women&rsquo;s Day and are also in the middle of Lent.  I listened to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; at lunch and, while it is meretricious to raise matters from that show all the time, he sometimes considers important matters.  This Tr&oacute;caire advertisement was one of the best I have heard.  It concerned the manner in which women are discriminated against and listed various categories of discrimination which all had one thing in common, namely, they were perpetrated on women.  Someone objected to this and, for reasons of political correctness, the advertisement has been withdrawn.</P>

	<P>By who?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It stated it was too political.  This is absurd.  We can publish any quantity of lies about dead Irish citizens but we cannot have a reasonable advertisement during Lent from a responsible organisation like Tr&oacute;caire because it is politically incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Norris that the BCI is independent in its functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be subject to standards of decency and reason.  I do not suggest that the Seanad can crack the whip and send the commission to jail but we can question its decisions.  I am merely raising a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only making a point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that and would not like to overstep the mark.  This is the fifth anniversary of a remarkable and immensely moving letter, which we read with great interest, from a woman who had been told that she was carrying a 16 week old foetus with a severe chromosomal abnormality incompatible with life.  The trauma of that news was exacerbated by the fact that she was forced to carry it to term by the State.  She had two other small children and was expected to carry this trauma and all the difficulties this entailed for the other siblings.  She did not advocate what she called &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; but stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am angry that men I do not know and who don&rsquo;t know me ... have decided that my body is their demesne; that they have the right to decide how my family will cope with this very real tragedy; that, regardless of the emotional and physical distress for us, I must do what they want; that their bigoted will rules my body.</P><Col N="772"/>
        <P FLI="0">She challenged this Oireachtas that it has a responsibility to bite the bullet and legislate in this limited area in light of a series of court judgments.  The Seanad, as part of the Oireachtas, is constantly castigated for not living up to its responsibilities.  The same occurred with the domestic partnership Bill recently.  There was a charade whereby it was to be amended in six months, even though we are well aware the Government will be gone by then.  As far as I am concerned, it cannot be gone soon enough.  Let the general election roll on and I hope, for the sake of the country, that we at last get a Government that will not suffer from the indecision and dithering on these important issues displayed by the present Government.</P>

	<P>Finally, there is a group of Kurdish people demonstrating outside the gates of the Oireachtas.  They maintain, apparently on good evidence, that the Kurdish resistance leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has been in prison for some years, is being systematically poisoned.  There appears to be medical evidence of it.  This matter should be examined by the human rights sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, am concerned by the reports that distressed Mrs. O&rsquo;Toole.  I will not go into whether they are spun out of the air or are the result of winks and nods or whispers from sources within the Garda.  I have seen both happen, and both reflect badly on the ethical and professional standards of the people concerned, regardless of their profession.  What I had intended to say has already been said by Senator Tuffy.  I support her comments.  If ever there was a case where public opinion required independent reassurance about an investigation, this is it.  It appears to be a ready-made case for investigation by a Garda ombudsman, if one were in operation.  That is what would happen in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Garda Ombudsman Commission is an independent body and will make its own decisions but could the Leader find out from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he expects that commission to commence operations?  It was established in February 2006.  Nuala O&rsquo;Loan had six months to set up her office, although she regarded that as too short a time. <Col N="773"/> Nevertheless, after 13 months one would have expected that the commission would be ready for business and that the staff would have been trained.  If one were an ombudsman, this would be the case with which to start one&rsquo;s career.  If the commission could be encouraged to look in that direction, it would be helpful to all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bannon&rsquo;s call for a debate on improving services.  I was amazed to learn last week that the Minister for Finance took in more than &euro;500 million in VAT on telecommunications.  The consumer is not getting value for money.  Although the telecommunications companies are privatised, the Oireachtas still has a role in ensuring there is a certain level of service.  Being required to wait 45 minutes to report a fault on a line is not the service anybody envisaged when the telephone company was privatised.  It is important that we debate this issue.</P>
        <P>I heard a radio report that seven venues had been closed down by the Food Safety Authority for breaches in hygiene.  Is it not a pity that the same standards do not apply to our hospitals?  Two weeks ago we heard of a case where a surgeon performed an operation on a patient, unaware that the patient had MRSA.  The hospital had not been informed of it when the patient was transferred there from another hospital.  Last weekend, newspapers reported that an autopsy could not be carried out on a man because Beaumont Hospital failed to inform the Dublin city coroner in time.  In England, an 87 year old woman successfully sued the state and won compensation for its failure to adhere to its infection control policies.  We have the same policies in place but they are not being adhered to.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm has almost thrown his hands up in the air in defeat.  While he has announced a new taskforce will be established, in November 2005 practices to combat MRSA were announced.  Will the recommendations of the new taskforce replace the existing guidelines?  People will unfortunately be forced to take the litigation route before they are taken seriously.  Have we learned any lessons from the Army deafness claims in which solicitors got an unfair share?  Will the Leader find out from the Department of Health and Children the status of the new taskforce?  Why are those infected and badly damaged by MRSA being forced to hire solicitors in litigation with the final expense coming to the taxpayer when a redress scheme should be established?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is as surprised as I am at the speed of the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of Derek O&rsquo;Toole and the recent Lucan tragedy, what he read in the media and the subsequent appeal by the young man&rsquo;s mother.  Everyone knows the phrase &ldquo;known to the garda&iacute;&rdquo; is a loaded one and the meaning behind it.  I believe <Col N="774"/>it was an attempt to smear before the investigation got under way.  Hearing the interview with the young man&rsquo;s mother, I felt all she wanted was fair play.  It is not the media but what information is given to the media.  It was wrong if this was an attempt to smear before the investigation got under way.  The mother was clear that her son was not involved with any underworld grouping or crime.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes also raised the matter of the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  The Opposition asked that it should not be rushed.  From reading the newspapers, I understand the referendum will be in the autumn.  If that is the situation, we should be glad of it.  There must be a debate on the referendum and we will endeavour to have one in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole agreed with Senator Brian Hayes on the matter of the Lucan tragedy.  He asked for a debate on the ten steps of progress during tSeachtain na Gaeilge.  I agree the late 1980s were a difficult time for the education system but we managed to get through them without any scars to our reputations.  He pointed to the lack of physical education facilities in schools and that in some counties 70% of schools have none.  With rising obesity levels among children, there is a need for proper exercise.  I hope this matter can be taken up tomorrow night on Private Members&rsquo; business.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry asked for a debate on the bio-energy action plan published in advance of the White Paper.  Such a debate would be useful.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon highlighted the recent NESF report on improving the delivery of public services which I read and thought was excellent.  It stated people telephoning a public service should be answered properly.  It wants public servants to become advocates for people.  They should be on the side of the consumer rather than the consumer having to constantly push and not get anything.  It reported on the need for courtesy in public servants&rsquo; dealings with the public.  Courtesy, particularly on the telephone, should be an everyday standard.  Rather than the Government giving lessons on courtesy and answering telephones, it should be down to each public service such as Eircom, the HSE or a local authority.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; heard the interview with the mother of the young man recently killed in Lucan.  She made a heart-felt appeal for fair play for her son.  The Senator said that, if there were any spin, it was all wrong.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy also raised the young man&rsquo;s case, stating her desire that confidence in the Garda be restored.  She suggested that the ombudsman might start his career with the case in question.  The Senator said that 500,000 people required further training, according to a recent report, also raising the anomaly whereby pensioners are not entitled to money under the back to work scheme.  Debating the report on further training in the House might be useful since we are <Col N="775"/>undergoing great economic expansion based on construction.  However, that will eventually tail off because it cannot be sustained at this rate for ever, and we should look ahead to determine future needs.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald sought a debate on the national skills strategy report, mentioning the volume of work being done.  He made the sensible observation that parents are driving their children right up to the doors of their schools, where their darlings disembark, and wondered whether they might not simply walk.  I presume that is what he meant, but in many cases it might not be safe for the children and that may be why parents act as they do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris raised libelling the dead, on which matter I believe he is to table an amendment.  He should read Fintan O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s column in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The</i> <i>Irish Times</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator also brought up the advertisement for Tr&oacute;caire, which I did not realise had been pulled.  I know that I listened to it, and once or twice the thought occurred to me that, while it was great for Tr&oacute;caire, the Catholic Church was not about to ordain female priests.  It mentioned how women&rsquo;s lives were blighted by terrible events, but it does not open many doors to them itself.  I do not know why the advertisement was withdrawn, although the Senator supposed that it was too political.  However, it was certainly a good example.</P>
        <P>It is safe to say this now that Senator Norris has left us.  He then embarked upon something of a rant, although I could not get to the bottom of the exact subject.  I do not know what he wanted.</P>

I gathered that much before the Senator took off, resulting in my missing a fair portion thereafter.  He also mentioned a Kurdish opposition leader who he said was being poisoned.  Life is constant excitement for Senator Norris.  He is always coming across exciting matters, and the rest of us are pedestrian and humdrum in comparison.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes spoke of ethical standards, wondering when the Garda Ombudsman Commission would be in operation.  He agreed with Senator Tuffy that the case of the young man in question might provide a good start to the ombudsman&rsquo;s career.</P>
        <P>Senator Browne claimed that consumers were not getting value for money.  He mentioned that seven restaurants had closed and wondered about hospitals.  One cannot simply go about closing hospitals, if that is what he advocates; I would not advocate it.</P>

        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, subsection (3)(<i>a</i>), line 15, after &ldquo;not&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;automatically&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Right" el="5">&mdash; (Senator Norris).<?oasys _is0p10- ?></P>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 may be discussed together by agreement.  Does anyone wish to speak on those amendments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris felt strongly about this amendment, which seeks to insert the word &ldquo;automatically&rdquo;.  He had some concerns in this regard on which he might well want to elucidate <Col N="777"/>himself, rather than me doing it.  Both amendments are more or less connected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With the indulgence of the House, I would like to await the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply before commenting. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected a long contribution from Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should not tempt providence because he might well get one, even though my lungs are not what they were last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The reputations of Senator Jim Walsh and Senator Norris precede them on this issue.  I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 10 and 11 together.  The amendments proposed by Senator Norris do not provide for any additional clarification of the provision.  I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that the proposed wording would not be normal in drafting legislation and might have the effect of damaging the meaning.  Therefore, the amendments are being opposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention of the amendment was to allow for the proposed insertion of the word &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; as a possibility after the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) which, as drafted, states:  &ldquo;does not constitute an express or implied admission of liability by that defendant, and&rdquo;.  That means that it cannot constitute an implied admission.  However, when one says that it &ldquo;does not automatically&rdquo; do so, it would leave open the possibility that in certain circumstances it could.  </P>
        <P>The point I was making on the last occasion &mdash; and I did have some degree of moral support, at least, from Senator Jim Walsh &mdash; was that the net effect of the Bill is to skew the balance against the individual in favour of the newspaper proprietors who have very large vested interests in this area.  I cannot accept the notion that it is not normal drafting.  There was a wonderful example of normal drafting the last day.  God almighty and His entire family could not understand section 18(3)(<i>a</i>) which was such a collection of nonsense that the Minister agreed to have it redrafted.  I will not accept guff referring to normal drafting because it does not exist.</P>
        <P>All that is sought on both sides of the House is drafting that is clear, simple and defends the rights of citizens.  Inserting the word &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; provides an avenue of approach whereby a plaintiff may be given a level playing field.  I remind the House that when this legislation goes through, one will be able to tell any number of lies about a citizen and follow them with an apology that must automatically be taken in mitigation of the effect, consequences and damages that accrue subsequent to an action for libel.  The <Col N="778"/>apology will be a valuable weapon in the hands of the press and, if this is how the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, wants it, then that is fine but he is simultaneously removing that weapon from the ordinary citizen.  He is asking the court to pretend the apology never took place and I suggest that such apologies made by newspapers are worthless and are only made to save money.  I accept that it would be improper to restrict the freedom of the press excessively and impede investigative journalism, but I also feel it is wrong to hinder the individual plaintiff as this legislation will.</P>
        <P>I apologise for being briefly absent from the House.  I passed through the ante chamber, did not hear a whisper of McDowell and thought I should follow the Leader&rsquo;s instructions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should refer to Minister McDowell.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg his pardon, the grand panjandrum himself, Minister McDowell, TD and T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a Minister of State in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a distinguished Minister of State, a decent man, and I know him well but I thought, since I could not see Minister McDowell, I would do as the Leader says and read what Mr. Fintan O&rsquo;Toole said in his column in <i>The Irish Times</i> on this subject and the subject of investigative journalism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think we should discuss what Mr. Fintan O&rsquo;Toole said.  We should discuss what Senator Norris has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I think any restriction on the discussion of the opinions of Mr. Fintan O&rsquo;Toole would only be for the greater sanity and welfare of the people.  On that jocular note, I will listen to the Minister of State if he has anything more to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As a director of Independent Newspapers and writer, I have an interest to declare in this matter, and I make such declarations ritually.  We have focused on this issue each day we have discussed the Bill and I can only conclude that the intention is not to make progress on Committee Stage.  I agree with the Minister that the purpose of this section was to encourage newspapers to offer apologies and, in doing so, to satisfy those people who find them acceptable.  This would keep many cases from the courts that would have otherwise have been there, and people not satisfied with an apology could still go to the courts.</P>
        <P>I share many of Senator Norris&rsquo;s views on the inelegance of the drafting of Bills that come before us but I think adding the word &ldquo;automat<Col N="779"/>ically&rdquo; in this case would define it out of existence.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not receive a satisfactory response to a point I raised on the previous occasion the Bill was debated.  Section 22(1) states: &ldquo;In a defamation action the defendant may give evidence, in mitigation of damage, that he or she made or offered an apology to the plaintiff...&rdquo;.  Why is a distinction drawn between the words &ldquo;made&rdquo; and &ldquo;offered&rdquo; in this context?  The legislation does not make provision for a press organ to unilaterally publish an apology when it knows it is wrong.  Why should the words &ldquo;or offered&rdquo; be included?  The section contains a dichotomy. </P>
        <P>The reason Senators are painstakingly examining the sections is that we have strong reservations about many of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  In addition, the purpose of the House is to examine legislation.  The Minister has kindly agreed to consider a number of points raised in the House.</P>
        <P>Section 22(3) states that in a defamation action, an apology made by or on behalf of a defendant in respect of a statement to which the action relates does not constitute an express or implied admission of liability by that defendant and is not relevant to the determination of liability in the action.  This means the plaintiff will not secure advantage by giving evidence in court that he or she has received an apology.  The defendant, on the other hand, may, &ldquo;in mitigation of damage&rdquo;, give evidence that he or she has made or offered an apology to the plaintiff.  This is an unfair and inequitable provision which must be addressed to achieve balance.</P>
        <P>As Senator Norris stated, if an apology can be cited in support of a case, it should be open to both the plaintiff and defendant to do so.  It is logical to provide that publications should not fear that making an apology will result in a subsequent legal case being conceded.  However, if the defendant can use an apology in mitigation of damage, it should not follow that the plaintiff should be deprived of an opportunity to raise the apology in support of his or her case.  If a publication has done damage to a person&rsquo;s reputation, damages should flow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am impressed by Senator Walsh&rsquo;s contribution which was fair, measured and reasonable.  I also have a degree of sympathy with Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s comments because I understand that one does not want to have blood in the water, in other words, the fact that an apology is given means that people who might not otherwise take an action sniff blood and decide <Col N="780"/>that, having received an apology, they can go for the publication in question.  It is a matter of striking a balance.  The problem, however, is that the section lacks balance and favours one side.  </P>
        <P>While I understand the concerns of Senator Maurice Hayes and, like everybody else, want good investigative journalism, I do not want the apology to be used as an excuse.  I will retain my amendments in order that I may resubmit them on Report Stage.  Will the Minister of Stage ask officials to examine the section to ascertain if the lack of balance, about which all Senators have some reservations, can be addressed?  In such circumstances, I would not be vexatious in pushing my amendments.  It is not a matter of personal vanity on my part to have my name on an amendment which is accepted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept that the Minister controls the Whip and that the reality of political life is that Members on that side will have to do as they are told and will be dragooned through the lobbies.  There is clearly a belief on all sides of the House that there is a lack of balance in this regard.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ask his officials to consider whether it is possible to introduce an extra degree of balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Section 23 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 24.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are technical alternatives to amendment No. 12.  All three amendments may be taken together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, lines 26 to 36, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;24.&mdash;(1) Subject to <i>subsection (4)</i>, it shall be a defence (to be known, and in this section referred to, as &ldquo;the defence of fair and reasonable publication&rdquo;) to a defamation action for the defendant to prove that the statement in respect of which the action was brought was published in good faith and in all the circumstances of the case, it was fair and reasonable to publish the statement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I tabled this amendment on the basis of my belief that newspapers may have too many hoops to jump through in proving fair and reasonable publication.  An article published in good faith should be viewed by the court as not being malicious, and this should be sufficient to proceed with the defence of reasonable publication.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am tempted to withdraw this amendment, however, in view of recent examples of untruthful newspaper allegations made against certain persons.  On today&rsquo;s Order of Business, Members referred to articles published in recent days on the death of a young man in Lucan.  These reports <Col N="781"/>contained several untruths, including the claim that he was known to the Garda.  Given that we have been discussing this Bill for some time, I had expected apologies to appear prominently in the newspapers that printed these lies.  We saw on the television a grieving mother forced to defend the good name of her son.  The newspapers in question printed what can be only described as rubbish.  These allegations have hurt the victim&rsquo;s family, as they would any decent and right-thinking person.  This is only one example but it is typical of the problem that exists.</P>
        <P>Some weeks ago, I spoke on the Order of Business about the media treatment endured by the manager of the Irish soccer team in the wake of the victory in San Marino.  One newspaper article the following Sunday suggested he should buy petrol and pour it over himself.  This is gutter journalism and it must be stamped out.  The sooner we have a press council with teeth the better.  As I said, I had hoped today&rsquo;s editions of the relevant newspapers would include apologies for the untruths they published about the gentleman who died.  This was a man who worked for charity.  It is harrowing for his mother and extended family that such articles should be published.</P>
        <P>I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about my amendment but I propose to withdraw it in light of these latest events.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what Senator Cummins said.  My understanding, although I may be wrong, is that we are attempting to introduce a new concept into Irish law.  It is a concept that is highlighted by the infamous Reynolds case in which a former Taoiseach was libelled and pilloried by a trashy rag owned by that despicable man, Rupert Murdoch.  It is astonishing that we should introduce something like this trailing after these types of judgments.  A judgment in the United States some years ago in the case of Sullivan <i>v</i>. <i>The New York Times</i> was based on a first amendment argument.  The net impact of this has been to introduce negative advertising whereby people can say whatever they like about their opponents in election campaigns and can pay people to lie on public television and get away with it.  Is that what we want?</P>
        <P>Mr. George Galloway can be an awkward customer and sometimes plays to a low gallery, something I am sure no Member would accuse me of doing.  On the other hand, he was well able for the Senate of the United States when he went there and blazedly told the truth.  The truth is something to which <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> is a complete stranger.  That paper repeatedly published lies about Mr. Galloway and tried to rely on the justification of fair comment.  It lost its case, however.  Are these the standards we wish to import into Irish law?</P>
        <P>My amendment No. 14 proposes to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1).  This provision is a squalid piece of work.  I ask Members, my fellow <Col N="782"/>turkeys, to note that subsection 2 (<i>a</i>) refers to the &ldquo;extent to which the statement concerned refers to the performance by the person of his or her public functions&rdquo;.  This provision purports to do something I maintain is unconstitutional because it creates two ranks of citizens.  On the one hand, there is the ordinary Joe Soap who has never lifted a hand to serve his community or do anything of a public nature.  It seems such persons are entitled to a higher degree of protection than somebody who enters public office in an attempt to do some good.</P>
        <P>As politicians, we are saying here that there should be a weaker test of truth in what newspapers and other media sources write about us than there is in regard to ordinary citizens.  Why is this the case?  What is the caratage of truth?  Should it not be an absolute standard?  Is a lie somehow lesser if it relates to a Deputy, councillor, Senator or Minister rather to an ordinary citizen?  I do not understand the logic of that.</P>
        <P>I understand that newspapers must pursue matters of public importance.  Above all, however, is the question of truth.  My standard can be summed up as &ldquo;Print the truth or pay the price&rdquo;.  In 1909 or thereabouts, a contemporary of James Joyce, Arthur Cleary, observed that a nation which takes an English paper for its Sunday lunch will one day find a change in its Friday menu.  I should explain for younger people that at that time, Roman Catholic people who were citizens of this State were required not to eat fish.  What Mr. Cleary meant by this observation was that if one allows one&rsquo;s ethos to be overwhelmed by the standards of the British tabloid press, one will find one&rsquo;s entire ethical context changed.  I do not say this in any racist way.  I am proud of the fact that my father is English.  I am not anti-English but I deplore and despise the standards of the British press.</P>
        <P>Under Article 40 of the Constitution, the State guarantees to secure the good name of every citizen and, by its actions, to vindicate that good name.  The Constitution does not provide that this will be done for Mrs. Olivia Boylan in Sallynoggin but not for Senator Maurice Cummins, because he is a Senator, nor for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, because he had the cheek to put himself forward for election.  We would want to be very careful before we vote through a Bill that states that if somebody is in public life there is a weaker test of truth to be applied in what is written about them, and I do not give a tuppenny damn if I attract the further ire of Fintan O&rsquo;Toole for expressing this view in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Much as I am interested in Mr. O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s commentary, he always goes on about the freedom of the press.  I have every freedom to express these opinions in defence of what I see as proper and decent standards in this House.  That is at least as much part of the freedom of expression in a democracy as is the freedom to print lies about politicians.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>I remind Members, if any of them are in the slightest doubt, that politicians are routinely held up to contempt and ridicule by commentators.  Only last night I was listening to Vincent Browne, whom I usually enjoy, but I had to switch off the programme because he was posing loaded questions, barracking people, interrupting them and groaning and sighing all over the place.  It was the most ridiculous performance.  He did not give people a chance to speak.  He was holding them up to ridicule because they were politicians, and here we are again allowing a lesser standard of truth and decency to be applied simply because we are politicians.</P>
        <P>We have been let down by some members of this profession who appear to have sold themselves out, especially over planning, for pathetic amounts of money but I still hold that this is an honourable profession where honourable and decent people work hard in the interests of the community.  If there are rotten eggs we should go after them, sort them out, find out the truth and publish it fearlessly but we must not publish half truths and lies.  We must not encourage that kind of low standard of journalism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris is extending the Sullivan judgment far beyond what anybody expects of it.  The basis of the Sullivan judgement was that people engaged in the rough and tumble of political debate and public life should be regarded as having slightly thicker skins than others but if there is a liable people can proceed on that.  Like Shylock, if we are pricked do we not bleed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That should be respected.  At the same time, we are not putting journalists, writers or others in a different position from the rest of the public when giving a defence of good faith because what is it but <i>mens rea</i>?  It is the intent to commit the crime or whatever.  There must be a good faith defence in that case as in this one.</P>
        <P>We tend to concentrate on the press and on the media but there are other forms of publication.  I was very concerned with a case involving a politician in Northern Ireland, who is no longer alive, which caused a history book by a reputable historian to be pulled because of one reference in a paper that had stood unchallenged for years.  There must be a provision which allows for a defence in those cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 12 and 14 together.  Amendment No. 13 is a technical amendment.  Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment No. 12 would radically alter the purpose of the proposed new defence of fair and reasonable publication.  Section 24(1) provides for the defendant in a defamation action to prove that the statement in respect of which the action <Col N="784"/>is brought was published in good faith and was published in the course of, or for the purpose of, the discussion of a subject of public importance, the discussion of which was for the public benefit.  These two qualifications are critical and are not divisible.  While it will be ultimately for the courts to decide the exact nature and extent of this new defence, it must retain the qualification that a matter of public importance be the issue.  For that reason, the amendment is opposed.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 14 is somewhat related to amendment No. 12 in that it seeks to divide the essential qualification of the defence.  The good faith requirement is a necessary precondition on the publisher of the statement and is indivisible from the public importance requirement.  I oppose this amendment also.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the press council.  The press council is absurd.  The Bill refers to the standards.  What are the standards?  Where are they?  Are they adumbrated in the Bill?  Will the Minister of State tell the House what precisely are the standards?  What is the code?  We are blithely saying in legislation that there will be an excuse for <Col N="785"/>them to adhere to the code of standards of the press council.  The incoming head of the press council is an old friend of mine and a former Provost of Trinity College but it is his innocent decency that has allowed him take up this position because it is a farce.</P>
        <P>Everybody knows the idea of a press council is a complete farce, and I will explain the reason to the Minister.  A classic example of it is that we do not have any code.  The Minister is from a country region, and I am not more than a hop out of the bog myself, and I assure him that neither I nor any of my ancestors would buy a pig in a poke.  This is a classic pig in a poke.</P>
        <P>Who are the members of the press council?  A fair preponderance of them are appointed by the people it is supposed to supervise.  It is not, in any recognisable sense of the word, independent.  We will be dealing later with the profession of architects in the Building Control Bill where we are insisting on an independent regulatory body to validate architectural qualifications and so on.  I could reel off any quantity of cases in which there have been editorials written, including by Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s newspapers, demanding independent regulation but apparently what is sauce for the professional goose in every other case is never to be ladled out as sauce for those in the press, who are above such concepts as independence.  Just as we are required to dilute the meaning of truth, we must dilute the meaning of independence.</P>
        <P>I will refer to another little wonder.  As I will not be allowed to elaborate too much on it at the appropriate place, I would prefer to talk about it at the inappropriate place.  Who is paying for this bird?  Did that ever strike anybody?  I will tell the House who is paying for it &mdash; the press.  We have a code that is not spelt out, which is the creature of a group of people who are not independent and are paid for by the people they are supposed to be regulating.  There is a phrase I encountered, which delighted me when I moved across the river: &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I didn&rsquo;t come down the Liffey in a bubble.&rdquo;  Well I did not, and I can smell this a mile off and I do not like it.  I would very much appreciate if the Minister of State would agree to delete it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 24(2)(<i>f</i>)(i) makes specific reference to adhering to a code of standards equivalent to those of the press council where the publisher of the periodical is not a member of the press council.  This provision is very sensible as a periodical may for whatever reason &mdash; it could be valid from its perspective &mdash; decide not to be a member of the press council.  We should allow such a periodical to access such a defence.  We cannot force periodicals to take up their entitlement to be members of the press council.  Thus when seeking to invoke the new defence, the existence of an equivalent code of standards similar to that to be established by the council or its absence will assist a court in its determination <Col N="786"/>of whether a published statement was fair and reasonable on behalf of the non-member of the press council.  For that reason I oppose the amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, subsection (2)(<i>g</i>), line 16, after &ldquo;obtain&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in advance&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The first part of section 24 (2)(<i>g</i>) states that the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events should be represented in the publication concerned.  If we also allow &ldquo;the extent to which a reasonable attempt was made by the publisher to obtain and publish a response from that person&rdquo;, that attempt should be made in advance of publication, which would be in keeping with the rest of the section.  It makes sense from the viewpoint of having balance and proportion.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18 requires that &ldquo;the extent to which the prominence and extent of the representation of that person&rsquo;s response compares with the prominence and extent of the suspicion, allegation or fact concerned&rdquo; should be taken into account.  It would be possible for a newspaper, for example, to have the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events in the same article that the person was defamed but it might be in small print, while a large heading might defame the person concerned.  It is not enough for a plaintiff to be permitted to have his or her version of events in the same publication.  The prominence of that version of events in the publication should be similar to the article which is defamatory.  At least it should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>While amendments Nos. 17 and 18 would preserve section 24(2)(<i>g</i>), they seek to alter its meaning by providing that the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events must be obtained in advance and so obtained the nature and extent of their representation compared with the suspicion, allegation or fact concerned.  While I have sympathy for and understanding of the thinking behind the proposed amendments they seek to be too prescriptive in imposing these conditions.  If accepted they would run the risk of making the new defence unusable.  There may be valid reasons the plaintiff&rsquo;s version cannot be obtained in advance of publication.  I would prefer to let this matter be the subject of continuing jurisprudence by the courts in determining cases that might come <Col N="787"/>before them.  As to the nature and extent of the representation of the plaintiff&rsquo;s views compared with the suspicion, allegation or fact concerned presented by the defendant, I would prefer to let the courts decide on the basis of the particular case presented to them.  Consequently, amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are opposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What Senator Tuffy is requesting represents good journalistic practice.  Publishers should try to establish the contra case before publication.  Most conscientious journalists would do so.  I agree with what the Minister of State has said.  It should be left either to the courts or to developing codes of practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Tuffy and Maurice Hayes.  I am somewhat taken aback with the response.  Section 24(2) states: </P>
        <P LI="1">For the purposes of this section, the court shall, in determining whether it was fair and reasonable to publish the statement concerned, take into account such matters as the court considers relevant including any or all of the following . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 17 would result in section 24(2)(<i>g</i>) stating:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>g</i>) the extent to which the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events was represented in the publication concerned and, if not so represented, the extent to which a reasonable attempt was made by the publisher to obtain in advance and publish a response from that person... .</P>
        <P FLI="0">If we leave the subsection as it is we would effectively not place any obligation on a member of the press and the court would not have any great regard to it if no attempt were made to establish from the individual who was defamed whether it was correct.  It would be ludicrous for us to allow that to go through.  It is a very sensible amendment.  If a vote were called I may be put in a position of having to vote against my conscience.  This section indicates many of the deficiencies and weaknesses in the Bill.  The amendment represents a simple request that should be acknowledged and included.  It takes nothing from rights of the media.  All it means is that the court will take into account that the journalist or publication made some attempt.  It is not even necessary to contact the individual.  However, the defendant should be able to give evidence showing an attempt to make contact even if it were not possible to contact the individual.  That would be very germane in a case where a defendant pleads a defence that it was done in good faith, and was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  I will come to the point of fair and reasonable publication in a moment because I agree with the insertion of that provision.  I strongly urge the Minister of State to reconsider this aspect <Col N="788"/>between now and Report Stage.  It is a very minor and commonsense change.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Jim Walsh and Maurice Hayes.  The more I look at it, what the Minister of State has said does not make sense.  How can one take into consideration whether something was fair and reasonable if, after publication, one looked at whether the defendant made an attempt to contact the person for a response?  That is after the event.  If somebody published something defamatory and he or she knew, surely he or she would try to get a defence for himself or herself by making the attempt this section allows.  I do not see the logic of it being something that could be considered where, after the event, somebody could make an attempt to contact the plaintiff to get his or her response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept the thrust of the Senators&rsquo; arguments, my difficulty with the amendment is that it is simply too prescriptive and we cannot be too prescriptive in legislation of this nature.  The matter is best left to the courts to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point the Minister of State makes but I strongly urge him between now and Report Stage to have another look at the issue.  It is not necessarily good enough to leave an issue such as this to the courts.  We are making a significant change in the laws of defamation, which I will comment on when we come to the section.  In doing that, there needs to be regard to the ordinary citizen who may well find himself or herself in a position where he or she is seriously defamed and, because of the way we construct the legislation, everything is stacked against him or her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If a serious journalist or publication were not to make any effort to establish from the party being defamed whether what was to be published was true and giving that party such an opportunity, that would be a serious breach of standard ethics in journalism.  I do not think we should prescribe for that in law.  It is wide open to the courts to interpret it.  Conversely, where a case was pending and the publication had a letter from a solicitor, it would not be good enough for the publication to try to establish from the individual whether it was right or wrong.  At that stage one would not give kudos to anybody for going to them.</P><Col N="789"/>
        <P>While one does not have to make contact, the important issue is that an honest effort is made to make contact in advance.  That is the very least I would expect where a serious defamation issue arises.  I urge the Minister of State to look at that issue between now and Report Stage because we are <i>ad idem </i>in the House.   All the wisdom on this issue does not reside just within the Department.  The views of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be reflected in the Bill as well.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Tuffy and Senator Jim Walsh.  I appeal to the Minister of State, as Senator Walsh has done, to look at the matter between now and Report Stage.  We are all of the same opinion that the issue should be looked at and a proper form of words agreed rather than being dismissed at this stage.  The Minister of State should at least give a commitment to look at the issue and come back with another form of words on Report Stage.  That is the least we deserve given that all sides of the House have the same opinion on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the other Senators.  It would be acceptable if the Minister of State were to say he would look at the matter between now and Report Stage.  Section 24(2) deals with whether it was fair and reasonable to publish the statement.  Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) and (<i>h</i>) all deal with the time of the statement or beforehand.  Paragraph (<i>g</i>) is the one paragraph that allows for the possibility of something happening after publication and, surely, that could not be correct.  If so, will the Minister of State clarify the reason it is necessary to leave it broader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to clarify further the reason for this requirement.  In doing so, I make it clear I am not necessarily agreeing to any change in the position I now hold.  I am prepared simply to seek further clarification on the basis that all Members are in agreement that I should do so.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, subsection (4), between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) as far as practicable, he or she made a reasonable attempt to obtain in advance and publish a response from the person to whom the publication related, and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is similar to an earlier amendment.  Obviously, it is part of the defence that an attempt was made in advance to obtain and publish a response from the person to whom the publication related.  If one used that defence, it would logically follow that one should be able to prove one made that attempt.  For that reason the amendment was tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 20 effectively follows on from the proposed amendment No. 17 by seeking to add an extra condition in pleading the defence of fair and reasonable publication that a reasonable effort had been made to obtain and publish the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events.  I have a certain understanding of the thinking behind the proposed amendment.  However, I hold the view that seeking to add this particular condition is being too prescriptive and, if not met, should be a reason for automatic failure of the defence.  It is of a different nature from the other conditions in subsection (4).  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 24, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It might well be argued that the defence of fair and reasonable publication is a concession to the media.  I take a different view.  I think it is a concession to free expression and it is one I fully support in the Bill.  It is a significant shift and modifies our defamation laws substantially, but it is right that it should do that where issues of public importance and matters of public benefit can be placed as a defence to publication.  In going that route, we need to mindful when easing the laws of defamation to maintain a balance.  Section 24(3) reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The failure or refusal of a plaintiff to respond to attempts by or on behalf of the defendant, to elicit the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events, shall not -</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) constitute or imply consent to the publication of the statement, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) entitle the court to draw an inference [that is fine] if, in the particular circumstances of the case, the court considers that the plaintiff was reasonable in withholding any response or in believing that a denial or refutation by the plaintiff of a defamatory <Col N="791"/>statement would itself be unfairly used or published.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What we are doing is qualifying the denial of the court&rsquo;s right to draw an inference.  I have serious concerns in this regard.  If a person is contacted by a newspaper, reporter or radio or television station, he or she should be entitled to say that he or she is not prepared to make any comment.  The court should not be allowed to infer in such circumstances.  This is a very significant qualification.  I ask that this be looked at between now and Report Stage.  I am discussing sections because, as I am on the Government side, I cannot table amendments to the Bill.  If I were in a position to do so, the House can rest assured that I would table many amendments.</P>
        <P>Section 24(4) deals with the defence of fair and reasonable publication.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The defence of fair and reasonable publication shall fail unless, in relation to the publication of the statement in respect of which the action was brought, the defendant proves that-</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) at the time of publication he or she believed the statement to be true,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) he or she did not act in bad faith or out of spite, ill will or other improper motive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am not disagreeing with that but how is it to be proven?  It strikes me that other than making an affidavit, it is impossible to prove this.  It is a significant part of the subsection.  What answer or clarification might we get in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat that we simply cannot allow the legislation to be prescriptive to the point where we are tying the hands of the court.  It would make the defence almost impossible and it is for this reason we must leave these matters to the discretion of the court.  While, as I stated previously, I might agree with the principles behind the case being made, in the interests of good legislation, we must put these proposals through as proposed in the Bill. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>A very simple question arises from section 24(3)(<i>b</i>) which states that the court is not entitled to draw an inference but then qualifies this by stating that the court would look at whether the plaintiff was reasonable in withholding a response.  In what circumstances would a plaintiff be unreasonable in withholding a comment if he or she were contacted by a newspaper?  There should be no obligation on him or her to comment.  We should not build into our laws the right of the court to have, in some way, discretion in interpreting that.  I see no consistency in this.  If someone has been charged with a criminal offence, he or she has the right to silence.  I know there is some debate about changing that, which I would advocate in respect of serious criminal matters.  In this instance, we are allowing the court to draw an inference where somebody may <Col N="792"/>have decided that he or she does not wish to comment on something put to them.  I do not think it right or proper to prescribe this in legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 24(3)(<i>b</i>) does not allow the court to draw any inference from the plaintiff&rsquo;s reasonable decision not to respond to the newspaper.  In other words, one could refuse to comment on whether one denies the story.  Therefore, no inference is being drawn in regard to section 24(3)(<i>b</i>).</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 20, subsection (1), line 41, after &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;District Court, Circuit Court or&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We tabled this amendment because it allows for a declaratory order.  As there are no damages with such an order, we believe there is no reason to confine it to the High Court.  In particular, in light of the costs involved in going to the High Court, it seems unreasonable not to give the lower courts jurisdiction in this matter.  It is a general issue which we should examine.  There are other areas where one should be able to go to the District or Circuit Court but where one is not allowed to do so at present.  This is an obvious area.  It would be a simple remedy for a person who wanted to clear his or her name.  He or she could simply get an order to the effect that a statement was false and defamatory of him or her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention in section 26 is to provide a clear indication to a potential applicant that he or she might seek the new relief of a declaratory order.  Thus, the section provides that such orders should be sought in the High Court.  This is not an issue of jurisdiction.  There is no benefit to providing that such orders should be sought in the Circuit Court.  The District Court does not have jurisdiction in hearing actions for defamation as it is very likely that any such decision there would be appealed to the High Court.  This would not be a particularly desirable outcome.  Therefore, amendment No. 21 is opposed.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 30 is unnecessary as it is clear from the text of section 32, which concerns an order prohibiting the publication of a defamatory statement, that the Circuit Court has jurisdiction to hear such an application if the action has been brought there.  Therefore, amendment No. 30 is also opposed.</P>

	<P>Yes.  I understand what he is saying and can see that allowing a District or Circuit Court to decide the issue would be a new development.  On the other hand, why should we not allow them to decide these issues?  One has a judge and a court.  Why must so many things go to the High Court for determination?  It is very off-putting for many people, especially those who do not have the money to take a case in respect of this or other issues to the High Court.  If one goes to the High Court, one can be represented by a solicitor, although I am not sure if this is true.  The idea of being able to go to the District or Circuit Court would be much more attractive to a person of modest means for cost reasons apart from anything else and possibly because the case might be dealt with more quickly.</P>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand some people will just want to clear their names and therefore will seek a declaratory order in order not to become involved in the high cost of prosecuting a case.  It is my understanding that if a declaratory order is made, no compensation would follow.  I am concerned that if there is no financial penalty, there is no incentive for journalists to be responsible.  I accept it is up to individuals, but it comes back to the balance of resources between the defendant and the plaintiff.  In general, defendants will be corporations of significant means.  If an independent press council found in favour of a plaintiff, there should be some mechanisms to allow compensation to be paid.  In the public mind, the issuing of such an order would indicate defamation had taken place and one side was in the wrong.  I appreciate the Minister of State may not be able to do much in this regard because declaratory orders were devised as a short-cut in the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is something lopsided about this approach.  If one opts to seek a declaratory order, one is not entitled to any other kind of compensation.  I do not think that is fair.  If one gets an order that indicates one has been injured, why should one not have a redress?  There is nothing in the Bill to suggest declaratory orders are awarded in cases that are not of sufficient seriousness; they cover everything.  One could make the most tremendously inaccurate and dreadful statement about somebody and by seeking a declaratory order, he or she would be cut off from all other avenues of redress.  This approach appears to be skewed in favour of newspaper proprietors.  That is not fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Essentially, if the plaintiff wants a quick fix, as it were, he or she will seek a declaratory order.  That is his or her choice.  If he or she wants to prove defamation, he or she will choose another approach.  Section 26 provides for this more expeditious remedy to the applicant where an allegedly defamatory statement has been published and the court is satisfied it is so, and that the respondent has no defence to the application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is absolute nonsense.  With the greatest respect, I do not imagine the Minister of State believes for a minute what he is saying.  He could not possibly do so, certainly not as a politician.  In effect, he is saying that if somebody puts into print or into the airwaves something that is criminally wrong and damaging about another person and if, in order to protect one&rsquo;s reputation, one seeks to have that statement cor<Col N="795"/>rected, one is cut off from all other remedy.  Come on, from where did this idea come &mdash; Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal was first contained in a report of the Law Reform Commission in 1991.  It was further recommended by the legal advisory group on defamation in 2003.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that clarification.  However, I still think it is daft.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened with interest to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  While I am not a legal expert, I understand the system and why people would seek a declaratory order.  In the case of a person who is seriously defamed, he or she may well decide to seek a declaratory order.  It is easy to say it is his or her choice and that he or she can continue the case but one has to take account of an individual whose financial resources may be limited.  When one goes to court it is a lottery.  Even if one has been advised one has a strong case, no doubt the other side will have been advised in a similar way.  Ultimately, the advisers will be the winners in the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not always possible or prudent for people to pursue their rights.  In this proposed legislation, no account has been taken of the ordinary citizen with limited resources who feels strongly he or she has been defamed, whose reputation is in tatters and who wishes to have his or her good name restored.  A series of obstacles is in the way of a person achieving this end.  I am in favour of an independent press council.  We will come to this issue in due course.  I do not think it is beyond the wit of anybody to draft legislation to the effect that if a declaratory order were issued, it would be possible for an independent body to award limited compensation up to &euro;50,000 or some such sum to a person who had been awarded a declaratory order.</P>
        <P>I recently heard of a case, perhaps not a very good one, which was settled on the basis of the newspaper in question taking a proportion of the plaintiff&rsquo;s costs.  The defendant stated he had been vindicated but the plaintiff made the point very clearly that no compensation was paid, only the costs, and the person who took the case was a man of straw.  If we are to settle cases on that basis, it does nothing for the restoration of a person&rsquo;s reputation where he or she has been genuinely defamed.  The same will happen if this Bill is enacted.  In serious cases a person will have, and should have under the law, the right to be vindicated.  We need to examine this issue carefully.</P>
        <P>It is easy for us to discuss the matter, it is an entirely different matter for the person who finds himself or herself in the Four Courts where we have allowed exorbitant fees to be charged and where people can risk everything they own, and a lot more, by going to court.  We need to be <Col N="796"/>mindful of this when we draft legislation.  We should seriously examine putting balance into some sections of the Bill and we could do this in section 26.  It would be a simple matter to have an independent body that could prescribe compensation to a limited degree.  Obviously, people should also have the right to go to court.  This would be also a media-friendly approach because, in most cases, people want to be vindicated.  People want their reputations restored and would settle for small amounts of compensation.  Often in the public mind, the level of compensation determines the correction of the defamation.  We need to re-examine aspects of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Jim Walsh said.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the Law Reform Commission.  I hope that enthusiasm will be sustained throughout the rest of this debate, which cannot go on for very long.  I will be suggesting some other things that were recommended vigorously by the Law Reform Commission should be taken on board.</P>
        <P>The points made by Senator Jim Walsh are valid.  I have a good deal of sympathy for individual journalists who are brought to court because it is a very heavy burden on a professional person.  The late Michael O&rsquo;Toole was a great friend of mine, a wonderful journalist, a good friend of Ireland and of literature and all the rest of it.  He wrote the &ldquo;Irishman&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; column in the <i>Evening Press</i>.  He was a terrific man.  Something quite innocent he wrote was taken up and he was crushed by it for quite a long time.  It was a horrendous experience.  I am not unaware of that aspect of the matter.</P>
        <P>However, if one gets a declaratory order, it is because one is aware that the longer a matter is allowed to remain out there, the more it accrues and acquires substance in the public imagination.  A declaratory order should be an instrument to prevent that happening but it should not completely cut off other redress.  Why should it?  I do not refer to personal redress against a journalist, I refer to the press barons.  One should bear in mind that my principal target in this is not particularly the Irish newspapers, it is bringing the horrible stable of English publications under the jurisdiction of our standards.  It is unfair that one is not allowed further redress because one nips a matter in the bud.</P>
        <P>I remind the House of a case of a man in Waterford.  He had a ramshackle hotel and came across as a decent man but perhaps a little eccentric.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He received &euro;100,000 and did not think it was enough.  If he had been granted a declaratory order he would not have been granted anything.  The entire country is laughing at him and he has been exposed to ridicule.  It does not matter to people whether he is running <Col N="797"/>a brothel.  I have no idea if &euro;100,000 was too much, too little or exactly right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>He was awarded &euro;50,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case I will send him a few bob in the post.  If he nipped this in the bud as provided for in this Bill he would receive nothing.  He has been damaged and exposed to ridicule.  I read the article, accompanied by a photograph, and laughed like a drain.  It cheered up my morning but I do not see why he should not have some recourse.  That may have been innocent nonsense but I am using the story as an instance.  I hope it is an accurate one, perhaps it is not.</P>
        <P>I approach this Bill as an ordinary person, not a lawyer.  An ordinary person might well ask why one is cut off from further recourse if one stops something that may gather momentum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The court will decide on the application.  If a person seeks a declaratory order the person must understand that damages cannot be awarded. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Why?  Is that not for the Oireachtas to decide?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>If one seeks damages one should apply for a standard defamation order.  It is up to the courts to grant a declaratory order and the courts must decide that the defendant has no defence.  The defendant may be able to offer a defence.  The issue of compensation is a separate matter.  </P>

	<P>Is section 26 agreed?  We have given the section a good airing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We are entitled to debate it.  This is an important matter that goes to the kernel of the debate.  Section 26(2) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Upon an application under this section, the court shall make a declaratory order if it is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the statement is defamatory of the applicant and the respondent has no defence to the application,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the applicant requested the respondent to make an apology, correction or retraction in relation to that statement, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the respondent failed or refused to accede to that request.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The court must establish these conditions before it can proceed with the declaratory order.  As night follows day there should be a system or another forum where there is a limit to compensation.  I understand the thrust of the comments of the Minister of State about the declaratory order.  I have not heard any argument that drafting legislation to provide for such a forum is beyond our remit and our wit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this section refer to the situation where the defendant lodges money in court, the plaintiff refuses to accept it, a lower award is made and the plaintiff is penalised for not accepting the earlier offer?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>In short, yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>That is appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have debated this section with the Minister and his officials.  It is badly in need of modification.  When someone is defamed, the defendant may agree to offer a degree of compensation without an apology or acknowledging the defamation.  The person may decide to pursue the case because reputation is more important than compensation.  Subsequently, the court may find that the plaintiff was seriously defamed but damages come to less than what was offered.  Suppose damages of &euro;25,000 were awarded but the publisher had offered &euro;30,000.  The plaintiff may be lumbered with &euro;500,000 in legal costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The plaintiff would lose costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The plaintiff may have to pay the costs of the defendant.  It represents a major gamble and is grossly unfair.  Does the Department not see the inequity in this?  The plaintiff may be a law-abiding citizen in court for the first time and would inquire of the legal team when an offer is made.  The plaintiff is likely to follow the advice of the legal team.  As a consequence, the plaintiff may lose everything and be left homeless.  There is no consideration for the small man.  We are in dereliction of our duties if the Bill passes as it stands.  This is the most galling provision in the Bill.  It does not even require, as an earlier section does, I believe it is section 20, that it must be accompanied by an apology.  That is the very least that is required.  The primary interest of most people who take a defamation <Col N="799"/>action is restoring their reputation.  We are crafting the Bill to provide that where somebody is defamed and takes a case, and where a certain amount of compensation is offered without an apology or retraction, the person could find himself or herself losing everything.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand how a Government could impose that on an unsuspecting public.  Of all the provisions in the Bill, this is the one to which I have the greatest objection.  It disadvantages the individual when taking a case.  In fact, the individual could find himself or herself on the horns of a dilemma simply because an offer is made.  The least that should be done by amendment of that section is to provide that an offer without an apology, correction and retraction is not, in fact, an offer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Jim Walsh.  This section is grossly unfair.  In this Bill we are trying to get the balance right but the balance is tilted in one direction in this section.  The Minister must re-examine it and either delete it or provide a better version.  There is no balance in the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a degree of sympathy with the position that a lodgement should either imply or include an expression of apology or of amends.  That would be essential.  However, let us remove this from the realm of libel and consider it in the context of another case where people are making claims against each other for injury, accident or the like.  The court decides at what point one party has acted reasonably and the other party has begun to act unreasonably.  People, along with their legal advisers, must make the judgment as to whether they should risk pursuing the case the rest of the way.  It is unreasonable to say to one party in a case that its costs will be covered, regardless of how unreasonable it is and even though the court has said it is unreasonable, or where the other party has acted reasonably at that point and the first party has accepted it.  We need to find a middle way.  One cannot give an assurance to one party in a case, whether it is libel or any other type of case, that its costs will be always met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Surely one can if the party is right.  The other side is already saving because it is getting a small reward.  I doubt that the plain people of Ireland have the slightest idea of what is being imposed on them in this Bill.  They would be very concerned if they did.  There are, by and large, reasonably decent standards in Irish newspapers.  However, as Senator Maurice Hayes is aware, this is not true of many English newspapers and, financially, they have deep pockets.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of senior people from the National Union of Journalists.  I honour them; they are people of the highest standard.  We are lucky to have them, and <Col N="800"/>I am not simply craw thumping in saying that.  However, we are well aware of the record of Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s newspapers.  They find it profitable to lie about people and they will pay any amount of money for it.  They will crush ordinary people if they can.  In a situation where injustice has been done, why should the individual not have his or her fees covered, if they would have been covered had he or she accepted a smaller amount?</P>
        <P>It is a guessing game, like guessing the weight of the pig at the funfair.  These matters are far too serious for the individual to be treated in this manner.  I will put down an amendment to delete this section.  I sincerely hope, not in a mean-minded sense, that it will spark a revolt on the Government side.  It does not bother me when there is an election because it is due in a short while anyway.  If Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats split on this, they could not do so on a better issue.  It is an issue of principle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ordinary person is not being treated well by this Bill.  The big newspaper proprietors, particularly people such as Mr. Murdoch, have plenty of money.  They also have plenty of shrewd advice and know how these matters can go.  They can take a gamble by offering a carefully estimated amount of money and they stand a sporting chance of upending the person they have already libelled.  They can then achieve a double whammy against that person.</P>
        <P>We have talked about inhibiting investigative journalism in the past.  What about inhibiting people from restoring their good names?  Between now and Report Stage I will compile a catalogue of the things going through in this Bill and I will read it into the record as a Bill of shame.  It will be a list of things the elected Members of the Oireachtas are permitting entrenched interests to do with impunity against the ordinary citizen.  It will be a dreadful day&rsquo;s work if this is passed unamended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Norris of the case of Sir William Wilde and Kit Travers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the one out in Bray?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Sir William Wilde complained, rather ruefully, that he had been charged &pound;5,000 for the pleasure of seducing a young lady whose virtue was valued at a farthing.  There is no justification for treating libel actions differently from other actions, where a lodgement in court is accepted.  It is up to the court to decide what is the reasonable price to put on the hurt and what redress is required.  The practice of lodgement in court is well tested.  It should not be different in a libel action from any other action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point.  Section 27 brings defamation proceedings into line with other actions for damages by allowing the defendant to lodge in court, with the defence, a sum of money <Col N="801"/>in satisfaction of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim.  This lodgement may be made without admission to liability.  Section 3 is intended to facilitate a plaintiff who may wish to ensure that some measure of public recognition attaches to the fact that the defendant was willing to settle the case before the trial or action was concluded.</P>
        <P>The legal advisory group on defamation was strongly of the view that it was entirely appropriate that defendants in defamation proceedings should be able, along with their defence, to lodge a sum of money in court in satisfaction of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim regardless of whether liability is admitted or denied.  Some plaintiffs will be content simply to take up the lodgement.  However, the group also acknowledged, particularly where the defence of truth was pleaded, that other plaintiffs may wish for some additional element which will help them to vindicate in a more public way the choice which they have made.  The group recommended that the new defamation legislation should permit plaintiffs to inform the court formally of the fact that they have accepted the lodgement and of the consequences for them of the resolution of the defamation proceedings.  This could provide the vindication element which might otherwise be missing.  This does not, however, require the defendant to also give an apology.</P>
        <P>The reform of the lodgement in court procedure in regard to defamation has the potential to make a significant impact on the law of defamation in that it is likely to encourage the early settlement of actions and help reduce legal costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What are they paying for if they have not done anything for which they need to apologise?  If that is the case, will they give me a few bob?  They are prepared to hand out money apparently for no reason at all but they do not have to apologise or say they were wrong and admit liability.  This is something fishy.  People like Conrad Black, Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly and Rupert Murdoch do not hand out money for nothing.  I want to know why they are giving out money with no admission that they were wrong.  They will claim they settled out of court to shut the plaintiff up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The plaintiff has a choice of going either route.  If the plaintiff chooses this route, it is a matter for him or her.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the plaintiff has a strong choice where an offer is made.  I note the Minister of State concurs with the point raised by Senator Maurice Hayes.  I cannot see any comparison between a case for defamation and another civil case involving a settlement.  A defamation case primarily requires an apology, retraction and the restoration of a person&rsquo;s reputation.  I cannot think of any other civil case where the offer of <Col N="802"/>compensation would not be a satisfactory outcome to a case.  It is not a satisfactory outcome in this.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  However, if an individual, who is seriously injured, goes to court, it will assess compensation and damages.  All that is at issue is the amount.  This provision means a person will receive money but no one will know there was a retraction of a libel if the newspapers do not publish it.  We are setting a charter where only the ultra-rich will be able to vindicate their names.  As a republican, this is anathema to me.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Maurice Hayes claims if we do allow this provision, a person can proceed with a case, no matter the costs.  The person ultimately will be faced with costs if they lose their case.</P>
        <P>Section 27(4) states, &ldquo;The defendant shall not be required to admit liability in an action for damages for defamation when making a payment to which this section applies.&rdquo;  This should be amended to &ldquo;the defendant shall be required to admit liability&rdquo;. If we fail to do this, a person&rsquo;s reputation only applies in selected cases.  It is inserting an element of gamble in the legislation which should not be allowed in cases where a person has been defamed.  It is the most offensive section in the Bill.  It will make it impossible for people to get satisfaction from a court case unless they have significant financial resources to follow the case.  A simple amendment will not take from the rights of the media.</P>
        <P>It was suggested the press would not be happy with a change to this provision.  If we are prescribing legislation just to keep the press happy, we are taking the wrong route.</P>

	<P>There is a need to reform our outdated defamation and libel laws.  I agree with fair and reasonable defence.  It must be balanced.

	<P>There is a misunderstanding on the part of Senator Jim Walsh.  He is seeking a requirement that the defendant admits liability.

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Norris, I am not a legal professional.  It is often to my disappointment as it would have been a far more lucrative profession to have pursued.  Settlements of this nature rarely come out of the blue.  They usually follow some consultation and negotiations between the legal parties on both sides.  If a person takes a case, the primary objective is the restoration of his or her reputation.  I cannot see any circumstances why the media, the defendant, would offer compensation unless there is a clear acceptance that what was published was wrong.</P>
        <P>In that scenario, I am looking for an acknowledgement for the ordinary person who initiates a case.  It is not just the compensation but the apology and correction must be combined in settling a case.  In other cases where settlements are made, negotiations take place on the issues.  If one side believes the other side will not agree, a lodgment is made.  In a case of defamation, there must be attachment of an apology which I assume is the main purpose of taking a case.</P>

The other part about which I am concerned is partially addressed by a Government amendment.  It concerns putting a judge in the position of editing a newspaper.  He or she specifies the time, place and order of publication, which has no regard for the manner in which newspapers are produced or what might happen in the circumstances.  Imagine the judge said that it had to publish something in the top left-hand corner of page 1 on 14 January.</P>

	<P>This amendment, which is not accepted, was proposed and rejected in the course of the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.  Section 2 defines an oil consumer as a person who, in the proceeding calendar year, imported into the State, acquired by purchase or otherwise from an oil company in the State, or held in storage in the State 1,000 or more tonnes of petroleum products exclusively for that person&rsquo;s own consumption in the State and not for resale or disposal to a third party.  The definition of oil consumer is linked to the provision in the Bill that provides for a levy on disposals of petroleum products by oil companies and oil consumers.</P>
        <P>Under the 1995 regulations, a National Oil Reserves Agency levy on disposals of petroleum products applies to oil companies and those major consumers who in the preceding month purchased not less than 1,000 tonnes of petroleum products.  The regulations provide that oil consumers may claim an exemption from the monthly levy if they held during the previous month volumes of oil equivalent to at least 55 days&rsquo; consumption.  The proposal in the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006 envisages continuation of both the levy on petroleum products and the provision for exemption from the levy.</P>
        <P>To accept the amendment proposed by the Senator would make smaller oil consumers liable for payment of the National Oil Reserves Agency levy.  It is accepted that those operators could claim a levy exemption provided that they held stocks equal to or in excess of 55 days&rsquo; consumption.  However, smaller oil consumers often operate on the basis of just-in-time deliveries and so are unlikely to wish storage facilities capable of handling significant volumes of oil surplus to <Col N="805"/>operational requirements.  In such situations, they would not be able to avail themselves of the levy exemption.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the figure of 1,000 tonnes should remain, and the amendment is therefore not accepted.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and subject to confirmation by a medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am sure, not being a medical practitioner, that the Minister of State will accept the provision in the Bill does not seem reasonable.  We would normally respect the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion.  However, as it relates specifically to someone not being able to perform his or her duties through ill health, might it not be reasonable to make it subject to confirmation by a medical practitioner?  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment, which was also proposed, but not accepted, during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.  The wording used in subsection (6)(<i>a</i>) of section 14 is the standard text used in legislation pertaining to the removal of directors from State bodies and is included in legislation setting up other agencies, for example, the Sustainable Energy Act 2002 and the Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003.  The fact that the text has not presented any difficulties convinces me that the amendment proposed by the Senator should not be accepted.</P>
        <P>A board member&rsquo;s relationship with his or her doctor is confidential, and the nature of a doctor&rsquo;s relationship with a patient would prevent his or her disclosing information about a patient&rsquo;s state of health without the latter&rsquo;s consent.  The context of removal from office provides no inducement for the director to provide such consent.</P>
        <P>Having considered the proposed amendment carefully with the benefit of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I am satisfied that, rather than improving outcomes, accepting the amendment would present practical difficulties for a Minister who wished to remove a director on the grounds of ill health.  Accordingly, the amendment cannot be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where there is agreement between the parties, there is no difficulty.  I assume it is envisaged that the said person would <Col N="806"/>normally offer to retire on the grounds of ill health.  However, if there were a dispute, no one would like to see a Minister remove a director without ill health being apparent.  I accept what the Minister said regarding confidentiality between the director and his or her doctor, but might there be an independent referee if there were a serious dispute?</P>
        <P>That does not sound particularly pleasant.  While I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s logic regarding confidentiality, perhaps there might have been provision for an independent medical practitioner in the context of a dispute.  If there were no dispute, for example, where a director was seriously unfit through ill health, he or she would offer to resign.  If the standard wording has not led to any difficulties, has that scenario been the norm?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The wording used in subsection (6)(<i>a</i>), as it stands, is a standard text which has not caused any difficulties up to now.  As regards the practicalities, a director&rsquo;s physician would not necessarily know the duties a person is expected to perform as a director of NORA.  The provision of a medical certificate by a physician does not mean that the director is unable to perform his or her duties.  For example, a director diagnosed with an illness such as cancer could still be able to perform such duties.  We have considered the matter carefully and sent it to the Attorney General who stated that what the Senator proposes would make things more difficult and that we should remain with the text that has been standard over the years.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The text of section 15, as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, provides for NORA strategy statements, the finalised documents, to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Similar provisions are set out in legislation setting up other bodies, for example, the digital hub.  I do not consider that specific issues pertain to NORA which require that a more stringent provision on strategy statements should be applied to the agency.</P>
        <P>Section 15 sets out the information to be included in strategy statements.  Such information must include key strategies and activities of the agency, outputs the agency aims to achieve and against which its performance will be checked, and staff resources and expenditure proposals necessary to pursue the agency&rsquo;s strategies.</P>
        <P>The House should note that section 31 provides for the examination of NORA&rsquo;s chief executive officer by the Committee of Public Accounts and select committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This section requires the chief executive officer to provide evidence on expenditure by the agency to the Committee of Public Accounts and to account to committees of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.

	<P>The Minister of State has largely responded to the question I was going to ask.  We have established a system of Oireachtas committees and so it is appropriate that many such matters should end up there.  I recall from the debate on Second Stage, to which the Minister of State referred, that section 31 provides an opportunity for NORA&rsquo;s chief executive officer to appear before Oireachtas committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  After all, the people who will take any active part in such a debate are the spokespersons from the various parties.  It would be better to do so in committee rather than in the Houses.  The matter is largely covered in the legislation, so I would have thought the amendment was unnecessary.</P>

    <Title>Building Control Bill 2005: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great pleasure to address this House on the occasion of the Second Stage of the Building Control Bill 2005.  The Bill was amended on both Committee Stage and Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and has benefitted from a detailed examination in the other House.  I believe it will be seen in years to come as one of the most progressive pieces of consumer law to be brought forward in recent decades and I hope it will win cross party support.</P><Col N="809"/>
        <P>The Bill achieves good consumer protection on a number of levels.  It will assure the public that people calling themselves architects, building surveyors and quantity surveyors are properly qualified.  Perhaps more importantly, it strengthens the enforcement of building control law to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s high building standards are fully adhered to.</P>
        <P>The Bill also makes a further move in implementing the Government&rsquo;s commitment to persons with disabilities by requiring commercial buildings and apartment blocks to be certified as being compliant with the disability access requirements of the building regulations at design stage.  It will be an offence to open or occupy a building without this certificate, where required.  This provision has serious economic and legal implications for the owner or developer of a building.  I am particularly pleased to introduce the measure because it is foolhardy for people to build without providing proper access and shows scant regard for the rights of citizens.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as published, had provided for energy rating of houses and commercial buildings as required under the EU energy performance of buildings directive.  However, as the Bill had not been enacted on time, I made the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 on 19 December 2006 and they have been operative since 1 January 2007.  Accordingly, these sections were deleted on Report Stage.  Ironically, criticism was made of my decision to introduce the regulations early.</P>
        <P>The issue of Ireland&rsquo;s building energy rating has been topical recently and was debated in this House before Christmas.  For this reason, I wish to correct some misconceptions and misstatements about Ireland&rsquo;s performance in this area.  A campaign by one player in the construction sector alleges that Ireland is behind the game in energy performance and the Government has shown bias towards the concrete sector.  I expect politicians to be sensible enough not to listen to lobbyists but there is always scope for disappointment.  Both assertions are wrong.  The first is nonsense while the second is at variance with the facts.  Ireland has among the highest standards in the European Union, a point independently verified by the European Insulation Manufacturers Association.</P>
        <P>My Department does not discriminate in favour of particular sectors of the construction industry.  We introduce standards and it is up to all sectors to respond and meet those standards in the flexible manner allowed under the building control system.  The issue is not the building medium but the standard.</P>
        <P>We have increased energy conservation standards on three separate occasions since 1997 alone.  It should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s building energy standards compare very well internationally.  Data produced by the European Insulation Manufacturers Association showed that Ireland&rsquo;s insulation standards are among the <Col N="810"/>highest in the European Union.  We have the second lowest energy loss through walls, behind Sweden, and the lowest loss of energy through roofs.  These facts will come as a surprise to those who believe every lobbyist who crosses their path.  Furthermore, I will shortly commence a review to increase the energy efficiency of new homes by 40% or more as part of our new national climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>It has been also asserted by the same lobbyist source that Ireland is behind the game in introducing the new building energy rating system.  This is not the case.  Prior to the new EU directive on the energy performance of buildings, Denmark was the only country in the European Union which had a building energy rating system.  Four member states introduced the system last year and Ireland is one of seven countries introducing it this year.  The suggestion that Ireland somehow lags behind is false, at variance with the facts and a self-serving misstatement by a lobbyist.  To illustrate the point, the European Commission has sent a formal legal reasoned opinion to 16 member states, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Spain, for their failure to notify sufficient implementation measures.  Ireland does not have such proceedings pending.</P>
        <P>It has been asserted that my Department has opposed the introduction by local authorities of higher energy standards.  This assertion, which is also made by a particular lobbyist source, is at variance with the facts.  In the most recent case involving D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council my Department commended the council on seeking to promote more sustainable development in energy performance of the built environment.  I have left papers on this matter with the Ceann Comhairle in the other House.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act 1990 provides the statutory basis for the making of our national building regulations which have been operative since 1992.  The regulations specify the statutory requirements for the construction of new buildings and material alteration-material change of use of existing buildings.  They comprise 12 Parts, A to M, covering areas such as structure, fire safety, materials and workmanship, sound insulation, conservation of fuel and energy and access for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The related technical guidance documents provide guidance to designers and builders on how to comply with the various Parts of the regulations.  While use of guidance documents is optional, they are in practice treated as the &ldquo;bibles of building&rdquo; and used almost universally by the construction industry.  They are a best seller, at a modest price, in the Government Publications Sales Office but are also available to view or download, free of charge, on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  I understand the technical guidance documents are among the top &ldquo;hits&rdquo; on the website.</P>
        <P>Changes are made in accordance with best practice for modern regulation.  Draft building <Col N="811"/>regulations are prepared, in consultation with the broadly based building regulations advisory body, and are subject to widespread public consultation.  The net result is that the definitive building regulations generally win widespread support within the industry.</P>
        <P>It is now timely to review and update the Building Control Act to meet the challenges of construction today.  In particular, there are four areas with which the Bill is concerned.  Part 2 is the amendment of the Building Control Act 1990.  The Bill provides for changes in the fire safety certificate regime, as recommended by the building regulations advisory body.  The changes include the  introduction of a seven-day notice or fast track procedure which must be accompanied by a valid fire safety certificate application and a declaration that the applicant will carry out any modification works required by the fire safety certificate, when granted.  This will cater for builders who are anxious to commence work on urgent projects without waiting for up to two months for the application to be processed.</P>
        <P>In addition, new applications for a revised fire safety certificate will be required where a building design is changed to comply with conditions attached to a planning permission.  A further change will be the making of applications for regularisation certificates where buildings have commenced or been completed without the necessary fire safety certificate, subject to the necessary documentation and declaration that the works comply with the fire safety requirements of the regulations.  The 1990 Act contained no provision to remedy such cases, although authorities dealt with such problems on a pragmatic basis locally.  It was important that we should have an option to do this variation in law.</P>
        <P>Part 2 also provides for the introduction of a disability access certificate.  Part M of the building regulations, which has been operative since June 1992, sets out the legal requirements for access to and within non-domestic buildings for people with disabilities.  This was extended to new dwellings from 1 January 2001.  It is often too late to seek to remedy disabled access deficiencies once construction is in progress or when a building is finished.  For this reason, the Government has decided to introduce a disability access certificate system, along the lines of the fire safety certificate system, for new non-domestic dwellings.  This provision implements a core recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
        <P>Once enacted, the legislation will prohibit of the opening, operation or occupation of a building until such time as a fire safety certificate, disability access certificate or revised certificate is granted.</P>
        <P>On enforcement, to have a credible building code we must have in place proper compliance with the code and strong enforcement measures.  The local building control authorities are at the <Col N="812"/>heart of our building control enforcement process.  The Bill will enhance the enforcement powers of the authorities in a number of ways.  The powers of building control authorities to seek High Court injunctions will be extended to remove works or stop work on buildings or projects which do not have fire safety certificates, disability access certificates or regularisation certificates, or where there is non-compliance with enforcement notices served by the authorities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The prosecution process will be simplified by providing local building control authorities with the option to institute summary prosecutions for all building code offences in the District Court, as an alternative to prosecution, on indictment, by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Circuit Court.  In the recent past, householders have in good faith engaged unqualified persons who pass themselves off as building professionals to undertake the design and planning of new buildings or extensions.  That is unacceptable.  Under this Bill, only qualified persons whose names are entered on relevant national registers will be entitled lawfully to use the title of architect, building surveyor or quantity surveyor.</P>
        <P>Parts 3 to 5, inclusive, provide for statutory protection of the titles of architect, quantity surveyor and building surveyor by restricting their lawful use to qualified persons whose names are entered on a statutory register to be established in accordance with the provisions of this Part.  The Bill provides that the registration system for architects will be administered by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and that the registration system for building surveyors and quantity surveyors will be administered by the Society of Chartered Surveyors, SCS.</P>
        <P>The various Parts specify the eligibility criteria for automatic admission to registers.  They also set out processes and procedures designed to ensure all applications are treated fairly and in a transparent way.  The Bill provides for the setting up of independent admissions boards; technical assessment boards, together with procedures for assessment of applicants who are ineligible for automatic registration; professional conduct committees to deal with disciplinary matters; and appeals boards to determine appeals against decisions of any of the aforementioned boards or committees.  There will be an ultimate right of appeal against decisions of the appeals board to the High Court.  It is proposed that the majority of members of the various boards will be non-building professionals and that each board will be independently chaired by a retired judge or a lawyer.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the payment of registration fees, appointment of registrars to deal with administrative matters and penalties for misuse of the professional titles.  There will be considerable benefit for consumers when seeking to engage architects or surveyors following the enactment of this Bill.  They will have access to a <Col N="813"/>statutory register with the assurance that all names registered are those of professionals with proper qualifications.  Parts 3 to 5, inclusive, also take account of the recently adopted EU directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which will be relevant in the case of qualified building professionals coming from other EU member states.</P>
<P>Part 6  provides for the preparation of codes of professional conduct and standards by the two registration bodies for registered members of both the architectural and surveying  professions. This Part also sets out procedures for the examination of complaints made to the professional conduct committee regarding alleged misconduct or poor professional performance of registered professionals, for a mediation process if considered appropriate, for the conduct of an inquiry into such complaints and for the attendance and examination of witnesses under oath. It further details the procedures to be adhered to following such inquiry and the measures the committee may take where a registrant is found guilty of proessional misconduct.</P>
        <P>The professional conduct committee will have the powers, rights or privileges vested in the High Court or a judge of the High Court in enforcing the attendance of witnesses, examining witnesses under oath or compelling the production of documents.  Witnesses will have the same immunities and privileges as witnesses before the High Court.  There is a right of appeal to the appeals board against decisions of the professional conduct committee, with the ultimate right of appeal to the High Court.  In addition, the name of a registrant may not be removed from a register unless confirmed by the High Court.  The processes and procedures under this Part are designed to ensure that all professionals against whom a complaint of alleged professional misconduct is made are treated in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
        <P>Part 7 provides for various miscellaneous measures for the effective administration of the registration scheme, including provisions regarding the procedures of the registration bodies, terms of office, payments and so on.  It also provides for the prosecution of offences.</P>
        <P>This is positive legislation which I trust will be welcomed by all parties in the House.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important Bill.  I have spoken on many occasions in the House and lamented the delay in bringing legislation before it.  This Bill is especially long overdue given the statement by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, that it represents the culmination of a campaign that has lasted 119 years since it first sought in 1886 to have registration for Irish architects.  In both its emphasis on the registration of architects and its broader implications, I welcome and, in principle, support the <Col N="814"/>Bill.  However, there are areas where questions must be asked, answers must be forthcoming and some amendments must be made.</P>
        <P>The Bill establishes a register for architects, building surveyors and quantity surveyors, strengthens enforcement of existing building control law, allows for the energy rating of buildings, and legislates for the disability requirements for commercial buildings and apartment blocks.  Fine Gael fully supports these aims, many of which are long overdue.  We particularly welcome proposals to make regulation of professional qualifications watertight, with special provision being made for the so-called grandfather category.</P>
        <P>The first Part of the Bill changes the procedures set out in the Building Control Act 1990 with regard to the fire safety certification and disability access certification of buildings.  It was apt that this Bill was put before the D&aacute;il on the anniversary of the Stardust tragedy, the like of which we must never see again.  Under this legislation, new buildings, extensions and buildings which undergo major alteration, including a change of use, must have a fire safety certificate and disability access certificate.  If a building is found to be without these certificates, the enforcement authorities can require steps to be taken to ensure the requirements are met.  It can also require that the building be removed or work on it stopped, or it may prohibit the use of the building.</P>
        <P>The disability access certificate is a confirmation by an approved building professional that the designs of new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks comply with Part M of the building regulations which deals with access for people with disabilities.  The Bill increases the fines associated with violations of the building regulations.  In addition, it is hoped the enforcement powers of the building control authorities will be strengthened under the Bill.  They will be empowered to initiate proceedings for offences under the building code by way of summary prosecution in the District Court rather than through prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Authority, NDA, has produced several documents on the accessibility of buildings to disabled people.  In a submission to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the review of Part M of the building regulations, it recommended, among other provisions, that the definition of disability used in Part M should reference the Disability Act 2005 and should include people with a range of impairments including, among others, people with hearing, speech, vision, mental health, intellectual or physical impairments, including those impairments that limit mobility, arm movement and hand movement.</P>
        <P>The NDA also recommended that significant enhancements be made to the current technical guidance document to increase the accessibility of buildings.  It also advised that technical guidance standards for non-residential buildings in the key <Col N="815"/>problem areas should be raised to the best international standards and that the standards set out in Part M should be reflected in other parts of the building regulations.</P>
        <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland proposed that the Bill be amended to increase the sanctions for breaching the building regulations and to ensure that the non-compliant pay the cost to the enforcement authorities of the investigation and prosecution of the breach in regulations.  They also recommended that a published consultation process take place before work commences on any construction in all major public developments and that the regulations on disability access and use of a building should be the same in this Bill as in the current building regulations.  They further advised that an access statement should form part of the planning application.  Fine Gael brought forward amendments in the D&aacute;il that would have covered many of these recommendations.  However, they were considered in the main unnecessary and were rejected by the Government.  I will raise these issues again on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the legal transposition of certain provisions of the EU directive of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings, including the phasing in over the period 2007 to 2009 of a building rating certification process for all newly constructed dwellings.  Poor insulation and energy standards in the past eight years have resulted in the construction of substandard houses and, as I said on another occasion in this House, could leave the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the State, open to charges and the State exposed to claims for compensation.  Whether the owners of the 250,000 supposedly substandard houses constructed on this Government&rsquo;s watch choose to take legal action is entirely their call, but the prospect hangs over the Government&rsquo;s head.</P>
        <P>In the light of such deficiencies, there are a number of other measures I would have liked the Bill to contain.  There is no reference to sound insulation.  One of the miseries of modern life is the ability to hear one&rsquo;s neighbour&rsquo;s life happening moment by moment, even though one is separated by a party wall.  There is no reference to public buildings taking the lead on alternative energy and being fitted for geothermal or solar energy technology.  Insulation and the issue of cavity blocks are ignored.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised that issue in a Private Members&rsquo; motion some time ago and we had an excellent debate on it in the House.</P>
        <P>Other sections of the Bill refer to the proposed registering of building professionals: architects and building and quantity surveyors.  The registering of those professionals should mean that the public is protected from unqualified professionals.  Those professions will move from self-<Col N="816"/>regulation to State regulation.  In the case of architects, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, RIAI, will be the registration body and, in the case of quantity and building surveyors, it will be the Society of Chartered Surveyors.</P>
        <P>As these are professional bodies which represent the professionals involved, there could be concerns about the impartiality of the organisations in becoming registration bodies.  Such concerns have been voiced with regard to other professional bodies with a regulatory role such as the Medical Council and the Law Society.  Their members may try to use the registration requirement to limit registration or the body itself may try to force non-members to become members against their will in order to register.</P>
        <P>When enacting and protecting any professional occupation, the concerns of consumers as well as competition concerns must be taken into account.  Consumers must be protected from unscrupulous practitioners, but not at the expense of restricting competition in the sector.  The Competition Authority recommended that the registration body be independent of the representative bodies to allay competition concerns.  The Bill in its current form does not do that.</P>
        <P>Of particular concern to me is the so-called grandfather category of architects who are without formal qualification but who have been practising in excess of ten years.  When exemptions are sought for this group, as I intend to do, we must not lose sight of the influence of many of our most prominent architects who are responsible for changing the face of our built environment, such as Michael Scott and Sam Stephenson, both of whom could be said to have had mixed training.</P>
        <P>I have received representations from the Group of Independent Architects in Ireland, GIAI, which, with the Architects and Surveyors Institute, the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors and the Irish Architects Society, has contributed to a document entitled A Framework for Registration of the Architectural Profession in Ireland, the framework document.  That document indicated that, in any new regime or in the event of the regulation of the profession, a grandfather approach would have to be taken to persons who were practising as architects without having formally qualified as such. The document also outlined the method of assessment to be applied to persons falling within the grandfather category which would enable them to register as an architect based on training acquired by practical means while also acknowledging their established right to practise without formal qualifications.</P>
        <P>However, at variance with the approach proposed in the framework document, the RIAI, the proposed designated registration body under the Building Control Bill 2005, is determined to impose a technical assessment based on recognition of prior learning, RPL. The Competition Authority&rsquo;s report states that the RIAI will face <Col N="817"/>a clear potential conflict of interest between representing the interest of its members on the one hand and regulating in the public interest on the other.</P>
        <P>RPL requires a candidate to demonstrate an achievement of learning outcomes and is not based on experience <i>per se</i>.  It is entirely inappropriate, therefore, and against the spirit of the framework document that such an approach should be used to assess those I described who fall within the grandfather clause.  The GIAI has serious reservations about this assessment system being used for the purpose of assessing so-called grandfathers under technical assessment.  This grandfather group is <i>de facto</i> a mature group, currently in practice, with the majority running their own practice with employees, and the assessment process should reflect this group&rsquo;s status as a finite grandfather group.</P>
        <P>In addition, the GIAI submits that the application of this assessment system is entirely inappropriate on the grounds that it is neither equitable nor consistent with the assessment procedures adopted by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when previously assessing those persons who are now on what is known as the Minister&rsquo;s list and which category of person is referred to in section 12(2)(<i>d</i>).</P>
        <P>The GIAI fully supports the aim of this Bill to introduce a system of registration for architects and for the elimination of rogue architects, but while its members do not have a formal architectural qualification, they have gained many years&rsquo; expertise through practical learning.  This Bill fails to prescribe the method of assessment to be used for those seeking registration.  It gives the new registration body a free hand to choose any method of assessment it wishes.</P>
        <P>What is of major concern to the GIAI and to me is the fact that the mechanism for the assessment of existing architects as proposed under the Building Control Bill would, by its inherent flexibility, permit a departure from the approach envisaged in the framework document in recognising a grandfather group.  This occurs because of the failure of the Bill to prescribe the actual method of assessment to be used.  The grandfather group has the qualifications and I believe their concerns, and those of the GIAI, are reasonable.  I will press this issue further on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  The legislation deals with a complex area, namely, the quality and sustainability of our housing and public buildings.  The measures to be put in place, and some of those already in place, will ensure the future quality and sustainability of our buildings.  As the Minister pointed out, we have high standards in this country regarding the way buildings are designed and built.  This legis<Col N="818"/>lation will reinforce many of the measures in place and, for that reason, it is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The Bill is good news in particular for people with disabilities.  There have been major strides forward in the past ten years in terms of access and services for people with a disability and this Bill is another step forward in that regard.  The disability representative groups and bodies will say that those with a disability do not want to be treated differently from other people.  They want to be treated equally.  My experience of dealing with various disability groups is that they accept that major changes have taken place.</P>
        <P>However, able-bodied people can only imagine how it feels not to have access to a public or private building.  It is only by talking to such groups and the various representative organisations that we get a feel for what it must be like not to have equal access to certain public buildings, including cinemas, pubs and clubs.  The changes made in the Bill will be welcomed by the majority of the bodies concerned.  I welcome that all new buildings will be required to be certified as having disability access.  I agree with basing it on the same lines as the fire certifications.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon mentioned the Stardust tragedy and there have been other incidences which, fortunately, have been less grievous.  Certification and enforcement of fire safety regulations is crucial, especially in public buildings that hold large crowds for sporting or social occasions.  The licensing and certification of the safety of people who use these premises is crucial.  Over the years, we have had issues with compliance and the enforcement of regulation, particularly in the area of fire safety.  The resources have been invested in this area in recent times, especially in the local authorities.  The fire chiefs and the fire services in the local authorities have responsibility for enforcement and inspection to ensure compliance with the required conditions for fire safety.  The Bill makes it easier to enforce safety regulation by supporting the fire safety authorities, which is a welcome introduction.</P>
        <P>Following the Stardust tragedy changes were made.  The public need to have confidence in our fire safety regulation and its enforcement.  I welcome that people now have far more leisure time and are spending more time in public places.  This legislation will ensure the safety and protection of those people.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about apartments.  The past ten years have seen an explosion in the development of apartment dwellings in my area.  There are plans for up to 10,000 more units in the next five to eight years.  They represent a different way of living for people given that we have always had a culture and tradition of two-up two-down, semi-detached or detached houses on a small piece of land.  That has changed dramatically in recent times.  Incentives were given to developers to provide accommodation when it was really needed and people were crying out for decent housing.  At the time, I remember the argument <Col N="819"/>was whether the apartments being developed then would become the slums of the future.  Most of the apartment complexes that were built ten to 15 years ago have proved to be anything but slums.  They are well built, well maintained and well managed.  People are quite happy to live in them in an urban setting in the centre of Dublin city.</P>
        <P>However, this does not apply to all apartment complexes.  Some of them have fallen through the net and have been of very poor quality.  Some of them have major issues regarding the materials used and with the functionality of lifts, electrics, windows, etc.  However, in my experience the majority of apartment developments are completed to a very high quality.  While there are issues regarding size and the numbers of bedrooms, such matters are being addressed by the Department on an ongoing basis.  A number of reviews are taking place into apartment quality, size and the facilities that accompany apartment buildings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation will ensure that all apartments built in the future will be sustainable.  In a small number of the complexes in Dublin, the apartments were not sustainable.  There were no common areas, access was very bad, and very little parking space was provided in a number of them.  Simple matters such as storage areas, including hot presses and space to store kitchen utensils, can be crucial to people living in apartments.  The issue of noise and its abatement also arises.  Apartments represent a cultural change for people and we are still coming to terms with it.  In countries like France, apartment dwelling is a natural part of life and has been for many years.  We need to ensure that apartment complexes, whose residents are forming very organised, settled communities, continue to be sustainable in the future.  All the services that we enjoy in suburbia, including schools, shops, etc., should be provided.  I welcome the huge improvement in the quality and design of apartments and the materials used in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>The Bill introduces measures regarding professional qualifications.  When people hire the services of a professional, such as a dentist, general practitioner or architect, they expect that professional to be fully qualified and a legitimate practitioner of that profession.  Over time, there have been questions about who is qualified and who can use titles such as architect and building surveyor.  The Bill finally gives people getting a small extension built at the back of a house, business people investing in a business and developers building housing of any kind recourse to verifying on a register that the person they hire for a professional service is a legitimate practitioner.  The Bill will provide an element of comfort to people hiring the professional services of an architect, quantity surveyor or building surveyor.  I welcome the sections that provide for the management of such professions.  Each of those <Col N="820"/>areas will have a technical assessment board, a professional conduct committee and an appeals board.  At the end of that process in the case of a dispute, people will have recourse to the courts.</P>
        <P>In any fair system that would be legitimate.  If somebody wants to employ a professional, he or she needs to have a guarantee that person is properly qualified in the area in which he or she is practising.  If there is a problem with the service being provided, there needs to be a place to which one can go to make inquiries and remedy the situation and, if not, to take some action.  That is a legitimate right for anybody who employs a professional.  The safeguards provided in the Bill will ensure professionals who provide that service will have to comply with the regulations and that it will be in their own interest to do so.</P>
        <P>The codes of conduct and fitness to practise sections will ensure the service being provided by these professions will be at the standards required.  We are complying with EU directives in respect of qualifications and professional qualifications, in particular those of other member states.  That can be of benefit to us.  We need quantity surveyors, town planners and people to help us plan into the future.  If we cannot get them in this country, we will have to them elsewhere.  The legislation will ensure everybody is on a level playing pitch.  The way in which it is framed will be to our benefit in the long run.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and listened to his erudite explanation on issues dealing with insulation and heat loss, on which he and I disagree.  I tend to agree with the other player referred to in the construction industry on that argument.  When watching television last Friday night, I said to my wife that I might take the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and Gerry McCaughey to lunch some day and sit between them and try to get this issue sorted out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be an interesting lunch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not going to go down the road of either person&rsquo;s argument.  I was about to suggest looking at it differently.  I agree it is a mistake not to outlaw hollow block building.  I believe we should do that and there is an overwhelming argument for doing it.  In terms of independent surveys, there is one to match the other.  The Minister can say one, I can say Nicholas Stern.  The Minister can say another, I can say UCD.  The Minister can say &ldquo;heat loss&rdquo;, I can say &ldquo;heat maintained&rdquo;.  I would prefer to use the international figure for the amount of energy it takes to heat a cubic metre of house space per year.  We can argue up or down, one way or the <Col N="821"/>other.  I raised these issues with the Minister previously.</P>
        <P>I noticed recently in one area in Spain a decision has been taken that all new houses must have solar panels installed.  Why could we not insist in this legislation that every new house has solar panels attached to it?  What would it cost?  I have costed it and I have had it installed and know the exact energy savings.  That the grant scheme has not been extended to cover wind generators is a mistake.  That should be done.  In terms of the carbon footprint, etc. the Minister and I know that methane is 20 times as dense as carbon and that methane is the real problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the fact that we have promised, time and again, to charge for waste collection by volume, weight or bin, why is it there are still local authorities that charge an annual amount?  One can send out a barrow load every week and nobody makes any change.  While that is not the main issue being debated, perhaps the Minister would examine it.</P>
        <P>Two years ago I made the point here that the two greatest issues facing communities in Ireland and which would cause local authorities most aggravation &mdash; a hearing is taking place today &mdash; were energy and waste disposal.  Why not look at a situation where if local communities are prepared to look after their energy needs and waste, they would be given a tax break?  That is a sensible idea.  It is a properly incentivised approach and it would work.  One would then get a real debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister will recall that I tend to agree with him on the question of incineration.  From what I read, incineration must be part of any future discussion.  Like the Minister, I disagree with the idea of nuclear energy but I would like to hear a discussion on the balance between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, a debate which has never taken place in this House.  At least nuclear fusion is controllable.  If there is a need for a compromise, that is where it should be.  These debates have not taken place.  They are issues for another day and, perhaps, I will set up that lunch for the Minister and Mr. McCaughey and act as referee to see if we can write an agreed minute and move it forward.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the protection of the term &ldquo;architect&rdquo;.  I chaired the audit review group.  Having done that, it has been accepted by the Committee of Public Accounts that we failed to protect the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;, which was not possible at the time.  In the meantime, legislation has been passed to protect all sorts of nomenclatures of different people in the medical area, veterinary surgeons and others.  We are now looking at the issue of architects.  I wish to share my experience.  I agree with what the Minister is doing in the Bill.  I agree with the idea of protecting the title of &ldquo;architect&rdquo; and the other titles.  I <Col N="822"/>agree that the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on architecture makes some valid points, but I do not agree completely with it.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the argument Senator Bannon and the independent architects have made.  It is not rocket science.  I do not agree with all their arguments but they made a fundamental point.  If I were advising them, I would them I would advise them to stick to the fundamental point.  People who are doing a responsible job in the community deserve protection from this legislation.  How can one go about doing it?  Can it be done?  It has been done in many cases previously.</P>
        <P>In one former life I dealt with it in the case of what used to be called untrained teachers.  We had to find a way to deal with the issue when we brought in the teaching council and regulations.  It required flexibility, training, education, an openness of approach and recognition of a transition period between where we were and where we wanted to go.  If we are certain about where we want to go, we know we will arrive there.  If compromises must be made, we should make them.  That should be done by means of a structured process in a responsible way.  We did it for teachers by establishing courses to allow them avail of various training.  What was the qualification of the man or woman who designed the Hanging Gardens of Babylon?  What was the architectural qualification of the builder and designer of the Pyramids&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They were both members of the RIAI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or the Ponte Vecchio in Florence?  We must assume there are good architects who never had a qualification.  The independent architects may have gone overboard with the argument but they have made the point.  We have moved from there to architects and professionals developing at the knee of the master.  That is the way the profession developed.  The independent architects must recognise that we have moved on to another level and they should accept that.  In fairness, I think they do.</P>
        <P>The independent architects have one objection.  They disagree that it should be the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland that decides.  I have no problem with the architects doing it but the way they do it must satisfy me.  The concerns of the independent architects are well founded.  I am also a member of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority which has always had to deal with it in terms of independent auditors and accountants and which had to make changes and be flexible without dropping standards.  We had to raise standards all the way.  I would like us to reassure the independent architects that we do not want to bury them and that we are trying to attain standards and, by agreement with them, to find a way to move them into this system in a way that will protect them, their <Col N="823"/>livelihoods and the decent work carried out by those good people in that area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, for making his time available to me.  This is a very important matter.  Architecture is a most important and honourable profession.  I regret that my university does not have a faculty of architecture, which is a great shame.  There is one in the National University of Ireland.  I wonder why, even under this Bill, people with architecture degrees are not automatically regarded as professionally qualified architects.  They should be regarded as such.  It seems a nonsense to have a qualification but not be regarded as professionally qualified.</P>
        <P>The need for this kind of regulation is perfectly obvious in my neck of the woods.  A scandalous situation arose where some gobdaw up the road in Gardiner Street got several Georgian houses, painted them green, sectioned off everything and stuck a group of immigrants into them.  It was an appalling business.  This man claimed to be an architect and nobody could deny him that.  He just said he was an architect and nobody could take it away from him.  That person should not be allowed to practise.  The really horrible situation was that, while he was in court being convicted of one thing, the planning department of Dublin Corporation gave him permission for exactly the same thing in the back yard.  There is something really rotten in that.</P>
        <P>This is why we need a body that is independent.  The RIAI is a wonderful body.  I have spoken at various charity functions and know some of its presidents.  I delight in the appellation &ldquo;royal&rdquo;, but it is as odd as the Friends of the Library, of which I am chair.  The RIAI has not had a proper election in 50 years.  It does exactly what we do, namely, go into a darkened room with a few bits of cigar smoke, poke out all their pals and say, &ldquo;Here is the next president&rdquo;, to which everybody replies: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  That is it and good for them.  That is the way things should work, but it is not the way things can be seen as independent.</P>
        <P>I noticed that the Minister did not take on board a reasonable amendment from Deputy Quinn, even during the guillotined debate in the other House.  This amendment would have secured a degree of independence.  If one wishes to regulate things properly, one must have independence.</P>
        <P>What about the money?  A total of 10% of the RIAI&rsquo;s money comes from subscriptions.  What about the other 90%?  Where does it come from?  It concerns me.  The Minister is very clever, nimble on his feet and a great smear artist.  He shoves in a piece here about one player who says this, that and the other.  He should name and shame his pal.  Senator Leyden is a great one for naming and shaming.  Why does the Minister not come right out and wallop it to them, whoever they are, and let Members know?  However, we all know <Col N="824"/>that his Government and party have been unhealthily close to the construction and cement industries.  The Minister can laugh, smirk and snigger as much as he likes, but we know this is true.  We must ensure the body that regulates the architectural profession is not only clear of this but seen to be so.</P>
        <P>What method of assessment will be used for these people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It struck me that Senator Norris must come to that lunch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be delighted to come.  I accept that Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci were not qualified.  There is a need for a so-called grandfather clause of some kind, but I do not see any reason there should not be proper assessment.  It seems quite reasonable to me.</P>
        <P>However, there are a few problems with matters such as certification.  I have been supplied with some hypothetical situations which are worth putting on the record.  What about somebody who won a court action on the basis of technical evidence supplied by somebody who put himself or herself forward as an architect but did not have the kind of qualification required and is not subsequently recognised?  Could that judgment be nullified retrospectively?  If a client lost an action before the enactment of the Bill, could he or she go back to the court and say he or she lost it because the person who gave evidence against him or her subsequently failed to have themselves registered and acknowledged as an architect?  Is this possible?</P>
        <P>The question of fairness and anomalous situations then arises.  I have been presented with a hypothetical case.  I received a letter from a proud father which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">My son is an architecture graduate from UCD and has just returned home after working for twelve months as an architect in Germany.  One of his European colleagues has returned with him, and both are seeking new jobs in Dublin.  My son&rsquo;s friend is able to assert that he is suitably qualified and has no examinations or tests outstanding that bar him from Registration in Ireland.  <i>(See Article 46 of the EU Directive, 2005/36/EC.)</i>  However, my son must work for a year more before then being permitted to take an obligatory test in order to be Registered as a architect, here in his own country.  Both have EU recognised architectural degrees, both were treated as equals abroad and both have one year&rsquo;s working experience.  Why are they not equals here?</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have an affection for the RIAI.  I have been in its premises in Merrion Square and enjoyed the company of its members.  However, Joan O&rsquo;Connor stated in a radio interview that architects are not exactly immoral, they are amoral.  Like barristers, architects are guns for hire.</P><Col N="825"/>
        <P>The Minister should look at some of the crap that is being perpetrated in this city.  The phrase may be unparliamentary, but I use it advisedly.  Look at Telephone House in Marlborough Street.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">Absolutely.  Look at Telephone House in Marlborough Street where a row of perfectly fine 18th century domestic dwellings were demolished.  The site was sold off to the pension fund of a British trade union and that monstrosity was built and won an architectural award because of the slime running down its wall.  It is an appalling monstrosity.  They have carried out some titivation on it so it is not quite as bad.  When the IRA finally decommissions, will the Minister decommission whatever gelignite it has left in that site&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Will the Minister try to ensure that there are fewer one-bedroomed apartments with no parking spaces in the city of Dublin?  This creates a volatile, transient community whose cars are parked on the street.  Having alienated all my friends who are architects, I thank God that few of them are graduates of Trinity College and I leave Senator O&rsquo;Toole to deal with the backwash of anything I said to him last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The latter point is being dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him on bringing this Bill before it because this issue has been going around for some time.  It was left on the backburner for a long time and not given great priority, although European directives were involved.  The Bill involves more than the registration of architects because it is a building control Bill.  It is essential that a number of its features are introduced.</P>
        <P>The feature which has created the greatest degree of interest is the registration of architects.  I will declare an interest.  I am a member and fellow of the Irish Architects Society.  The RIAI has decided to bring the society under its umbrella when this Bill is passed.  It is important for me to put this on record.  Although I am not involved in it, I am still in the registration system in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the fact that the registration system for architects will be administered by the RIAI, which I expect to be a member of after this Bill is passed.  I would still prefer if it was administered by an independent organis<Col N="826"/>ation, as opposed to one group.  This concern has been expressed by many.</P>
        <P>I have some concerns with aspects of this Bill which will affect certain architects who currently practise in this country.  I refer to the section of the Bill which outlines the procedure for the registration of architects.  There is a fear on the part of some architects that this Bill may put them out of a job.  This is a matter of deep concern to them.  They are recognised as architects, have a number of buildings behind them, have a proven track record, have been practising for more than ten years, are successful in their trade and have made a major contribution to the economy.  However, under the terms of this Bill, they may have their livelihood taken from them, which is their great fear.</P>
        <P>I regard it as unconstitutional to deprive someone of their livelihood, irrespective of European rules and regulations.  If people who have been practising in the architectural profession up to the time of the enactment of the Bill can prove they have practical experience of architecture and have been working as architects, they should not be deprived of being registered as architects under this proposed legislation.  Proof of their case could be the use of the word &ldquo;architect&rdquo; in a letterhead or in signing documentation.  It would be a great injustice if we were to deprive people of their livelihood.  Following enactment of the Bill, to use the title, &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, it will be necessary for people to have qualifications and apply for registration.  That is a fair warning to anyone who wishes to practise in this profession in future.  If a person wishes to practise as an auctioneer and valuer, he or she must apply to the courts for registration.</P>
        <P>The independent group which represents professionally trained architects without formal qualification who have been practising for more than ten years has voiced concerns about the method of assessment to be used to assess those seeking registration.  The new registration body to be set up as a result of this Bill can choose its own assessment procedure.  This may mean an academically focused test could be put in place and this method of examination may not be the best way of examining practically trained architects with years of experience behind them.  It would be preferable for them to be judged on the quality of the buildings they designed.</P>
        <P>There was a closing date for registration of architects in 1997, and many were informed soon afterwards whether they had made it on to the list of eligible architects.  However, many architects were not informed by the Department of the closing date or even that there was such a registration process.  I expect the Minister will reply that advertisements were taken out in the national media to give people adequate warning.  I have sought to get a list of registered architects from the Department.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to make that list available on the Department&rsquo;s website or elsewhere.  It does not <Col N="827"/>appear to be available currently.  I would like to know how many names are on the list and I also want to check whether my name is on it.</P>
        <P>People have been left out in the cold on this issue and it is important that we remedy it.  To apply rules retroactively to a group of people who have been practising architects for many years is a costly and time-consuming business.  It is also unfair and puts undue pressure on professional practising architects.  In general, when introducing a new rule, it was thought wise to apply the rule to all future situations, while letting existing situations carry on as they were.  This has come to be known as the grandfather clause.  While I do not like the name, I agree with the sentiment behind it.  It is a question of acknowledging experienced practitioners of the architectural arts.  Many successful practices have great track records and employ other qualified architects.  A commonsense approach is required.</P>
        <P>The Minister is a practical politician with vast experience.  I do not think it is his intention to put anybody out of business but this may be a consequence of enacting the Bill as it stands.  People are concerned.  I have received numerous representations, as I am sure has the Department, from the group concerned that represents approximately 60 architects.  These, and the list of people who were excluded, may constitute the maximum number of individuals who will be affected.  If somebody without qualifications wanted to practise as an architect from today, it would be difficult for him or her to justify the case for registration.  I do not intend to table an amendment to the Bill and I accept it may be difficult for the Minister to have to bring it back to the D&aacute;il but I urge him to examine the views put forward by Members of this House who are being fair and reasonable about the approaches made to them.</P>
        <P>I met a practising architect yesterday who is very concerned about the future.  We are all facing a test in a few weeks.  The Minister will face the general electorate and I will face the Seanad electorate.  That is our profession and we must put our names before the people for ratification.  I hope the Minister will be successful and will return to Government again.  When people have been practising architecture daily, rearing a family, paying debts and making a contribution to society, they should not be deprived of their livelihood by legislation enacted by this House.  That is my concern and I hope the Minister will devise some procedure to ensure the recognition of those who have accumulated years of practical experience working as architects and who can put forward a portfolio of the work they have executed over a number of years as architectural technicians, draftsmen or architects.</P>
        <P>In fairness, an appeals system, the details of which the Minister outlined, will be in place.  Ultimately, I hope nobody will be deprived of a livelihood and I know that is also the wish of the Mini<Col N="828"/>ster.  I urge him to recognise the experience of architects who have been practising for years as opposed to academic qualification alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise some issues regarding the Bill.  Previous speakers touched on most of the major issues.  I agree with what Senator Leyden said in his opening remarks, that this issue has been long-fingered in recent years, which is a pity in light of the scale of construction that has taken place in the past ten years.  I refer in particular to the grading of insulation for new developments.  Perhaps the Minister can confirm or deny a statistic I read recently, namely, that somewhere between a quarter and a third of all housing units in the country have been built in the past seven or eight years.  If it is correct, that is an astonishingly high figure.  We should have gone down this route a number of years ago.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Leyden&rsquo;s reservations about some aspects of the Bill but, on the whole, I welcome it.  He objected to his inclusion in the so-called grandfather category of architects.  I will not refer to him as that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in that category.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is in the godfather category.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is essential that those who have full architectural qualifications would be acknowledged, but equally, people who have practical experience of working in the business over many years should also be acknowledged.  There will be an opportunity for further discussion in that regard.</P>
        <P>An area of particular concern to me has been that of enforcement in planning.  While there has been an improvement in local authorities, there is still not enough enforcement among the local authorities with which I deal.  There is not enough follow-up by planning departments to ensure adherence to all of the conditions of planning.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiments raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others in a Seanad debate six months or a year ago on the use of hollow blocks in construction.  There is a compelling case for banning the use of hollow blocks in new developments.  They are not used in most parts of the country but they are in certain areas, especially some parts of Dublin city.</P>
        <P>We must extend the environmental grants scheme introduced 18 months ago.  We must also examine installing solar panels in new housing developments.  Some people suggest solar panels are not practical in Ireland but they should be included in Government buildings and civic facilities.  Improvements have taken place but not enough has been done.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill but we must examine the so-called grandfather category mentioned pre<Col N="829"/>viously.  The categorisation of houses based on the standards of insulation must also be addressed.  There has been much poor development over the past 12 years in terms of insulation and architecture and perhaps this Bill is a case of locking the door after the horse has bolted.  The Government can ensure that new developments will be much better than those over recent years.</P>
        <P>I echo Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on the recently constructed building.  There have been shocking examples of apartments in the most unsuitable places.  I come from south Kilkenny but my local town is New Ross, County Wexford.  The Minister was born in County Wexford.  Some of the apartments built in New Ross are examples of appalling planning, even worse than the bad planning in Dublin city.  I welcome this Bill if it can ensure such bad design can be avoided.  I may have a deeper discussion and table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed by the lack of historical imagination shown by some speakers.  People have no idea how ancient civilisations were organised if they believe the wonders of the ancient world, such as the pyramids or the hanging gardens of Babylon were jerry-built by people without qualifications.  Just because we cannot decipher the hieroglyphs or the library of Alexandria has been lost does not mean these professions were not regulated.  The master guilds were closely regulated in the Middle Ages, in a hierarchical manner.  They existed under the <i>ancien regime</i> until the French Revolution.  If we had examined the Statute Law Revision Bill some of the Acts repealed related to crafts that are no longer in so much use.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a clever formula for controlling admissions.  The professional bodies are in charge of admissions but the majority of the admissions board is appointed by the Minister, a reasonable compromise.  The codes of conduct are important.  In the economy in which we live, mutual recognition of qualifications across the EU and, subject to qualification, elsewhere is desirable.  The hidden protectionism we and other countries had for the past 20 years is not appropriate to the thriving global economy we now have.</P>
        <P>If enforcement is to be effective there is no point in fines being payable to the Exchequer because there is no financial incentive.  If fines are paid to local authorities they have an incentive to enforce.  Enforcement has left much to be desired in the past.</P>
        <P>We approve of disability access and fire safety measures in buildings.  Energy performance and insulation is important.  We have forgotten how raw the Irish climate can be.  One realises this when reading the records of the number of soldiers who died of climatic effects waiting for the battle of Kinsale.  Climate and poor habitation had quite a bit to do with the 1 million people who died during the Famine of the 1840s.  We <Col N="830"/>have improved our housing stock beyond recognition.  We should pay tribute to the quality of public and social housing during the early decades of the State.  Many have lasted very well and have undergone improvement in private hands.  They look very well and compare favourably with what was built 40 years later.</P>
        <P>We now have choices that we did not have 30 years ago.  Apartment living was not a possibility, with very few exceptions.  It is widespread on the Continent in both capitals and provincial towns.  More apartments are now being built in provincial towns and the standard of many of them is excellent.  At the lower end of the scale, one wonders how well small, box-like structures will last and to what extent they will keep their value.  I came across some apartments in Cork city that were very damp.  This should not happen and, now that we have overcome the shortage of accommodation, there should be more emphasis on quality rather than quantity.</P>
        <P>I encourage people to adopt alternative energy supplements.  I would not make it compulsory but conservation and efficiency are important.  If one lives in an older house, too much insulation leads to dry rot.  One must be careful.  Concern was expressed on the Order of Business with regard to apartments entirely taking over the city, removing facilities such as hotels, filling stations and schools run by religious orders and invading green spaces and clubs.  Many of the finest capitals in Europe &mdash; Vienna is one example &mdash; have green squares at regular intervals.  I am utterly appalled at suggestions by people with so-called environmental credentials that we should allow half of St. Anne&rsquo;s Park in Raheny to be used for housing.  We should value our green spaces and not lightly give up any of them except for the most pressing and convincing social purposes, and certainly not just to make speculative profit for builders.</P>
        <P>The Minister is probably aware of a problem I increasingly encounter, that is, interruptions of the water supply.  Public water supply is just as essential as electricity.  Interruptions might be due to a combination of factors, including the effects of global warming and all the building taking place throughout the country.  However, when I was canvassing last Saturday with a councillor, he was constantly dealing with telephone calls about the water supply being cut off for several hours for the second day running in a local village.  In some cases interruptions are due to upgrading works but our water supplies are coming under pressure.  The Minister and his successors will have to seek more money from the Department of Finance to ensure people can be confident of their water supply in the same way as they are, broadly speaking, confident of their electricity or gas supplies.  Water is vital for many forms of economic activity, particularly in the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>People of certain political tendencies tend to throw around comments about my party&rsquo;s close<Col N="831"/>ness to the construction industry.  There has been huge development in this country in the past 20 years.  Not all of it was good but the majority was.  We should be proud of that development.  Dublin is a terrific city compared to what it was 20 years ago, when it was rather run down, or 50 years ago, when it was shabbily genteel and contained many slums.</P>
        <P>In most provincial towns people welcome development.  They are glad when new housing is built and that there will be a larger population to support better commercial, recreational and sporting facilities.  For a long time there was no development and the population was declining.  Most villages in my constituency have small housing estates, with many of them built in the past two years or so.  Incidentally, they appear to be high quality housing in so far as I can judge.  We should welcome that and be proud of it.  If that type of development is one of the engines firing the economy, so be it.  There is nothing wrong with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Minister accepted amendments to the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  That made a substantial difference to it.  I hope he will also listen to us in this House and that he will see fit to accept amendments which will improve the Bill.  The Bill deals with many issues.  I agree with the last point made by Senator Mansergh.  I am tired of being targeted with the accusation that we are the builders&rsquo; friends.  I have never heard anything so ridiculous.  Of course, we should seek to have proper buildings and developments and to provide affordable and social housing for people.  However, that does not imply one should be labelled the builders&rsquo; friend or carry that tag.  I would love to have builders as my friends but I do not.  It would be nice to have such friends.</P>
        <P>I have two reasons for raising the following issue, one of which is education and my awareness that there are several ways to acquire proper qualifications in addition to simply having technical titles after one&rsquo;s name.  I refer to a group of people who are a long time in the business of designing buildings, surveying, making bills of quantity and doing all the other tasks required to produce proper housing developments.  There has been some consultation with the Department on this matter.  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, will decide the assessment of the people who are a long time in the business and seek recognition under this Bill.  I am worried about such an arrangement.</P>
        <P>I do not know if the Minister is listening to me or writing, but what I am saying is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking down every word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not, and I know he is not.  I would be glad if, instead of writing up other people&rsquo;s comments, the Minister might listen to mine.</P><Col N="832"/>
        <P>The RIAI by its nature, regardless of how fine the individual members are as architects, would be elitist.  Its members have got their qualifications and are, as it were, kings of the walk.  They would seek to put a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around those whom they would allow into their enclave.  In that regard, I am uneasy that the RIAI will be the assessor of the qualifications of people who have been in the business for a long time and who seek recognition under this Bill.  I say this from the education point of view.  I am well aware that when people seek to enter third level college as mature students, what is taken into account is not so much their record of prior learning, although that has its place at a basic level, but life experience, the various positions those people have held, how they influenced events and how events have influenced them.  That type of experience is often better and can be assessed.</P>
        <P>I hope the Department could become the assessor of people with prior experience who were admitted to the building business under the grandfather clause.  I dislike that term as I find it somewhat denigratory.  However, it is in common usage.  I was lobbied about this issue and received extensive documentation on it, as is probably the case with every other Member.  As I read the documentation I thought about all the people I know who went into third level education but who did not, perhaps, have a leaving certificate or the necessary points.  However, they had lived life and that life experience stood to them.</P>
        <P>These people have lived their lives by working in a particular profession, be it quantity surveying, surveying or architecture.  That has been their business.  That experience should be the telling fact, rather than prior learning.  I hope our spokesperson, Senator Brady, with the Minister&rsquo;s help, will be able to put forward an amendment which will take cognisance of this factor.  I feel strongly about it because I know many people who have gained so much knowledge and have gone so far after getting their third level qualifications.  They simply did not have what one should have had when entering third level education.  Life experience should be taken into account.  I have always felt strongly about this, particularly with regard to women.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister was generous enough to take amendments when the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il.  I hope he will take on board amendments which the Seanad may bring forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this detailed Bill that recognises many aspects of building controls such as fire safety, disability access and parking in new developments and building standards authorities. <Col N="833"/> Credit is due to architects and surveyors for the work they have done in building developments.  Irrespective of what profession, there will always be the odd exception.  However, my dealings with architects and surveyors have been very professional and I found them very thorough in their approach.</P>
        <P>Members commented on the various types of buildings and fire safety.  It must be recognised the number of people promoting different types of building.  I am a strong advocate of concrete-built buildings.  I have seen situations where minor fires were controlled because the concrete was able to hold them.  I recall a timber-structured building that went on fire.  In less than an hour, there was nothing left but the steel scaffolding around the building.  It brings home the importance of fire safety in construction design.  Thousands of timber framed buildings are being erected.  Those involved in this type of construction must err on the side of caution for fire safety in design and construction.</P>
        <P>The proper inspection process for foundations is a necessity.  They must be checked to see if piling is required so that there will not be problems in the future.  Section 4 provides for a seven-day notice to a building authority before commencement of a project.  This is important.  It is also important that the building authority has the adequate professional staff to ensure detailed inspections are undertaken.  Section 5 provides that buildings over 1,000 sq. m. have alternative energy systems in place.  We know errors have taken place.  Often in building projects, there have been changes to the design adding extra costs.  It is always asked who is responsible.  It must be ensured that professional bodies are properly bonded and that a Government body or local authority will not be left carrying the can.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appeals process for professionals who may be affected by decisions of the admissions board to their professional bodies.  Credible building codes are to be welcomed.  I compliment all concerned with the developments that have taken place in this regard.  It is easy for the media to highlight how a development may not fit into its environment.  In time, it may be shown that the development was architecturally outstanding.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about the importance of proper and good water supplies.  It must be recognised that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has allocated substantial funding to local authorities to enable them to put in place excellent water schemes.  If local authorities were doing their job and planning ahead with development plans, the problems with water supplies would not be happening.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill and hope it sees speedy passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with great interest to various valuable contributions.  Senator Norris, my good friend, introduced a <Col N="834"/>sense of levity to the situation.  However, we are dealing with a serious issue and this legislation was long overdue.  As Senator Bannon stated, the longest lobby in democratic history must have been the one to register the name architect.</P>
        <P>The Bill has three main objectives.  First, it is to strengthen the enforcement powers of local building control authorities.  Second, it aims to improve the accessibility of buildings for people with disabilities, a matter precious to me.  I am pleased to be the Minister pushing this through and I know all Members share my anxiety in that.  Third, it provides for the registration of the titles of architect, quantity surveyor and building surveyor.</P>
        <P>Contrary to Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s assertion, I was listening attentively to contributions, including hers.  It is safe to say there is universal support in the House for the introduction of a disability access certificate.  I want to make such universal access a reality and believe this Bill will achieve that.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon asked that local authorities be able to take summary prosecutions through the district court, something for which the Bill provides.  The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, undertook in the D&aacute;il last week to consult the parliamentary draftsman regarding amendments tabled by Senator Bannon&rsquo;s party.  Those amendments would allow local authorities to recover the cost of enforcement action, and I am considering that.</P>
        <P>The Senator also mentioned that all sides of the House have welcomed the registration of architects, quantity surveyors and building surveyors.  There is more or less universal agreement that the time has come to protect consumers from unqualified persons passing themselves off as building professionals.  Among the great scourges in planning are those characters who draw houses essentially on the back of an envelope, trying to pass themselves off as architects.  Some quite extraordinary charlatans are operating.  I have seen in various local authority areas, including in my constituency, the appalling efforts that have been accepted.  Young couples have had to pay through the teeth for the results of the extraordinary and slipshod approaches taken.  It is very important that the titles of architect, quantity surveyor and building surveyor should be registered.</P>
        <P>Architects will have the option of joining the RIAI, which is not mandatory.  Senator Leyden, in an interesting contribution, asked regarding the list and mentioned previous difficulties in getting hold of it.  I have therefore made arrangements for it to be placed in the Library.</P>
        <P>Several Senators, including Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who has unfortunately left the Chamber, raised the technical assessment process for non-graduates.  In particular, she and several others mentioned the Group of Independent Architects, the GIAI.  The procedure for that assessment will be carried out by the technical assessment board to be established under section 19 of the Bill. <Col N="835"/> However, that will have a majority of non-architect members, appointed by the Minister.  As Senator Mansergh correctly spotted, it is quite an elegant solution to the problem that Senator O&rsquo;Rourke and others raised, namely, that there might be an element of incestuousness.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke also mentioned concerns regarding elitism.  The RIAI was agreed as the registration body by all the other architectural bodies, including the Irish Architects&rsquo; Society, the Association of Building Engineers, the Architects&rsquo; and Surveyors&rsquo; Institute, and the Group of Independent Architects.  It was not picked because of the appellation &ldquo;royal&rdquo; or any sense of elitism.  On the issue of control, the RIAI will have to prepare annual reports and detailed accounts, and registration fees will be approved by the Minister.  Senator Norris mentioned his concerns on both those points, which will be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden mentioned the question of providing a way for people with practical experience to register, as did Senator O&rsquo;Rourke.  Section 20 sets out the procedure, which enables a person to put forward information on projects that he or she has carried out, the very point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke.  The technical assessment board, which will have a majority of lay members, will conduct an interview.</P>
        <P>Senators Brady, Norris, Mansergh and others touched on the need to improve the standards of apartment buildings.  I could not agree more.  I am fully aware of the slime-coloured building mentioned, as well as one or two other monstrosities.  Senators Norris and Brady will both be interested to hear that I have issued proposals on improved standards for apartments, particularly their size and layout, in order that there might be a better mix of one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments.</P>
        <P>The last category will suit families, and Senator Brady pointed out that if we are to achieve greater housing density and prevent urban sprawl, we must create apartments that are user-friendly and family-friendly, with basic amenities such as storage facilities and laundry rooms.  There are now some very good examples, especially where the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is making a very real effort.  I know from talking to the Taoiseach that he takes a more than merely constituency interest in it.  It is interesting to see what is beginning to be realised.</P>
        <P>Senators Brady, Norris and Mansergh spoke about the need to improve the standards of apartments and their general appearance, a suggestion to which I would sign up.  Senator O&rsquo;Rourke asked about restricting an architect from practising if he or she has not registered or was unsuccessful in the assessment process.  It simply means that such a person will not be able to use the title of architect.</P><Col N="836"/>
        <P>The assessment process, to which several Senators, in particular Senator Leyden, referred, was carried out in 1996 in connection with a proposed amendment to the EU architects directive then current.  Some 170 architects were successful, just more than 50% of those who applied for the assessment, and as I have already said, the list is in the Library.</P>
        <P>Senators Mansergh and Moylan both touched on water supply.  Senator Moylan in particular raised a favourite point of mine.  I am increasingly impatient with the level of delivery.  Last Thursday in Castlebar, I was in the very happy position of announcing the biggest allocation ever made by a Minister in the history of the State towards rural water schemes.  We have invested hundreds of millions in the past two years.  The president of the Group Water Scheme Federation said he had never thought he would see the day when one could envisage an end to second-rate water in the rural countryside.  The money is there, as is the building capacity, and I urge councils to be much more ambitious than hitherto.</P>
        <P>Senators Mansergh and O&rsquo;Rourke also mentioned the building and construction industry.  I am at a loss as to how people in the Oireachtas and politics in general can continue to demonise it and the political choices it has made.  Let us remind ourselves that 250,000 men and women now work in the industry producing first-rate houses and commercial buildings at a higher rate than anywhere else in Europe.  In 1988, just 20 years ago, there were 71,000 people in the building and construction industry.  If I were a carpenter, plumber, bricklayer, roofer or building supplier, I know I would have a political preference, and people have the right to make such choices in a democracy.  There has been continual demonisation of the industry.  They are not all saints or devils, and I cannot understand it.</P>
        <P>The issue of technical assessment was touched on.  The RIAI will not set the technical assessment for non-graduate architects.  That will be done by the technical assessment board to be established under section 19.  The procedures are set out under section 20.  The suggestion that there might be some incestuous attempt to protect vested interests is refuted.  The RIAI will be the registration body, and section 11 requires the establishment of an admissions board.  A prudent balance has been struck in this case.  Three architects will be appointed to the board, together with four non-architects nominated by the Minister.  It will be chaired by a retired judge, solicitor or barrister.</P>
        <P>Senator Moylan mentioned fire issues regarding timber construction.  Fire safety is imperative irrespective of the building medium, and any medium subject to fire obviously imposes its own specific constraints.  The Senator mentioned a particular instance, and a recent case in north County Dublin caused me concern; a tiny spark on an external balcony led to a fire in internal <Col N="837"/>wall cavities that destroyed at least five homes.  Questions will have to be asked in that regard.</P>
        <P>A general issue raised was the energy performance of Irish buildings.  On occasion I suggest things to the media, who do not always listen, but I make the following suggestion to Members of the Oireachtas and the public in general.  A myth has developed that energy performance in Ireland is uniquely low, but that is a complete untruth.  It has been put about by one particularly powerful and loquacious individual with deep pockets who is a timber lobbyist.  I would argue that people should look at each medium on its individual merits.  The suggestion that the Government shows bias to the cement industry is risible, particularly given my own relationship with some of the bigger people in the concrete sector where I have been regarded as one of the biggest thorns in their side.  It is astonishing that this mythology is trotted out repeatedly.</P>
        <P>The first point, that there is a particular bias towards concrete, is an absolute myth.  The fact that this myth is peddled in the self interest of one lobbyist is demonstrated by the fact that the timber industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister ought to name and shame him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be improper for me to name somebody who is not in the House.  The Senator&rsquo;s colleague has already done it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister tell me privately afterwards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the Senator privately afterwards.  However, the self-serving myth that has been put around is nonsense.  It has been very well put around by a lobbyist who buys a lot of advertising space.  If it were true, one would have a hard time explaining the wonderful penetration which has been made by the timber sector in building and construction.  Some great work has been done there.  I believe it is a very good medium which has made a major contribution towards allowing us to build out.  We should therefore stop dealing with the myth and deal with the reality instead.  </P>
        <P>The second and more important point, however, concerns an argument that is simply untrue.  It is suggested that Irish homes are somehow or other sub-standard, whereas we have houses that are among the highest standards in the European Union.  The proof of that is as follows.  The European insulation manufacturers&rsquo; association, which has no specific interest in arguing the case for one medium or another, made the point that Irish standards ranked very highly.  They found that we have the second lowest energy loss through walls behind Sweden, and the lowest loss of energy through roofs of any EU state.  So a myth has been propagated in that regard.</P><Col N="838"/>
        <P>The second myth that has been propagated is that somehow or other we are lagging behind Europe.  I will deal with this matter again because it annoys me.  In the last ten years alone there have been three separate occasions on which energy ratings have actually increased in this country.  I have made a proposal that we will shortly increase the energy efficiency of Irish homes further, by 40%, which is part of the climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>Another extraordinary point has been made which shows that those who make it know very little about Europe or reality in general.  It is the suggestion that Ireland is behind the game in terms of European comparisons.  In my introductory remarks, I mentioned that prior to the EU directive being put in place, Denmark was the only EU member state that had a building energy rating system.  Four member states introduced such a system last year and we became the fifth, having introduced it as and from 1 January this year.  That suggestion is therefore simply untrue.  It is a myth that is put around by a particular lobby yet, amazingly, without ever checking the facts, people in our media accept it.  It is disappointing that people in the Houses of the Oireachtas have also accepted it.</P>
        <P>This year, some seven countries will adopt energy rating systems, of which Ireland was the first.  To illustrate the point further, the European Commission has sent formal, legal, reasoned opinions to 16 member states.  Ireland was never part of that process.  It has also been asserted that my Department has been reluctant to support local authorities in this area.  The charge was not made in this House but in the Lower House.  In fact, we have commended D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its efforts.</P>
        <P>I wish to thank and compliment Senators for their contributions, some of which were scintillating and in Senator Norris&rsquo;s case, Joycean &mdash; written in a language that most people do not understand, but that was Joyce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, vulgar too, that is right.  I wish to thank Members of the House for their contributions, however.

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House and call on Senator Norris to speak on his Adjournment matter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I am particularly glad that he is in the Minister&rsquo;s chair.  In the early days of my political career, I recall listening to him as a young Deputy talking passionately to a virtually empty D&aacute;il Chamber about social conditions in his own constituency.  I think it was the area around Ballymun, although I cannot remember.  He knew the details of people&rsquo;s personal circumstances there and felt a commitment towards improving them.  I thought that was the kind of politics in which I wanted to be involved.  I am grateful therefore that Deputy Haughey is the Minister who is taking this Adjournment matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it was Darndale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Darndale, yes, I remember that very clearly.</P>
        <P>In respect of this Adjournment matter, I must declare a series of interests.  I have raised it because of some old friends of mine who may be known to the Minister of State, at least by reputation.  I have asked their permission to mention their names.  They are George Morrison and his wife Janet.  George is one of our most distinguished artists in film, having made films such as &ldquo;Mise &Eacute;ire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Saoirse&rdquo;.  Like many artists, he is not a money grubber.  He has not always had huge amounts of money but he has made a comfortable and civilised home for himself in a little by-way near Shankill.  However, a short time ago he suffered a bad stroke, which incapacitated him to some degree.  It means that he cannot drive a car and neither can his wife who has also been unwell.  They would have been in difficulty has it not been for a group called Choices, which was founded by the sister-in-law of a lady with whom I was in college.  There are therefore all kinds of connections here and Choices is run by a remarkable group of people.</P>
        <P>In case I overstay my time, I want to frontload the demand now.  We are seeking funding <Col N="840"/>amounting to &euro;30,000 in order to put the existing driver in the scheme on a full-time basis.  The current driver has been with them for three years.  The idea of the scheme is that people who are incapacitated make use of the befriending service and its driver in order to take them to the post office, chiropodist, chiropractor, the chemist to collect prescriptions or the library to exchange books.  Without such a service, elderly people would be isolated, lonely and deprived.</P>
        <P>This unique service has been running for 18 years and is largely dependent on community employment schemes.  As the Minister of State knows, however, these schemes terminate after three years.  The current driver is coming to the end of his period.  He is known and loved by the clients.  It is so often necessary to ensure that  elderly, dependent people know and trust the person who is dealing with them.  The driver is reliable, trustworthy and responsible.  The service provided to these people is totally free of charge.  In addition, State agencies already rely on this service and, in turn, refer people to it.  Although the State is making use of it, the service receives no core funding whatever.  There are minor fundraising events such as cake sales, and the service occasionally receives grants from charitable endowments.  Over the last five years, the transport service has been funded by people in need. They must pay for diesel, maintain the people carrier and they now want core funding to keep the enterprise going.</P>
        <P>The service started 15 years ago.  In 1989, there was an RTE programme on the problems of isolation facing elderly people and the pressures placed on them by society.  As a result, a sister-in-law of a friend of mine decided to get something done, distributed leaflets to local shopping centres and areas of housing where older people lived and was amazed at the overwhelmingly positive response.</P>
        <P>The people involved indicated their priorities and of utmost importance was addressing the issue of loneliness.  A lack of day-to-day company and social contact left elderly people feeling isolated.  Transport was also an issue and the problems of getting to and from the doctor, post office, chiropodist, shops and the outpatients area of hospital were mentioned.  Such a service is not only a practical necessity, it also provides a social outlet that relieves depression, lets elderly people meet others and even argue.  The service also helps in the collection of pensions and prescriptions.</P>
        <P>After the initial phase, the befriending the elderly service began.  The group wisely and sensitively decided not to go into competition with existing local parish services such as those provided by St. Joseph&rsquo;s Roman Catholic church in Crinken.  Instead of walking roughshod all over such services, they negotiated and sought to find out how they could complement them.</P>
        <P>Many long-established clients rely on the service and it would be a great pity if they were <Col N="841"/>to be deprived of it.  As I indicated, the value of the service is evident in the fact that the group receives some support, albeit sporadic, from groups such as the F&Aacute;S community employment schemes, the County Dublin Vocational Educational Committee and so on.  At the moment, more than 40 clients are on the befriending list, and without the support of Choices Local Enterprises and the befrienders, they would have no way of accessing the kind of services and community facilities they can with this team.  The clients have been enabled to maintain their ability to live independently and we have often heard in this House of the value of independent living to people in wheelchairs and people with intellectual disabilities.</P>
        <P>The group provides a service for people who are isolated, elderly, victims of stroke and debilitating illnesses and so on, with no cost to the client.  There is support from community employment schemes but such schemes terminate after three years.  The seven seater bus used for clients was paid for through funding from People in Need but everything else was paid for through fundraising.</P>
        <P>However, the group is on a very tight budget, as is clear in the pathetic funding scheme I have in my possession.  The Christmas raffle raised &euro;596 and clients&rsquo; donations raised &euro;45: the widow&rsquo;s mite.  Car cleaning is listed here as earning &euro;247.41, so some volunteers must have performed a bob-a-job style fundraiser like the scouts.  I do not know what the Catherine Howard Foundation is but it is obviously a charitable group and it provided &euro;1,500.  A printing and secretarial service came to &euro;257 and the group ran a bingo night that came to almost &euro;1,000.  Expenses included petrol, bingo shopping, van maintenance and a Christmas party for clients that cost less than &euro;500.  Who could possibly begrudge them that little bit of fun and entertainment?  I know the Minister of State would not.</P>
        <P>After all this, Choices Local Enterprises ended up &euro;18.08 in the red.  I believe the Minister of State will understand what a significant function is played by this admirable group and I hope he will indicate a method whereby the State can assist in ensuring the service continues.</P>
        <P>It is remarkable that an artist of the calibre and standing of George Morrison, who has given so much service to this State, should have found it necessary to approach me regarding this issue.  He said he and Janet were in difficult circumstances and could not have survived without this group.  If this service is not continued, 40 clients will go without and a number may then need to be taken into State-funded care facilities.  Although it may be unwarranted, many elderly people are terrified at going into such facilities involuntarily owing to recent publicity on television programmes.  Such a scenario would also cause a significant charge to the State so it would be both a good day&rsquo;s work and a good investment to find a way to provide some assistance to this wonderful group.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and I thank Senator Norris for raising this issue.  It provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to services for older people and explain the current position regarding funding for Choices Local Enterprises.</P>
        <P>The development of services for older people is a priority for this Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in the budgets of 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full-year cost of &euro;150 million, and this year, a full-year package of &euro;255 million has been allocated for services for older people.  This gives a total of more than &euro;400 million added to services for older people over two years.</P>
        <P>Government policy on older people is to support them to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, the Health Act 2004 gave the Health Service Executive, HSE, responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  As a corporate body, the provision of these services, including the delivery of services by agreement with voluntary and community organisations, is a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>Funding for health services has been provided as part of the HSE&rsquo;s overall Vote for health and personal social services in 2007.  The allocation of resources is a matter for the HSE in accordance with the overall priorities for specific services as set out in its service plan.  The HSE is more than happy to meet Choices Local Enterprises to discuss the services it provides and it has advised that two appointments were made for this discussion but, unfortunately, on both occasions these meetings were cancelled.  However, renewed efforts are being made to organise a meeting that is convenient to the organisation.</P>
        <P>I understand that Choices Local Enterprises is also considering applying to the HSE for lottery funding.  It is aware that its application should be submitted by Friday, 16 March 2007.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children also provides funding to voluntary organisations under a national lottery funded grant scheme.  This funding is discretionary, and if Choices Local Enterprises wishes to make an application for funding, it should contact the finance unit of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>A meeting will be arranged with the HSE and there are possible sources of funding for the group, including lottery funding from the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter and hope it can be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="843"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and was not aware of the cancelled meetings nor the reasons for the cancellations.  I will encourage the group to take up this opportunity for a meeting and will suggest it makes applications, which should include this debate from the Official Report of the House, to both sources.  This will be intended as an encouragement to State agencies to assist in this valiant enterprise.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  As a member of the board of Scoil Naomh Iosaf in Adare, I ask the Minister of State for an update on the school&rsquo;s request to have an assessment carried out to determine the role of the Old Monastery CBS buildings in meeting the school&rsquo;s future education needs.  The buildings are in urgent need of repair and improvement and are being temporarily used by Scoil Naomh Iosaf to house a physical education hall, an extra classroom and a learning support classroom for speech, drama and modern language classes.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As the Minister of State is aware, while the property forms part of the school complex, it is not vested with the Department.  The buildings are vested with the bishop&rsquo;s nominees and trustees and the parish priest of Adare who have requested the Department to carry out an urgent assessment because the property is in a poor state of repair.  The educational needs of the community in Adare are at stake.  Given the urgency of the suitability of the buildings, I ask the Minister of State if the assessment could be carried out by the Department in the near future, with a view to meeting the future educational needs of the Adare community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects.  Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013, funding of &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in the first and second level schools modernisation and development programme.  This unprecedented level of investment will allow us to meet the needs of a growing school population, modernise existing school facilities and provide for curriculum reform and innovation.</P><Col N="844"/>
        <P>A total of 7,800 individual schools building projects were delivered for the &euro;2.6 billion investment during the 2000-06 period of the previous national development plan.  The completion of building projects under the &euro;4.5 billion investment in the new NDP will benefit from recent innovations in delivery mechanisms which have allowed for fast tracking of priority school developments.  Schools will have noted that activity under the new plan is already under way, with 1,500 schools building projects due to be delivered in 2007.  In addition, in association with the Minister, I announced yesterday the approval of more than &euro;87 million for building projects in 250 schools under the permanent accommodation and small schools schemes.</P>
        <P>On the specific matter in hand, an application for capital funding towards the provision of additional accommodation has been received in the school planning section of the Department from Scoil Naomh Iosaf, Adare, County Limerick.  The application is being examined with a view to establishing the future accommodation needs of the school.  The continued future use of the Old Monastery CBS building and land will be taken into consideration in the course of this assessment.  The project is banded in accordance with the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects and will be considered in the context of the multiannual schools building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter which allows me to outline the progress being made under the schools building and modernisation programme and the position of Scoil Naomh Iosaf, Adare, County Limerick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  The issue I raise on the Adjournment concerns special needs in education.  Recently, I was presented with a case in County Kilkenny involving a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome who attends her local national school.  Following much agitation by her parents, she has secured 2.5 resource hours of additional teaching from the 18-hour allocation granted to the school as a whole.  I am led to believe that from next year onwards, the child in question will receive only 30 to 60 minutes resource teaching out of the school&rsquo;s overall resource teaching allocation.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to outline the position with regard to the allocation of resource hours.  I understand from the case and some work I have undertaken in this regard that, until two or three years ago, children with Down&rsquo;s syn<Col N="845"/>drome were automatically allocated a certain number of hours of resource teaching when they commenced school and that these hours were not subtracted from the school&rsquo;s overall allocation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will agree that early intervention in the cases of children with special educational needs ensures they do not become a financial burden on the Exchequer.  The decision to remove the automatic qualification for resource hours for children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome is a step in the wrong direction.  Surely intervention would allow children with this condition to lead much more independent lives as adults.  Any cutback in this regard is a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>I understand Down&rsquo;s syndrome affects approximately 250 children in the general school system, a very small proportion of the primary school population.  Perhaps the Government, in the short period it has left in office, will be in a position to reverse the change in entitlements made several years ago to ensure intervention in the educational development of children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome takes place at the earliest possible date in order that they can live independently in future.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Senator has given me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of extra teaching support for children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  As the Senator will be aware, the Government has established a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including those with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  The professionally assessed needs of the individual child determine the appropriate model of response in each case.</P>
        <P>Children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system for children with high incidence special needs or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need.  The general allocation system for primary schools was introduced in September 2005 in order that children with high incidence special needs such as mild general learning disability could secure resource teaching support at school without the need for an individual assessment in each case.  All schools have been allocated resource teaching hours, depending on their enrolment levels.</P>
        <P>A number of benefits are associated with the new system.  It puts in place resources on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels, facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols, reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective delivery of services.  The new system means that instead of each school having <Col N="846"/>to make individual applications for resource hours for such pupils, an allocation of resource teaching hours is provided in advance to the school.  It is a matter for the school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs who will receive this support.  With the thousands of resource teachers now in place in our schools, each school has enough general allocation hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.  School authorities can use their professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided among pupils to ensure all their needs are met.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before the Department allocated resource teaching hours.  This time-consuming process often led to delays in children getting the support they needed.  Learning support and resource teachers are now in place in all primary schools in order that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</P>
        <P>The new general allocation system does not preclude the provision of one-to-one tuition to pupils who need such support.  A significant percentage of children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome have been assessed as having a mild general learning disability, which comes under the high incidence disability category.  Thus, they are given extra teaching support from within the school&rsquo;s general allocation of resource teaching support.  In circumstances where a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome has other associated needs and falls into the low incidence disability categories, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation. Such applications should be referred to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, by the school.</P>
        <P>Far from withdrawing supports from children with special needs, the Government has presided over a dramatic expansion in special education supports.  There are now 15,000 adults in our schools working solely with children with special needs.  A fraction of this number was in place some years back.  This complement includes more than 8,000 special needs assistants, compared with only 300 in 1998.  The system for accessing supports has also improved through the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, with its network of 80 local special educational needs organisers.</P>
        <P>Further improvements in services are on the way with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  More than &euro;820 million is being provided for special education in 2007.  This is &euro;180 million, or nearly 30%, more than what was provided in the 2006 Estimates.  The Department will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs, includ<Col N="847"/>ing those with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, have the supports they need to reach their full potential.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator once again for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer but there are several points I wish to clarify.  He stated, &ldquo;With the thousands of resource teachers now in place in our schools, each school has enough general allocation hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.&rdquo;  I could mention several schools that do not have access to adequate resources.  This statement would gall those who are in a similar position to the family about which I spoke.</P>
        <P>I accept there has been a great improvement in the allocation of resources for children with special educational needs, as the Minister of State outlined.  That is welcome.  There is clearly a case to be made, however, for children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  It is a condition that effects only a small proportion of the primary school popu<Col N="848"/>lation and which responds well to early intervention.  The provision of additional supports in the classroom will ensure these pupils can live independent lives in the future.  Only a meagre allocation of resources is required to bring significant benefits.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the progress made in this area.  For the level of financial outlay involved in my proposal, the benefits to the State far outweigh the costs that would be incurred.  The Minister of State spoke about upcoming legislation in this area.  I urge that some provision be made to ensure students with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are assisted in living independent lives as they grow into adults.  Only a small proportion of the population of our primary schools is involved.  This small investment will bring a great improvement in the standard of their lives and those of their loved ones.</P>

	<P>I will ask the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to consider this matter further in view of the Senator&rsquo;s comments.</P>
