	<P>I have received notice from Senator Keaveney that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to give an update in relation to the site acquired in a location (details supplied) and the current status of each of its three constituent parts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the plans he has to alleviate the impending water shortages due to climate change.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the up-to-date position regarding the provision of the much needed second level school for the Leopardstown-Stepaside area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the recent agreement between the HSE and the pharmaceutical wholesalers is renegotiated.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McCarthy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to furnish a report on the up-to-date progress of the much promised and long overdue sewerage scheme in Skibbereen, County Cork; and when he expects the work to be completed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Keaveney, McFadden <Col N="334"/>and Corrigan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ross and McCarthy may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

	<P>Today is World Mental Health Day.  Since 1992, a specific day has been designated to offer the opportunity to communicate about mental health issues.  I raise the issue because worrying information has been published on the website of the Mental Health Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, two 13 year olds were admitted to psychiatric wards, as were six 14 year olds, five 15 year olds and 95 children aged 17.  What are we doing admitting young children with mental health problems to adult psychiatry wards in 2007?  One can imagine the state of mind of these children when they need admission only to find they are being admitted to an adult inpatient ward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This raises serious questions about the neglect of mental health services.  The report, A Vision for Change, was supposed to be implemented and I would like to get an update on that.  A number of inpatient units for children and adolescents were promised, units that are long overdue, and we should be told what progress is being made.  The unit in Cork is seven years behind schedule.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has written to the Dublin mid-Leinster region stating that the waiting list for child and adolescent psychiatric referrals is two years long and that it will accept only urgent referrals for children who need specialist help.  The waiting list is two years long, there are huge numbers of extra referrals and the lack of team resources over a prolonged period, whereby the team is staffed at 40% of recommended levels, means the decision has been taken to close the waiting list.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister said here last week that current cutbacks are not affecting patients.  The evidence in the two examples I have given highlights how patients are suffering because of the state of the health service.  We should debate these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We are at the point in the lifetime of a Government when it starts to fill vacancies on boards of directors.  We have previously said that it would be appropriate for this House to have a vetting function in the appointment of directors.  If people are to be appointed to the board of Aer Lingus, would it not be useful <Col N="335"/>to do the same as other democracies, where the vacancies are publicly advertised and those who apply and those who are proposed by the Minister come before a committee of this House or a joint committee to show their expertise, experience, skill and independence?  If we were to do so, it would be a major step towards engendering new trust and confidence in the political system.  We should have a debate soon on the issue of filling directorships in State and semi-State bodies.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise another issue briefly.  The Government made an extraordinary decision yesterday regarding the European treaty.  This House discussed approximately five Bills last year concerning co-operation on policing matters between various European countries, but I do not know where we stand anymore.  We passed legislation which made it possible for somebody in Ireland to be required to give evidence and be part of an investigation in another country.  At that stage, I specifically asked the Minister if there was not a difficulty in terms of the Napoleonic code being married to our common law process.  I was told that this could be done without difficulty, yet suddenly there is a problem.  Surely there is a need for us to discuss this matter now.  It should have been discussed before the Government took a decision on it.  This is how the first Nice referendum was lost because people took decisions and then expected support afterwards.  I do not understand why the Government made that decision but it should have initiated a debate so that we would have known where we were going.  I will be slow to support something which makes life easier for criminals, particularly when we have taken action previously to accommodate movement between states.  If that means our leaving the Schengen agreement, in a final position, then we should be sufficiently big, strong and independent to do that.  Just because the British want to have people in uniforms at their borders does not mean we must follow suit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance has recently published a report by the decentralisation implementation group.  Will the deputy leader request the Minister to attend the House for a debate on that report?  Despite all the spin used to soft-soap the issue, the report shows that progress has been lamentably slow concerning the Government&rsquo;s so-called decentralisation programme.  The report also shows that no more than 15% of a projected 11,000 civil and public servants have moved under the scheme, notwithstanding the fact that it was introduced four years ago.  Does the deputy leader agree that the entire decentralisation programme was ill-conceived and deserves debate after four long years, given that it has not unfolded as planned?  The House should consider this topic in the context of the public service generally.</P><Col N="336"/>
        <P Just="Left">The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has indicated to the Minister that it would not be prudent or appropriate for Revenue computer staff to move.  The Minister said he has been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there were some business continuity issues.  In plain English, however, the language used by the Minister means it has been accepted that they will not move.  They are in such an important position that they cannot be compelled to move.  I wonder how many other business continuity issues there are across the civil and public service that ought to be considered in this context?  When can we expect to have Government proposals on real decentralisation and real reform of local government?  Instead of pretending that moving civil servants out of Dublin constitutes decentralisation, which is a sham, let us have a real debate on the matter.  Although it would be an advance to have elected mayors in major cities, let us hope that it will not simply amount to that because real root and branch reform of local government is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are all shocked and horrified by the brutal murder in Galway yesterday of Manuela Riedo from Switzerland.  In the history of the State, we have never had so many murders occurring in one week.  This is a horrific ordeal for the student population of Galway, which totals 20,000, as well as their families.  Those whose children have studied abroad under the ERASMUS programme will share the grief of the families involved.  I hope the person responsible will be brought to justice.  I appeal for full co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the regions dealing with murders.  Every murder is important and significant to the families of those who have died.  I share the grief of all those affected by the tragic deaths in Dublin in the past week.  I know the House will support me in that regard.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that there will be a debate on Shannon today the motion before the House does not include this point: Dermot Mannion must have a death wish for Aer Lingus because he is proceeding with the hub in Belfast despite not having negotiated with the pilots.  He will dismiss all the pilots and withdraw a service from the mid-west.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the deputy leader outline the rationale behind the decision to opt out of the new EU reform treaty regarding criminal and policing measures?  There has been significant growth in cross-border and international crime, and our coastline is porous, as shown by the shipments of drugs for onward movement, perhaps across the sea again.  This is difficult for the citizen to accept.  I also call for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>What is the status of the Fitzgerald report which promised 100 extra garda&iacute; for Limerick to be led by a Garda superintendent and a dedicated branch of the Criminal Assets Bureau to deal with the growth in hardline crime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the deputy leader call an urgent debate on suicide?  Last year there were 417 reported suicides and there were possibly many more not reported.  I welcome the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s announcement today that it will give &euro;500 to an advertising campaign for the prevention of suicide.  The campaign will start today and will be on television. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely it is giving more than that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When I was on my intense Seanad election campaign many councillors around the country pleaded with me to raise <Col N="338"/>the issue of suicide here.  There is an epidemic of suicide.  I look forward to a debate on this matter.  We must get the idea that there is no longer a stigma attached to suicide or attempted suicide onto the radar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the deputy leader consider holding a debate on abortion, a topic of ongoing concern, particularly to women?  Politicians have ignored and overlooked the topic.  Governments have failed to legislate for abortion, particularly to provide for the circumstances in which an abortion may be carried out in line with the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, whereby continuing a pregnancy poses a real and substantial risk to a woman&rsquo;s life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a recent poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> 69% of women surveyed said they would favour the Government&rsquo;s legislating to provide for the X case circumstances.  A total of 54% said they would like to see abortion legalised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, a senior Church of Ireland bishop justifiably criticised politicians for their spinelessness and hypocrisy in failing to face up to this issue.  In respect of the X case in 1992, a Supreme Court judge was similarly critical of politicians for failing to legislate and leaving the matter to judges.  In this context, I ask the deputy leader to try to face up to the collective cowardice of politicians regarding this issue and to consider holding a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a great honour and privilege for me to be in this House and I look forward to having the opportunity to contribute to, and participate in, many debates on various issues.  I wish the Cathaoirleach and other Members all the best for the coming session.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On World Mental Health Day, I ask the deputy leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to address the House on the implementation of the framework report, A Vision for Change, which was intended to establish state-of-the-art mental health services in Ireland.  The framework has received the support of patients, families, professionals and advocate groups and provides for comprehensive support, responses and services for those who face the challenge of mental health illness.  Moreover, it is of particular importance in that it also provides for the promotion and maintenance of good mental health well-being for all.</P>
        <P>A new HSE report has indicated that at least 23% of Irish citizens will be affected, either directly or through a family member, by mental health issues.  A total of 11,000 people annually will engage in or attempt intentional self-harm and 500, or possibly more, will die by suicide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will add to Senator Mary White&rsquo;s contribution on this issue.  Last night, the HSE launched an advertisement campaign to coincide with World Mental Health Day and I understand Senator White intended to state it has a budget of &euro;500,000.  It is important that such advertisements should contribute to ensuring the creation of an <Col N="339"/>environment and the fostering of a climate of openness to discuss mental health issues and challenges.  However, this can only work when the requisite responses are in place to support those who come forward.  The deputy leader should invite the Minister before the House as I believe the implementation of A Vision for Change will provide the supports and services for people.  Moreover, Members can play their role in the creation of an environment in which it is possible to discuss mental health issues in a positive context and in ensuring that people appreciate there is light at the end of the tunnel by being open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was deeply concerned to read reports on the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture&rsquo;s review of the Irish Prison Service.  It cites gross violations of human rights, violence and the ongoing procedure of slopping-out cells.  While many Members will never see the inside of a prison, it is clear there has been a mass proliferation of drugs, gang warfare is taking place and the entire Irish Prison Service is in chaos.  In 1995, a former Member, T. K. Whitaker, produced a report on penal reform.  A couple of months ago, he produced a review of the report entitled, The Whitaker Committee Report 20 years on: Lessons learned, or lessons forgotten?  While the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated his intention to produce a Bill on penal reform by the end of 2006, it appears to have been forgotten.  The deputy leader should ask the present Minister to come before the House to outline his plans for penal reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the deputy leader to arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House in the near future in order that Members can debate a matter of importance, namely, the funding of CURA by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. It is appalling that this body has failed to fund CURA, which does tremendous work for young girls who find themselves needing help and support.  I ask that we have a debate on this matter.  I am sad to see the failure of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to live up to its responsibilities, and this should be addressed in the House.  If there is any impediment from the Government with regard to the terms of reference of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, that should be exposed and debated here.</P>
        <P>In a lighter vein, I welcome the recent initiative in which the DUP, the ruling party in Northern Ireland, and the Catholic Church, the majority church on the island, have come together to oppose the introduction of abortion on either side of the Border.  This is to be welcomed.  It is time the silent majority articulated their views to prevent a small liberal minority from engineering a situation which would be detrimental to human rights in this country.  A primary human right is <Col N="340"/>the right to life, and this must be articulated, safeguarded and defended at all costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I called for a debate on the possibility of Ireland&rsquo;s opting out of the EU criminal and policing measures provided for in the new reform treaty.  It was agreed to have an urgent debate on this matter.  We now know that the decision has been made by the Government.  However, it is rather discourteous to this House and to the Lower House that there has been no debate on what is potentially a constitutional issue.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, after the original Nice referendum debacle there was much soul searching in this House and in the Oireachtas generally about what went wrong.  Clearly, people were not informed about EU matters.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Deputy Brian Cowen, spoke in this House about new measures and procedures that had been put in place by the Government for greater scrutiny of EU legislation and said there would be an ongoing dialogue between the Oireachtas and the Government on this matter.  This has not happened.  Although we were also promised transparency, no explanation has been offered to the House as to why this opt-out has been exercised.  It is of fundamental importance that this explanation is provided, even belatedly.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We have spent 35 years carving out an individual approach for Ireland in EU matters, but this time we have locked ourselves into a British opt-out which will inhibit our negotiating position in an area of fundamental importance.  Cross-border crime has a direct and adverse impact on this country.  I wish to highlight the discourtesy of the Government in not allowing a debate on this matter in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support my colleague, Senator Bacik, in her call for a debate on abortion.  This is a complex and difficult issue and people on both sides have strongly held views.  I raised the matter towards the end of the last Seanad in the light of a very dignified letter written by a woman who was not an extreme person.  She was not even particularly liberal, as far as I know, but she wrote as an ordinary citizen in the light of the impact her anencephalic pregnancy would have on her family.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have betrayed people by long-fingering this debate.  It is significant that a senior Anglican cleric has reproached us, as legislators, for our lack of courage.  This is the Chamber in which to address these kinds of issues because we have a history of dealing with complicated, divisive and emotive issues in a calm and rational way, although there are divided opinions.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White in requesting the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance to come into the House, not specifically to deal with the issue he raised but instead to deal with an issue that impacts on many young people in particular, that is, the sub-prime mortgage issue.  People are <Col N="342"/>finding themselves in a position of negative equity.  During the week there were 39 cases of court action to gain possession of houses, which is very worrying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also ought to take a stand about radio advertisements marketing these services, where, for example, there is a positive statement about taking a mortgage, including consolidating one&rsquo;s credit card debts, but then not letting people know that by so doing they are moving from a position of unsecured debt into one of secured debt and they could lose their house over their credit card debt, which is intolerable.  In addition, the warning at the end they are statutorily required to provide is gabbled at an ungodly rate nobody could understand and is the voice-over equivalent of the notorious small print in contracts.</P>
        <P>I suggest the Leader find time for a debate on Windscale.  New information has now come to light that the explosion in 1958 was significantly worse.  We know there are clusters of Down&rsquo;s syndrome births, still births, etc., in the area of Dundalk and the east coast.  We also know that there was significant low-scale pollution before, during and after that accident through the smokestacks at Windscale.  It is a matter we should monitor through this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the interests of balance and fair comment, the record of the House should show the results of a recent survey held of attitudes to abortion in Ireland in which over 75% of those polled were opposed to abortion.  Most public representatives are reticent about getting involved in another debate on abortion, precisely because of the acrimonious nature of previous debates.  The extreme comments and language used by a particular churchman when being critical of legislators are not helpful and do not create the calm atmosphere which Senator Norris desires.  In fact, one need only look at the letters in the newspapers to find that they have created the opposite atmosphere.  It behoves us all at this time to approach this issue in an exceptionally calm manner.  My views are well known and are on the record of the House.

	<P>I endorse the words of our party leader, Senator Fitzgerald, regarding World Mental Health Day.  I am pleased to say I have spent a number of years working voluntarily with the Mental Health Association of Ireland and for that reason I have a particular interest in this area.  I was involved in setting up one of its branches.  Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s overall contention was that we have a lack of investment in facilities and resources in this area.  She is absolutely correct and all the evidence supports this view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw attention to one facet of this inadequacy which is a serious matter, namely, that there are no facilities for young people who suffer from <Col N="343"/>anorexia.  I came across a tragic case recently in my work.  Approximately three beds are available for young people with anorexia.  Currently young people are put in wards with adult psychiatric patients who have very different types of illnesses.  There are no specific facilities for the treatment of those who suffer from anorexia.  This is a great indictment of the health service and of our country.  I urge the deputy leader to raise with the Minister the serious matter of facilities for the treatment of young people up to the age of 18 or 19 years with anorexia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to my own brief, I ask the deputy leader to allow for a debate on the current position regarding the roll out of broadband.  I would welcome an audit or stock take of where we are in terms of the delivery of broadband and where we are going.  This issue is of critical importance to many communities and, while progress has been made, the objective must be to provide broadband for every citizen in the State and every half parish.  Broadband provision is critical not only for quality of life and social issues but also for the economic development of the country and to deal with issues such as traffic and so on.  It is critical that broadband is made available to every home in the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I concur with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in regard to the 2012 Olympic Games.  I am a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which drew up a report on this matter.  Given that the committee structure is not up and running yet I hope we can have a debate on this matter to maximise information exchange.  It would be appropriate to have the Minister present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are in the run-in to both Halloween and Christmas.  Each year at this time the issue of the use of illegal bangers and fireworks comes up.  I refer to this matter in the context of animal welfare.  In the run-up to Christmas many people will be thinking of giving pets as presents, but we should remember the adage that an animal is for life, not for Christmas.  Halloween is a time that can be very scary for pets.  In that context, is it possible to invite the Minister to the House to discuss when the animal welfare Bill will materialise?  Such a debate would provide an opportunity to give an input into what the legislation should contain before the Bill comes before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of World Mental Health Day, I call for a debate on the role played by alcohol abuse in mental health.  At a minimum we should push at both national and EU level for a watershed of 9 p.m. for the advertising of alcohol.  There is no point in discussing issues such as suicide or mental health and avoiding the elephant in the room &mdash; our cultural attitude to alcohol abuse.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate with the Minister of State with special responsibility for children to address a serious issue, of which many Senators will be aware due to the lobbying of the community child care sector?  The structure of funding to that sector is being changed and will operate in a tiered system according to the income of parents and the services will receive subventions instead of the current staffing grants.  Many families using community child care facilities are on relatively low incomes but do not receive social welfare payments, and, therefore, will not qualify for the new subvention scheme.  Without sufficient numbers able to avail of the subvention scheme community child care services will go out of business in many areas or fees will have to be increased for those using the facilities.  In one example, the household income is &euro;485 and the cost of child care will increase by 28% from 1 December because of this scheme.  This makes a mockery of the Government&rsquo;s claim that the scheme is for the disadvantaged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to debate this matter in the Chamber.  The Government needs to step back and listen to the concerns with regard to increasing user fees of those who are providing community child care services.  Some community run and owned child care facilities that depend on voluntary assistance will close down.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science could also come to the Chamber to update Members as to why maps provided in primary schools currently include Ireland in the British Isles.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Other speakers referred to World Mental Health Day.  The record will probably show our services are in total disarray and there has been a lack of facilities and progress.  My knowledge of services is that we have taken down the walls of Grangegorman and brought into the community people who, in years gone by, were dumped into institutions by their families and they were forgotten about.  They are now living in independent units in every parochial area, with a good quality of life.  I congratulate <Col N="345"/>those involved in the formulation and application of the policy of independent living for people with an intellectual disability and mental health problems.  Equally, I congratulate those bodies such as St. Michael&rsquo;s House, which provides a tremendous service for young people in the area I represent, where it runs a great many community houses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members referred to suicide.  As I am sure the Opposition will agree, it is fair for the House to acknowledge and applaud the work of one of our parliamentary colleagues, Deputy Dan Neville, for the manner in which he has highlighted issues associated with suicide over a prolonged number of years when people were a little afraid of it or did not want to address the issue.  I also applaud others in the community such as Pat and Nuala Matthews, who work on issues associated with autism, and the work of the Irish Society for Autism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we have a debate on these issues, we will all have an opportunity to put on record a more balanced and fair reflection of what is happening in the services.  We know there are bottlenecks in the health service.  One has to congratulate the NTPF&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The report today that only 50% of those with penalty points have paid their fines is a concern because it is a reminder of the lack of respect for the law.  When Mayor Giuliani was elected in New York, he said he would stop crime by refusing to accept unacceptable behaviour.  Unacceptable behaviour has been drawn to my attention in recent days.  I saw a group of people rush to the head of a queue waiting for a bus on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  Yesterday, I saw car drivers moving from a tailback into the bus lane to beat the queues.  This practice delays other drivers.  We must stop accepting this type of behaviour if we are to clamp down on crime.  I ask the deputy leader to consider holding a debate to allow the House to get to the root of the crime problem.  I support Senator Mary White&rsquo;s call for a debate on suicide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the deputy leader to reply.  Due to time considerations, I regret that four Senators who indicated a desire to speak will be unable to do so.  I will call on them first tomorrow. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators want a large number of issues debated in the House.  I will try <Col N="346"/>to address the matters raised in the order in which Members raised them.  As this is World Mental Health Day and in light of the recent report published by the Mental Health Commission, there is certainly scope for a debate on mental health issues.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to teenagers being treated in adult facilities and the lack of treatment for certain conditions, including bodily perception disorders.  While improvements are required in these areas, as Senator Callely noted, progress has been made on A Vision for Change, a policy document agreed by all those involved in the mental health sector.  A debate would show that while much remains to be done in the area of mental health, considerable progress has been achieved.  A common approach is required to address the stigma and difficulties experienced by those with mental health problems.</P>
        <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations extended to Deputy Dan Neville and the Irish Association of Suicidology.  Suicide is one of a number of mental health sub-issues which require a debate in their own right.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of suicide in Europe and the problem disproportionately affects young men.  There is an onus on all of us to identify the reasons for suicide and develop common approaches to tackle them.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney raised the issues of alcohol advertising and the attitude of Irish people towards alcohol abuse.  The voluntary code of practice operated by alcohol vendors is a matter of contention.  Government policy is to establish whether this approach works.  In the event that it is found that the code does not work, the Government has undertaken to place on the Statute Book legislation it promised to introduce in the past.  The House should have an opportunity to debate whether the code is working and if legislation is necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of public appointments he was probably aware that I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this issue in the other House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The scrutiny role was discussed in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill and in the report on Seanad reform.  All those involved in political life are open to having greater Oireachtas scrutiny in this area.  However, given that hundreds of such appointments are made every year, I am not certain every appointment should be subject to such scrutiny.  Perhaps we could adopt a version of the US model and invite those who are appointed to the chair of State <Col N="347"/>bodies or agencies to appear before a committee of the Oireachtas and account for how the relevant organisation will be run under their stewardship.  This approach would enhance the role of politics.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan and Regan referred to the Government&rsquo;s proposal to opt out of justice and policing matters in the EU reform treaty.  The Government does not propose to opt out of all such matters and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, the Oireachtas has approved several directives in this area.  The difficulty arises as a result of the differences between the common law jurisdictions &mdash; Ireland and Britain &mdash; and the continental justice system operated in most other European Union member states.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
        <P>The treatment of the Madeleine McCann case, for example, shows how different justice systems can experience difficulties.  We need the power to opt for provisions, when necessary, namely, where there is a better common approach to policing and justice issues and our citizens&rsquo; civil liberties will be protected in every instance, which may not be the case if we were to buy into something where we were being asked to decide by qualified majority voting alone.  The Government is putting down a marker in the sense that the House will debate this issue properly after the European Council reaches agreement and a referendum Bill is put before both Houses.  Senators will have many opportunities to outline their reservations or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White raised the issue of decentralisation and the implementation report.  Progress must be monitored regularly.  There will no be difficulty in debating the matter in the House, but the new procedure for presenting the budget and the Estimates on the same day in the first week of December will not make it easy to ensure the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s availability during the coming weeks.  However, I will make the request.  If the Minister is unavailable, a Minister of State at the Department of Finance may address these issues.  The Senator also asked about the difference between relocation and decentralisation.  The Green Paper on local government will be ready in early January as part of a process to produce a White Paper and legislation before the 2009 local elections.  The programme for Government encompasses real reform in this respect.  Senators&rsquo; contributions to the Green Paper and subsequent legislation will be helpful in completing this process.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the appalling murder in Galway and several unacceptable deaths in recent weeks.  Similar issues were raised on the Order of Business recently.  There is an ongoing commitment that the House will discuss the issue of serious crime, on which a debate can be held in the near future.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the matter of the Fitzgerald report and the need for 100 extra garda&iacute; in the Limerick region.  While I must revert <Col N="348"/>to him regarding implementation of that measure, the other elements of the report are being implemented.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has made a decision on the boundaries of Limerick city.  Decisions have also been made regarding the redevelopment of particular areas of the city to rid it of the social undermining which is unravelling its fabric and causing many of its difficulties.  Recommendations, including the provision of 100 extra garda&iacute;, will be implemented.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the need for legislation on abortion and was supported by Senator Norris.  Contributions from other viewpoints were made by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Walsh.  In itself, this shows the nature of the difficulties in the debate.  The three abortion referenda did not bring the problem closer to a resolution.  I like to think the type of leadership referred to by the Church of Ireland clergyman forms part of a common approach by all political parties and politicians rather than the Government acting in isolation.  There are distinct and divergent opinions.  While we can discuss the success of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, despite its ongoing dispute with other organisations, in reducing the need for the option to be considered, the problem has not gone away.  The matter requires a mature debate on the part of all parties and Members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Issues regarding the Irish Prison Service, the European monitoring report and reports from the Inspector of Prisons &mdash; sadly, the previous inspector passed away this summer &mdash; should be debated in the House.  The Government has been working on the matter and there are plans for the provision of new prisons and the redevelopment of existing ones.  The pace at which the work will be done and the priority attached to it should be the subject of debate in the House.</P>
        <P>The question of EU scrutiny was raised in the context of the opt-out on policing.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole also addressed the issue, which was the subject of one of the essential recommendations in the report on Seanad reform produced by the previous Seanad.  The recommendation indicates a road which could be followed by this House if we are strident enough in making the argument.  The difficulty, however, is that an Oireachtas committee already exists for scrutiny of EU legislation and the volume of instruments coming from Brussels annually is too large even for that body to manage.  I understand that 2,000 such legal instruments come from Brussels every year.  We need a co-ordinated approach, as well as people who are dedicated to examining the documentation so that all the t&rsquo;s are crossed and the i&rsquo;s dotted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of contributions were made regarding the possibility of having the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism come to the House to speak about linking training camps in this country with the London Olympic Games of 2012.  I do not know if an alternative approach is being made by County Donegal to host the games but the <Col N="349"/>requests seemed to come from that region in particular.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney spoke about the animal welfare Bill.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on Shannon Airport and the development of the mid-west region.  This is an important issue for the House, the Government and the people of the west and mid-west.  Regarding the decision made by Aer Lingus to withdraw the service between Heathrow Airport and Shannon Airport and the issues surrounding the wider development of the mid-west region, the fact that the Government has initiated a debate on these matters in both Houses indicates the serious manner in which they are being considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not propose to go into background detail relating to this situation as it is well known and has been discussed in the other House.  I will, rather, deal with issues and questions that have been raised as a result of the decision.  Lest anyone is in doubt I will repeat again that the Government is disappointed with the decision taken by Aer Lingus to discontinue the service between Shannon Airport and Heathrow Airport and has consistently conveyed that disappointment to the management of the company publicly and privately.  I reiterated this view on my behalf and on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government on a number of occasions during the weeks following the decision and I emphasised it again at a formal meeting with the chairman and chief executive of Aer Lingus on 28 August.  I sought to convey to them, once again, the extreme disappointment felt by the Government.  I pointed out that the decision runs contrary to public policy in a number of respects, including the national spatial strategy and regional development and aviation policy.  It was recognised that Aer Lingus is not an instrument of Government policy but there was an expectation that such wider policy issues would be considered when commercial decisions were being made.  I also made the point that Aer Lingus should have engaged more with its customers, staff and wider stakeholders before announcing its decision.  The chairman said the decision was taken to establish a new base at Belfast International Airport following extensive evaluation of growth opportunities throughout Europe.  He said the decision was commercially robust and the company would not reconsider it.  The company has since reiterated that position consistently.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P Just="Left">It was evident from early on that Aer Lingus would not deviate from its decision and, given this fact, the Government began to look at the possibility of restoring connectivity on the route.  A number of options were explored in this regard.  I first investigated the possibility of the State acquiring Heathrow slots to replace the service.  I was informed that this was not legally possible because it is not open to this state or any other to acquire slots as the applicable rules allow only for slots to be assigned to airlines.  The option of providing funding to assist in acquiring such slots was also examined but this or any other form of direct subvention of a London Heathrow slot is constrained by state aid rules.</P>
        <P>It became clear that the only option open to us was to assist the Shannon Airport Authority in any way we could to secure a replacement service for the Aer Lingus Shannon-Heathrow service.  Arising from this it was clear that the focus of attention had to be on getting a replacement service for the Shannon-Heathrow route.  We indicated clearly to the Shannon Airport Authority, which has direct responsibility for securing such services, that we would assist it in any way we possibly could.  The authority has been actively pursuing all options in this regard since then and I have made it clear to it that I am available to assist in these efforts, if required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Undoubtedly, the best chance of securing a London Heathrow service was through the efforts made by the Shannon Airport Authority with BMI.  Unfortunately, we now know that BMI has decided not to provide the service on this route in the short term.  I have no doubt that the Shannon Airport Authority will continue its efforts to try to attract another carrier to the route, but the current situation, as far as I am aware, is that no such carrier has been identified.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question has been raised on a number of occasions and no doubt will be raised again today as to why the Government as a shareholder does not intervene directly to change the Aer Lingus decision.  The answer is simple. The clear and unequivocal legal advice we have is that shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.  This is a simple legal fact which cannot be changed by any amount of political rhetoric.  Even if the Government, on its own or in conjunction with other shareholders, called an EGM and voted for the restoration of the service, the management of Aer Lingus would not be obliged to follow any such direction of its shareholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question has also been raised as to why the State retains a strategic shareholding of over 25% in the company.  We had two key objectives in mind in doing this.  First, this shareholding provides a major block to a hostile takeover by enabling the State to prevent a compulsory takeover of 100% of the company.  If the company was taken over, the new owner would not be able to extract the Aer Lingus assets, including slots <Col N="352"/>and cash.  This provides significant protection against the selling of slots.  The second strategic advantage of a 25% shareholding is that it enables the Government, as a shareholder, to block special resolutions which could lead to the sale of Heathrow slots.  The report of the senior officials group, which was appointed to examine all aspects of the decision, states, &ldquo;Disposal of slots relates specifically to the sale of slots and/or the transfer of slots between airlines and does not apply to the reallocation of slot pairs to new or existing bases&rdquo;.  Our key strategic interests are protected in the memorandum and articles of association.  While they do not protect against the transfer of slots such as occurred in this case, they nevertheless remain extremely important from a national point of view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I conveyed to the chairman and chief executive of Aer Lingus the Government&rsquo;s strong disappointment with the decision on the Shannon-Heathrow service.  In those discussions I set out, in particular, that the decision ran counter to public policy in a number of respects, including the national spatial strategy, regional development and aviation policy.  I made it clear that while it was recognised that Aer Lingus was not an instrument of Government policy, there was an expectation that it would take these wider policy issues into account in making commercial decisions.  However, it is clear it did not do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To ensure this point of view is consistently articulated at board level, I have decided to appoint two further directors to the board of Aer Lingus.  I will ask the State appointees to seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company, that have implications for wider Government aviation or regional development policies, are considered and decided at board level.  That will give the State appointees the opportunity to raise the public policy implications of each decision and to ensure the full commercial implications for the company are taken into account.</P>
        <P>The State appointees to the board do not, nor will they, have a veto on board decisions.  Under company law it is not possible for the State or any other shareholder to overturn a decision taken by the company on day-to-day business matters.  The legal advice to the Government has been clear and unequivocal.  Neither is it possible for the State, even as a shareholder, to seek to impose non-commercial obligations on the company.  By appointing our full board complement it will be possible to ensure the full ramifications of all significant strategic decisions are fully discussed and decided by the board.</P>
        <P>Would the appointment of these extra directors have changed the decision on the Shannon-Heathrow service?  In these particular circumstances the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; because the board gave the management a mandate to pursue all commercial opportunities for the airline.  On foot of this mandate, management decided to discontinue the service between Shannon and Heathrow.  It did not have to get the further <Col N="353"/>approval of the board.  The appointment of two extra directors would not have made any difference to this decision.  Even if board approval was a requirement, the emphasis that the company has put on the commercial advantages of Belfast over Shannon suggests that a better understanding of the wider implications for the Shannon region and wider commercial issues for the company would not have tipped the balance in this case.</P>
        <P>On the point about connectivity, it is accepted by the Government that this decision by Aer Lingus will have an adverse effect on the region, especially business travellers to the Middle East, Asia and Australia.  The senior officials group confirmed that.  I am committed to ensuring the mid-west will continue to have the widest possible range of connectivity options available for the benefit of business and tourism throughout the region.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my view that little will be gained by continuing to look backwards regarding the Aer Lingus decision.  Everyone must look for solutions and options that will address the adverse impact that may flow from this decision.  That is the reason the Government commends the efforts of the Shannon Airport Authority for its positive response to a very difficult situation.</P>
        <P>The authority has specifically identified airline services to the key European hub airports of London Heathrow, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as being of key strategic importance to its ongoing development.  The airport recently published a European hub airport incentive scheme for services to come into operation in 2008, which provides for significant discounts in airport charges and for the possibility of marketing support to be provided by Shannon Airport for the new services.</P>
        <P>This is the way forward.  An airport such as Shannon cannot have all of its eggs in one basket.  London Heathrow is undoubtedly an important link to the wider world but it is not the only option.  A total focus on London Heathrow to the exclusion of other possibilities does the airport and the region a major disservice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those campaigning for the restoration of connectivity should throw their full weight behind the efforts of Shannon Airport and the Government to secure connectivity to the wider world.  While the Heathrow link will continue to be a priority hub for us, other major European hubs <Col N="354"/>can offer the same opportunities and potential.  Equally, I respectfully suggest that statements to the effect that only Aer Lingus can provide connectivity to Heathrow are less than helpful to the efforts being made by the Shannon Airport Authority to maintain connectivity in the region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the report of the senior officials group, it is proposed that taking account of its findings and the other issues addressed in its report, relevant Ministers, following consultation with the four mid-west planning authorities together with the Mid-West Regional Authority, will report back to the Government as soon as possible on strategies for unlocking the further development potential of the Limerick-Shannon gateway and its wider region in light of the substantial investment planned under the national development plan and Transport 21 to create an integrated infrastructure underpinning the region&rsquo;s competitive position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted to have and I thank Members for giving me the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s position on Shannon Airport and the development of the mid-west region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to address this issue.  I assure him that we as a party are as delighted as he is to address this issue in this House, express views about it and put questions to him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my contribution I will do my best to respond directly to the points made by the Minister in his contribution.  I want to focus on two issues directly, the first of which is the statement the Minister has just made about the appointment of directors and the role they can play in this decision and in moving the issue forward in the future.  The second is the role of the shareholding the Government has in Aer Lingus and what can be done to use it to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
        <P>I am approaching this issue from a different perspective.  I am a north side Dubliner.  I have lived and worked in Dublin all my life.  I do not work or live in the west or in any of the areas that have been most vociferous in raising this issue but I am as committed as I possibly can be to resolving it.  This is not an issue about whether connectivity to Heathrow is restored and so on but a broader issue about balanced regional development for the entire country.  If we cannot deliver that, it will be a debacle from which everyone will suffer, not just people living in the west who will be affected by it but the entire country.  This is not just an issue for the west and counties near that region.  It is a national issue about the way we want to plan for the development of our country and ensure we have the infrastructure in place so that as an economy, the entire country can be competitive as we move forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are not just my views on the issues involved.  These views are expressed in the national development plan.  They were the views <Col N="355"/>of the Government as we moved into the general election and as expressed in its manifesto during that election.  The national development plan leaves us under no illusion regarding the importance of balanced regional development.  It points out three reasons, the first of which is the need for proper national infrastructure.  The second is the need for that infrastructure to work in delivering prosperity to all regions, both rural and urban, and the third is the need to use that infrastructure to ensure economic activity is spread throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This issue was recognised by the Government in the run-up to the general election in its manifesto and that of its constituent parties.  The Fianna F&aacute;il general election manifesto, The Next Steps, specifically highlighted the need for the development of Shannon Airport to ensure it had a range of options to allow for long-term development.  The Green Party, in its document, called for that also.  It quoted Teagasc and referred to the need to avoid regional imbalance and the need for infrastructure to make that happen.  The Progressive Democrats Party, which has been very vocal on this issue, particularly in the letters pages of some of our national newspapers, talked about the need for national development and for infrastructure to ensure a sea change in regional development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This commitment was made again before the general election.  In April 2007, the then Minister for Transport, in response to a question from an Independent Deputy, emphasised the need to retain these slots, the importance of connectivity to the overall development of the region and made clear that it was in the national interest to ensure the best possible use was made of them.  Now, despite these assurances, general election manifesto pledges, D&aacute;il statements and commitments in the programme for Government, we find ourselves in this mess.</P>
        <P>The consequences have been clearly spelled out by those living in the region and by national commentators.  Almost 94% of business interests in the region say this will have a negative impact on economic activity, while 92% of chief executives in the region say this is a bad decision for the area that will affect the work they do and the income they can deliver.</P>
        <P>Specific businesses are crying out about the difficulties this will cause.  Element Six, which employs 630 people, uses 2,000 seats on the Shannon to Heathrow route every year.  Are we really saying that the withdrawal of those 2,000 seats will ensure those 630 people will still have their jobs in a year&rsquo;s time and that this will not affect them?  Of course it will affect them, as we can see from statements by the American Chamber of Commerce that it has &euro;35 billion invested in the region across 129 companies and that the change in Government policy will have a negative impact on its ability to maintain that prosperity and investment.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>I draw a comparison between the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House and the decentralisation programme.  In that programme, the Government claimed it wanted to decentralise public service bodies throughout the country to ensure the fair allocation of economic activity, the maintenance of quality of life and that infrastructure does not suffer from one centre hogging all investment.  Although I have major difficulties with the practice, I support the theory and the Government was articulate in promoting it.  To say, however, that we want to decentralise our public services while at the same time removing essential public infrastructure that ensures that not only public bodies can work but also private services is plainly contradictory.  I do not say this to score political points.  Such a contradiction will affect people&rsquo;s jobs and incomes.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the role directors<?oasys _jy ?>can or cannot play.  It beggars belief that two vacancies on the board of Aer Lingus lay unfilled for so long since privatisation.  It is inconceivable that the Government and other interests at the highest level were unaware these discussions were taking place.  While they were taking place, the people and the Government were not represented at the board to make an input.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am fortunate to have been a director of a private company and a public body.  I have experience of the workings of boards of directors.  It is all about setting a mandate and a framework within which commercial and individual decisions will be made.  Surely if these people had been present, they would have had the opportunity to ask what mandate we are giving the organisation to deliver commercial success and to insist wider policy considerations be taken into account.  If trade unions can legitimately make those points at board meetings, surely representatives of the Government, the people and regions that will be affected should be able to do the same.  The fact that the Government is only trying to appoint those people now demonstrates its incompetence in managing this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We move on to the role of the 25% stake.  As I was preparing for this debate, I looked at a statement made by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, about the role of Shannon Airport and Aer Lingus in the future.  In 2004 in this House, he was discussing legislation relating to the airport and he said the people best able to determine the future of the airport were the people of the Shannon region themselves, who should be able to participate in the discussions taking place there and not just receive some memorandum from Dublin.  In this case it appears the memorandum was not even written.  The people in the region sought representation on the issue did not have board representatives to make their case and it is clear that Government direction that could have been given through use of the shareholding did not happen.  The Minister made a number of statements about this.</P><Col N="357"/>
        <P Just="Left">What is the point in our having such a shareholding if we cannot use it to influence the commercial decisions of Aer Lingus in a way that will have a substantial impact on the development of the western region and the country as a whole?  Is there any doubt that President Sarkozy or Chancellor Merkel would use such a shareholding to make that point and to ensure the economic success of the airline was compatible with the needs of the country?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">We must respect the investors and management but we also must respect the people of the west and those who have an interest in balanced regional development.  History will be quoted back to me in this debate about the role of Se&aacute;n Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce in establishing Shannon Airport.  If we looked back on our history, however, we would not make this mistake.  Se&aacute;n Lemass talked about the State playing an active role in delivering national development overall, something he also did as Taoiseach.  Would he make these decisions?  If we had studied our history, this would not be happening.  The Government will go down in history as responsible for this but I am more concerned about the jobs and incomes of those who have been affected by this decision.  They should not be consigned to history.  The Government should play a role in ensuring that does not happen.</P>

	<P>The Senator can use his own time to criticise me any way he likes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Aer Lingus is now a private company.  It is no longer State-run.  Why was this necessary?  Aer Lingus needed substantial capital investment in the coming years if a national airline of any description was to be maintained.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, I held a number of meetings at which we discussed the privatisation of Aer Lingus with the current management and their predecessors.  It was politely outlined to us that state aid to airlines was no longer allowed if difficulties arose.  It was Hobson&rsquo;s choice, so we had to decide that it would be privatised.  When it was privatised some people may have thought that because the State maintained 25% it would control the airline with that interest.  The State is a 25% shareholder but it does not have control of the day-to-day management decisions.  Aer Lingus management saw a business opportunity by swapping the Shannon-Heathrow slots to Belfast.  The management was wrong.  If it had spare capacity on the Shannon-<Col N="358"/>Heathrow route, which is quite obvious, then rather than having four flights a day it should have left two return flights per day, morning and evening.  That would have solved everything and kept everybody happy.  That is the approach that should have been adopted, rather than getting out of Shannon altogether.  By quitting Shannon, the company is leaving a part of the country without connectivity.  Let us not be under any illusions about it.  That is the situation in which we find ourselves, so we must now look ahead and see what we can do about it.  I do not know whether Aer Lingus might still, at this late stage, consider leaving two slots for Shannon-Heathrow, but I do not think it will.  Is there not an opportunity, however, for somebody else to take up the slack?  Last week, the death occurred of Mr. Tony Ryan, a person who probably made the greatest contribution to the Irish aviation industry.  He saw an opportunity for Ryanair and what could be done for the airline sector generally.  There is a business opportunity in Shannon for some other airline to take up the slack.  The Shannon Airport Authority has a major role to play in this regard, but it will have to get out there and sell that business opportunity.</P>

We cannot have it <i>&agrave; la carte</i> because it does not work like that.  It is easy for people to make rash statements about what the Government can do, but once it was agreed by everybody, with the exception of Senator Doherty&rsquo;s party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Whoever wanted to disagree did so and we will allow them that privilege.

The House should support the initiatives taken by the Shannon Airport Authority to seek a new partner.  We must be clear, however, that the biggest advantage of the Government&rsquo;s 25% stake in Aer Lingus is that the Heathrow slots cannot be sold.  They are probably worth more to some airlines than Aer Lingus is worth in its entirety.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As far as the Government and everybody in the Shannon catchment area are concerned, we need to get connectivity between Shannon and Heathrow, irrespective of how we do so.  Some years ago, Aer Lingus committed another serious crime regarding a regional airport much closer to me, when it pulled out of Knock and left it for dead.  We saw what happened there, however, because when Knock decided to sell itself it grew the air traffic volumes using its facilities.  The Shannon Airport Authority said there could be considerable savings with regard to the costs incurred by Aer Lingus.  I hope the authority will now decide to make those savings available to any other airline that is prepared to provide connectivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes, but it needs to go out and push its case.  BMI did not take it but quite a number of airlines with slots in Heathrow would be only too glad to take up this route which was profitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the statement of clarification that was provided for the House by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  It is not my intention to make the Minister&rsquo;s job more difficult.  There are more than enough Opposition Members who will do so.  The importance of this issue is illustrated by the fact <Col N="360"/>that so many Members wish to contribute to the debate.  I am thankful to my colleagues, including our party spokesman and particularly Senator Callanan, for allowing me to address the issue.  As the crow flies, I am probably the closest of our group to Shannon.  While many arguments have been proposed for retaining the Shannon-Heathrow service, I do not intend to go over old ground by reiterating them.  A number of such valid and cogent arguments were made by various groups both within and outside the region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to comment, however, on the negative social and commercial impact this decision is having on our region.  People have said those effects are exaggerated and that we are whingeing, but employers and workers in the mid-west are not whingers.  They have delivered consistently over the years and have been both proactive and successful.  In addition, we are fearless in taking on challenges and when we express concerns they are real ones.  Regional equality is an important issue, which has been brought to the fore as a result of this matter.  All regions should be cherished equally.  This is a test case that must be won if we are to restore any form of balance between the over-concentration of economic activity in the greater Dublin area and the east coast generally and that of other regions.  It will be won.  I am confident our Ministers will deliver on the issue one way or the other.  It is of paramount importance that they do so.  Those who elected me to the Seanad are public representatives from the mid-west region.  They are not fools and will not be easily fobbed off.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The manner in which Aer Lingus handled this matter from start to finish beggars belief.  I cannot understand how the decision was taken exclusively by the chief executive and other executives, with virtually no consultation, input or involvement by the board of directors.  For many years, I had the privilege of serving as a director on another important transport board in the region, namely, the Shannon-Foynes Port Company.  Any action taken by that company was discussed and approved by the board and no executive would have got away with making a decision that had not been properly thrashed out at board level.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is appointing two additional directors, but my concern is that it may be a bit late going to the fair.  They are welcome nonetheless if only because they will be able to hold a watching brief for the other regional airports.  I hope these directors will protect Cork and Dublin Airports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a businessman I understand that all companies are inspired and motivated by profit.  Their <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> is to make money and nothing else.  I oppose what Aer Lingus has done because it makes bad commercial sense to leave a market which it has dominated and which has supported it to go into new terrain.  Experts have responded unfavourably to this move.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As people who aspire to a united Ireland we were thrilled to see a company in which the <Col N="361"/>Government holds a 25% stake being greeted by and on such good terms with Ian Paisley.  That has given us food for thought about what a united Ireland would mean but nobody, not even our friends in the North, would have wanted that progress to occur at the expense of another region.</P>
        <P>This problem must be solved.  The alternatives to a Heathrow slot are not credible.  For people to say that we can do business in Luton or Stansted is like someone shouting from the sidelines at Colm &ldquo;the Gooch&rdquo; Cooper when he has the ball in front of an empty net and telling him to pass it back to the goalkeeper and let him score from there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my three colleagues.  We will speak for three minutes each. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment my colleague and old friend Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan for picking up the mores of Fianna F&aacute;il so easily.  It will come as a major surprise to the Senator that it was the Government that called the people of the mid-west whingers.  He may talk to it about that.</P>
        <P>We do not need to be objective about this matter.  There is nothing objective about a decision which tears the heart out of a region and a community.  This should never have happened because we forecast it last year.  We said this would be the death knell of the regions.  I mentioned Senator Boyle&rsquo;s airport the last time I spoke on the subject here and several times outside the House.  We said that if Aer Lingus was privatised this would happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is right, this is a private company and there is a fiduciary duty on the management to make the best profit possible.  It would be completely wrong and in breach of all governance principles for the board to try to undermine a decision that was not in the best interests of the stakeholders.  We know that but we knew it last year too.  The people of Shannon and the mid-west region have lost out because we did not take notice of what could have been anticipated.</P>
        <P>It was not a Hobson&rsquo;s choice last year and I outlined the options then.  It was all forecast but not by the people on the other side of the House who now say it is clear and obvious and is the way the sector works.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  How will he appoint the two directors?  The posts should be advertised in the public media.  The applications should be scrutinised and the applicants interrogated by either a committee of this House or an Oireachtas joint committee.  They could outline their expertise, experience, independence, commitment and knowledge of the <Col N="362"/>area and the regions for which they would be responsible.  Who will be put in there and how will they do their jobs?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan is right to say that the idea that the board of directors apparently was not privy to this astonishingly strategic and fundamental decision beggars belief.  If I was a 25% shareholder in a company whose directors, whom I had appointed, did not know of such an important decision being taken they would be out the door.  Let us appoint directors who mean something and would have the trust and confidence of the mid-west area and understand it.</P>
        <P>Could the Minister of State do something for Shannon Airport such as put in a rail head, to make it the only airport on this island that would have an advantage over every other airport?  There are two or three stations within four or five miles of the airport.  Why not put that in now and give Shannon that advantage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to make four quick points.  I remind those who are protesting about the behaviour of Aer Lingus that this was easily foreseeable.  The Goldman Sachs report last year made it clear and that was one of the reasons I voted against it.  Despite all its smokescreens the Government&rsquo;s 25% holding was never going to enable it to place national priorities ahead of a privatised company.</P>
        <P>I urge everyone not to be bamboozled again by the Government.  The Minister is appointing two new directors but let us not be taken in by that.  If a majority of Aer Lingus shareholders cannot stop the management, a minority of the board certainly will not be able to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the future Aer Lingus will apply the simple laws of arithmetic to dealing with its Heathrow slots.  A big aeroplane uses the same slots as a small aeroplane, a long-haul aeroplane uses the same slot as a short-haul aeroplane.  If Aer Lingus wants to maximise the value of the Heathrow slots in the long term it will use the biggest possible aeroplanes on the longest possible routes.  That means that Aer Lingus will make more money by flying directly from Heathrow to New York and other points in the United States.  If the imperative to make more money drives the airline that is what it will do.  I foresee a time when for us to get from Ireland to America we will all have to fly through London.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let none of us underestimate the ruthlessness with which Aer Lingus will pursue what it sees as its commercial interests.  It seems to believe that it can successfully pursue a strategy against the wishes of its shareholders, the Government, its staff and, even more so, its existing customers, whom most people would regard as its most valuable asset.  The very haste with which it has announced this decision shows that it has a different mindset.  Only time will tell whether the company can survive with such an approach.</P>
        <P>We should be in no doubt as to what to expect from the company in the future.  The warning for <Col N="363"/>Shannon and the west is one for us all.  We could and should have foreseen this.  We argued about it last year but this was not recognised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We should not be having this debate because the Government should have sold its 25% stake in Aer Lingus at the time of privatisation.  Had that happened there would be no good reason for it to be a political football now.  The Government is reaping the whirlwind of its fudge this time last year when it decided in its wisdom and its desire to cosy up to the unions in Aer Lingus and others that it would hold on to 25%.  The impression was given - it was not contradicted by the Government at the time - that as long as it held 25% and the unions 15%, everything would be all right and the privatisation would not really be a privatisation, but that the airline would remain under State control.  The Government deliberately gave that impression to keep vested interests happy.  Now when it is being called on to deliver on that unstated but deliberate impression it cannot do so.</P>
        <P>I have little sympathy for the Government in this situation.  I support fully the sale of State assets.  The Government has no business being involved in airlines, airports or banking.  If we fudge it this is exactly what will happen.  Now it is hoist on its own petard, and does not know whether it has control or influence, which it does not have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The appointment of directors does not give one control over the day-to-day management of Aer Lingus.  While the Government has no business in respect of this decision, it appointed the directors.  Members should not forget the other directors are also political appointees.  Every one of them was appointed prior to the privatisation by the Government.  No one should take great comfort from the forthcoming appointment of two more directors.  The Government implies the directors to be appointed will be two of the greatest political patsies ever to have been appointed by it, which will be some record to beat.</P>

	<P Just="Left">They will be expected to deliver on a matter in respect of which they cannot.  I feel sorry in advance for the unfortunate people who will be appointed to this board, because they will be expected to take orders directly from the Minister on non-commercial grounds.  They will be unable to so do and the Government will be unable to deliver.  While it wishes to surmount this problem by stating its intention to appoint two people who somehow will prevent it from happening in the future, it will not be averted.</P>
        <P>Were the Government really to desire to so do &mdash; I do not suggest it should &mdash; while it could not interfere with this decision today or tomorrow, it <Col N="364"/>could certainly remove the board.  There is no reason to prevent it from getting together with the unions and others to remove the board at the next annual general meeting.  However, the Government will not do this.</P>
        <P>Allow me to contrast the extraordinary inaction and feeble excuses provided by the Government on this issue with its incredible activity when Ryanair decided it wanted to take over Aer Lingus.  No one could have been faster on the road to Europe than the Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers who stated this should never happen.  It used its 25% shareholding ruthlessly when it was politically practical.  In this case, however, when the Government finds it impossible to deliver, it states there is nothing it can do legally.  This problem arises when one is unable to make up one&rsquo;s mind whether to privatise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to my colleagues for allowing me some time to speak on this issue.  This was a ruthless executive decision taken in a business context.  From the parameters of one perspective, this was a correct decision because the guidelines were entirely economic and directors might have been found to have been neglectful of their responsibilities were they to fail to make the greatest possible profit.  However, as the route was already profitable, this was not a necessary decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ellis was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on which I served and this was one reason I spoke and voted against the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  One hears much about privatisation and competition and I completely disagree with my distinguished colleague, Senator Ross, when he speaks about Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  While this action was meant to produce competition, the first thing to happen was that Michael O&rsquo;Leary tried to use Ryanair to gobble up Aer Lingus and establish a monopoly.  We would have lost a State monopoly only to gain a monopoly whose only interests were greed and the wealth of a small number of individuals.</P>
        <P>This was also a political decision and the Government undoubtedly knew about it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This was a ready-up because it fitted in with the Government&rsquo;s North-South co-operation policy.  Hence, this was a political decision.</P>
        <P>One should contrast the attitude adopted by the Government on this issue, in which it shafted the people of Shannon and Aer Lingus, to its manoeuvrings when Members were in the process <Col N="365"/>of establishing a committee to investigate the rendition flights that passed through Shannon Airport and the lies that were then told in this regard.  The Government was prepared then to gallop in at the behest of a strong Shannon lobby for nakedly political reasons.</P>
        <P>This issue has two elements.  I refer to the business element whereby one can justify what was done in terms of harsh competitive realities.  However, I do not, because there should be a social dimension.  The only way to have one is by retaining Aer Lingus in public control, which is the reason I voted against the privatisation.  All the matters Members raised then are now coming home to roost.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government, business people and industrialists in the Shannon region, its loyal staff, councillors from Galway to Kerry, the tourism industry and the people of the mid-west.  This was not the behaviour of a world-class company as normal companies look after their customers with respect.  One need only consider how Senator Quinn treated his customers.  The customer was king and he wrote a book, <i>Crowning the Customer</i>, on the subject.  Similarly, one should consider how Tesco, as a successful world company, looks after its customers and provides them with their needs.</P>
        <P>It was a savage act on the part of Aer Lingus to do this to its 320,000 customers.  Lest any Opposition Member is in doubt, the Minister&rsquo;s speech makes it clear the Government did not know about this.  The Minister, on his own behalf as well as that of the Taoiseach and the Government, has reiterated his deep disappointment to Dermot Mannion and the board regarding the withdrawal of the slots for four return flights per day to Heathrow Airport.</P>
        <P>Everyone who flies to London prefers to fly into Heathrow Airport rather than Gatwick or Stansted airports.  For example, those business people who wish to travel to South Africa, the Middle East or the Far East and who can only fly into Gatwick or Stansted cannot run their luggage straight through.  What business people do not wish to be able to send their luggage straight through to their destination?  Those who travel to <Col N="366"/>Stansted or Gatwick will be obliged to collect their luggage and journey to Heathrow to get to Cape Town.</P>

	<P>The Government and the Shannon Airport Authority are doing their level best to induce another airline to take up this opportunity.  As Senator Ellis noted previously, it was a profit-making route and all Members must support the Government&rsquo;s efforts to secure another airline.  If no other airline takes up the offer, Aer Lingus should be forced to give back two slots.  I refer to slots from Dublin or Cork that do not operate at full capacity.  The region requires connectivity to Heathrow.</P>
        <P>A lady with great knowledge of industrial development in the mid-west, Ms Maura Saddington, spoke out on this issue, which is highly unusual for someone from the semi-State sector.  She is on record in <i>The Irish Times</i> as stating the region needs the return of the slots in question.  I call for a re-energised Government plan that prioritises the national development plan for the area, the production by the Minister of the tourism plan for the region, as well as a focus on re-energising the west and mid-west.

	<P Just="Left">While I welcome the Minister of State to the House, it is a pity the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was unable to remain.  I speak on behalf of the Labour Party and thank my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, who is our spokesperson on this subject, for allowing me to do so.  I speak as a representative of the mid-west who is highly exercised about events in Shannon in the past few months.  The mid-west has been let down by the Government&rsquo;s failure to intervene in this crisis which threatens the livelihood of thousands of people, as well as the region&rsquo;s very character.  This is an important matter and the mid-west&rsquo;s morale has taken a hit arising from it.</P><Col N="367"/>
        <P Just="Left">Given the time allowed for this debate, I will not go into details regarding the decision&rsquo;s impact on the mid-west, except to state it obviously will be detrimental from the perspective of business, tourism and socially, which has been greatly underestimated.  Members have already witnessed businesses losing jobs, as well as projects being put on hold.  For example, I refer to Dromoland Castle, Doonbeg golf course or the proposed new hotel in Quin, County Clare.  Moreover, as someone who has worked for Bord F&aacute;ilte and its successor, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, for nine years, I am fully aware of the impact this decision will have on the mid-west in respect of tourism.  The region suffers from a lack of sustainable tourism agency policies aimed at persuading visitors to spend more time outside Dublin.  Shannon Development has spoken out about this matter, but it is deplorable that the other State agencies have not had one word to say about one of the biggest decisions affecting Irish tourism in recent years.</P>
        <P>The decision of Aer Lingus, aided by the Government&rsquo;s inaction, to withdraw the Shannon-Heathrow route is nothing short of a disgrace.  Nothing has ever mobilised the people of the mid-west in this way.  I say this with some knowledge, as I am a representative from that area.  As people from all sides have pointed out, we should not underestimate the passion that people feel on this subject.  Nothing since the suspension of breast cancer services at Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital in Limerick has exercised people to such an extent &mdash; in fact, they are more exercised about the Shannon issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have met members of the Atlantic Connectivity Alliance and Aer Lingus workers&rsquo; groups many times. I welcome many of them to the House today, where they are present in the front row of the Visitors Gallery, including Theresa, John, Conor, Michael, Eugene, Tony and Michael.  Geraldine Morrissey, who is the nemesis of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, is also present, as is my colleague from the mid-west, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  It is great to see that someone with an interest in this issue is here for the debate.  I welcome these people to observe the debate, and I admire their determination, the arguments they have put forward and the way in which they have done so, and their professionalism in pursuit of this very just cause.  I also admire the dignity with which they are dealing with this issue &mdash; something which I cannot say I have always seen among the Government benches.</P>
        <P>The motion put forward by the Government in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann some weeks ago on Shannon and Heathrow was one of the most cowardly ever seen in these Houses.  The motion expressed disappointment at the decision of Aer Lingus.  I will repeat that: disappointment.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are not here to be disappointed.  They are here to act.  However, the Government says it is disappointed.  In this, it has singularly failed to <Col N="368"/>look after the people of the mid-west and show solidarity with them.  The Government Deputies from the mid-west also showed their true colours as they walked like lambs through the lobbies.  They had a choice.  They could have put pressure on their own Minister and Government to use its 25% shareholding to intervene in this crisis and reverse the decision, whether by means of voting on the behaviour of management at board level, by a vote of no confidence in the board, or by whatever means was required.  However, they have failed to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some questions about the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, who privatised Aer Lingus, and the way in which he did this.  Did he really know what he was doing?  He was either incompetent or inept.  Either way, it does not fill me with confidence.  He sold the current Minister a pup, and many people in the Minister&rsquo;s own party believe the same.  He botched the privatisation, pure and simple.  He stated in the D&aacute;il that through the memorandum and articles of association, the 25% shareholding available to the Government would protect connectivity and the slots in Shannon, Cork and Dublin.  The Minister for Transport and the Marine should be in a position to call an EGM to maintain Government policy.  We realise the reality: he cannot or, more importantly, will not do this.  I ask the Minister of State his opinion on the former Minister&rsquo;s declaration.  Does he still agree with what he said in the D&aacute;il?  Whether he does or does not agree, I ask him to explain why.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the start of this crisis the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that we in the mid-west were exaggerating the situation.  Does the Minister of State still believe this?  The Government said initially that it could not intervene.  It is amazing how this has changed so that it is now saying it will not intervene.  It will not use its shareholding to call an EGM and reverse the decision.  This was confirmed earlier this morning by the Taoiseach.  The Government talks about a balanced regional policy, but will not act on it.  It is not on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  All the spatial planning in the world will be no substitute in a region that has no connectivity to the central axis point of the world.</P>
        <P>When I raised the issue of Shannon and the Government&rsquo;s failure to use its 25% shareholding on the Adjournment last week, the Minister of State, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, was wheeled in to read a script, from which I quote: &ldquo;The Government&rsquo;s legal advice is that, having regard to the duties of the board of directors pursuant to the Companies Acts and the memorandum and articles of association of Aer Lingus, shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters&rdquo;.  This is very similar to what the Minister said today.  Why did the Government keep the shares at all, if this is its interpretation?  Why did it keep the shares if it cannot call an EGM, vote on management <Col N="369"/>decisions or, if necessary, propose a vote of no confidence in the same management?  This seems very strange legal logic to me and my party, and also to other observers, including the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, former Deputy Des O&rsquo;Malley, who in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister for Transport, among others, is espousing a version of company law with which I am not familiar.  He seems to think that management is supreme, to the exclusion of all others.  The Companies Acts envisage the board of directors as responsible for the actions of a company.  The board in turn is answerable to the shareholders.  The shareholders have the ultimate sanction of dismissing the board if they disagree with the company&rsquo;s policy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is also our understanding, but it is not the Government&rsquo;s.  Instead, the Government has found a convenient way of avoiding its responsibilities.  I have never seen a board take a strategic decision of this magnitude without first consulting its shareholders.  I share with Senator Davis Norris a belief that this must have been known by the Government prior to the decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the crisis initially rose, Government Deputies in the mid-west assured us that things would be fine &mdash; either the decision would be reversed or connectivity would be established by a different carrier.  Now that neither of these is possible due to the Government&rsquo;s own position, what will Government Deputies say?  What are we going to do now?  It is a simple question.  They seem to be speaking out of both sides of their mouths on this issue, and they want to be both in government and in opposition.  My Seanad colleague, Senator Mary White, asked in a letter to <i>The Sunday Times</i>: &ldquo;If the Government&rsquo;s 25% stake in Aer Lingus was not intended to influence the strategic development of the company, what was it envisaged for?&rdquo;  I ask the same question.  What was it envisaged for?  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain what it was envisaged for, because I am still unclear.  Senator White agrees with the Opposition that connectivity through Shannon is key, and many other speakers have said the same.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The key issue is the likely setback to the region&rsquo;s development.  Heathrow is a gateway to the wider world, and in this era of globalisation international connectivity is more important than ever.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I could not have said this better myself if I tried.  Perhaps the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues in the D&aacute;il, when they were voting, might have thought of this and voted in accordance with what many of them actually believe.  I make an honourable exception of the Deputy from Cork who went missing, and a few others who did not seem to have time to turn up for the vote.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party, the Labour Party, opposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  It was the only major <Col N="370"/>party in the Oireachtas to do so.  This was not on ideological grounds, but because we believe in a simple economic philosophy called externality, which implies that in certain circumstances the greater good must be protected.  In this case, the greater good of the mid-west should have been protected.  Unfortunately, the Government did not believe this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week&rsquo;s announcement by BMI that it has no intention of instituting flights to Shannon Airport did not surprise me in the least.  Those of us who have been following this crisis closely, as I have, knew that this was never on the agenda, especially as BMI had announced a week or two before the Aer Lingus announcement that it intended to establish 17 new routes.  If this were the case, how could it be expected to create a new route to Shannon?  It was never going to happen &mdash; it was a smokescreen, plain and simple.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Transport and the Marine stated that the Government was in talks with BMI and that these were going up and down.  I presume they were down quite often.  When exactly did the Minister&rsquo;s officials last correspond with BMI prior to Thursday&rsquo;s announcement?  As I said all along &mdash; many of my colleagues agree with me &mdash; Aer Lingus is the only sustainable option at this time for the Shannon-Heathrow route, despite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assertions today.  This is because it is the only company that has slots at Heathrow, apart from British Airways, which is not interested, and BMI, which has already stated that it will not participate.  Thus, Aer Lingus is the only possibility, if its decision can be reversed.</P>
        <P>There has been talk of airlines&rsquo; establishing flights to Shannon from other hubs.  Of course they would be welcome, but they cannot provide the connectivity that the business and tourism interests of the mid-west need.  We need sustainable connectivity for the business people of the mid-west.  If airlines do come into Shannon from other hubs in the future, whether from Amsterdam or anywhere else, we do not know how sustainable this will be, particularly with regard to subsidies.  We need a sustainable option for the mid-west that will allow strategic and spatial planning towards various objectives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister of State from another point of view.  If he will not intervene based on the arguments outlined by me and my colleagues today, which are based on the good of the mid-west, he might consider it from a more commercial angle.  I will provide the facts in this respect for the Minister.  Aer Lingus is leaving a very profitable route on which it has no competition.  People do not like the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;, but that is, in reality, what the company has on this route from Shannon.  It is going onto a route on which it will have serious competition, where one sees from the statistics that there are low bookings from Aldergrove to London.  In 2001, British Airways ran this route for a couple of years.  It was not viable and BA gave it up.  It did not give it up <Col N="371"/>without a reason.  It gave the route up because it was not worthwhile.  If it is not worthwhile, why is Aer Lingus going in there?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Aer Lingus is also giving up all the goodwill and the subsidies the Shannon Airport Authority has been willing to give it in the recent period and has improved in recent times.  The following is an important statistic.  According to the industry average, it is eight times more difficult to get new customers for an airline than to hold onto one&rsquo;s current customers.</P>
        <P>There are other reasons the Government should intervene in the running of this airline.  Last year this airline launched the Dublin to Dubai route with great fanfare and now it is giving it up.  I raise a question mark over that.  One must also look at the dispute with the pilots.  There is a view across the House which was expressed earlier today, that the dispute is not exactly being handled with great authority.</P>
        <P>We all know the reality is that Mr. Dermot Mannion wants to move this airline into a zone where it is principally a long-haul airline which will work out of Heathrow, principally serving the US.  If this means cancelling Cork and some other services in Dublin, so be it.  The representatives from Cork should recognise this.  He wants to create an airline that can be put up for sale without any social responsibilities or baggage.</P>
        <P>The State airline is no more.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, know this and that is why he is making two new appointments to the Aer Lingus board.  Wait until we see what comes out of the next two world slot conferences.</P>

	<P>I am concluding.  These slot conferences are important because they will decide the future of where Aer Lingus can work from.  Wait until we see the decisions that come out of those conferences.</P>
        <P>We in the mid-west will continue to fight this decision.  The people of the mid-west are not whingers or exaggerators, and it is to their great credit that they have fought this decision.  I will finish with a quote from the famed former Deputy Des O&rsquo;Malley, who I mentioned earlier, in his excellent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">The termination of services from Shannon to Heathrow will have its greatest effect in making it much more difficult to attract that kind of investment in the future.  Apart from the loss of existing jobs, thousands of jobs that might have been created will not materialise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, to work with the Govern<Col N="372"/>ment to reverse this decision.  It is the only sustainable option for the mid-west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday I had a conversation with a former director of Aer Lingus who informed me that on becoming a director, he was issued with a manual outlining the responsibilities that a director of Aer Lingus should have.  Within that manual there were 34 pages on the area of corporate social responsibility.  It could be that that manual needs to be rewritten given the new circumstances in which Aer Lingus finds itself.  It is no longer a national carrier; it is a privatised company that operates to a base commercial agenda.  I presume the same manual is in use, nonetheless, even for the two new directors being appointed today by the Minister for Transport and the Marine.  Not having a copy of that manual or read its contents, I suspect it speaks of corporate social responsibility in its widest sense &mdash; responsibility to the workforce of the company, responsibility to its customers, and responsibility to the wider community, especially where the company has its base of operation.  On every one of those criteria, it is clear that the new Aer Lingus has failed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can argue to our heart's content about the effects of the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  That debate was held.  My party had a particular viewpoint on it, but it was not necessarily the strict viewpoint of the previous Government.  There were other parties &mdash; parties in opposition &mdash; which agreed exactly with that practice.  The fact is that a privatised Aer Lingus now makes its commercial decisions regardless of the consequences for others.</P>
        <P>The trend in this decision making even preceded privatisation.  I recall having arguments about decisions Aer Lingus made on Cork Airport.  The company took on a private competitor in the form of Jetmagic and undermined three routes so that there was no choice out of Cork Airport any more.  Aer Lingus made a decision no longer to provide an air route between Cork and Dublin, and that was before privatisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to face a new reality.  We do not have a national carrier and need to refocus the national aviation strategy to take that into account.  Having listened earlier to the contribution of Senator Ross, we are very much in the realm of Hobson&rsquo;s choice as regards the future of aviation in this country and the roles companies in the area are prepared to play.  It is not a case of Aer Lingus making these particular choices.  It is just as much a case that one of the largest shareholders in the privatised Aer Lingus is not a company that has the best interests of the airline at heart.  It is not concerned with the maximisation of profit in that company but more with how it can stymie a competitor in the commercial field.  It is even possibly considering how it can transfer assets in the event of taking control of the company.  On those grounds, Shannon has been very much the victim <Col N="373"/>of a set of circumstances, only part of which relates to the decision to privatise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some contributions had regard to how this situation can be solved.  It seems unlikely it will be the retention of the routes by Aer Lingus, but it must be the provision of some route by some carrier from Shannon to important hubs.  We all must strive to get to that point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was particularly taken by the contribution of Senator O&rsquo;Toole when he referred to the fact that Shannon, of all the international airports in this country, is the easiest to link up to a public transport network.  An early decision needs to be made on that.  It is technically feasible.  In terms of cost implications it is one of the easiest to achieve.  The Government is soon to make announcements on the metro north programme and Dublin Airport, but the need for a rail link for Shannon to open up the potential of that region is something my party will be highlighting in the coming years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The decision to appoint two new directors might seem like an exercise in locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, but retaining the existing slots to ensure they are not sold to competitors will be an important facet of regional policy in the next few years.  I am convinced that the Minister outlined during the debate in this House at least a strategy as to how Shannon can be rescued. My party, as a partner in the Government, is prepared to play its part in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Senator Nicky McFadden.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should be rightly critical of Aer Lingus for pulling the plug on Shannon.  Despite all the assurances given in the past regarding the retention of the Heathrow slots in the national interest, it is, as has been stated in this debate, tearing the heart out of the region.  In fact, it is worse than that.  It affects the entire western seaboard.  It has undermined the stakeholders.  It has shafted customers and its staff.  The directors, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, should be out the door.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The board is hiding behind the management in this matter and I do not understand how it has managed to get away with it.  It must have known the Government would not act or lift a finger against it.  It seems as though there was some collusion in what has happened because corporate governance would require &mdash; Senator Kelly quoted the correct position &mdash; that directors direct and lead; they cannot abdicate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government, despite its 25% shareholding, has left Aer Lingus to freewheel.  It was supposedly a golden share to prevent any alien takeover.  If it was not that, the Government might as well have sold its shareholding, as has been pointed out.  Connectivity is vital and it will not happen without the retention of those slots.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other matter we cannot ignore here is that the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, misled the D&aacute;il, because he confirmed the importance of the Shannon to Heathrow route in the D&aacute;il debate that led to privatisation.  He con<Col N="374"/>firmed it was for reason of strategic national importance that the State was retaining its interest in the company, yet the Government has refused to utilise that stake in order to retain the use of the Heathrow to Shannon slots, despite it appointing a few extra directors.  Why did the State need to retain any share in Aer Lingus if it is not prepared to use it?  I contend the Government clearly did intend to use it in the national interest, so to speak, as outlined by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.  Because management got away with a con, in a manner of speaking, and because the board refused to act, we are now left in the lurch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, for attending this debate.  The Minister for Transport and the Marine needs to intervene and reinstate the Shannon to Heathrow services.  I do not believe it is a <i>fait accompli</i>, nor do I accept the links are gone.  The Minister still has a chance to intervene.  Aer Lingus has proposed an extraordinary general meeting on expanding its fleet.  The Minister has an opportunity to ensure the Shannon issue is firmly placed on the agenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all know the extent to which connectivity is critical to an island nation that is wholly dependent on trade and tourism.  As Senator Mary White stated, Heathrow is the closest gateway to the global economy, serving 200 destinations.  As she also stated, closure of the Shannon to Heathrow services would sever access to 46 cities that are not served by the other London airports.  Investors and visitors who use these connections are the key to continued wealth for the west and midlands.  The Government claims to be committed to the national development plan, the national spatial strategy and investment in the Atlantic corridor.  However, to ignore the customer, namely, the investor and visitor to the west, is nothing short of a disaster for the development of these regions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We in the midlands do not have an airport.  Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore are part of the midlands gateway and it is the intention by 2020 to grow the population of these towns by 20,000.  To attract trade and investment to the region we need the global connectivity that can be provided through Heathrow, not a reduction in our options.  If I were the Minister my first concern on my appointment would have been to appoint the two Government nominees to the board of Aer Lingus.  Perhaps then we would have had a chance of putting forward a view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the assistance he has given to Shannon and the mid-western region to bring back connectivity between that area and the wider world.  I also welcome his future appointments to the board of Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole in his call that the two appointees would come from the mid-west<Col N="375"/>ern region in order that the interests of that area would be served and their points of view put across.  I also support Senator Norris&rsquo;s call to question the commercial rationale behind management&rsquo;s decision to move from this route.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some interesting facts emerge.  Senator Kelly stated it takes a significant effort to get a person to change from one airline to another.  The statistic he used was one in eight.  Aer Lingus management should explain its actions, given that between 2000 and 2006 there was a reduction of 43% in traffic between Belfast and London while traffic on the Shannon to London route has grown in the same period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also like to hear how Aer Lingus proposes to capture half of the traffic between Belfast and Heathrow while providing only one third of the flights on that route.  This appears to be an attempt to get a square peg into a round hole.  It is questionable how Aer Lingus will achieve this and realise more attractive fares than in Shannon, given that it is competing against an airline that controls two thirds of the flights on the Belfast to Heathrow route and 12% of the slots in Heathrow itself.  The competing airline on the Belfast to Heathrow route will be able to up the ante and will literally put Aer Lingus out of business, as British Airways went out of business when it tried to take on that company on the Belfast to Heathrow route.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The impact on Aer Lingus of its revenues on the Dublin to Heathrow route must also be examined.  These are questions the new board appointees must put to management.  The fact that there is an overlap in the catchment area of Belfast and Dublin means that in many respects people will fly from Belfast to Heathrow rather than from Dublin to Heathrow with no net gain for the airline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to see the State appointees questioning the commercial rationale behind the company&rsquo;s decision to move from Shannon to Belfast.  Any company should stay with a monopoly.  If I were in business and I had a monopoly I would not move for love nor money.  It beggars belief how Aer Lingus thinks it will succeed where British Airways, the world&rsquo;s largest airline, failed.  The real question is whether the management of Aer Lingus is serving the company and its shareholders well by leaving a monopoly and going onto a competitive route.  A reduction of 43% in traffic in the past five years shows demand is falling on that route.  Allied to this, the fact that Aer Lingus&rsquo;s market share in Dublin will be affected by its proximity to Belfast also calls into question management&rsquo;s decision making.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that we must look forward and that the restoration of connectivity between Shannon and the rest of the world must remain a Government priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not good enough for the Minister for Transport and the Marine to wash his hands of this Aer Lingus decision.  What use is it for the Government to have a 25% stake in Aer Lingus when the Minister expressed no interest or concern when critical decisions that seriously eroded the region&rsquo;s competitiveness were taken that affected its potential attractiveness for foreign direct investments?  The Government continues to spin the need for greater regional development.  At the launch of the national spatial strategy for 2007 to 2013 Shannon and Limerick were awarded gateway status but Limerick and the greater mid-west region continue to fall behind other parts of the country.  This is a serious body blow to that area.</P>
        <P>The people of the mid-west want their representatives in the Government parties to show leadership and courage in the face of Cabinet silence following this disastrous decision to scrap the flight services between Shannon and Heathrow.  Crying crocodile tears will not help anybody.  Senior Ministers cannot continue to bury their heads in the sand and hope this issue will go away.  That will not happen.  There is an immediate and real threat to jobs and investment as a result of the Aer Lingus plan.  I am aware hotels and other businesses in the Galway area are deeply concerned about the potential damage of taking away this key route to London Heathrow.  The latest decision makes a mockery of proposals for development of the west and the principles of regional development and planning.</P>

I have little time to speak on this matter.  I realise Shannon is a political soft target for the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  We have heard of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s intention to develop the party in Northern Ireland.  Is this why it has moved the slots from Shannon to Belfast?  As many speakers have noted, the fairest way would have been, at the very least, to share out the slots between the four regions of Ireland, including the Belfast region.  It is pathetic how Fianna F&aacute;il has abandoned its voters in the west by selling them out.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, affirming the principle that no child should be denied access to education on the grounds of religion or race, notes with deep concern the crisis which occurred this September in the provision of primary school places; further notes that this crisis, which has had profoundly unacceptable consequences, arises from:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the haphazard manner in which new school sites are identified through the planning process, both nationally and through local authorities;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the apparent failure to apply adequate criteria, based on demographic and other relevant factors, in the assessment of whether additional schools or classrooms are required in a given area;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the role of the Department of Education and Science in the procurement of school sites; and</P>

        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on the Government to establish a National Convention on Education to address the future of Irish education, and to plan for the needs of a changing Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister.  It is important to state there are few, if any, issues which may come before the House of greater import than the future of education.  I strongly believe the post of Minister for Education and Science is the most important in any Government.</P>
        <P>This is an important debate for reasons of which we have been aware in recent weeks, but it is one we should be having in any case.  The purpose of the Labour Party motion is to debate in the House and the wider community the direction the school system should take.</P>
        <P>Public discourse often tends to be dictated by the latest crisis, whether it is the state of the health service, Shannon connectivity or the crisis in the provision of school places experienced in Balbriggan a few weeks ago.  I am sure the people at the centre of these very public spats would prefer not to be the subject of public controversy and to get on with their lives when the particular difficulty they face has been resolved.  In this context, while my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, might touch on the subject, we might not want to dwell for too long on the particular situation that arose in Balbriggan.  I am sure we would all want to join in wishing the pupils in particular, their parents and the staff of the new school in Balbriggan every good fortune in their future endeavours, notwithstanding the very public nat<Col N="378"/>ure of the establishment of their school.  They are at the centre of this issue and should be supported in every way, as I am sure they will be.</P>
        <P>The real opportunity offered by this debate and the convention we suggest should be established &mdash; I regret the Government is not supporting it &mdash; is that of ensuring there would be no recurrence of what happened in that instance.  This ought to be the single objective of the House and, most importantly, the Government.  In that context, it is unfortunate the Government parties have sought to amend the motion.  I am not naive enough to think Private Members&rsquo; motions from the Opposition are not subject to amendment by the Government &mdash; I understand the practice and procedure in this regard.  However, without being overly pedantic, I would have expected that the principle set out at the beginning of the motion, namely, that no child should be denied access to education on the grounds of religion or race, was one which was beyond controversy and discussion in the House or anywhere else.  I would have thought it was a touchstone.  In the spirit of debate and discussion, it might occur to the Government parties that they might not contest this principle and might instead agree to it, notwithstanding the other aspects of the amendment.</P>
        <P>The motion we have tabled seeks a debate.  We cannot have the last word today on all of these complex issues but that we simply seek to advance the debate should be a laudable objective.  It is surprising the Government appears not to wish to do this in the manner we propose.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to haphazard planning.  It may be this phrase that does not appeal to the Government.  What we are treated to in the Government amendment is essentially a list of bullet points detailing the various improvements in construction work and expenditure that have apparently been made.  However, it is clear planning is haphazard or we would not have experienced the recent problems.</P>
        <P>What many cannot understand is how the Department of Education and Science and Government agencies do not seem to have the basic demographic information on population movement, including immigration trends, that would, at least, ensure meaningful advance notice of a demand for places.  One hopes they have that information, but there is no point having it to hand if it is not put to use and if the policy decisions we expect the Department to make are not informed by this information.  We only have to look about to see that commercial organisations, campaigners of all kinds and political parties have very detailed and sophisticated information on population movement, where people are located, their likes and dislikes, the pubs they drink in and their preferences across a range of products.</P>
        <P>It is not huge to ask of a Department that it have at its fingertips such demographic information on population trends and movements in our cities, suburbs and towns to inform its policy. <Col N="379"/> This would ensure meaningful advance notice of such problems.  However, it should do more than this.  It is not enough to simply claim we are able to avoid a problem by knowing about it a few weeks or months in advance.  Planning should go much further &mdash; it must ensure schools are constructed at the same time houses are built.  Why is this such an extraordinary notion in the Ireland of 2007?  Why is a development such as the one in Adamstown the exception rather than the rule?  After more than ten years of economic growth, the like of which we have never seen in our history &mdash; I have no problem conceding this is the case &mdash; why can we not have schools at the same time as we have houses?</P>
        <P>Can anybody answer this question?  What does it say about our priorities and those of the Government?  Ensuring the provision of a school should be as vital in a housing estate as the completion of any other infrastructure, roads or otherwise.  Surely the school is at the heart of a community and is an essential element of our infrastructure, physical and otherwise.  Why has this simple objective not been achieved?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister will no doubt inform the House, schools do not just materialise, they must be made to materialise.  Active, forceful and tenacious intervention by the State is required to achieve this outcome.  We should not expect developers to provide schools, other than by imposing an enforceable legal requirement similar to the provision originally included in the planning Acts in respect of social and affordable housing.  Unfortunately, this provision was subsequently amended.  This requirement must make the construction of a school a social dividend which developers and others who build houses in our suburbs must deliver at the same time as the houses they build.  They must give the provision of a school the same level of priority as bricks and mortar for housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government amendment refers to certain measures in the programme for Government in this context.  We will await developments in that regard.  However, as was pointed out in the other House last week, it is noteworthy that the area development unit referred to in the programme for Government has still not been established.  I hope this fact is not an indication of the level of urgency with which the Minister and her Department approach the matter.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, there has been considerable debate on enrolment policies in national schools and their implications for the overall debate on education.  The attitude of Catholic school managers in particular has been raised.   We all accept that society has changed dramatically in recent decades, in particular in the past ten to 12 years.  During this period, the State has been slow to address growing demand for non-denominational schools, although I acknowledge that some progress has been made in this respect.  These are precisely the types of issues that could be pro<Col N="380"/>ductively considered and debated in a convention or public forum established to address educational issues.  The Archbishop of Dublin has even called for such a debate and indicated that the Catholic Church has no interest in being the sole provider of primary school education in the Dublin area.  Clearly, the Catholic Church cannot have it both ways.  While the need to preserve and support religious ethos in schools is a legitimate concern, given that public funding is at stake, this must not be simply a matter of red-circling support for particular religions.  The issue must be considered in the round.  We must examine priorities, the changing nature of demand for primary school education and all the issues which arise in that context.  While I would welcome the involvement of the Catholic Church in such a debate, it will need to change its stance on a number of relevant issues.</P>
        <P>The motion does no more than call for a national debate on education in a public forum.  There cannot be a serious or meaningful objection to having a public discussion of the relevant issues.  That is the basis on which the Labour Party tabled the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House.  I propose to address an issue which arose recently in Balbriggan and provide examples of the types of problems the Minister needs to address.</P>
        <P>Balbriggan has featured prominently in the news in recent weeks as a result of a lack of school places at primary level.  A school, Bracken Educate Together, was opened at the last minute to accommodate children who could not secure places in existing schools in the area.  Balbriggan is an example of crisis management in primary education.  Other areas in the greater Dublin area, including my parish of Skerries, are having similar experiences with severe pressure on schools to provide places.  School planning, particularly at primary level, has been a disaster.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Balbriggan is a good example of a fast growing town in the greater Dublin area.  It is worthwhile commenting on some of the problems the town is experiencing as a result of rapid growth.  Of the eight primary schools in the catchment area, which includes Balrothery and Balscadden, five are under Catholic patronage, one is under Church of Ireland patronage, two, including the much publicised Bracken Educate Together school, are under Educate Together patronage and one is a Gaelscoil.  There is, therefore, considerable diversity in primary education in the town.  The most recent three schools to open in the area are not under faith-based patronage, a trend which is increasingly reflected in other areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years, Balbriggan has emerged as a rapid growth area.  According to the most recent census, the population of the town increased from 10,294 in 2002 to 15,559 in 2006, a massive rise of 51.1%.  While this population growth presents <Col N="381"/>major challenges for the Minister, it did not happen overnight.  There were many indicators along the way, including land rezonings, planning applications, housing starts and completions, all of which are widely used economic indicators.</P>
        <P>Forecasting for primary school place demand may not be a particularly difficult exercise but it requires attention and must be carried out by somebody.  It is the responsibility of the Minister and her Department to anticipate demand, have schools in place when they are needed and provide the necessary teachers and places.  As we have observed in the case of Balbriggan, meeting these requirements has proved challenging for the Minister and her Department.</P>
        <P>In responding to the current problems the Minister has blamed others, including local authorities.  I heard her adopt this position on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;.  While I do not suggest the local authorities are blameless in these matters &mdash; an integrated approach which includes the local authorities is needed &mdash; it is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure effective planning in this regard.  She must take ownership of the process rather than abdicating responsibility.</P>
        <P>The recent suggestion that demand for primary school places in Balbriggan crept up on the Department this year is simply not acceptable and does not stand up to scrutiny.  Principals and patrons of existing primary schools in Balbriggan have regularly highlighted the problem of increasing demand for school places since 1999.  Excerpts from correspondence to the Department, which I have seen, include statements noting that the Balbriggan catchment area was expanding daily with literally hundreds of new houses under construction; uproar would ensue in the community if something was not done; one of the schools urgently required additional accommodation; and the town was set to explode.  The recent events in Balbriggan were a crisis waiting to happen and had been predicted.  Despite repeated warnings by people involved in primary education in the town, someone took an eye off the ball.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has published detailed proposals on planning for school places in which we argue that the National Treasury Management Agency be given the task of tracking residential development and population patterns.  The NTMA should develop a model which would be able to predict when and where demographic change will lead to a demand for school places.  It must also address the many existing education black spots, including north and west Dublin.  Irrespective of which body or agency performs this task, demand planning must take place.  This issue could feature on the agenda of the forum the motion proposes.</P>
        <P>I will discuss briefly the issues of patronage, enrolment policy and suggestions of discrimination.  Enrolment policies for faith based primary schools, whether the patron is the Catholic Church, Church of Ireland or another <Col N="382"/>faith, give priority to children of their own faith where demand outstrips available places.  These are based on guidelines from the faith based patrons, namely, the bishops or archbishops.  They are not, as has been suggested, at the discretion of individual school boards of management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People should have a choice.  If parents want to send their children to a school with a Catholic, Church of Ireland, Jewish or other ethos, so be it.  However, the State should be the patron of a school where appropriate.  It is only when there are insufficient places available that enrolment policies become a problem, which the Minister recognises given her comments in the other House.  No school can refuse a child a place, irrespective of religion or ethos, if places are available.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the suggestion in some parts of the media that there is discrimination in primary education in Balbriggan and the area&rsquo;s school principals have been hurt by these suggestions.  In one of the primary schools to which I referred, 25% of pupils are non-Irish, with a high proportion of those being black, which does not suggest a discriminatory enrolment policy.  A principal reminded me that if he is faced with a choice between a Catholic Nigerian child and a non-Catholic Irish child, he must give the place to the former in accordance with enrolment policy.  He has no discretion.  These problems for principals can be eliminated with proper planning.</P>
        <P>Regarding another issue, 50% of the school&rsquo;s pupils are taught in 12 prefabricated buildings despite there being adequate land in the parish&rsquo;s ownership around the school to extend the school properly.  It is not a local authority issue, but relates to a commitment on the part of the Department.  Prefabs cost approximately &euro;1,000 per month to rent and present a constant worry to principals due to the possible outbreak of fire.  It is a false economy and is not good enough for our children, as prefabs do not pass for proper school buildings.</P>
        <P>Our motion calls for a national convention on education to be established, which is important given the changing face and increasing diversity in society and the fact that churches are increasingly declaring their intent to pull out of education.  In the meantime, we must get the basic school planning right because much depends on it.  If we get the planning right, we will have fewer problems.</P>

        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the record level of activity under the school building and modernisation programme in recent years and the innovations in the design and delivery of school buildings that have been put in place to ensure that extra accom<Col N="383"/>modation is delivered as quickly as possible;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the provision of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings under the NDP and the plans therein to provide 100,000 extra school places;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the Government&rsquo;s commitment to promoting successful integration in our schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am proud to have been appointed Government spokesperson on education and science.  As a teacher by background, this topic is close to my heart and I look forward to a long tenure in the upper House &mdash; currently, I have five years and nothing more in mind &mdash; as I come to grips with what is a large brief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Alex White that education is a key Ministry.  My starting point will always be simple in that education is a cornerstone that unlocks potential in each of us, our children and their children.  It opens doors into new worlds and does not need to be the same door or have the same paths for all who experience it to be a successful encounter.  That is exciting.</P>
        <P>Education will help us survive and thrive, but it does not begin when a child reaches a school gate aged approximately five years or, in my case, three.  As I did not get out of school until I was 27 years of age, I had a long sentence.  I aspire to the evolution in Ireland of the acceptance that parents and children bonding from birth or pre-birth and the interaction of parents and children from the earliest stage is the starting point of the greatest potential for education.  The quality time parents can give their children until the latter are six years old is the greatest investment they can make.  This must be supported in both ideology and reality by the Government, be it through Life Start or similar programmes.  I can give many countries as examples, in particular those in the southern hemisphere, where the battle is already won.</P>
        <P>Too often, we will stand here and muse on the need for more supports and resources for students when they go from pre-school to primary school, from primary school to secondary school <Col N="384"/>and from secondary school to university.  I am a great advocate of prevention being better than cure.  Access to schools is a topical issue in the part of the country from which I come, but it may not be popular or topical for the same reasons held by those who tabled the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to address the issue of a failure to pre-plan in respect of hundreds of houses but no schools being built, as raised by Senator Alex White.  In Border areas, there was a court case relating to the right to go to school.  This is not an issue of the lack of facilities in, for example, Donegal, but of the fact that new residents moving there from Derry city wish to continue their education in Derry.  The term &ldquo;grannying&rdquo; has become synonymous with the use of granny&rsquo;s address in Derry rather than the Donegal address when filling in the form for the next school term.  This raises a number of interesting questions such as pre-planning, putting in place the correct resources and not creating white elephants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The population of practically every Border village in County Donegal has exploded in a short period.  Had the Department of Education and Science followed the planning application process and, on foot of the hundreds of houses being built at any time &mdash; sometimes as many as 500 &mdash; put in place new school accommodation, it would have yielded some white elephants because the children did not materialise.  Instead, they kept &ldquo;going North&rdquo;, as it were &mdash; politically North and geographically South.  Some small schools in County Donegal struggle with numbers, the retention of teachers and excess classrooms where numbers have declined, yet the population has grown significantly.  In other parts of the country, the population explosion has yielded pressure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a need to encourage more accuracy in the mechanisms to ensure children born today can be identified and that a concept is developed as to where they will be schooled, irrespective of their race, religion or origin.  The identification of children born in the Twenty-six Counties has become easier in that the children&rsquo;s allowance scheme has been computerised to such a level that the book, as mentioned at the scheme&rsquo;s launch, is on the mat as soon as the baby is carried across the threshold.  Can this be a starting point?  The current starting point is census information, but should we pursue the collection of census information where people have not filled in the forms?  Some people in my area would not fill in a census form.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Information is crucial, but it must be accurate.  In my area, relying on baptismal records is not accurate.  I do not believe this is a Border or rural issue because there is a greater fluidity in the movement of people than before.  Currently, where a child is baptised is not necessarily where the child will go to school.  In making these observations, I strive not to defend the Department, but to point out the definite logistical issues that are far from straightforward.  If many others fol<Col N="385"/>low the new Minister for education in the North, who lives in a Border region and whose children are schooled in the North, it makes for a fluid Border.  While I advocate a 32 county Ireland, we must question the logistical nightmare for all involved across the island in terms of resource decisions until there is in place a good information exchange mechanism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once numbers can be predicted, we move to the issue of responsibility for school provision.  While the Department is responsible for educational matters, there is a question of whether there is a role in the planning permission to put an onus on the developer to assist in the provision of the schools, be it in the form of sites or public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>Given that my time is so limited, I wish to underscore that I have witnessed considerable investment in schools at primary and post-primary levels.  I am on the board of a primary school beginning a building project for an eight-teacher facility.  While I welcome that facility, my old primary school is either in the process of being knocked down or will be knocked down shortly, about which I am disheartened.  I am the chair of a second level school that, as a multimillion euro investment, is a prime example of how to do a project well, fast and within budget in an innovative way, of which the Minister is aware.  This is not to say that Moville Community College does not need completion, that Scoil Mhuire and Crana College in Buncrana do not need building programmes, that gaelscoileanna are not searching for permanent facilities or that Carndonagh Community School does not want to scale down and consolidate to cope with the decline in numbers.  Rather, these and similar locations have better chances to progress under the current Administration.  I wish the Minister well at the beginning of her new term in office because she understands and is committed to education.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, whom I have met on a number of previous occasions in various educational contexts.  As the Fine Gael spokesperson on education and science in the Seanad, I welcome the Labour Party motion that no child should be denied access to education on the grounds of religion or race.  This follows from the position articulated by my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, in the D&aacute;il last week, where he described the convening of a national forum on education as vital for the future of our education system.  I see such a forum, which would have clear terms of reference with regard to discussing the future of our education system, as the way forward in terms of bringing all the issues into the open and addressing them in public.  We established a similar forum in 1994 following the publication of the Green Paper and prior to the Education Act 1998.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider a <Col N="386"/>forum.  It would not be very different from the proposals being put forward by the Labour Party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The crisis which occurred in September in the provision of primary school places in Balbriggan should never recur.  In many ways, however, we have been done a favour because the matter has finally come to a head.  Yesterday I spoke with the principal in Balbriggan and the chairman of the Educate Together school.  I commend them for rising to the challenge in such a situation of crisis.  No one listened when similar issues arose elsewhere in the country.  In Galway, schools are at full capacity, yet house building continues in new areas such as Doughiska and Knocknacarra without any forward planning for an education infrastructure at local level.  The matter is totally brainless.  Knocknacarra, which I called new although it has been in existence for 20 years, has finally received its first English school this year.  Should we call that good forward planning?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem can be solved if there is the will on the behalf of the Department of Education and Science to engage in joined-up thinking with local government and other Departments with information on population trends.  The areas that need to be targeted in the first instance are those with large-scale housing developments.  This information is freely available through local area plans and town plans with population projections.  If she wants to be responsible, the Minister should immediately act in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to amend the Planning and Development Acts to ensure that school places are included by law and, where necessary, that schools are built at the same time as houses.  In practice, this means the Department will have to take a proactive forward planning role with local government to identify school sites and begin the planning process once the local area plan is adopted.  That is not happening and the way we do our business is not satisfactory.  Laytown screamed for a school earlier this year.  In Oranmore, where I live, Gaelscoil de hIde has been 13 years in existence without a permanent site and the school&rsquo;s nearly 200 students have to stagger their breaks in order to be able to play safely in the yard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been a member of four school boards of management, each of which has encountered issues pertaining to space or buildings.  Over 50% of the accommodation in Athenry vocational school is in prefabs.  A state-of-the-art facility at Calasanctius College was already over capacity when it was opened by the Minister and the school had to inform a number of children there was only room for local students.  These problems will continue unless a system of integrated forward planning across Government agencies is initiated by the Department.</P>
        <P>A national and local government database needs to be established of births and new entrants to current school areas in order to establish whether schools have adequate places for chil<Col N="387"/>dren at primary and secondary level.  When a child is born, a window of four or five years is available for planning.  I accept it is more difficult when families move into areas during the year in which they need school places but ours is a State led, publicly funded education system and it is the duty of the Minister to ensure sufficient places for all our children, regardless of race, religion or social background.  Balbriggan has proven this is not happening.  It has done the country a favour in terms of bringing the Department&rsquo;s lack of forward planning to a head.</P>
        <P>Where there is a new influx of multi-ethnic populations, information needs to be sought from other Departments so as to give a fuller picture of new populations.  Using the PPS system, data can be collected on families receiving rental allowance through the community welfare office and the HSE.  Community pre-school services can give information on the numbers seeking funding from the Department of Health and Children and the HSE for inspections.  Non-EU national families are in contact with local immigration offices under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which can also provide information on refugees and asylum seekers on direct provision.  This information needs to be centrally collated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to commit to putting a national and local database system in place so that we can track our children.  This would also help children who do not transfer from primary to secondary level.   At least 1,000 children are currently untraceable due to the absence of a database.  We have far more accountability in our national cattle herd.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of school patronage, I acknowledge the huge contribution that the Catholic church has made to education.  Few of us have not been educated by nuns, priests or brothers and there will always be a need for denominational education.  Parents have the right to chose and, in this context, I welcome Archbishop Martin&rsquo;s statement on a debate.  However, we also must accept that we live in a changing Ireland that has experienced unprecedented immigration and multiculturalism over the past ten years.  This has challenged all that we do at every level, including our traditional models of school patronage and provision.</P>

I examined the word &ldquo;haphazard&rdquo; and visited South Dublin County Council, on which I served.  Senator White was also with that council for many years.  I agree that 15 or 20 years ago, when I was a councillor, things were haphazard in this regard but this matter has changed radically in the past ten years.  The area is no longer haphazard.  Previously houses were built with no regard for infrastructure in the area but this has changed as the fine model of Adamstown demonstrates.</P>

For this reason the use of the word &ldquo;haphazard&rdquo; is incorrect.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Regarding the procurement of sites, I agree that more joined-up thinking is needed.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, may have recognised that there should be better co-operation between local authorities, the planning <Col N="389"/>section of the Department of Education and Science and the health agency.  The new office for integration represents a great step forward in acknowledging the problems in fast growing areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not agree with the suggestion that we need a new national convention to debate this issue because this country is turning into a talking shop due to the preponderance of committees.  The necessary structures are already in place in every local authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The structures are in place but I suggest to the Minister, regarding joined-up thinking, that some loose ends need to be tidied up.  There are fast growing areas and Balbriggan is a model on which the Minister can speak at length because it is an example of how we should move forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There may have been discrimination in fast growing areas where there was a shortage of school places and, perhaps, an ethos prevailed that saw Catholic students gaining preferential access.  I can understand concerns in this regard but such matters come under the remit of the Equal Status Act 2000.  It is important that extra school places be created and the Government is committed to achieving this goal.  Significant investment has been made in this regard to ensure nobody is denied access to education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not favour the suggested convention because I believe we should keep the existing structures and tidy them.  Better joined-up thinking will help us work together to ensure school access for all children of schoolgoing age.  It is possible to make this work using the existing structures.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Labour Party for tabling this motion that is at least partly in response to the critical situation in Balbriggan.  I notice it is causing the usual Wednesday evening ping-pong match, whereby the Opposition criticises the Government for its failures and the Government amends the motion noting and welcoming various achievements.  This debate should be taken more seriously without points scoring.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, is one of the best Ministers in the Government but that does not mean her Department is immune from criticism and she would not expect that to be the case.  A critical situation was raised on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; in recent weeks and a fine doctor stated clearly that she was aware, in the area of her general practice, of children turned away from a primary school because they did not have a baptismal certificate.  This is a significant problem that must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that there is a crisis led the Minister to call in Educate Together, an excellent group, and the chief executive said there is a catastrophic failure in the provision of school places for rapidly developing housing areas.  This is not a partisan, party political view but rather one from the coalface from an expert on whom the Minister relied to rectify the situation.  How did this situation arise?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We live in a rapidly developing society and a very good article on this topic was written by Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  He points out that 60% of residents of the area in which I live are not Irish but mostly eastern European and Asian.  There is a problem regarding the command of the English language possessed by some immigrants and this is an area the Government must address immediately.  In the aforementioned school situations, the preponderance of non-Irish people will inevitably pull back other students, through no fault of their own but through a lack of linguistic skills.  This is a problem that may lead to tension.  Again, how did this situation arise?</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is clear the information on which forward planning should be based was available within the Department.  Dr. FitzGerald points out that &ldquo;from each census the necessary data on the numbers aged nought to four in each of the 320 different areas of Dublin and in well over 3,500 other parts of the country have been available&rdquo;.  If one adds this to details relating to housing numbers, approvals and so on available from county councils and data relating to people&rsquo;s nationalities and ethnic origins, it is clear the information is available.  However, it was inert <Col N="391"/>and was not acted upon and this constitutes failure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another significant problem is the baptismal certificate.  I am a churchgoing member of the Church of Ireland.  I am not antagonistic towards religion but the exemption from the Equality Act sought by all churches, not just the Roman Catholic Church, presents a significant problem.  There is this problem because of the lack of confidence each church has in the ethos it holds.  A real religious faith can be fostered in the home and school is a place for giving facts.  This is why Educate Together is such an excellent system.  It is not militantly atheistic.  It provides for the religious needs of the children and the requirements of parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is very dangerous that churches should be exempt from equality legislation.  Christianity is supposed to be about equality, the State is supposed to treat all the children of the nation equally, yet we exempt churches from such notions.  I raised this matter previously.  The Government should re-examine such exemptions because they allow churches, using State money, to fire teachers because of their lifestyles and a perceived conflict with school ethos.</P>
        <P>The State is comfortable with the lack of separation of church and state and one need only examine the case of Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe, who sued the State because she was sexually molested, for evidence of this.  She was landed with the costs of the case because the State neatly passed responsibility to the church.  This is unfair and clearly indicates the need for the separation of church and state.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the Roman Catholic hierarchy has indicated it no longer wants complete control of this area of education and is preparing an exit strategy of some kind.  It is important that we know the motivation for this and how it will be accomplished in order that we can have proper, integrated education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to pick up where Senator Norris left off.  I welcome debate on this motion as it is an issue about which I feel strongly and one I have raised on the Order Paper and previously on the Order of Business.  The Minister is well aware of the problem of the lack of planning that led to the crisis over school places in Balbriggan.  However, we need to focus on the deeper, structural issue that needs to be addressed, which requires the sort of national convention for which the Labour Party is calling.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister to focus on the issue of church control of schools which are State funded and whose teachers&rsquo; salaries are paid by the State.  For a long time the State abdicated responsibility for the education of children and the churches took it on.  However, in modern Ireland it is no longer appropriate that children gain access to schools on the basis of religion.  It is unjustifiable <Col N="392"/>that a child may be denied a place in school because he or she is of the wrong religion.</P>
        <P>Some Senators have mentioned the issue of choice.  In rural Ireland, where I grew up, there generally is no choice and children must attend the local school, which is generally Catholic.  If parents are not of the Catholic faith or are of no faith, they do not have a choice in a real sense.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about Educate Together, which is a multi-denominational school organisation.  This is the model we should look to in a modern pluralist Ireland.  If a more integrated schooling system had been developed in Northern Ireland, it might have resolved some of the sectarian issues there.</P>
        <P>Other speakers mentioned the Equal Status Act.  This Act gives schools exclusion rights and allows them to discriminate on the basis of religion.  There is a concern that this exemption in the legislation may lead to indirect racial discrimination, a matter which has been raised by the Equality Authority and which the Government must examine in the context of EU law and the EU race directive.  The opening of schools which appear to be almost exclusively made up of children of a non-Irish ethnic background, or of only Irish ethnic background, is a significant concern.  It is in our interest and that of our children that our schooling system be fully integrated and that all children be given equal access to school places, irrespective of their race or religion.</P>
        <P>Religious instruction should be a private matter for parents outside of school while schools should teach religious education, which is a different matter, to all children by teaching them about religions.  We should see an end to discrimination and to the system of patronage on the basis of religion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate the Labour Party motion on the important issue of education, planning for it and the provision of primary school places.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our rapid population growth is a starting point for this debate.  My constituency of Wicklow falls within the greater Dublin area and it had an increase of 10% in population between 2002 and 2006, which is phenomenal.  We must be fair and admit that this growth brings extraordinary pressure in terms of the provision of educational services.  I admit that as a result of the rapid population growth in particular areas, we face difficulties with our education system.  This significant population growth highlights the shortcomings of our education system, particularly the planning area.</P><Col N="393"/>
        <P>Having served as a county councillor with Wicklow County Council for eight years, I am familiar with the way local authorities plan future educational provision.  The difficulty as I see it is that the Department of Education and Science has a central role in educational planning while local authorities are responsible for land use planning, but often the two functions are not well co-ordinated.  As a result, in the absence of a local area plan, areas grow considerably and densities increase, but the issue does not come under the radar of the Department until a local area plan has to be drawn up.</P>
        <P>In areas where a local plan is drawn up and land is zoned specifically for educational purposes, developers effectively have a green light to proceed with residential developments.  However, this does not always mean the provision of schools happens simultaneously.  Often we find such large estates occupied by families, but unfortunately no new schools are available for the new population to attend.</P>
        <P>We must address this challenge of educational planning.  The Green Party believes this can be done through the establishment of a specific strategic planning section within the Department of Education and Science.  Good quality information should be available to the strategic planning section and shared with relevant local authorities.  This is essential for proper planning and would include population projections and accurate assessments of the capacity of existing schools.  This is an area we fall down on currently, particularly with regard to the influx of new immigrant populations into specific areas.  If this information was available to the Department and shared with local authorities and an emphasis placed on forward planning, we would overcome some of the difficulties in a few years.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion raises the issue of procurement of land by the Department for the building of schools.  Unfortunately, under the current system local authorities zone land for development, thereby greatly increasing the value of the land.  The Department then has to pay top dollar for that land.  We have seen evidence of a new approach with the Adamstown development where the approach was more integrated and developers were informed that when developing large residential estates it was their responsibility to provide a school as part of the development.  Developers are often happy to do this as it does not add major extra costs to build a school while the estate is being constructed.  The advantage of this approach is the simultaneous provision of the school and housing.  The Adamstown project is a welcome, forward-looking development.  I hope the partnership approach evident in that development, between the Department of Education and Science and South Dublin County Council, can be replicated elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The location of schools is an important issue.  We talk a lot about the issue of obesity and the need for children to exercise more.  Often, <Col N="394"/>however, when we select new sites for schools, we locate them on the outskirts of towns which means children will be car-dependent from the start.  I call on the Minister to locate future schools in central areas of towns and villages in order that children can walk or cycle to school.  It is important to do this.  Local authorities have a safe routes to school programme, but often it is impossible to implement these programmes because of the location of the schools, particularly new schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On patronage and enrolment policies, the Green Party would welcome the creation of a State-run patronage system that would coexist with our current system.  There is a danger we may be too critical of the provision of schools by the Catholic Church, which has provided a great service for the country.  However, there is room for a greatly expanded and exciting new development of our primary education system.  There is an opening for schools like Educate Together and the Bray School Project, which are forward looking, multi-denominational and co-educational.  They are run in a democratic way which is different from the more traditional Catholic schools.  The challenge is to find a model that will allow this new system to develop under a State patronage system.  The debate must focus on how that will evolve.</P>

        <P>Pre-planning and planning have never been an exact science in terms of the provision of schools.  I was a teacher in Dublin in the 1970s when huge growth was experienced in areas such as Ballyfermot, with in excess of 60 and 80 teachers being provided in schools.  Ten years later, those schools were almost empty while small two or three teacher schools in the country continued to operate without adequate toilet facilities.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P Just="Left">I have just finished working 22 years in local government and I can say that pre-planning for facilities such as educational, medical, community and religious facilities was never a priority for our planners.  They will insist on a certain amount of green space and they are rigorous in enforcing social and affordable housing regulations, but with the greed in terms of planning, important issues such as education tend to be ignored.  In that capacity, I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government and the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in her ten-year development plan to try to rectify that and take a longer view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding ethnic minorities, it is almost impossible to legislate for minority groups in every sector.  Education is not different in that regard.  However, there has been some success in education in terms of the Traveller community.  While not ideal, there is a great history of practi<Col N="395"/>cal work being done by the Department, schoolteachers and boards of management to help those unfortunate people who often find it difficult to become involved in mainstream society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ethnic minorities are more of an urban problem; they do not affect rural communities to the same extent.  However, where there is a critical mass in the cities, we see the provision of specially dedicated schools which, although not ideal, are at least available.  In rural areas, a school with three or four members of an ethnic group is too small for specially dedicated teaching, although I acknowledge the Minister provides additional grants in that case.  There may be an inequity in that regard because it is difficult for a teacher in a 20-pupil class in rural Ireland with three or four students from an ethnic group who do not have language facilities.  Are those students getting the same crack of the whip as those who, despite all the objections in the city areas, are at least being given an option?  I welcome the provision by the Minister of in excess of 1,500 additional language support teachers but that initiative is to address what is more of an urban problem.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for the interest she has continually shown in the welfare of Drumclough national school, outside Listowel, which is experiencing ongoing difficulties in getting clearance for the &euro;3 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  Access to education is a major problem for young families in Dublin, Meath, Louth, Wicklow, Kildare and throughout the country.  It is a problem that is growing day by day.  It is a ticking time-bomb and it is due to the fact that we have an obsolete system for planning new classrooms in schools.  We suffer from a planning system that is disjointed and a management system that is out of date and overseen by a Minister who, with all respect, does not appear to have a grip on the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem is that there is no central person with overall responsibility for bringing together the various strands of the planning process.  For example, planners are responsible for zoning sites for schools.  Councillors are responsible for voting for that rezoning.  The landowners are only interested in getting top dollar for their sites.  The churches or the educational establishments are responsible for being the school patron.  When something goes wrong, the Department of Education and Science seeks to pass the blame on to one or all of those organisations when the reality <Col N="396"/>is that the only organisation that could possibly control the whole area is the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year in Laytown I saw the damage this system failure causes when, because of the demand for classroom spaces and the lack of planning, some children went to school in the mornings while others attended in the afternoons and some children had to take lessons in the gym.  I saw it in Ratoath as well where more rationing was needed because there were no classroom spaces.  The rationing was done on the basis of age.  Some schools required the child to be five by September, others said August while other schools required the child to be five by May.  One can imagine the implications that is having for family life.  Young families have to find additional funds for child care costs, take extra holidays or rope in the child&rsquo;s grandparents to do a spot of extra babysitting.  That is all because we have an obsolete planning system.</P>
        <P>This year there has been rationing of school places on the basis of religion, with some parents being asked to produce baptismal certificates.  Last week, I spoke to a man who tried to get his daughter into the local school but he was refused because his daughter had been baptised as an Orthodox Christian, not a Catholic.  Rather than the child walking five minutes to the local school, that family must drive 45 minutes every day to ensure the child gets an education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Access is also a problem in the area of special needs.  Owing to a lack of facilities, parents find it difficult to get suitable educational facilities for their child.  Special needs education is being rationed as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us be clear about where the fault lies.  This rationing is put in place because of a lack of school places.  It is not the fault of the school, nor is it the fault of the churches.  The fault lies with the Department of Education and Science for overseeing an obsolete planning process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The country was founded on the basis that educational access was a right.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states, in Article 42, that the State shall provide for free primary education.  What about the spirit of the Proclamation which states that we should seek to treat and cherish all the children of the nation equally?  All children have the right to learn with dignity and in comfort but that is not happening.</P>
        <P>It is for these reasons that we must have a national convention on education.  We must sort out the mess in the planning process, make more spaces available and modernise the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People talk about the role education has played in the creation of the Celtic tiger.  It now appears we are taking education for granted.  While we discuss these matters in this House, other countries are honing their education systems to equip their children with the ability to be at the forefront of the knowledge economy.  I urge the <Col N="397"/>Government to face facts, recognise our system needs changing and call a national convention to sort out this crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I congratulate the Labour Party for bringing forward this timely motion.  Education, of its nature, is an issue that must continue to be debated.  The debate on it will ever end.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The backdrop to the discussion is the fact that we have had something of a population explosion in recent years.  That is manifested most notably in the development of the commuter towns and the entire commuter belt in the catchment area of our large cities.  That is particularly apparent in the constituency from which I come in south Cavan and the towns of Virginia, Ballyjamesduff, Bailieborough and so on.  All of those towns have experienced substantial and immediate increases in population.  In some instances they have experienced a doubling of population in a few years as a result of the movement of people from Dublin, immigration, etc.</P>
        <P>The major failure of both the Department and the Government &mdash; one must level the political charge &mdash; is that this problem was not anticipated.  It should have been anticipated at the planning stage and links developed between local planners and the people who draw up the local area plans with the Department of Education and Science.  I have expressed that view at local authority level for a long time.  It is my understanding that more formal links are now established between the Department of Education and Science and the local government structures.  It would be wrong if that were not the case.  The Department should see the planning permissions and the area plans to anticipate school needs within a close range of the proper requirement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nightmare scenarios arose in my constituency.  In the national school in Virginia a number of prefabs have been taking up the children&rsquo;s play area for years, there are overcrowded classrooms, children being taught in cloakrooms and great discomfort throughout the entire school.  There is no capacity to allow for the full implementation of the modern curriculum.  In St. Anne&rsquo;s national school in Bailieborough there is huge overcrowding and large class sizes.  In Ballyjamesduff a new school was built before the final blocks were laid, before a pupil had even walked in the door, numbers dictated a need for three additional classrooms.  There are plans under way to build those classrooms but there is no anticipation about the project and that must change.  If that were to happen as a result of tonight&rsquo;s debate, it would be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government and local authorities have failed to extract enough from the big builders during the economic boom.  There should have been commitments for school buildings and many of the large builders got away with building mass<Col N="398"/>ive estates with no schools.  More should have been done and we must correct it in the future, although we have missed the boat in this respect.  Even now, however, where a developer is building a large estate, just as there is a requirement for social housing, there should be a requirement for educational facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The forum outlined by our education spokesperson, Senator Healy Eames, is a good idea.  Education is not static.  Many of us have been at the coalface of education and involved intimately with the sector.  We all know it is not cut and dried and a forum would not be the same as a committee, it would be a beneficial exercise that could be carried out at a low cost.  It is an inherently worthwhile idea.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can never understate the debt of gratitude owed to the Catholic and minority churches for the provision of education over the years.  They have done a great job and there is no point denying that.  There is also no escaping the reality that the vast majority of Irish people want denominational education provided in Catholic and Protestant schools.  This has implications for my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, where the minority community forms a substantial segment of the population and wants to preserve its identity and culture.  The same is true in Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s constituency.  The existence of a denominational school for the local Protestant community in any area plays a vital role in the perpetuation of their way of life.  It is equally important for Catholics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Alongside Catholic and Protestant schools, we should note the multi-denominational and non-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna.  It is understood that new structures must emerge in certain instances, particularly to take account of the population in some areas.  I agree, however, with Bishop Leo O&rsquo;Reilly, the spokesperson for the bishops on education, when he said that the Church would have to be compensated in the instances where it cedes control.</P>
        <P>We must accept that the majority of people want the <i>status quo</i> to continue while recognising the new, ethnically mixed, multicultural society, marrying the two in certain areas.  That marriage must be approached intelligently and new structures put in place.  All partners will co-operate in this area.</P>
        <P>I recommend that the Minister rethinks the idea of the forum.  She is capable of playing her part in the process and it is too good an opportunity to miss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is much to commend in this motion.  The last education convention in 1997 addressed the governance of all schools and helped to clarify the constitutional position of education.  If there was to be another such debate it would be welcome.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the tone of this debate, not just in this House but in the media in recent <Col N="399"/>weeks.  It is unfortunate that a certain red herring has been allowed to colour the debate.  I am referring to the role of the Catholic Church, particularly its enrolment policy, in contributing to the problem.  While it is not specifically referred to in the motion, the issue of the effects of particular enrolment policies applied by primary schools is listed with three other factors we could definitely point out as problems &mdash; the haphazard manner in which new school sites are identified, the apparent failure to apply criteria based on demographic and other relevant factors.  Those three points make eminent sense and any criticism of the planning by officialdom in this area is well deserved.</P>
        <P>To link the sensitive issue of schools&rsquo; and churches&rsquo; particular enrolment policies, however, is unfortunate.  It stems from a failure to grasp the delicate interplay of issues that have contributed to the problem as we have experienced it or it may be an instance of what the Taoiseach referred to as &ldquo;aggressive secularism&rdquo;, whereby certain problems are used to further an entirely separate political agenda.  I warn against that because it is unfair to the people affected by these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is only one reason we have experienced these recent problems, particularly in Balbriggan: the lack of joined-up thinking.  There are massive housing estates with no provision for education.  It is true that the State is now getting its act together, but it must be asked who located these families in Balbriggan in the first place?  To what extent was this problem flagged by those involved in education in the area to the State?  It was flagged years ago; before the Educate Together school even opened in Balbriggan, the three Catholic primary schools in the area approached Fingal County Council and outlined their capacity and explained the numbers they could accommodate, asking the county council to remain in contact so that they could plan for the future but they never heard back from it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To prepare for the 2007-08 school year, the three Catholic schools in Balbriggan and the education secretariat of the Dublin diocese notified the Department of Education and Science of the serious situation that was developing in the area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, pointed to the large number of empty houses in Balbriggan, undoubtedly a factor in the location of certain families in the area but, far too often, in this and in other areas, there has been a lack of joined-up planning.  I am not targeting this criticism at the Minister who is responsible for only one Department.  However, time and again, there has been a failure to foresee the problems that will affect communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of education is such a basic right one would imagine it would never leave the top of the agenda, yet it seems to have done so in this <Col N="400"/>case.  That is the reason we have had this problem.  We have a bizarre linking in of church baptismal policies as though they were genuinely a part of the problem.  I can only speak from my own past experience, but I am sure it is also true of other denominations, in saying that the Catholic Church is playing an active role in integration.  It also facilitates the choice of others to have the type of education they want for their children.  In the diocese of Cork and Ross the late Bishop Murphy provided a site for an Educate Together school there.  The Loreto sisters in Churchtown gave a site to the south Dublin Educate Together school.  The Bracken Educate Together school in Balbriggan is housed in property owned by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Not many people are aware of these facts, which show that while the Catholic Church and other Christian denominations may well be interested in providing a certain type of education &mdash; which is their right &mdash; they also support the right of others to choose the type of education they think is appropriate for their children.  Being the majority church, the Catholic Church has rightly facilitated smaller groups with fewer resources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a real danger of a certain statist mentality, which states that one size fits all when it comes to the provision of education.  It is important to remember that neither the State, the Labour Party nor anybody else has the right to tell parents what type of education they should choose for their children.  We know what people want from surveys that have been carried out.  As my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, people frequently choose denominational education, which is their right.  With respect to Senator Alex White, I heard him say earlier that the Catholic Church cannot have it both ways.  I do not think anybody should be allowed to have it both ways, but we must not forget that those who adhere to one religious faith or another constitute a large percentage of society.  At a relatively conservative estimate, 48% of people attend church weekly, which is a fair indicator that they want certain values to be a part of their lives.  Many more people who do not attend church choose to have their children baptised.  Should they choose a Catholic education for their children &mdash; which is more than just about teaching religion, but is also about promoting a way of looking at the world &mdash; that is their right.  I humbly suggest that, as taxpayers, they are just as entitled to that type of education as parents who want to send their children to an Educate Together school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to refer in passing to some of the comments by Senators Bacik and Norris.  Senator Bacik suggested that religion should have no place in schools, but what respect does that attitude show to individuals who may beg to differ about how they would order their family lives and make educational choices for their children?  Senator Norris said that schools should be about <Col N="401"/>facts, not faith.  I am reminded of the character in Dickens&rsquo; <i>Hard Times</i>, Mr. Gradgrind, who insisted that all he wanted was facts.  We would provide a dull kind of education if we were only interested in inculcating facts.  Education is about many things.  It is about helping children to grow, mature and acquire competences for the work place.  Much more than that, however, it is about developing healthy attitudes to life and solidarity with others.  It is fair to say that many partners in education, including those involved in the provision of denominational education, have been part of that great ethos of inclusive education.  That should continue to be the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Acting Chairman, Senator McCarthy, on his elevation to high office since I last saw him in the Chamber.  I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate and while I will not repeat many of the excellent points that have been made by my colleagues, I do wish to raise one issue with the Minister.  The gaelscoil in Clonmel began as a temporary arrangement in 1994, yet children attending it are still in temporary accommodation that was provided by the council in a building that was condemned at the time.  Over the years, the school has had many piecemeal repairs and there was an arrangement to relocate it in conjunction with the TRBDI at Ballingarrane, which has not happened.  There is extreme frustration in Clonmel concerning the gaelscoil.  The issue will not go away because this unsatisfactory situation is unfair to the children and others who access the service.  Will the Minister provide an update on the position regarding that school?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The problem we are discussing is essentially one of planning and integration.  It represents a failure of education policy.  There is a constitutional right to education, which entails a right to ethos education.  To commence the argument based on the issue of ethos education misses the point.  The right to ethos education is given expression in a detailed legislative framework under which schools are patronised by the main churches.  It was originally designed in an Ireland far different from the island of today, but there was diversity and minority communities &mdash; both Protestant and Jewish &mdash; were accommodated in that education process.  However, in a short space of time, with the inward migration of EU workers and refugees far exceeding the total number of those previous minority communities, structural problems have become apparent which have given rise to an important philosophical debate on the nature of Irish education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael supports ethos education and, indeed, all forms of education, whether it be religious, interdenominational, multi-denominational or non-denominational.  We are in favour <Col N="402"/>of a choice of ethos either by parents or the State.  Fine Gael supports the maximum practical choice by parents over the education of their children and that is why we continue to support the practice of patronage of schools by churches, which has served our country so well.  However, the integration which has taken place has created a different society and it will have an important impact on planning for education in the future.  It is not just a question of planning for an adequate number of primary schools, it is also a question of planning for integration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Britain, mosque-sponsored schools in predominantly Moslem areas have had the effect of alienating a generation of Moslem youth.  In France, the physical ghettoisation of immigrants has had a similar effect in many areas, regardless of the secular system of education that state promotes.  We must provide an adequate number of primary schools and deal with the issue of integration.  How is this to be tackled at local and national level?  Speaking as a former councillor, it is clear that at local level we had no business in the area of school provision.  It was made clear to local authorities that it was a function of the Department of Education and Science.  It is self-evident that given the pre-planning required, based on population and the choice of schools required by our new communities, there must be a link between the Department of Education and Science and local authorities.  This must be reflected in their county development plans.  We must also place greater emphasis on other models of education such as Educate Together, the VEC and community schools.</P>
        <P>The Minister will probably welcome a talking shop, whether it is in the form of a convention or a forum.  A consultative forum is necessary, but the House should not have to outsource such matters of national concern.  It is our job to discuss and decide on them.  The Minister should bring forward proposals for pre-planning school needs, the link between this and the county development plans and the provision for reserving land for primary schools.  I have seen many cases in which the land has been reserved but the school has not materialised.  There also should be proposals for integration in education because it misses the point to blame specific schools for problems such as arose recently in Balbriggan.  Those proposals could form the basis for a forum or convention on education.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom a bhua sa toghch&aacute;n a thr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis na Seanadoir&iacute; a labhair anseo inniu.  I note that of the 14 Senators who spoke on this topic, 12 are newly elected which augurs well for future debates on education.  I thank them all for their interest and welcome them to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I thank them also for affording me <Col N="403"/>the opportunity to outline the priority that the Department of Education and Science continues to give to school planning and integration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In proposing the motion Senator Alex White asked why I did not accept the initial principle about access in respect of religion and race.  I rejected it because it was not inclusive enough.  A major problem arises when schools exclude children on the basis of social background or special educational needs.  We all believe schools should be inclusive, and for the most part they are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Had Senators been here for the past five or ten years they would have heard that the focus was all on substandard schools and on investing in existing schools.  They also would be familiar with the level of activity in the school modernisation and building programme which has reached an all-time high.  Since 2000 the Department has spent &euro;3 billion on 9,000 projects, ranging from new windows or roofs to the large wonderful new schools which cost up to &euro;14 million, or &euro;18 million for the complete fit-out of the new school I opened last Friday in Malahide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a challenge to balance the need to deal with under-investment in schools for many decades while also providing new ones.  We have made significant progress, however, by unprecedented investment and innovations in the building programme.  New schemes have been central to the fast delivery of programmes in the schools and to ensuring we meet the under-provision from the past and deal with substandard schools.  This year 1,100 schools were approved under the summer works scheme.  Many have waited years for small projects but the success of that work is evident throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have also expanded provision in developing areas.  Investment has increased and the way in which we design and deliver schools ensures we build the extra accommodation as quickly as possible.  Responsibility for small projects has been devolved to school level to reduce red tape and to allow projects to move quickly.  Standard designs have been developed for the eight, 12 and 16 classroom schools to facilitate speedy delivery of projects and to save on design fees.  This hastens the planning process because the difficulties have been already ironed out.  The design is top class and so energy efficient it has been recommended for an energy award.</P>
        <P>Where possible, we build permanent accommodation instead of prefabs but where extra accommodation is needed at short notice it is necessary to erect prefabs.  The amount spent on these is kept to a minimum, and is a small part of our annual budget.  We have also significantly improved the manner in which the Department plans for the provision of extra school places in developing areas.  People are designated within the planning and building unit of the Department to deal with local authorities, specifically in <Col N="404"/>developing areas.  We have also published our own area development plans, separate from those of the local councils, on which we invite public consultation.  These set out the provision that will be needed in the next ten years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This year we have catered for an additional 14,000 to 15,000 children in primary schools.  It was a remarkable achievement to get that down to the last 50, bearing in mind population movement into and within the country which occurs frequently.  Approximately 50,000 children did the leaving certificate this year and more than 64,000 children came into the education system.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that up to 100,000 extra children will come into our schools in the next few years.  As a result the Department has developed close links with local authorities to improve planning for schools.  In the past far too many houses were built without the necessary facilities being set aside for them.  The local authorities are best placed to know what planning permissions and rezonings they give and how many houses they build.  In recent years there has been strong two-way communication with the local authorities which are obliged to consult the Department about the need for school places.  Following that sites are reserved before planning or development takes place.</P>
        <P>The Department signed an interesting agreement with Fingal County Council which has undertaken to acquire the sites for the Department.  The Department benefits both from having the sites made available by the people who know the plans for the area and because the council makes available at a reduced cost land it owns and will negotiate the purchase of land from developers.  In return the Department invests part of the savings in enhanced sports and community facilities which the council will also fund.  This is up and running in a school in Diswellstown.  The site was provided at a good price and the school was built with large sports and meeting room facilities in order that the community can use it.  This is a positive development which could roll out throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It can be difficult to acquire appropriate sites which, like planning, creates major problems for the Department.  Reference was made to an area where, because of the demand for classroom spaces and the lack of planning, some children went to school in the mornings while others attended in the afternoons and that this lasted for a fortnight.  If the local community, not the parents involved in the school, had not objected to the provision of the school it would have been on site.  That difficulty arises particularly when trying to provide a site in an already built-up area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once we have the sites we can build the schools in record time because of our design and build process using some of our generic designs, for example, the Archbishop Ryan school in Dublin <Col N="405"/>West or the new school built in Laytown this year.  The major stumbling block has been the acquisition of the sites.  In some areas the site was not reserved, in others where it was reserved it was difficult to get it at a reasonable price within the timeframe.  By imposing planning conditions that require schools to be built before the houses, the local authorities can ensure the developers are willing to provide school sites without excessive cost to the Department.  I suggest the ability to highlight the availability of the school as a community facility next door would also improve the likelihood of developers being able to sell their houses.</P>
        <P>While Members have noted the success of the Adamstown strategic development zone, this model can also work in smaller areas and could be used both to provide a new school or site and as a planning condition to provide one or two additional classrooms in small rural areas that are also experiencing significant development.  The new programme for Government contains a commitment to ensure no rezoning of land for residential development may take place without a prior commitment of an appropriate proportion of land for the schools.  I have already held preliminary discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on how to make rapid progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>In addition to improving its links with local authorities, my Department has also developed its own planning capacity for schools.  In 2004 it adopted an area-based approach to school planning that uses a public consultation process involving all interested parties.  As I noted, a blueprint for the schools&rsquo; development over a ten-year timeframe is set out and members of the public are involved actively in consultation regarding the required schools, places and numbers in their own localities for the next ten years.</P>
        <P>Five-year plans have been already produced, some of which are for the developing areas of north County Dublin, south County Louth, east County Meath, the N4-M4 corridor running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan.  In addition, the Department has conducted detailed analysis of the existing and projected enrolments in a large number of developing areas to ensure good planning for additional accommodation, where required.  However, one is still unable to rely completely on the census figures as some groups of people did not fill in the census returns for various reasons.  Some were immigrants who may have been worried about their own status.  In addition, irrespective of the census returns, the movement of people into areas, including very young children and entire families, creates a demand both for junior infant classes and for places in fourth, fifth and sixth classes, which may be already full in existing schools.  When this scenario has taken place, schools have been highly accommodating. <Col N="406"/> A number of important initiatives have been taken in respect of forward planning within the Department and its links to local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nevertheless, the demand is great.  An additional 100,000 school places will be required during the lifetime of the national development plan in which a provision of &euro;4.5 billion has been set aside to meet this need.  In its first year, construction work will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.  This should provide Members with a sense of the scope involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of Balbriggan was raised.  I accept it is not ideal to set up a school at such short notice.  However, the Department was highly conscious that Balbriggan was a developing area and had been working closely with the town&rsquo;s existing schools, which were provided with additional teachers and accommodation.  Moreover, it has been already noted that new schools were opened in Balbriggan in 2005 and 2006 and that Educate Together had indicated its intention to open a new school there next year.  Consequently, while the Department worked with Fingal County Council to acquire land for new school buildings in Balbriggan, it also kept the enrolments under review, particularly this year.  It became apparent that given the rates of growth and movement of people, further schools and accommodation would be required despite the provision of additional accommodation for the established schools.  This was made available in Sunshine House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department invited Educate Together to bring forward the school it had hoped to open next year and I thank the organisation for working with the Department to provide the school within such a short timeframe.  In addition, I thank the school principal who had an extremely difficult first week, given the media focus on her school and pupils.  She is deeply committed to ensuring her pupils receive a top quality education.  While it could be stated that one would not wish to provide a school for children of a single ethnic background, it was necessary to provide a new school there.  Moreover, Bracken Educate Together national school reflects the nature of the families that have moved into the area recently.  Those who are familiar with the town are aware its new growth has come from people of various ethnic backgrounds.  This issue is not the result of unwillingness on the part of the town&rsquo;s existing schools to accept children of any particular ethnicity or religion.  Some existing schools have large numbers of newcomer children.  It has been already noted that many people in Balbriggan were very upset by the implication in some sectors that there was a form of racism at play in this regard.  Obviously the Department will continue to work with people there, as well as in other developing areas.</P><Col N="407"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to supports for newcomers.  Members have discussed the issue of integration, which is of equal importance.  The establishment of the office for integration and the appointment of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with responsibility for integration policy, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will ensure the Government has a co-ordinated and cohesive approach to dealing with the integration of newcomers into Ireland.  In the first instance, the Department&rsquo;s priority for children in schools is they should be able to speak and understand the language.  Hence, priority was given to the teaching of English.  Without referring to mainstream teachers, special needs teachers or resource teachers, there are now 1,450 teachers whose sole job is to teach English to newcomers to our country.  This constitutes an enormous increase and a further 305 teachers will be employed by 2009.  Some schools have as many as six teachers teaching English to such children to support them in their new communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department has also ensured that information is available to parents in a number of languages.  One can obtain information on the education system on the Department&rsquo;s website in Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and German, as well as Irish and English.  Similarly, information from both the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the National Educational Welfare Board has been provided in a number of languages.  I have also ensured that the Department is pursuing an active policy of integration in schools to prevent racism through practical guidelines on integration that have been given or made available to all primary and secondary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will touch briefly on the issue of school patronage.  As was noted earlier, the present shape of the school system reflects the historic reality that religious authorities established the majority of schools.  In the main, the Catholic Church provided an education for children in all districts, regardless of whether one was on an island or the mainland, in a large city or a small rural area.  Moreover, traditionally such schools have welcomed and continue to welcome children from all backgrounds and religions.  From their own experience, Members will be aware that Catholic schools have enrolled a large number of children of different faiths.  I have visited such schools personally and regardless of whether the location is in Castleisland or west County Dublin, one can see the diversity that is present and that has been welcomed.  I will continue to support this practice by ensuring there are enough school places available.</P>
        <P>The majority of new schools that have opened in recent years have been multi-denominational, which reflects the new Ireland and the new demand that has arisen.  In this year alone, the <Col N="408"/>Department of Education and Science has received 38 notices of intention to open new schools next year, only seven of which concern schools of a Catholic ethos.  This demonstrates the present demand.  All such schools are being assessed through a process that involves public consultation.  Consequently, the public is involved in this process, be it for planning in one&rsquo;s own locality or in respect of the individual school being established.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having recognised the need, the Department is developing a new model of primary school patronage, namely, the community national school.  It will cater for a diversity of religious faiths that are represented, in particular, in growing urban areas.  This new model will be in place next year under the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in west County Dublin.  However, it is important to recognise this model will not constitute a substitute or replacement for the existing patrons and will run alongside them.  I look forward to developing this model and to having inclusive schools that will focus on the academic, the cultural and the spiritual, because the overall development of a child is hugely important in their education.</P>
        <P>Members will be aware the Catholic bishops&rsquo; commission on education has signalled in a policy statement issued last week that in some areas, in which there has been a decline in the demand for Catholic education, some of its existing schools may no longer be viable as Catholic schools.  It has also stated that in certain circumstances, Catholic schools may be transferred to other patrons.  I welcome that the bishops&rsquo; statement makes clear that parents and teachers will be consulted before decisions are taken in respect of any school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will explore with the bishops the scope, range and pace of disengagement they envisage in order that any changes are well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers, children and local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system.  As Senators have heard me outline, there are a number of methods by which people can get involved in consultation and debate at all stages of planning in our school system.  The matter of community national schools is being discussed with all of the education partners.  Among all Departments, there is a formal process of consultation with all education partners, involving management, teachers&rsquo; unions, parents and students.  It is very inclusive.  Between 2002 and 2004 my predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, held a two-year public consultation process called YES, Your Education System.</P>

We are very conscious of the needs of the growing population and the particular needs of our large immigrant communities, and we want to ensure all of these are met.

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for being here for the debate.  We do not always have a senior Minister for our debates.  This is an important issue, and I thank the Labour Party for raising it.  It will become an even bigger issue in the next couple of years, and it is proper that we discuss it in the Seanad tonight.  I do not always agree with what the Minister says, but I concur fully with her position with regard to the religious ethos of schools.  I have a particular interest in this as I am a member of the board of management of my local primary school, which is a Catholic-established school, although there are students who are not Catholics and do not belong to any religious faith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The system as it operates very successfully for the overwhelming majority of students around the country.  The network of national schools has served the country well.  However, there are a number of areas which are under pressure.  This was highlighted recently in north and west Dublin, but there are also towns elsewhere, in areas where there have been significant levels of development, whose schools are having problems with regard to spaces.  The enrolment policies held by national schools usually do not come into play, but they do when there is a sheer lack of space.  The Government has a serious case to answer in this regard.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that there has been significant investment in national schools.  Despite this investment, I could list half a dozen schools in my area which are still seeking extensions or new school buildings, but progress has been made.  The Labour Party motion does not state this has not happened, but it points out that there are difficulties in particular areas.  The Government should have a clearer plan for solving these difficulties in the future.  Some areas have large numbers of new houses, residents and pupils, and we cannot allow the problems that developed at the start of this school year to become a regular occurrence, as has the issue of school bus tickets, <Col N="410"/>which occurs at the start of every school year.  We cannot allow a similar situation with regard to primary school places.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s comments contain an element of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  An unprecedented number &mdash; hundreds of thousands &mdash; of new housing units have been built across the country.  People have mentioned Adamstown, which I am sure is a wonderful place, although I have never been there.  A couple of other well planned communities have also sprung up in the past few years.  Sadly, however, there are many more areas that have not been planned as well as Adamstown, where sufficient educational facilities have not been provided.  They have not been allowed for in the building of huge new housing estates.</P>
        <P>In a previous life, I was a member of a local authority.  In my own area, there was a significant problem with a school in Rosbercon, which is one of those unusual areas which is almost in County Kilkenny but is actually in County Wexford, although we claim it nonetheless for Kilkenny.  The school in question has not had a playground for a number of years because the prefabs have taken over the yard.  The multi-purpose room is now divided into three classrooms.  Four years ago, when I was on Kilkenny County Council, we zoned a site for a new school.  Because all of the built-up area is in New Ross, County Wexford, the only area for potential growth is in the Kilkenny end.  However, there is no danger I can see, although I have lobbied long and hard, that a new school will be built there.  To place the blame on local authorities is incorrect, because in many places they have zoned lands for educational facilities, although there are many areas in which they have not.  The response from the Government has been insufficient.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Parents have the right to choose the school their children will attend.  The overwhelming majority of parents, as far as I have established, want their children to go to a school of a particular denomination.  The largest Church of Ireland boarding school in the country, Kilkenny College, is in my constituency.  Schools have every right to protect their ethos and give preference to siblings of existing students and to members of their particular faiths.  This is right and proper.  People of many faiths attend Kilkenny College, which is a brilliant school.  Similarly, parents who wish to send their children to primary schools of a particular faith should have that right.  However, the kernel of the problem is not the ethos of the school.  It is that in situations such as we have seen, of which there will be more in the future, there is not enough space available.  The Government, the Minister and the Department need to ensure sufficient places are provided in those areas for students to attend primary school.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues of all parties for their contributions to this debate.  I also thank the Minister for her close attention to the points made in the course of the discussion.  Senator Keaveney made the point, which was reflected by the Minister, that there were concerns about figures obtained from baptismal records.  Senator Keaveney seemed to suggest that because there were difficulties with the data, there was almost an argument for doing nothing.  I am not suggesting the Minister or anyone else is doing nothing, but if the data are insufficient, the answer is to improve them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Why can we not have Adamstowns in the north, south, east and west?  That is the difficulty.  South Dublin County Council is a very progressive body, but that level of input does not seem to be replicated in other parts of the country.  The Minister&rsquo;s notes state she is anxious that more local authorities use certain conditions to ensure new schools are in a position to be ahead of or in line with demand.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that anxiety is not sufficient.  The Minister and the Government must insist that this be done, whether by way of mandatory guidelines to local authorities or by legislation.  Anxiety is not enough.  Change must be delivered through actual requirements imposed by central government.  I was a member of a local authority for three years and I know it is mainly a function of the manager rather than a reserved function.  Even in South Dublin County Council, progressive as it is, I saw little or no debate of these issues within the council and it is not such a live issue in local authorities as has been suggested.</P>
        <P>The fundamental point in this debate has been my party&rsquo;s call for a convention.  The Minister touched on it at the end of her contribution.  She <Col N="412"/>felt there was no real need for one.  If she does not mind me saying so, I thought she scoffed a little at the idea in that the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, had held one previously for a period of two years and this called into question the need for another forum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of the debate in this Chamber suggests there are a large number of issues that would bear public debate and scrutiny.  What is wrong with having that level of debate?  We do not suggest large infrastructure or something that would last forever and a day but a convention where consideration could be given to all these issues, including the ethos issue described by Senator Regan and others.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a compelling argument, which Senator Bacik made, that the churches should not be involved in education or perhaps we should move towards a largely non-denominational system of education.  On the other side of that coin is a real implication, of a financial nature if no other, for us as a community.  Even if we leave aside the ethical, moral and political arguments that go with it, if the State must pick up the entirety of the tab, that is a substantial political issue for us all to consider and it is not as easy to say we should just show the churches the door.  It will not happen that way and none of us can be naive enough to think it will.  That is another issue that needs to be put into the frame in such a forum.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Senator Mullen, in the rhetoric of his speech, stated that the Labour Party does not have the right to prevent people sending their children to denominational schools.  There is no suggestion, in the motion or elsewhere, that we would ever wish to do that but, as the Minister has acknowledged, there is an emerging need for a debate on the balance that needs to be struck between the State&rsquo;s involvement, which will inevitably increase, and the churches&rsquo; involvement which, even according to their own statements, will inevitably recede in the next period.  Let us bring that into the public domain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remember when I was a child in the early 1970s that there was a debate about community schools and there was a roadshow on television from the then Department of Education.  The Department, if the Minister would not mind me saying so, has not always been the progressive organisation it is claimed to be now but even then, in the early 1970s, it got on the road and introduced a debate in urban and rural communities about community schools, their implications, etc.  There is nothing wrong with that approach now.  It is the kind of issue that is crying out for public debate.  In the circumstances, it is not asking a huge amount of the Minister and the Government to provide for that forum and that is the basis on which I move this motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to be able to raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, the need for an update on a site acquisition in Buncrana.  The development in question will have three constituent parts, namely, a Garda station, the consolidation of the social welfare offices and a decentralised office under the auspices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The upgrade of the Garda station in Buncrana has been long required.  The existing building has gone beyond the state of being in bad repair.  It does not provide the service that is needed, not only for the garda&iacute; there but also for the public.</P>
        <P>My main concern is value for money.  To date, temporary solutions have been examined while <Col N="414"/>the main building is being developed.  I believe a lease has been secured for a building and that substantial money may have been spent on ensuring the temporary accommodation is of sufficient standard.</P>
        <P>The delay in having the garda&iacute; moved from their existing accommodation to the temporary accommodation has lasted too long.  We have just debated the issue of education and how school projects can move very quickly when a decision is taken and a site is available.  I am disappointed at the seeming lack of progress on progressing the temporary and permanent accommodation projects, which is why I have asked for an update.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was to be a consolidation of the existing social welfare offices on the same site.  I understand the staff of the social welfare offices in Buncrana have gone through an endurance test in coping with a difficult situation.  It is important their needs are met soon by having accommodation built for them.  It is not economic to continue to rent accommodation in a number of centres, which I assume is happening.  It would be preferable to have a permanent building.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is not just about the quality of the staff&rsquo;s current accommodation but also about staff welfare and team spirit.  If staff are in one location in a new building, the team spirit and the ability to do the job will be enhanced.  Staff are working against the odds, although they are doing a mar<Col N="415"/>vellous job in poor circumstances, which also applies to the garda&iacute; in Buncrana Garda<?oasys _jy ?>station.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The core issue I wish to raise is that of the decentralisation of the Department of Social and Family Affairs offices to Buncrana, which is the third component part of this one site.  It is very important that this project is advanced.  While the number of staff offering to move to Buncrana is smaller than its original allocation, we must move on, build the offices and make the project a reality.  When that happens, more people will take notice of Buncrana as a destination, and should they do so, they will realise that the quality of life and opportunities presented by the location and town are immense.  There should be no back pedalling with regard to developing the site for decentralisation.</P>
        <P>From a career perspective, which is what concerns many civil servants, there is a positive message in Buncrana and Donegal given that Letterkenny is a major location for the Department&rsquo;s offices.  When the new &euro;1,000 payment for children under six years old was introduced, it was decided that the offices in Letterkenny would be the administrative centre for this.  In terms of career progression and opportunities, having a Department of Social and Family Affairs office decentralised to Buncrana is a further positive development in addition to the existing social welfare services in place in the town and the services in Letterkenny and County Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need the building to be physically in place to encourage other civil servants to accept Buncrana as a real, positive option.  The project has been talked down by many.  It is important for the status of the town, which has lost hundreds and perhaps thousands of jobs from the textile industry in the past decade, for the Inishowen peninsula and the surrounding area right into the Derry heartland that the region is given priority by the Government.  If the Government will ensure the decentralised jobs are up and running on schedule, we will have the opportunity to use this as a catalyst for other inward investment.</P>
        <P>We have had a difficult time, including an employment crisis, but we have worked to turn that situation around.  We have improved infrastructure and continue to do so.  The new dispensation in the Six Counties and its new Assembly will give the north west a much more attractive base than our geographic position has allowed until now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister of State has good news for me today, namely, that work is progressing on all three projects.  Ultimately, whether the project will be progressed is an economic decision.  Much of the groundwork has been done but to reach this position, it was necessary for me to sit down with many people who were blaming each other.  The Office of Public Works was blaming the <Col N="416"/>Department of Social and Family Affairs until it arrived in the room, and the Department blamed the Garda until the Garda arrived in the room.  However, I had a very successful morning when I brought most of the parties around the table.  I would like to think the project will progress significantly given that the site has been acquired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A site of about 2.25 acres was acquired in 2005 in Buncrana to facilitate the provision of a new local office and a decentralised office for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As Senator Keaveney noted, there was an additional requirement in Buncrana for a new Garda district headquarters.  The existing Garda station is inadequate to such an extent that the garda&iacute; are moving to temporary accommodation in the short term pending the erection of the new station.  With the acquisition of a small additional portion of 0.38 acres of adjoining land which was available for purchase, the combined site can facilitate construction of the three facilities, namely, the two facilities for the Department of Social and Family Affairs buildings and a Garda district headquarters.</P>
        <P>Planning permission for the Department of Social and Family Affairs local and decentralised offices was obtained on 30 January 2007 and the Part 9 planning process for the Garda district headquarters was completed in May 2007.  In deciding how best to design and procure these facilities, it was considered that designing and contracting the facilities as one single project was the most sensible way to proceed.  It was considered that the best value for money, deriving in large part from economies of scale, would be achieved in this way.  The design of the facilities is integrated, making best use of the site.  It incorporates shared excavated basement car parking facilities for the two Department of Social and Family Affairs buildings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following an EU competition, seven contractors were shortlisted for the project.  The tender competition for construction of all the elements proved very competitive with all seven contractors submitting tenders.  Consideration of the tenders is under way.  When building commences, the project is expected to take 21 months to complete.</P>
        <P>The project comprises three elements, the first of which is the Department of Social and Family Affairs decentralised offices.  This building will be a three-storey building which will accommodate 120 decentralised staff from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The Department provided a general brief of requirements based on the Government decision but has not as yet identified specific sections to be transferred.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second element is the Department of Social and Family Affairs local office, the design of which will allow for a building over two floors. <Col N="417"/> The local office is currently located in leased accommodation in Castle Avenue.  This building will also include an area for the Department of Transport and the Marine driver test centre, which comprises an interview room, staff room, waiting area and staff and public toilet facilities.  This facility will be for driver testing for motor vehicles only.  The driver test centre for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, will continue to operate from Letterkenny.</P>
        <P>The third element is the Garda district headquarters, which will be a three storey building.  The Garda station was previously located at St. Oran&rsquo;s Road.  However, as this premises is wholly inadequate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in the process of moving to temporary accommodation in Lisfannon industrial estate in the short term, pending the erection of the new station.  To sum up, consideration of the seven tenders is under way.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Ryan. </P>
        <P>In 2006, Dublin City Council published a draft feasibility study in which three options were considered to meet the projected water demands of the greater Dublin area.  The options were to abstract water from the River Shannon at Lough Ree, abstraction from the River Slaney, River Barrow or both and abstraction and desalination of sea water from Dublin Bay.  The second option, the abstraction of water from the River Slaney and River Barrow, was ruled out because it was considered that this source would not provide the required volume of water.  The third option, desalination of water from Dublin Bay, was also discarded as it was deemed to be too expensive.  The first option is to abstract from Lough Ree 300 million litres of water per day for the greater Dublin area and a further 50 million to 100 million litres for other local authority areas located along the proposed pipeline.</P>
        <P>Estimated future water demands are based on a number of criteria, including the need to respond to the possible effects of climate change.  In addition, it has been predicted that greater affluence will result in increased <i>per capita </i>water consumption.  The need to facilitate potential future industries with high water demand is also taken into account.  The feasibility study makes no mention of the need to put into practice conservation measures such as rain water harvesting for sanitary flushing and garden irrigation and grey water reuse on site.</P>
        <P>Current leakages and losses from the water supply system in the greater Dublin area amount to 65 litres per household per day and an additional 161 litres per day through leaky pipe distribution.  This mismanagement by the local <Col N="418"/>authority is unacceptable.  In two short years from July 1998 to 2000, the Dublin water conservation project reduced leakage in the Dublin area from 40% to 30% of water supply.  Regrettably, the feasibility study makes no mention of such conservation measures.</P>
        <P>Total losses of water from the Dublin system amount to 200 million litres per day or around 60% of the quantity Dublin City Council proposes to abstract from Lough Ree.  The Government has committed itself to the national spatial strategy, of which the gateway towns of Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore are part.  Given that the population of these towns is projected to grow by 60,000 by 2020, we in the midlands need to plan for our future water needs, rather than allowing the needs of the people of Dublin to supersede our own.</P>
        <P>Westmeath County Council and other local authorities may expect to satisfy these future water needs by tapping into the proposed pipeline from Athlone to Dublin.  The Athlone area has experienced severe water problems this year, with poor quality water from the River Shannon causing severe difficulties in existing water treatment facilities, resulting in water being rationed during the day and turned off at night.  Senators will be aware of the recent cryptosporidium contamination of the water supply in Galway, a crisis that could easily recur.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I may be a lay observer but it is clear that the lack of consultation with members of the public and the clandestine manner in which Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authority executives are managing this matter are wrong.  I understand the final decision will be one for the Minister rather than elected members of the relevant local authorities.</P>
        <P>The effects of major abstraction on the capacity of Lough Ree and the River Shannon for recreation, navigation and fisheries have not been addressed in the feasibility study.  I am acutely aware of the importance of tourism, tourist angling, pleasure cruising and sailing to the midlands, a region in which massive investment has been made in marinas, club houses and amenities.  To damage in any way this important resource would be a disaster to the region&rsquo;s economy and the quality of life of its people.  The significant commitment of local fishing organisations to restock the lakes of County Westmeath is to be commended.  This is, however, a vulnerable process as fluctuation in water levels would be most harmful to the area&rsquo;s rich fish stocks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Shannon catchment area contains a significant number of vulnerable national heritage areas, NHAs, and special areas of conservation, SACs, which are under serious threat.  Knowledge of the effects of abstraction on these areas is inadequate.  While no one denies that the projected water needs of the greater Dublin area must be <Col N="419"/>addressed, I fail to understand the reason Fingal County Council has applied for planning permission to construct a landfill in an area which has a rich resource of underground lakes and springs.  The utilisation of these aquifers along with conservation, recycling, rain harvesting, the possible storage of excess water from the River Shannon during the winter months and, if necessary, desalination could, with a little vision, meet the projected needs of the greater Dublin area without abstracting water from the River Shannon and Lough Ree.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council&rsquo;s proposal to abstract water from Lough Ree for the purpose of meeting a projected growth in the demand for water in the greater Dublin area is a matter of grave concern for citizens.  I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to set the record straight and I ask Members who represent constituencies in the Shannon basin to consult their constituents and enter into a full, honest and open debate on this important issue.</P>

	<P>I cannot understand the reason consideration is being given to a proposal to pump surface water from the River Shannon to Dublin to meet the water needs of the capital when the city is surrounded on two sides by the north Leinster aquifer.  This aquifer, which stretches from Daingean, County Offaly, through counties Kildare and Meath and across north Fingal until it enters the sea between Balbriggan and Rush, can be viewed on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s website.  It has been mapped and tested by the EPA for nitrates and coliforms.  Although it is the largest and cleanest aquifer in the country, it has never been surveyed for its potential output as a public water source.  This output can be estimated based only on the groundwater extraction at Bog of the Ring in Fingal.  The output at this point, which accounts for approximately one hundredth of the total aquifer, is 3.5 to 4 million litres per day.  On this basis, potential overall output may be as high as 350 million to 400 million litres per day, equivalent to the estimated shortfall in the Dublin water output.  </P>
        <P>Five hydrogeologists have agreed that at least three other potential public water sources could be tapped into between Bog of the Ring and Swords.  The only people who understand and are aware of the importance and potential of the aquifer are those involved in horticulture who currently use it through a complex network of private and industrial wells.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Groundwater is currently under-used, with only 5% of the public water supply derived from groundwater sources.  This figure compares with figures of 99% in Denmark, 72% in Germany and 70% in the Netherlands.  The risk of contami<Col N="420"/>nation of surface water is much greater than that of groundwater.  Estimated costs of removing water from the north Leinster aquifer are approximately one tenth of the cost of pumping water from the River Shannon.  The cost of purifying water from the aquifer would be a fraction of that required to purify surface water.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government must protect our water sources.  A national policy is required for the management of all water resources, particularly in the context of predicted water shortages and recent water-related health problems in Galway.  Identification, development and protection of locally and regionally important groundwater resources such as the north Leinster aquifer are vital.  The Minister must act now on this strategic issue of national importance.</P>

	<P>This is my second visit to the Chamber today but my first time to address the Senators present.  I congratulate new Members on all sides, including my former colleagues in the other House who have been promoted to the Upper House, Senators who were successfully returned and Senator Moylan on his elevation to the position of Cathaoirleach.  I thank Senator McFadden for raising this important issue and Senator Ryan for the important points he made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland will experience significant climate change impacts, even if international efforts are successful in stopping or slowing down the current rate of increase in average global temperature.  Research on future impacts of climate change on Ireland predicts changes in rainfall frequency and intensity.  This will require us to invest in measures to reduce the adverse impact of such changes such as infrastructural investment to deal with more intense floods and droughts and to ensure that water supplies continue to<?oasys _jy ?>be able to service social and economic requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Water is a finite resource and we have a collective responsibility to manage it effectively for future generations.  Local authorities, which are at the heart of this challenge, have a range of facilities available to them to produce, deliver and conserve sufficient stocks of water to meet current and anticipated needs.  The Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved water supply infrastructure.  Details of currently approved projects are set out in the water services investment programme 2007-09 which the Minister published only last month.  A copy of the document is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The programme includes some 330 schemes worth &euro;2.6 billion which relate exclusively to water supply.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 includes an increase of 27% &mdash; to &euro;4.7 billion &mdash; <Col N="421"/>in planned spending on water services by comparison to the previous NDP.  Substantial increases in water treatment, storage and delivery capacity will be achieved on foot of this investment.  Schemes completed in the period 1997 to 2006 have already produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.2 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Conservation of water supplies has an equally important role to play in avoiding water shortages and developing sustainable water use practices.  Finding additional water supply capacity through leakage control and better supply system management is preferable to capital investment in new infrastructure.  It reduces environmental pressures from extra raw water abstraction, treatment and delivery.  Some &euro;288 million is available to local authorities from the Department&rsquo;s national water conservation programme for measures to reduce leakage and other unaccounted for water losses from public water supplies.  By the end of the year, almost all non-domestic water supplies will be metered, giving the business community a means and incentive to determine how to reduce water consumption, providing both a financial and environmental benefit.</P>
        <P>It is of fundamental importance that we continue to plan strategically for future pressures on water services whether from climate change or other influences.  A passive approach will not do.  There must be a concerted, planned and co-ordinated response.  The Water Services Act 2007 provides for that and requires all local authorities to manage their water services functions within a framework that requires six-year strategic plans to be drawn up for each area.</P>
        <P>Ahead of the legislation, many local authorities have moved to plan for their long-term needs.  For example, the Dublin, Cork and Limerick local authorities have completed studies with minimum horizons of 20 years.  The strategic water plans that local authorities must draw up under the Act will address current and projected challenges and identify appropriate responses to changing pressures and demands.  Detailed guidance on the preparation of these plans is to be available shortly from the Department and I will bring the related provision of the Act into force soon afterwards.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that with adequate commitment and planning by all stakeholders, the integrated policies, strategies and financial resources being put in place will ensure the national water supply infrastructure will be capable of meeting all reasonable demands in the future.  Senator McFadden raised issues referred to previously in the D&aacute;il by Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke.  I will send the additional information to the Senator, as I was not aware it was part of tonight&rsquo;s debate.</P>

	<P>In recent years, the Leopardstown-Stepaside area has undergone extensive development and expansion.  In the past five years, approximately 6,000 additional residential units have been given planning permission and commenced building.  In most cases, they are occupied.  Further residential units are planned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent agreement of the Kilternan local area plan ensures further development, population expansion and educational need in the area.  The Department has been helpful in meeting the area&rsquo;s primary educational needs in that there are six primary schools, two of which were completed recently, and the completion of another has been fast-tracked.  The area is appreciative of these facts and, with the Department&rsquo;s agreement, sites for an additional three primary schools have been identified.</P>
        <P>While the area is on track to have nine primary schools, it will not have a post-primary school.  In 2000, the Stepaside area action plan identified a site for a post-primary school just outside the village and a reservation order was placed.  In 2001, the Department&rsquo;s inspectors visited the site and confirmed the need for a post-primary school.  Therefore, the reservation order was to remain in place.  Six years on and we are still awaiting news of progress.  Children from the area attend a range of secondary schools, almost none of which has direct bus routes to and from the area.  This places a burden on people in terms of transport and has an adverse impact on the community&rsquo;s future development.  I hope the Minister of State has good news regarding progress in terms of the site&rsquo;s acquisition and plans for the post-primary school.</P>

        <P>In the course of examining the need for additional provision at post-primary level and having regard to the developments at Kilternan, Stepaside and Cherrywood, the Department has <Col N="423"/>identified surplus capacity in existing post-primary schools in south Dublin, but it has requested the local authority to reserve two sites for post-primary schools in the Stepaside-Kilternan area.
