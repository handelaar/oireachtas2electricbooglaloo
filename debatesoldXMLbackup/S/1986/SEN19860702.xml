      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 7 on today's Order Paper.  No. 1 is purely formal.  No. 2 is a continuation of the Committee Stage of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985.  In regard to No. 3 the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, in charge of this Bill cannot be present for the debate today. She regrets that as she would like to reply in person to the debate.  This matter has been discussed with the other groups. There is agreement that if the debate concludes it will be adjourned in order to allow the Minister, Deputy Doyle, to reply to the points raised by Senators at some convenient time next week.</P>
      <P>In regard to No. 7 which is the motion on bilateral aid, it is anticipated that there will be only a few speakers and it is hoped that it can be disposed of today.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m. and also from 6 p.m. to 7 p. m.  It is proposed to take No. 7 on the resumption of business at 7 p.m.  It is unlikely that it will last until 10 p.m. and accordingly it is most likely that we will go back to whatever business had been interrupted at 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>I gave an indication <Col N="1600" /> on the Order of Business yesterday that I intended to hold a meeting of representatives of the groups in regard to the question of the business for the remainder of this term.  I should like to indicate the agreement that has been reached.</P>
      <P>Today's business has already been agreed.  Tomorrow it is intended to take the Report Stage of the Companies Bill. It is also intended to take the National Lottery Bill and the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, both of which will pass Dáil Éireann today.  In order not to delay this House unduly in its consideration of these Bills there is an agreement that the Second Stage of both these Bills will be taken to conclusion tomorrow even though that might involve a late sitting.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the Seanad should reassemble on Tuesday next at 12 noon in order to take Report Stage of the Harbours Bill and the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill if Report Stage is needed and to take Committee Stage of the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, and the National Lottery Bill and also, if necessary, to hear the reply of the Minister of State on the Air Pollution Bill.  It is proposed to take the Report Stage of the National Lottery Bill and the Malicious Injuries Bill and to take in their final form the regulations on persons in custody on Wednesday, 9 July.  It is then proposed to adjourn the Seanad and to resume on Wednesday, 1 October.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Second Stage be ordered for Wednesday, 1 October 1986.&rdquo;  The intention was to have this Bill through the House before the resumption of Dáil Éireann so that this House cannot be accused of delaying <Col N="1601" /> the Bill.  This is an important measure which has been in preparation for some time.  The Government hoped that it would be possible to have it through the Seanad before the summer.  This is not possible with the agreement we have now made and the other business which we have.</P>

    <Title>Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 5, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) Where a complaint has been made orally it shall be the duty of the Chief Executive Officer to provide, from the information sent to the Board, a summary of the complaint to the person who has made the complaint. No further action shall be taken on the complaint until the summary is acknowledged as accurate by the signature or mark of the person making the complaint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator O'Leary.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the contents of section 4 and the way in which I proposed it should be amended by amendment No. 1.  The Minister is right, as I said yesterday, in recognising that, in addition to written complaints, oral complaints are to be provided for.  Oral complaints should be taken every bit as seriously as written complaints.  If I have read the Bill correctly, the procedure which the Minister proposes to adopt is as follows.  When a complaint is made orally, this complaint is reduced to writing by the appropriate person &mdash; very often it will be a member of the Garda Síochána who is receiving the complaint &mdash; and a note of that reduction and a note of the receipt of the complaint are to be given to the person who is making the complaint.  What does not appear to be <Col N="1602" /> required from that person is confirmation that the note on the memorandum prepared which purports to be a summary of the complaint is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>It is important that people who for one reason or another, are unable or unwilling to reduce a complaint to writing in their own hand should be confronted with a written substance of their complaint for two reasons.  This is the prime reason for moving this amendment.  It is important that the member of the Garda Síochána who is the subject of the complaint should be aware in a very accurate manner, and a manner which can be referred to at a later date during the course of the investigation, of the exact nature of the original complaint.  It should not be open to the person making the complaint, having gone through the procedure to say at the last minute or, indeed, when the decision has been reached by the complaints procedure which, in some instances, obviously would go against the complainant: &ldquo;That was not the complaint I made at all.&rdquo;  or &ldquo;While the garda did take a note of some points about which I complained there were additional points of which he did not take an adequate note.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude what I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by The Workers' Party, which is certainly a rude interruption, in order to fully protect the integrity of the investigation and in the interest of justice and fair play both for the complainant and more particularly for the member of the force who is the subject of the investigation the issues between the parties must be clearly identified and acknowledged by the complainant so that no residual doubt can remain as to the subject matter of the complaint.  I should like to bring briefly to the attention of the House section 4 (2) (b) which states:</P>
      <P>On receipt of a complaint by a member at a Garda Síochána station&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  he shall record it forthwith, <Col N="1603" /> together with the date and time of its receipt, and furnish an acknowledgment in writing of its receipt to the complainant, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the member in charge of the station at the time the complaint was received there shall notify, or cause to be notified, the chief executive and the Commissioner of the complaint as soon as may be, and send each of them a copy of the complaint or, if the complaint was not in writing, a copy of the record of it.</P>
    <P>It is not clear what is to be supplied to the complainant by the Garda Síochána. It appears to be only an acknowledgment in writing of the receipt of a complaint. For example, if a long, complicated complaint is made a member of the Garda Síochána only has to acknowledge it in writing by saying: I hereby acknowledge having received a complaint on today's date from you at a particular Garda Station. It will be signed and given to the person without him being sure whether the oral complaint was accurately reduced to writing.  I do not think that members of the force will inaccurately do that job because it will be open to scrutiny.  The accusation could be made later, by the complainant, particularly if the complaint is not upheld, that two years were spent investigating a complaint which really was not the substance of the matter complained of.  I want it to be crystal clear that where it is not a written complaint the complainant is under an obligation to consider at an early stage the precise nature of the complaint as it has been reduced to writing, to make any addition to it as he considers appropriate and to acknowledge it.</P>
    <P>For example, I referred in passing yesterday to the Kerry Babies Tribunal. There was a typical example of people who started complaining about one matter but who ended up complaining about a different matter altogether.  That is an example of what can happen.  There are many people who would seek to justify their original complaint and I do not think <Col N="1604" /> it is right or proper that this area should be left vague.  I have had professional experience of where complaints were made against medical practitioners, for example, complaints of misconduct under the contract which they had with local health boards to supply services in the general medical services area.  In all such cases, if a complaint is made with regard to the manner in which the service is being provided it must be reduced to writing.  A complaint will not be considered unless it is reduced to writing.  In those circumstances it is appropriate that this or a similar amendment should be made.  If the Minister is able to convince me that already within the Bill this mechanism exists I am quite happy to accept that.  In the absence of that assurance, I think it would be an ease to both parties but particularly to the member who would be the subject of the investigation to have an amendment of this kind made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill I did not really so much criticise the Bill as suggest that a possible shortcoming was the fact that it seemed to be too comprehensive, too complex, tried to dot every &ldquo;i&rdquo; and cross every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and to provide for every possible situation.  In a sense, Senator O'Leary is adding to this feature of the Bill by providing for another step which way in the end only discourages the person who is making the complaint.  That is one of the things about the Bill, that there are so many steps, procedures, that a person making a complaint would lose heart halfway through and just abandon the whole thing.  To provide that &ldquo;no further steps will be taken until the person acknowledges that their complaint is as set out in this way&rdquo; might have that effect.  The section as it stands could in effect, by implication anyhow, provide that the acknowledgment would in fact set out the complaint.  A conscientious officer of the board would in the circumstances say, &ldquo;We acknowledge receipt of your complaint as follows&rdquo; and it is quite likely that the acknowledgment would in fact set out the complaint as received. Perhaps it would be a good idea that, <Col N="1605" /> instead of going as far as Senator O'Leary suggests, the Bill should say that the acknowledgment would in fact acknowledge the complaint as received by them or as understood by them.  Then, it is up to the person making the complaint to write back or communicate with the board and say &ldquo;No; that is not exactly what I meant&rdquo;.  If he does not respond to say that the board have got it wrong then I think they should go ahead.  I think it is going too far to say that nothing further should be done until they hear back from the person making the complaint.  Basically I think Senator O'Leary has a point. It is very easy in a situation like this for an oral complaint to be misinterpreted &mdash; misinterpreted by whoever took it in the first place, or misinterpreted between there and arriving at the board.  In principle I think the point is good but I would not be in favour of making it quite as formal and as complicated as suggested by Senator O'Leary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary has made a valid point here.  However, if one pursues the point, what he is really saying is that the board should not investigate an oral complaint.  What he is in effect suggesting is that every complaint should be reduced to writing in one form or another.  It is a good point.  It is a good point in the sense that it prevents any difficulty arising at a later stage in relation to what precisely the board have investigated, what precisely is the nature of the complaint and these would be set out pretty clearly what is to be investigated. The current practice in relation to the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971, is that the member concerned is furnished with a copy of all statements made in relation to the investigation together with a copy of the precise charge made against him, being one of the scheduled charges in those regulations.  Certainly a difficulty can arise if a similar procedure is to be followed in relation to this Bill.  It is difficult to furnish a member with something which is based on the oral complaint.  The importance of the Bill is to ensure that at the end of the day the person who makes the complaint is satisfied <Col N="1606" /> that the subject of his complaint has been properly investigated.  That can only be achieved if that complaint is reduced to writing.  That can only be achieved if the nature and content of the complaint is reduced to a precise form.  If the matter is left to an oral complaint that it is difficult to interpret precisely what the nature and basis of the complaint is.  For those reasons, I would support the amendment put down by Senator O'Leary, purely in the interests of clarity and in the interests of ensuring at the end of the day that a person who makes the complaint cannot allege that his or her complaint has not been properly investigated or has been only partly investigated.  I believe also that the amendment put down by Senator O'Leary is an amendment which is in measure in ease of the Garda in relation to this Bill and something they are entitled to be assured of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the amendment proposed by Senator O'Leary would introduce an additional complication into the procedure and delay quite substantially the consideration of oral complaints. There is a point there I will come back to in a moment.  What it provides for is that a summary of the record of each oral complaint should be prepared by the chief executive of the board, sent to the complainant for authentication and signature by the complainant.  Obviously, it could take some time between the moment when the complainant called to the local Garda station and the time he would receive the summary of the complaint in the post.  A further period would elapse then after the complainant had received the summary, signed it and sent it back, assuming that he found it to be an accurate record of his complaint.  Only then under the amendment proposed by Senator O'Leary could the investigation begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Eoin Ryan has pointed out before now, he was not alone on Second Stage in complaining about what he saw as the complexity of the Bill.  He was indeed joined most eloquently by my <Col N="1607" /> friend Senator O'Leary on that point.  I would think that the amendment can be criticised on the same grounds, that it would add a new element of complexity. Some oral complaints could in fact be of a fairly serious nature.  We could imagine the case, for example, of a person in custody in a Garda station who complained of serious ill treatment.  A complaint of that kind, and indeed there are others &mdash; just take that example &mdash; should be investigated without any delay.  It should be of its nature investigated immediately. The draft treatment regulations which we discussed in this House only yesterday provide that in such a case the member in charge must arrange for the person making the complaint to be medically examined as soon as practicable.  As for the Bill it would require any member of the Garda Síochána on becoming aware of the complaint to take any necessary steps immediately to obtain or to preserve evidence about the conduct being complained of.</P>
    <P>You would have to do that without waiting for the complaint to go to the board and without waiting for a decision as to the admissibility of the complaint. You would be obliged to take that action immediately so as to ensure that the complaint, if it were deemed admissable, could be fully and properly investigated. Those considerations would indicate the need to have a system that allows us to deal very quickly with complaints and therefore the need to avoid anything that would cause delays.  It would be somewhat anomalous, although I know there may be two views about this, to require oral complaints to be authenticated in this way and not to require the same kind of authentication of written complaints &mdash; written complaints which could conceivably be rather confused in some cases, where they are badly expressed and perhaps not very clear.</P>
    <P>I think it is better that we should have a situation where the chief executive of the board would decide quickly on the admissibility of a complaint on the basis of what is presented to him, whether it is a written record or a record of an oral <Col N="1608" /> complaint, rather than to delay the whole precedure by looking for further and better particulars or for authentication. If he decides that the complaint is inadmissable he must say precisely why.  He must say what condition or conditions of admissibility have not been fulfilled by the complaint.  It would then be up to the complainant if he felt aggrieved by that decision to remedy any omissions there might be in the original complaint and ask the board to review the chief executive's decision.  I would imagine that in practice most complaints would be likely to disclose enough information to allow the chief executive to make a decision fairly quickly as to whether the complaint is admissable or inadmissable.  If there are omissions or inaccuracies in the account given in a letter of complaint or in the record of an oral complaint, then they can be adjusted at the time when the investigating officer comes to take a full statement.  It seems that that is the correct point at which to look for an accurate account of the conduct complained of and then have it signed by the complainant.</P>
    <P>I thought for a moment that Senator Durcan was going to support my point of view, although he seemed to take a slightly different track during the course of his remarks.  What is clear is that in an ideal world &mdash; and this world, as we all know, is far from being ideal &mdash; all complaints should be in writing.  I fully take the points made in that regard by Senators, including Senator Durcan.  The fact is, however, that it would impose an unjustified disability on some potential complainants if we were to require that all complaints should be in writing.  It is reasonable and essential to allow for complaints to be made orally.  We had some discussion on Second Stage of the circumstances in which oral complaints might be made.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan's suggestion that an acknowledgment would be accompanied by a record of the complaint is certainly something that we could look at.  There is another possibility also.  I would imagine and I hope Senators will regard this as being something other than a purely bureaucratic concern, that the Garda <Col N="1609" /> Síochána in playing their part in this scheme would provide Garda stations with some kind of a standardised form on which they would record their complaint and that the acknowledgement could be accompanied by a copy of that form. I would have to discuss the details of implementation with the Gardai.  There could be there an opportunity effectively to give the complainant that kind of record.  The essential point I want to make is that to propose, as the amendment does, that the procedure could not start in any real way until this authentication had taken place could in many places unnecessarily delay the beginning of an investigation in a way that is unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add that the board in their own interest should, when they are acknowledging the complaint, acknowledge what they understand the complaint to be.  Quite apart from the frustration as far as the complainant is concerned, if he finds that the wrong complaint is being investigated it would be a great waste of time for the board if they embarked on an investigation of a complaint to be told at the end of the day that that was not the complaint at all.  It would be well worth our while from a purely bureaucratic point of view to say what they understand the complaint to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Eoin Ryan has got to the kernel of what my amendment was about.  I will be withdrawing my amendment because I acknowledge some of the points made by the Minister as being valid.  I do not want to add another bureaucratic step in the already overburdened bureaucratic steps contained in this Bill.  I acknowledge many of the Minister's points as being accurate.  I think you have to view my amendment as a response to what is not in the Bill.  The reality of the situation is that while we have got the Minister's assurance as to what might be done, all the Bill actually requires of the Garda is that they would acknowledge receipt of the complaint.  That could be a one liner: <Col N="1610" />&ldquo;I hereby acknowledge having received a complaint on the &mdash; day of &mdash; 1986 from John Murphy&rdquo;.  That, I think, would cover the situation as far as the Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that other practices will now grow up.  I am concerned with trying to ensure that the procedure is correct.  If the Bill were amended, if in some way there could be an obligation on somebody to supply a copy of the complaint as reduced to writing to the person, I would be quite happy with that. Let the person then raise an objection if they want to and if they do not, let the assumption be that they are accepting the summary as accurate.  That will not get over every problem but it will get over most of them.  I do perceive a weakness in the legislation, which will be exploited by those who feel aggrieved by the results of complaints.  That is where I think the exploitation will be.  Those who are aggrived with the results of complaints and particularly those who have made the complaint and have not got the result which they desire, in my opinion, will exploit this weakness as indicating that proper and comprehensive note was not taken of what they said or that it got lost in a bureaucratic muddle and had gone too far before they realised it.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I acknowledge the legitimacy of the additional point made by the Minister about the necessity to have certain processes of investigation carry on even prior to the submission of the complaint to the chief executive of the board.  That is another reason why I agree to withdraw the amendment. Having said that, when we come to discuss the section I will be asking the Minister to respond and to set our minds at rest that the interpretation which I am putting on the legislation, which I think Senators Durcan and Eoin Ryan are also putting on it, is incorrect.  In so far as this amendment is concerned, I am happy to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister like to comment on what he understands to be the legal position as distinct from what he hopes to be the actual practice with regard to section 4 (2) (a) (i) which reads:</P>
      <P>He shall record it forthwith, together with the date and time of its receipt, and furnish an acknowledgment in writing of its receipt to the complainant...</P>
      <P>The same applies to (2) (c) (i).  From a legal point of view would the one line acknowledgment cover that and does the Minister anticipate any difficulty arising as a result of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>From a legal point of view, what Senator O'Leary calls a one liner would cover that.  However, as I said earlier we have to take account of some other circumstances.  In my view &mdash; and I think some Members of the House would share this view &mdash; the ideal situation would be one in which a complaint was made in writing.  For a number of reasons, including the requirement that complaints be made in writing, some people would be put off making a complaint.  We have allowed, properly, for the possibility of making a complaint orally.  Obviously that has to be recorded and forwarded to the board.  As I said, I would expect, though I have not discussed this matter in detail, that there would be a standard form on which such complaints would be recorded.  I would see no difficulty either in ensuring that at the moment the complaint is recorded in the station, that it be shown to the complainant or that the acknowledgment would be accompanied by a copy of that record.  I take the point made by Senator O'Leary about the difficulties that might arise afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat in great detail something I said on Second Stage but the Minister was not here then. I am concerned about how people will feel about making a complaint in a Garda station.  I gave an account on Second Stage about the one occasion on which I was involved in making a complaint about misbehaviour by a member of the Garda. <Col N="1612" /> I was not the victim of the misbehaviour, I was speaking on behalf of somebody else.  I went into a very large Garda station in Cork and there were about 40 gardaí in the station sitting around the fire as it was a cold winter's morning. One of the gardaí came to the desk and spoke to me very politely.  When I said I wanted to make a complaint about the behaviour of a member of the force, a frosty silence descended on the entire Garda station and every single word I had to say about the complaint was taken in, not just by the individual who less than enthusiastically was writing down my complaint, but by every member of the Garda who was present in the station at the time.  If people, &mdash; particularly outside Dublin &mdash; are going to identify the Garda station as the only place for making a verbal complaint, bearing in mind that evidence shows, and this has been my experience, too, that the people who come in contact with the law most frequently and who have the most grievances about the law tend to be people who will have greatest difficulty in making written complaints and would need assistance in doing so &mdash; it is obviously not practical or feasible to make a regulation saying that under all circumstances such complaints should be heard in private.  Nevertheless, it should be possible to suggest in some sort of guidelines that, as far as possible, people making complaints under this legislation should have their complaints dealt with in some privacy so that they can not be overheard by other members of the public who are present and particularly by other members of the Garda.  The function of the Garda in this case is simply to transmit a complaint as an agent of the complaints board and there should be no necessity to go into a Garda station and have the entire membership of the Garda listen to your complaint.  There should be some element of privacy involved.  My own experience was somewhat awesome but, as the Minister can see I survived fairly well but I would not wish it on anybody else.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for that piece of folklore which we must classify in the annals of mythology but I take the point he is making.  In most cases where people live outside an urban area and are going to a Garda station to make a complaint, most frequently they will go to a Garda station where the station party consist of a sergeant and two or three gardaí or, in a number of cases, where the station party consist of one or two gardaí and there is no sergeant.  I would invite Senator Ryan to look again at the provisions of section 4 (1) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>A member of the public who is directly affected by, or who witnesses, any conduct of a member and who wishes to have a complaint concerning that conduct considered by the Board shall himself or through his solicitor or, in the case of a person under the age of seventeen years, through a parent or guardian or, in the case of a person who is mentally handicapped or mentally ill, through a parent or guardian or some other person interested in his welfare make a complaint in relation thereto orally, or send or give it in writing, to the Board at the office of the Board, to a member at a Garda Síochána station or to a member above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than a Garda Síochána station within six months of the date of the conduct.</P>

    <P>That provides a number of different channels and circumstances through which a complaint can be made.  In that we have recognised the central point Senator Brendan Ryan was making &mdash; which is a quite legitimate point &mdash; that people who have complaints to make about a member of the Garda might feel <Col N="1614" /> constrained in making the complaint directly to another member of the Garda Síochána.  Of course, the complaint does not have to be made in the station to which the member being complained of is attached.  It can be made in any Garda station.  As I mentioned, there is a procedure under which the complaint can be made to a person above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than a Garda station.  I freely admit that that is a fairly limited channel.  There are not all that many people above the rank of chief superintendent, those in question would be the assistant commissioners, deputy commissioners and the Commissioner. There are not many of those and they are not very accessible to people with complaints to make.  We provide also that the complaint can be sent or given in writing to the board at the office of the board so that as far as possible we have provided a sufficient variety of channels to get over the problem mentioned by Senator Brendan Ryan which I fully agree is a problem and is the reason for our providing all those different channels.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I felt that there were 30 or 40 Garda present but it definitely seemed like an over-powering number and I do not usually feel overpowered. It was a unique experience and the Minister has taken it quite seriously. He is accepting my point but he is not accepting some of the consequences or realities of Irish life.  Large sections of our population, for instance, do not know solicitors or members of the Garda above whatever rank is specified.  For a large section of urban Ireland outside Dublin &mdash; people in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway &mdash; the only place they will know of to make a complaint is the Garda station.  Large sections of our society would have difficulty in making a written complaint so they will make a verbal complaint and the prospect of not being able to make it in conditions of some privacy will intimidate many from making complaints. I do not ask for a change in the legislation but it would be helpful in terms of guidelines to Garda stations about <Col N="1615" /> dealing with complainants under this legislation, if it was suggested that as far as possible complaints should be heard with a reasonable degree of privacy.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to comment on subsection (6).  It says that where a complaint has been made a member can still be charged with an offence relating to that conduct.  But it goes on to say that the member shall not be charged except with the consent of the DPP.  Would the Minister tell us what is the purpose of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection makes it clear that a member of the Garda Síochána may be charged with an offence notwithstanding the fact that a complaint could be made in relation to the conduct in question.  If, for example, the gardaí had evidence that a member had assaulted a member of the public, they could proceed to charge the member with the offence and need not wait for the person who was assaulted to make a complaint under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It also provides that where a complaint has been made the member may not be charged with an offence in relation to the conduct alleged in the complaint except by or with the consent of the DPP.  The importance of that is that the bringing of a prosecution against a member who is the subject of a complaint, particularly a prosecution that results in his acquittal, affects the action that the board may take in relation to the complaint.  For example, the board cannot refer a breach of discipline to a tribunal if the breach is in substance the same as the offence of which the member has been acquitted.  In the circumstances the DPP is the most appropriate person to decide whether or not to prosecute the member who is the subject of a complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that explanation and I agree with it.  I would ask the Minister to help me with one point with regard to concurrent investigations.  Where it comes to the attention of the police authorities that a <Col N="1616" /> person has been assaulted, using assault as an example, normally they make their own investigations and in due course the person is charged.  Where the alleged assault was allegedly carried out by a member of the force and is the subject of a complaint, as I understand it, it goes through the complaints procedure and afterwards through the preliminary stages and ultimately an investigating officer is appointed.  Is all investigation of the matter, both in its complaint complexity and relative to any criminal prosecution vested in that investigating officer?</P>
      <P>Is there a residual power of investigation that remains with the force as in the normal way pending arriving at the stage of the appointment of the investigating officer?  I am not talking about the case where you have to take action which is covered by subsection (5), that in an emergency you must preserve the situation. Will other normal investigations have taken place in the meantime quite separate and distinct from the complaints procedure?  At what stage will the power of investigation switch from the ordinary procedure to the investigating officer who has been appointed by reason of the complaint having been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Once the complaint is sent to the board the procedure that is provided for in the Bill would have to be followed.  All of that investigation would be carried out by the investigating officer subject to the overview of the investigating officer that is provided for elsewhere in the Bill by the chief executive or by the board.  All of the investigation of that complaint would be carried out by the investigating officer.</P>
      <P>I would bring the attention of the Senator to section 6 (1) (b) which provides that:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to an investigating officer that the conduct alleged in a complaint may constitute an offence, the law and practice applicable to the investigation of offences shall, subject to section 4(6) of this Act, apply in relation to the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sets out very firm guidelines for the <Col N="1617" /> investigating officer as to how he must go about his investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  But where there is an alleged assault by a member of the force and there is not actually a formal complaint by the person subject to the assault, presumably the members of the Garda Síochána would, in pursuance of their duties, be investigating that assault in any case.  If after a period of two months a formal complaint is then made by the person, is the investigation stopped, pending the investigating officer getting on with the business of processing the formal complaint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will correct me if I am wrong in saying that he is imagining the following kind of case where as a result of some activity by a member of the force and without a complaint having been made by the public it appears that that member might have been in breach of Garda discipline regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a breach of the law. The disciplinary requirements of the force would require an investigation to be carried out internally into that kind of conduct.  If a complaint is subsequently made by a member of the public, that complaint must be dealt with under the procedures that are set out in the Bill. The Bill is designed specifically to deal with the way in which complaints by members of the public are treated so that an investigating officer would be appointed.  That investigating officer would clearly be able to have at his disposal the results thus far of any previous investigation that had been carried out in the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the thinking behind section 6 (1) (a)?</P>
      <P>The Commissioner shall appoint a member of the Garda Síochána (in this Act referred to as an investigating officer)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  not below the rank of superintendent, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  if he considers that the circumstances so warrant, of the rank of inspector...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That appears to be almost contradictory. On the one hand, the Minister is putting it very strictly that it cannot be below the rank of superintendent.  But then it says &ldquo;if the circumstances so warrant it, below the rank of inspector&rdquo;.  Effectively, what is being said is that one might as well put in &ldquo;the Commissioner shall appoint a member of the Garda Síochána not below <Col N="1619" /> the rank of inspector&rdquo;.  Is that not the sum total of what is available to him? Why does the Minister say he cannot appoint somebody below the rank of superintendent and then qualify it immediately by saying if he considers the circumstances so warrant it he can appoint an inspector?  That is a total contradition. This has been used in the Criminal Justice Act.  He had to appoint a chief superintendent if he thought a chief superintendent was not good enough.  Would the Minister explain what is the reasoning behind this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation is simple. It is not one that will give the Senator any great difficulty.  The norm is that the commissioner would appoint a superintendent to investigate cases.  Where, however, he found that the matter was not of very great importance, he could appoint an inspector or where, for example, he found that because of the exigencies of the situation a superintendent was not available, he could appoint an inspector. The reason for putting the reference to &ldquo;not below the rank of superintendent&rdquo; first is to indicate clearly that in the normal case it would be a superintendent who would investiagate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary is right about this.  I see no necessity for wording it as it is.  It is quite likely to lead to some kind of legal proceedings at some time if an inspector is appointed.  The contention is made, why was it not a superintendant and what were the special circumstances which warranted the fact that it should be an inspector rather than a superintendant? I can visualise this giving rise to quite ridiculously complicated proceedings and applications in another place because an inspector was appointed instead of a superintendent and somebody is not able to show in a satisfactory way what the special circumstances were. I agree entirely with Senator O'Leary. Why not just say &ldquo;not below the rank of inspector as seems appropriate&rdquo; or <Col N="1620" /> something like that and allow the discretion to the commissioner to appoint whoever he thinks fit?  It is one of the features of this Bill which is, as I have said before, very well intentioned.  It shows great industry and great dedication to considering every eventuality but it will lead to complications.  Senator O'Leary has made a very good point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, my reply is that the intention is that in the normal case a person not below the rank of superintendent would be appointed, but that since there is a limited supply of superintendents and since there may be cases where, either because of a limited supply of superintendents or because of a relatively trivial nature of the complaint, it could safely be investigated at a lower level, we will provide for the appointment of an inspector.  If we were to say simply &ldquo;an appointed member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector&rdquo;, then the norm would be that inspectors would investigate all of the cases, whereas the norm we want to establish is that it would be a superintendant who would do so.</P>

      <P>Knowing the general state of my confusion about most things, it ill befits me to be talking about clarity of thinking, but I have noticed in a lot of Bills that come before this House &mdash; this has been my learning experience over the past five years &mdash; there are these little catch all phrases, stuck in on tailends of legislation to enable the people who are, perhaps, going to have to operate the legislation to do a lot more if they are stuck than would otherwise be the intention of the Bill.  If the Minister means that where there is no Garda superintendent available or where the commissioner is of the opinion that the complaint is of a relatively minor nature, why not say so? Why not put it into the Bill that in the circumstances that, perhaps, where no superintendent is available and/or the commissioner is satisfied that the complaint is of a relatively minor nature, he can use a member of the force not below the rank of inspector?  Why not say so <Col N="1621" /> rather than leave such strange phrases as, &ldquo;if he considers the circumstances so warrant&rdquo;.  I think that reflects sloppy thinking more than anything else and a desire to leave plenty of room to manoeuvre in case something comes up we have not thought of.  I do not think that is a particularly good way to frame legislation.</P>

I feel a bit like the navigator trying to pass safely between the Scylla of Senator Eoin Ryan and the Charybdis of Senator Brendan Ryan with Senator O'Leary providing the storm from my left.  The discussion we have just had shows very clearly some of the difficulty of producing a measure of this kind.  Senator Eoin Ryan is complaining about excessive specification.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With this country in the state it is in, can being in the middle be a virtuous position?  I could imagine a situation where somebody who is the subject of an investigation &mdash; I hope this never arises because I think it is the most awesome thing to visit on any member of the force &mdash; is told the recommendation is that he should be dismissed.  He may say: &ldquo;I was only investigated by an inspector; so, obviously, they started off thinking that it was not a very important case; even the Minister said in the Seanad that inspectors would be used only in cases <Col N="1622" /> which were not considered to be so important&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I certainly would not like it to stay on the record that the Minister really means that you would only use inspectors where it was not so important because in those circumstances in my opinion you would be limiting the range of punishment which would ultimately be open to the complaints board, or whatever they are to be called.  I would consider the suggestion I made that it would be a straight person, not below the rank of inspector. If that is what the Minister considers appropriate, I have no objection to it. That is far better than the way it is drafted at the moment.</P>
      <P>I would warn the Minister against allowing the view to prevail that it is only or primarily in cases where not important matters were being investigated that inspectors would be appointed.  That should not be the case because circumstances might arise where inspectors were appointed and that this would subsequently give rise to a situation where somebody has to be punished very severely for something that has been proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 provides for an appeal board so that the kind of case in which the conclusion indicated by Senator O'Leary would be arrived at, would not only have gone through the normal hearing but it would also have gone through an appeal.</P>

      <P>Obviously, we are not going to get anything on the inspector and superintendent.  We will not go into that any further, or at least I will not.  I cannot speak for my colleagues.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of Members referred to the use of the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; during the course of Second Stage.  During section 6 this is used in quite a number of cases.  It is used in section 2 (a):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An investigating officer shall complete the investigation under the section as soon as may be, and if he is <Col N="1623" /> unable to do so within the period of 30 days...</P>
    <P>I can understand that flexibility has to be provided for in that regard.  The idea of an interim report within 30 days is very good.  I congratulate the Minister for that, though it adds a certain complication to the investigating officer's brief to have to do that.  Leaving aside that for the moment, it is also probably an extra hurdle he has to overcome.  You can imagine the situation where a report is prepared by an investigating officer beyond the period of 30 days and he had not produced an interim report, would that invalidate the whole procedure?  I know that if I was arguing for a garda who was in trouble, I would say it did.  I would argue that although, say, 45 or 60 days had been involved, there was no interim report.  There is the requirement to produce an interim report.  I would be arguing along those lines if I was professionally representing a member of the force but I hope I never am, that it will not arise that anybody will need professional representation.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is relative to 2 (b), which says:</P>
    <P>An investigating officer shall, as soon as may be after the completion of the report on this section, furnish a report in writing...</P>
    <P>Is there any way we can tie that down a bit further?  The phrase, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, is as I understand it, probably the least urgent of the time constraints put on people in legislation.  There is &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as is convenient&rdquo; and so on.  What is the best judicial interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;?  I am sure the Minister's officials have that available to them.  I am sure it has been considered.  Would the Minister share with us what the correct judicial interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point Senator O'Leary has made.  I should like the Minister also to define for us as far as he may, in ministerial sense, the meaning of the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;. <Col N="1624" /> Yesterday when discussing the draft regulations for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, I raised the question of the meaning of the words &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;, as distinct from &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  Indeed &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; seems to be a phrase that is creeping into legislation very frequently now.  It is a phrase that one can put some understanding on but &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; seems to be longer and open ended. Perhaps the Minister might try to define it for us in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As a mere economist, I always feel some trepidation when lawyers get after me, who, obviously, have a perfectly clear idea in their own minds as to the meaning attached in legal practice terminology, to ask me to give them an idea as to how another judicial mind might interpret the phrase.</P>
      <P>Senator Durcan mentioned our discussion yesterday where in one case the phrase used was &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; and in another case &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. &ldquo;Without delay,&rdquo; as I pointed out yesterday, does not necessarily mean immediately. There are circumstances in which, for very practical reasons, &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; might not mean immediately, as in the case which we were discussing yesterday, mentioned by Senator Michael D. Higgins, of 30 people who were brought to a Garda station and it was not possible &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; to inform each one of them of the charges against her, as it was in that case.  &ldquo;As soon as may be&rdquo; is a phrase that is hallowed by long usage.  I would hesitate to guess how often it turns up in legislation, but it has turned up very often in legislation over a long period.  The meaning that we would attach to it is that there must be no undue delay in the carrying out of whatever it is that must be done as soon as may be.  For example, it would seen that when talking about section 6(2)(a), the investigating officer should complete an investigation under this section as soon as may be.</P>

      <P>If the Senator will bear with me, not having as agile a legal mind as he has, I tend to be more pedestrian and take it in stages: the investigation must be completed as soon as may be. That means that it should not unreasonably be held up.  It means that it should not be suspended in the interest of doing something that is of a less urgent nature than that investigation.  If the investigations officer is unable to complete his investigation within 30 days from the date of his appointment, he has to furnish an interim report.  Now he has to furnish that interim report as soon as may be after the period of 30 days has elasped. That means that once the 30 days have passed and he has not finished his investigation, he must, as soon as he can, produce an interim report.  Again, he cannot prefer a less urgent task to the furnishing of that interim report.  In each one of these cases Senators will see that it would be unrealistic and impractical to write &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On the other point raised, it would be important that if the investigation had not been completed within 30 days, which I think is a reasonable period, there should be an interim report so that everybody concerned could be assured that the investigation was not simply being long fingered.  If it appeared, during the course of an investigation that the investigating officer was not carrying out all of these things as soon as may be, and that he was preferring less urgent work to the investigation he was carrying out, he would begin himself to run the risk of it being charged against him that he was neglecting his duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On that &ldquo;as soon as may <Col N="1626" /> be&rdquo;, there are two points I want to come back to.  Could we talk first about &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, and what it means?  My interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is that it is certainly less urgent than &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and probably less urgent than &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;?  It appears to be a very loose choice of words that could reasonably be put in there.  I would say &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  Look at it from the outside: Somebody has a complaint being considered and feels nothing is happening.  He writes to the board and asks what is happening.  Why is he not getting a result of the complaint? Forget the investigating officer for the moment.  Just take the chief executive who must also submit things as soon as may be.</P>
      <P>Suppose two months had elapsed between the receipt of the report and the taking of action by the chief executive officer, would that be within or without the limit of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;?  In my opinion there is no way he could go to court and say, &ldquo;they are refusing to consider my complaint because they have not done it within a period of two months&rdquo;. That is not practicable.  As soon as may be might be six months, or nine months. And that is, as Senator Durcan said, in respect of each step of the procedure. Now you are talking about a situation where the investigating officer shall complete an investigation as soon as may be. Then after the completion of an investigation, there is another period as soon as may be in which to furnish a report. Forget the interim report for the moment.  The chief executive then has another &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; in presenting the report to the board.  It just appears that the &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; provisions are being compounded one upon the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan is quite right in saying it is &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; multiplied by three.  The first &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is for the completion of the investigation, the second relates to the writing of the report and the third to the submission of the report by the chief executive officer.  That appears to be a very slow procedure. <Col N="1627" /> In the circumstances the Minister should look again to see if it adequately conveys the urgency which he, no doubt, wishes to convey or see if there is any other form of words which could be used.  Lastly, dealing with that point, I ask the Minister again if he has got advice and if he has, would he share that advice as to whether there has been a judicial interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The phrases &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; or &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; are all somewhat airy-fairy and difficult to define.  Certainly, for the citizen who makes a complaint they are phrases which are difficult to comprehend. I would refer the Minister once again to the regualtions for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, which we discussed in draft form yesterday. Regulation 9 which is headed &ldquo;Information to be given to an Arrested Person&rdquo; uses a delightful phrase when it says:</P>
      <P>The member in charge shall without delay inform an arrested person or cause him to be informed...</P>
      <P>I think the phrase &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; is more precise.  It is more easily understandable to the person who would make a complaint.  I would ask the Minister to consider inserting in section 2(a) in substitution for the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, the phrase &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;.  It is a phrase which is more easily understood by the citizen and it is more precise; it is more suitable for this type of section bearing in mind the nature of the legislation we are talking about and the nature of the section entitled &ldquo;Investigation of Complaints&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to say, with respect, that the comparison Senator Durcan is making with the treatment regulations is not really all that relevant, although I know he is an admirer of the language in the regulations.  The reference to &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; is in the circumstances of somebody being furnished with particular information when taken into custody.  The person who receives it and <Col N="1628" /> the person who gives it are both present at the same time, so that &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; is an entirely appropriate phrase to use in that case.</P>
      <P>I am not inclined to follow Senators O'Leary and Durcan in their remarks about the cumulation of the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  Where an investigating officer is appointed &mdash; ignoring all of the frills for the moment &mdash; he must complete his investigation &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  He is being supervised and he has to produce a report for the chief executive of the board.  The chief executive of the board will be spurred on in his request to the investigating officer by the provision that the report be produced &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  He will want to know and satisfy himself that it has been produced &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  Further, if an investigating officer has only one case to deal with and it is a fairly straightforward case it would be perfectly within the competence of a chief executive to call him in and say &ldquo;Look, superintendent, this is a fairly simple case.  I want a report from you quickly.  It has taken you four weeks and so far I have not seen anything.  That is not &lsquo;as soon as may be&rsquo; in my book. Now, go away and produce your report quickly&rdquo;.  Therefore, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; could in some cases be less than 30 days; in some cases it might be a few days; in other cases it might be longer.  If an investigating officer has, at a given moment, five or six cases on hand it would be unreasonable to tell him that he should complete an investigation at any other time than &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, taking into acount the work he has to hand.  It might also be unreasonable to require him to produce an interim report on each case immediately after the 30 days had elapsed from the beginning.  Each one of these situations would have to be judged, and &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; in each case would have to be judged in the light of the circumstances of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific question raised by Senator O'Leary I cannot illumine him on a judicial interpretation of the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  I would prefer not to venture into it because it was in an area of planning which would not be of <Col N="1629" /> direct relevance to this.  As Senator O'Leary and I both know, the time scales involved in urban planning matters are rather different from the kind we have in mind here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Report Stage I will look at the judicial definition of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and, if necessary, I will share my views with the Minister by way of an amendment.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister like to comment on the point I made about the inclusion of the interim report provision?  An interim report is required.  I do realise that it can be done &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; after the exploration report.  Let us put forward two possibilities, one is that an investigation is completed 32 or 33 days after it started and for one reason or another no interim report is ultimately made.  Will that invalidate the procedure?  I think there will have to be an interim report even though it is actually produced at the same time as the final report.  There will have to be an interim report if the procedure is to be followed.  I would warn the Minister &mdash; this is not objecting to the procedure as such &mdash; that the standard of proof required in this is a sort of <i>quasi</i> criminal standard of proof.  Every step that is required by law to be taken will have to be taken.  When you are talking about the possibility of dismissing somebody from their means of livelihood any step that is missing may be held to invalidate the procedure.  You may be able to say that the person was not prejudiced by the failure to produce an interim report. That would be the defence I would put down if I was on the other side, that there was no prejudice by the failure to produce an interim report.  At the same time I warn the Minister that it is a matter to which he should give some attention.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister explain again to my less than sharp wits what precisely is the objective of subsection (5)?  I understand it to be a device whereby the board, through the chief executive, may carry out investigations themselves without the assistance of the gardaí in circumstances where they think <Col N="1630" /> it is appropriate.  I would like to have my understanding clarified before I start involving the Minister in a discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back first to Senator O'Leary's question I could quite easily conceive a situation in which a report would be produced in the time scale which he mentioned.  The report would begin by saying that it is both an interim and a final report.  That would certainly resolve any of the doubts that he raised. There is no objection to a final report being also the interim report.</P>
      <P>On Senator Brendan Ryan's question, subsection (5) is there to empower the board to request the chief executive himself to order or carry out an investigation if it is not satisfied that the investigation is being carried out properly by the investigating officer first appointed.  It is in the nature of a backstop so that the board can always be assured that if it is not happy about the way an investigation is being carried out it can have the investigation carried out at a higher level and by somebody who is more directly in touch with the specific concerns of the board in the operation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On subsection (8) I cannot reconcile paragraphs (d) and (a). It appears that paragraph (a) details a procedure where in matters which the investigating officer judges to be liable to affect the security of the State he shall refer the matter to the commissioner. Then paragraph (d) says:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the making of arrangements between the Board and the Commissioner whereby, in a particular case or more generally, a matter referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection may be dealt with by some other procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the necessity for paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) given that paragraph (d) says what it says.  I find it objectionable that it would appear that the investigating officer, the commissioner and the Minister together <Col N="1631" /> could decide that certain matters could be withheld from the board.  I can fully accept that there are matters which might be contained in a report which should not be published.  I can fully accept that there are matters that the board itself should not publish.  I cannot accept that it could be the decision of the investigating officer, the commissioner and the Minister as to which matters affect or are liable to affect the security of the State.  We have an unfortunate history in this country of having a fairly broad definition emanating largely from the Minister's own Department of what are matters liable to affect the security of the State.  I believe that the board should have a say, if not the final say, in deciding what is liable to affect the security of the State.  It appears that paragraph (d) does allow for that.  I would like first of all to have my own understanding as to the relationship between paragraph (d) and the remainder of the subsection and then perhaps we can go on from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection makes provision for non-disclosure in the investigating officer's report of information that would otherwise be appropriate for inclusion in it where it would be liable to affect the security of the State or constitute a serious and unjustifiable infringement of the rights of some other person.  As Senator Brendan Ryan has pointed out it is only if, and to the extent that the investigating officer, the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice are in agreement that the disclosure of the information would be liable to have those consequences, that a direction may be given that the information is not to be included in the report.  Where a direction of that kind is given, the fact that it was given must be stated in the report together with such part of the information as the Minister in this case might have authorised to be given for the assistance of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two particular concerns, one relates to dangers to the security of the State, others to dangers to the rights of other persons.  I think Senator Brendan Ryan takes the point about the security <Col N="1632" /> of the State although I note that he has some hesitation about the breadth of the definition that is used.  I do not intend to pursue that matter with the Senator here as it is a more general concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must respect the Senator's rights but I, too, have certain liberties in the matter although I am sure the Senator and I will find a suitable occasion to discuss the matter.  If the Senator wants to pursue that, then I must agree with that.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan did raise the matter at Second Stage.  I stated and I quote from my reply in relation to paragraph (d) of the subsection:</P>
      <P>This provides that nothing in subsection (8) shall prevent arrangements being made between the board and the Commissioner for dealing with cases covered by the subsection in some other way.  For example, the Commissioner could disclose information of the kind that we are concerned with here, that is security information or other information that would place a person at risk, to the chairman of the board alone on a personal basis which it would be dangerous or risky to disclose to all the members of the board. This is a particular reason for having this provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a case where that provision might be invoked would be where information might otherwise have to be disclosed about an informer.  The Senator, while he may feel that here is excessive breadth in the definition of what constitutes matters of national security may also be aware that it is not unknown for senior Garda officers not to be told by subordinates of theirs who the subordinates' informers happen to be if it is believed that <Col N="1633" /> that would either put the informer in some danger or reduce the security that would attach to a particular source of information.  These same concerns are here.</P>
    <P>I would consider it a safeguard that for this provision to be invoked three people have to agree that this is the appropriate procedure, that is, the investigating officer, the commissioner and the Minister for Justice.  It would not necessarily be the case that if it were the name of a person that was not going to be revealed each of those persons would have to know the name but it would be a necessary condition that each of them would have to be persuaded that it was necessary to act in that way.</P>
    <P>There are three different interests involved.  The investigating officer has his own concern with concluding his investigation properly and professionally.  The commissioner has his own concern as being the chief disciplinary officer of the force and the guardian of its good name and the one who is obliged to make sure that it is an effective force and the Minister for Justice who must have regard to the public interest in the matter and whose primary concern must be with the general public interest rather than with the interest of a particular case.  If those three people can agree that it is appropriate to proceed in that way that decision will not be taken lightly nor would it be taken in cases where there was not a very compelling reason for doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that paragraph (d) can only operate if the board and the commissioner agree, that if the board wanted a different procedure to operate and the commissioner declined to agree to that different procedure it could not operate and the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) would then apply?  What the board may wish can be vetoed by the commissioner in the first place &mdash; is that right?</P>

      <P>The Offences Against the State Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act are two Acts which it has been alleged to me frequently have been used indiscriminately for purposes far beyond their intent.  Since the Offences Against the State Act almost by definition relates to matters connected with the security of the State it would be very difficult for any investigating officer of the rank of superintendent to disclose any material connected with certain complaints.  For instance, I know people who have had their premises searched or have been arrested under the Offences Against the State Act, and to endeavour to investigate a complaint like that would be virtually impossible.  When a garda is asked in court why he has suspicions for arresting somebody under the Offences Against the State Act he almost universally claims privilege.  In a situation where there is a wide area of public concern most of the complaints will not be capable of being adequately investigated, or at least the grounds on which a report is drawn up will be incomplete because large areas of the information will be withheld.  I have no doubt that the commissioner, the superintendent and the Minister will have no difficulty in this regard.</P>

      <P>Before the involuntary interruption of the business of the House, Senator Brendan Ryan was making the point that there was a danger that under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act when combined with the provisions of this section it would, in his view, be conceivable that a great deal of information might be withheld from the board under the arrangements we were discussing. <Col N="1635" /> I have to make the point, first of all, that the fact that where this provision is invoked and used has to be notified to the board would, in itself, constitute a substantial disincentive to the frivolous use of the provision.  Secondly, it would not at all be the case that the simple fact that a matter was being considered in the context of either the Offences Against the State Act or the Misuse of Drugs Act would not allow information generally to be withheld from the board in the report of an investigating officer.  The kinds of information are very specifically set out. The grounds on which that procedure may be invoked are very tightly defined. Thirdly, I recall to the Senator that under section 4 of the Bill a wrongful arrest is one the types of procedure about which a complaint can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too political about this.  If the Minister looks back on the list of names of those who have held the office he now holds he would be hard pushed to argue that they were all such models of probity and rectitude that one could assume that their judgment on matters like the security of the State would be superior to the sort of person he has in mind as chairman of the complaints board.  I do not know why the chairman of the complaints board could not be part of the decision making process about these issues.  There is a whiff off this procedure which can actually exclude somebody as eminent as the chairman of the Garda complaints board or the chief executive, or both, from even an assessment of the quality of the information on which these judgments are being made. There are obviously good legal and constitutional reasons why the Minister of the time would be involved.  I do not understand why there is this suggestion that somehow it would be improper or a risk to the security of the State if the chairman or the chief executive were to be drawn into the confidence of the investigating officer, the commission or the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept completely that there are areas where the security of the State could be <Col N="1636" /> threatened and that there are areas where personal privacy could be seriously diminished. The necessity for a provision like this is not at issue.  The question is why should not some part of the complaints procedure personnel be involved in the decision?  Is there some overwhelming reason involving the interest of the State which suggests that these people should not be informed?  I do not understand, if there is.  This is just the natural reaction when the issue of the security of the State comes up, which is, to hold it within the State apparatus and not let it out to anybody else.  If my suggestion were adopted it would be very healthy for everybody and would mitigate the possibility of abuse.</P>
    <P>It is true that improper use of arrest powers is an offence under the schedule that the Minister referred to.  It is also true that it is very difficult even in court, to get a garda to explain why he arrested somebody under the Offences Against the State Act, other than to say that he had reasonable suspicion.  On the grounds for that suspicion, by and large, a garda will claim privilege.  I cannot see us being able to do much in terms of detailing why people are arrested under the Offences Against the State Act beyond a garda saying he has reasonable suspicion, if the garda involved can convince the investigating officer, who, I am sure will convince the commissioner, who I am sure will convince the Minister, that national security is threatened.  Once one gets involved in the Offences Against the State Act one is on very shaky ground, and is liable to be accused of being sympathetic to the aims, if not the activities, of the Provisional IRA.  People can immediately get in on very tricky ground.  It would confirm the view that this was a body which had the power to look at matters and to take decisions about matters, even where the State might feel a conflict of interest.  As it stands, it seems that where the State is happy that something is a threat to national security there is little the complaints board can do about it.  The simple solution would be to involve the chairman of the board in the <Col N="1637" /> process of deciding where national security or questions of personal privacy were so important that they had to be left out of a report.</P>

      <P>Since the Order of Business was made this morning I understand that a message has been received from the Dáil seeking the concurrence of this House in sending the Building Control Bill, 1984 to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation.  It is a matter of extreme regret that if the Dáil wished this Bill to go to that committee over the summer period it did not send a message to this House at an earlier date.  Nevertheless, having expressed that degree of displeasure which I am sure is shared by other Senators, we have to face the fact that the message has arrived and we have to decide how to deal with it.  I have consulted with the main Opposition group and they very kindly indicated that they have no objection to this motion being taken today.  Accordingly I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Order of Business be altered by the addition of item 2 (a) which is a message from the Dáil seeking concurrence in relation to the reference of the Building Control Bill to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation and that that item be taken between item Nos. 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be made clear that the House, in discussing that resolution, is discussing the principle of the Bill.  It is, in effect, a Second Stage discussion and therefore the House is being asked to take Second Stage at very short notice.  There is possibly an hour's debate left on this Bill.  So there would be several hours then before 6 p.m. and I do not anticipate that the bilateral aid programme being taken at 7 p.m. will go on until 10 p.m.  So it should <Col N="1638" /> be possible to have several hours of debate on the principle of the Bill if that is required.</P>
    <P>It is with great regret that I propose this change to the Order of Business.  It is not good procedure and it can only be done because of the understanding of the Opposition.  Perhaps in this respect their understanding and sympathy may be greater than mine.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has over-summarised the remarks he made earlier this morning.  It is not true to state as he did earlier that nobody from the machinery of the Garda complaints process to be set up under the Bill would be involved in the kind of decision to which we are now referring because the investigating officer would be one of the people who would make the kind of decision in question.  The other people involved are the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice who quintessentially &mdash; I am speaking of their office and not necessarily their person &mdash; are the people whose concern is the security of the State.  The chief executive of the board to be set up does not have that specific role, therefore, his involvement would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>It reminds me of a famous case that went to the Supreme Court some years ago about whether the courts or the Executive could decide what was privileged in the case of a court appeal on a matter of planning law.  The inspector's report was at issue.  The Executive claimed that it was a matter of privilege that the Executive could decide not to produce certain information.  The courts quite firmly and unambiguously ruled that it was a matter for the court to decide on these issues.  This has consistently been the position in the courts. You cannot claim that matters are of national security and have that decision taken and arbitrated upon by the people who make the first judgment.  There is no element of independence in assessing what is a matter of national security in this procedure.  All the people involved will, of necessity, have a similar view.  It is unrealistic to presume that a Garda superintendent, a Garda commissioner or a Minister for Justice will disagree <Col N="1641" /> substantially about what constitute matters of national security.  By and large the Minister for Justice takes advice on national security from the Garda Commissioner.  One can presume &mdash; this is not meant as a reflection on anybody &mdash; that senior Garda officers would share the view of the Garda Commissioner. The fact that there is no function for the board as distinct from the investigating officer is regrettable and downgrades the role and function of the appeals board. Nothing is involved other than a reluctance to let go of a traditionally well guarded area of responsibility.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (9), paragraph (c), lines 23 to 25, to delete &ldquo;(other than a member who is the spouse of the member concerned)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (9) provides for a procedure to be established whereby certain questions may be asked of a member of the force pursuant to a direction issued in accordance with the procedure laid down in the subsection.  The original position appears to have been that the exclusion from the possibility of inclusion in a direction of a spouse of a member of the force who is himself or herself a member of the force was not in the original Bill and was inserted by the Dáil.  The purpose of these amendments is to reverse that position and to hear why the Minister acceded to the view that a member of the force who is the spouse of a member who is being investigated should not be liable to answer questions.  These are general questions.  It has to do with conduct alleged in the complaint concerned if it arose in connection with the performance or exercise, or purported performance or exercise, by the member concerned of <Col N="1642" /> functions or powers conferred on him as such member.  It has nothing to do with what he had for his breakfast or the number of times he went on holidays.  It has to do with matters which arise directly out of the performance of his duties as a member.  Why should a member of the force not be expected to conform to directions like that just because they happen to be the spouse of the member in question?  I am aware of the principle of not treating husbands and wives as compellable witnesses against one another in criminal matters although I do not see much future for that principle in the law.  It is not a principle which we should extend to investigations relative to the conduct of a garda arising in connection with the performance of his or her duties.  The purpose of moving these amendments is basically to give the Minister an opportunity to explain why he felt it was necessary to include this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general rule in common law in criminal proceedings that a spouse cannot be compelled to give evidence against the other party to the marriage.  Whatever Senator O'Leary's views about the future of that provision in law may be its existence is a fact.  The Law Reform Commission recently issued a report on this matter.  They recommended that we should continue with this rule.  The rule derives from a concern for the protection of privacy in marriage and took account of the privileged nature of communications between husband and wife.  It is closely associated with the principle that we should avoid self-incrimination. We have spent quite enough time in recent times talking about the closeness of the marital bond to obviate the need for me to go on at any great length about that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a principle that has very wide ramifications in law and in the Constitution as we have recently heard, not that I would necessarily share all of the divagations of some of the statements made in recent weeks on that matter, but that is another day's work.  The power conferred in subsection (9) is likely to be only very rarely used and a situation in which, <Col N="1643" /> were the Senator's amendment to be accepted, the subsection might be invoked against a member who is the spouse of another member would be even rarer.  It could be argued that the invocation of this subsection in those circumstances would be discriminatory towards those members of the force who happened to be married to other members. Their spouses could be compelled to give evidence against them while members married to non-members of the force would not find their spouses so compelled.</P>
    <P>The subsection would apply only where there is no possibility of criminal proceedings. It could be argued that the same considerations that underlie the rule against compellability of spouses as witnesses in criminal proceedings should apply with equal force in disciplinary proceedings where, as indeed as the Senator pointed out on the discussion of earlier sections, testimony could have very serious consequences for the partner to the marriage and where, in fact, the effect on the marriage would be just the same as if the testimony was given in a criminal case.  There is something inherently wrong with using a provision such as this to compel a wife to give evidence against a husband or a husband against a wife. Given the fact that the principle set out there is so solidly embedded in law there would have to be very strong reasons for departing from that principle here, and I am not aware that any strong reasons have been adduced for so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where subsection (9) was invoked.  Since the Senator has invited me to make some general remarks on this, there are one or two that I should like to make because this has been a matter of some discussion.</P>
      <P>We are speaking now in the context of conduct arising in the course of the performance of the member's duty and in the course of that performance only. It is a well-established practice, both in the public service and private employment, that where an employee or servant, or whatever denomination we might chose to describe a person, is alleged to have been involved in conduct that is in some way improper or undesirable, the employer or representative of the employer can ask the employee to explain his or her actions.  That is not just a principle of sound common sense but a matter of common practice.  To make a provision of this kind in the Bill amounts to nothing more than putting members of the force in the same position as other employees in regard to conduct that may be held to have some undesirable aspects to it.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the allegation that has been made in public, that we are singling out members of the Garda Síochána for special treatment in this regard, we are not.  We are applying the same commonsense rule in this context as is applied to other public servants.  Given the context in which this measure is framed, the Garda Complaints Bill and, given the wider context of which that Bill is a part, I think it is perfectly reasonable and highly desirable that we should have a provision of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="1645" /> that exposition and there are two points arising out of it to which I would like to refer.  Getting back to my amendments which have been withdrawn, the Minister now informs the House &mdash; no doubt he is correct in saying so &mdash; that in certain circumstances the member himself may be under an obligation to answer questions in respect of certain complaints relating to matters connected with the performance or exercise of his duties. If he is under that obligation surely the principle of treating husband and wife together should be that the spouse should be in precisely the same position as the other spouse.  The principle of self incrimination to which the Minister referred, and its extension to spouses, relates specifically to a situation where nobody is under an obligation under our legal system to incriminate themselves and therefore we say that because that is the general principle of our law, we will extend it to spouses as well.  That is at least a legitimate exercise of judgement in that regard.  Here we have a rather odd situation that where a direction is issued that the member will be under an obligation to answer the questions but the spouse will not.  That is not the same thing.  If the member was under no obligation, then I can agree with the Minister that the spouse should not be under an obligation either.  Quite rightly the Minister in these limited circumstances, is putting the member under the obligation. Similarly the spouse should not be able to then take advantage of an exemption which has nothing whatsoever to do with the principal person involved.  The Minister's answer to my amendment in that regard falls.  I say that merely to emphasise the thinking behind my amendment, in a more lucid fashion, having got from the Minister the explanation with regard to section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister to my second point on section 7.  The Minister has stated now in this House and he stated on the Second Stage that he is not placing members of the Garda Síochána in any position different from that of other employees, whether they be State or other employees.  I would go further than <Col N="1646" /> the Minister.  I did so in my Second Stage speech and I would like to bring this to his attention again, that is, that he is going further than other employers, that he is giving a greater protection than is given to other employees.  If somebody is working for an ordinary employer and there is an accusation that they fiddled money or did anything which might be a criminal offence and if they are called on to give an explanation to their employer, they cannot say that because there is a possibility they will be charged with an offence, they will not give any such explanation. They have a perfect right to stay silent of course, under the law but the employer has a perfect right in the meantime to ask them would they mind explaining why they are so much short in their cash.  The employer could pursue the matter and indeed suspend or dismiss the person on the basis of that.  What the Minister has done is not to place the members of the Garda Síochána in the same position as other employees but to place them in the more advantageous position whereby if they can raise the suspicion that there is a possibility that an offence has been committed, that is the end of the matter until all the procedure is gone through.  Nobody else is in that position.  They are in that position <i>vis-á-vis</i> criminal investigation, but they are not in that position <i>vis-á-vis</i> their employer and employee relationships. The residual position with regard to the members of the force is that they are in a far superior position after this and have far more protection than the ordinary member of the public dealing with his ordinary employer.  My criticism is that almost any complaint is going to have the possibility of being a criminal offence. The member is almost being invited to refuse to answer questions relative to the complaint.  In those circumstances the investigation of complaints where there is a theoretical possibility of it being a criminal offence, right up to the stage where it comes back to the board, is going to be very difficult.  It is going to render the whole procedure inoperable.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of complaints will contain an element where there is a possibility <Col N="1647" /> of a criminal offence.  Every member asked about that is going to say: &ldquo;there is a possibility that I will be charged with a criminal offence arising from this so I am choosing not to say anything&rdquo;. As a result of that the investigation of complaints is going to be very difficult.  We have gone overboard in protecting what the members of the Garda Síochána and their representative bodies like to call the right of silence, confusing the fact that the ordinary general public may have a right to silence with regard to criminal matters, but do not have any right to silence with regard to civil matters which are being investigated contemporaneously, unless they go to court and establish such a right to silence.  They certainly have no right to silence as normal general practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Senator's view that at the end of the day this provision would be inoperable.  In any particular case a member would know that at the end of the day he could be compelled to provide information.  I do not intend to comment on the Senator's view as to the position in which this places members of the Garda Síochána.  I have given the House my views on that today and on previous occasions.  I did say to the Senator at an earlier stage that I would follow in the same direction as the Senator but in his wake on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first part of it, the Senator in referring back to my previous remarks and my reference to the privilege against self incrimination, is actually standing my argument a little on its head. The first point I made was that it was a general rule that spouses were not compellable and that that rule originated as a protection for the privacy of marriage. In addition to that it was closely associated with the privilege against self incrimination. I did not posit the privilege against self incrimination as the only or even the main reason for this rule.  So to the extent that the Senator's argument depends on that ground to take issue with my position, it is not well founded.  The basic consideration here is the protection <Col N="1648" /> of the privacy of marriage.  That is a sufficient ground for taking this line on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I can differ with the Minister's interpretation.  I would like to make one brief comment. There was an amendment in the Dáil which refers to subsection 9(e) whereby a requirement was inserted in that paragraph, that before the investigating officer concerned can bring into operation the requirement to answer questions, he must inform the member in writing.  I support that.  I think it is correct and proper.  If it had not been there I would have proposed it.  However, it does show how well members of the force appreciate the importance of things being done in writing where their own interests are at stake and they are right.  But I think the Minister could learn from that that there are other cases such as the one we spoke about this morning where the members themselves as well as other people need to be protected by things being put in writing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9(2) states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the function of a tribunal to decide in relation to a matter referred to it as aforesaid&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the member concerned has not been in breach of discipline, or</P>
      <P>(b)  that such member has been in breach of discipline as alleged, or</P>
      <P>(c)  that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline.</P>
      <P>Then it goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>provided that a decision under paragraph (c) of this subsection shall not be made unless the tribunal is satisfied that the other breach concerned is less serious than the breach alleged (that <Col N="1649" /> is, that it is one which in the circumstances of the particular case merits disciplinary action of a less serious nature than that warranted by the breach alleged) and that such a decision would not be unfair to the member concerned having regard to the fact that the other breach concerned is not the breach that was alleged.</P>
    <P>This is a rather serious provision and one which could turn out to be most unfair to the person who is charged in spite of the fact that the section says that the decision would not be unfair to the member.  That proviso could be read in two ways.  It could be read in the sense that the disciplinary action would be less serious than that in relation to the actual charge against the member in the first place.  But it could be that even though in the long run the member would not be subject to such a serious disciplinary action he might in fact, be found guilty of something which he would regard as being very serious.</P>
    <P>I will take an example which may not be very suitable but, which, nevertheless, will illustrate the situation.  A person could be charged with drunken driving. His main defence would be that he was not driving the car at all.  He would pay almost no attention to the drunken aspect of the charge because he felt that he had a complete defence on the basis that he was not driving.  If you had a situation of that kind, in the end the tribunal would say they were satisfied that he was not driving but that he was drunk.  The member concerned would say: &ldquo;I never devoted any attention to this question of whether I was drunk because I thought I had a complete defence on the other count, but I certainly object most strenuously to the finding by the tribunal that I was drunk at the time and that I did not even have an opportunity to defend myself on that basis.&rdquo;  That may not be a very suitable illustration but I can see circumstances where somebody at the end of the day would find himself in the situation that while the actual disciplinary action would be quite mild, he would be found guilty of something which he never <Col N="1650" /> devoted his mind to, never defended himself against.  He would be found guilty of a breach of discipline in relation to something he did not pay much attention to.  This is a rather dangerous proviso. The saving clause, that such a decision would not be unfair to the member concerned, could be interpreted as meaning merely that because the disciplinary action was much milder, it would be unfair to him.  But the member concerned might consider it to be quite unfair because he would, inadvertently, find himself guilty of a breach that he never defended himself against or paid much attention to.  I think this is dangerous.  It might occur only rarely but we should not be very satisfied with such a proviso.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the point Senator Eoin Ryan is making, we should be conscious of the fact that we are dealing with a Bill which is intended to set up a procedure for dealing with complaints made against the Garda by members of the general public.  That should colour our view on this.  In the event that there is conduct about which a complaint is made I would suspect &mdash; of course, both the Senator and I are in the dark on this until we see how it works out in practice &mdash; that if there are grounds in the complaint for the investigation of several different possible breaches, that each one would and should be taken on its own merit.  To that extent it would tend to be a fairly rare case in which this would happen.</P>
      <P>However, I would have to point out that a provision similar to this has been in the Garda Discipline Regulations since 1971.  I am informed that it was put in at the request of the Garda representative side.  It has been in the regulations since 1971 and a similar provision is in the revised regulations which have been discussed recently with the Garda and there has been no objection to it.  I take the point that that might be regarded by the House as nothing more than a useful and interesting piece of information which need not deflect the House from examining the issue before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the fact that we are talking about <Col N="1651" /> complaints by members of the public against the Garda, it is desirable that we ensure that the procedure which is there is one which not only allows but, as far as possible, obliges the tribunal to look at each and every aspect of any complaint which might be made.  The provision itself produces a situation in which the tribunal cannot decide that a member is guilty of a breach of discipline other than the one which is alleged unless it is satisfied that that other breach is less serious than the breach alleged.  As the Senator has pointed out that decision would not be unfair to the member concerned.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal finds evidence that the member in question might be guilty of a breach that is more serious than that which is alleged it would not have the power under this provision to proceed and impose a heavier penalty in respect of that breach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does mean that he may be found guilty of a breach with which he has not been charged, for which he has no reason to defend himself against, because as I understand it, this breach would not have been mentioned when the member was brought before the tribunal. I can understand the situation where, for example, people are charged with dangerous driving.  It is a fairly frequent occurrence that they are not found guilty of dangerous driving but are found guilty of careless driving.  The whole conduct of the case would be in relation to how the person drove the car and in these circumstances the lesser breach would have necessarily been part of the proceedings and the person would have been defending himself against the way in which he drove the car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the kind of proceedings we are talking of, the tribunal would say that the member concerned was not in breach of discipline in relation to the matter before the tribunal but that they are going to find them guilty of something else, something entirely different that happened to arise in the course of the proceedings. At the end of the day the disciplinary action is going to be less than <Col N="1652" /> it would have been if he had been found guilty of the first breach but it could be in some area completely different and one which the member might have very strong feelings about.  He might in fact be much more sensitive and much more concerned about being found guilty of a lesser offence because it would be something that he would regard as being more serious from the point of view of his character and so on even though the disciplinary action was less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand in my own simple logic how anybody can be sent before a tribunal or have a tribunal investigate complaints made against him and that in the course of the proceedings it is possible to find that they are not guilty of either of the two main offences before the court but can be found to be in breach of discpline, something they are not being charged with.  It defies my simple primary school logic and also my army experience in terms of tribunals or court martials.  It appears to be inconsistent with the way a normal criminal would be treated in court.  I am doubtful that, in the course of evidence in any court, if a judge discovered by inference from the charges in the court that the man was guilty of something else, he would then proceed to punish him for that other offence. It is not a direct analogy but there is some sort of an analogy there.  It is a bit of a puzzle to me.  It makes it more difficult for me to understand.  I want to see people treated properly while in custody.  I want to see the Garda answering for their misdemeanours but we are dealing with a force and we have to deal with the question of their morale and their rights.  They have rights the same as anyone else.  They are citizens with a vote.  If, for example, anyone stands in the way of a policemen to try to hinder him from making an arrest in an incident involving a breach of the peace he is justified in taking that person into custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that something may happen where it may be necessary to decide whether a member was guilty of a certain breach of discipline or guilty of a <Col N="1653" /> breach of discipline as alleged.  I do not understand the &ldquo;or&rdquo; in that context.  When you remember that the Garda are also entitled to arrest persons who obviously were about to commit breaches of the peace the chances are they would never be out of trouble if such cases were to be dealt with by the tribunal.  It would not be a double jeopardy situation but the member would not only be on trial for what is before the tribunal but would actually be on trial for charges that had not been made against him and in the course of events it might emerge that there was another breach of discipline.  It defies my primary school logic to see how this question can be dealt with in that way.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the question here of a lesser discipline, but there is always a danger of something arising that would warrant a greater punitive measure and when we think of what can happen to a garda arising out of the proceedings of the tribunal, we realise that we are dealing with a very serious matter.  We are talking about his job, about his being dismissed or forced into retirement.  We are talking about his being given the option to resign to save his character in certain circumstances.  We are talking about reducing him in rank, about taking some of his power away though the proceedings might only end up with a reprimand or a caution.  In effect we are covering a very wide area where a member can be disciplined for something that he is not even charged with.</P>
    <P>As distinct from many other citizens in modern day society, the garda is liable to be dealing with for example, the whole question of communications, crowd control, murder, traffic fatalities, offences against the State or offences against property, aggravated robbery, burglary, arson and so on.  Things are liable to go wrong because of the circumstances this person finds himself in and suddenly, through no fault of his own, he is caught out on a disciplinary matter.  On the other hand if it was a serious offence he would be entitled to be charged separately for it anyway.  I am very concerned on that matter.  I am concerned that people be <Col N="1654" /> treated properly when they are detained. I am very concerned that the laws are applied properly when the powers of arrest are to be exercised.  I am very concerned that all of the legal procedures when dealing with a person in custody or in taking a person into custody are handled properly.  I am also concerned for the citizen who has to uphold the law, that he would not be placed in a situation where he would be at a disadvantage compared with any other member of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan has raised a very interesting point.  Section 2 of this Bill follows very closely on section 9(1).  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>the chief executive shall determine the particular breach or breaches of discipline to be alleged against the member...</P>
      <P>the chief executive shall notify each member of the tribunal of the breach or breaches of discipline aforesaid and...</P>
      <P>the tribunal shall hold an inquiry into the matter unless the conduct alleged in the complaint concerned, or conduct which is in substance the same, is admitted by the member concerned.</P>
      <P>That last paragraph is the most important.</P>
      <P>The tribunal, therefore, has to examine a particular breach of discipline which I presume is a breach of discipline specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill, the contents of which are specific.  We then move on to subsection (2)(c) which reads:</P>
      <P>that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline:</P>
      <P>Provided that a decision under paragraph (c) of this subsection shall not be made unless the tribunal is satisfied that the other breach concerned is less serious than the breach alleged ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is less serious?  We are talking about breaches of discipline as specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  It is possible that a member could be charged with a breach of paragraph 6 of the Fourth <Col N="1655" /> Schedule, that is, &ldquo;misuse of money or property in the custody of the Garda Síochána belonging to a member of the public&rdquo; and it may happen that the tribunal would hold that a charge under that paragraph would not stand.  But if the member is in the situation whereby a breach of discipline can be held in respect of one of the other paragraphs specified in the Fourth Schedule, for instance, 2 (a)(i) or 3 or, indeed, 4, it leaves the matter very open ended.  I think there is a certain lack of logic in this subsection 2.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Eoin Ryan is a reasonable point.  It is reasonable in the sense that if a member appears before a tribunal, he does so on the basis of a specific charge.  The member presumably is there or is represented to meet that specific charge and that charge relates to a specific breach of discipline as specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind subsection (2) that member can now find himself in a position where he can be found guilty of a whole range of breaches of discipline specified in the Fourth Schedule and in respect of which he is not charged.  I must say that it caused me a certain amount of worry.  The other question that arises in relation to the subsection is the determination of what is a less serious nature and that, again, is another difficult matter.  I must say for the reasons expressed by previous speakers, I am not altogether happy with subsection (2) as it stands.</P>

      <P>I must say to Senator Durcan how pleased I am that the debate is having its proper function in drawing his attention to things about which he feels less happy than he did, perhaps, before the debate began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can put Senator Harte's mind at rest about one particular aspect of this provision.  Senator Harte appears to fear that there was always the danger that a more punitive measure would be involved than was originally thought.  That is not the case because the provision makes it perfectly clear that the tribunal cannot <Col N="1656" /> decide that a member is guilty of a breach of discipline other than the one alleged unless it is a less serious breach of discipline so that there is no question of any possibility of a more punitive measure being the outcome.</P>
    <P>I have to say to Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Durcan that they should not find in this measure any enormous departure from the practice in our courts in terms of the kind of verdicts that can be made on foot of specific charges.  Senator Ryan did himself mention one case which is fairly common where people are charged with drunken driving and are convicted of careless driving.  People are frequently charged with dangerous driving and convicted of careless driving.  People are periodically charged with murder and convicted of manslaughter.  People are frequently charged with a particular kind of assault and convicted of a less serious kind of assault.</P>
    <P>There is no huge departure from that kind of practice involved here.  If, for example, a complaint against a member were being investigated which alleged abuse of authority on the part of the member, for instance, oppressive conduct towards a member of the public, it is perfectly conceivable that the tribunal investigating would conclude that the member was not guilty of abuse of authority or oppressive conduct but was guilty, for example, of discourtesy, that is, failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public.</P>
    <P>That would not be entirely out of keeping. It would be perfectly in line with the kind of practice in the courts that I mentioned a moment ago.  If, on the other hand, during the course of an investigation into an allegation that a member acted oppressively, that he, for example, used unnecessary violence towards any person, it emerged that some other offence could be held to have been committed by the member, then if there was not a complaint about that, it would be perfectly open to the Garda Síochána authories in the framework of their own discipline regulations to take the matter up separately.  It would be separately.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I do not think there <Col N="1657" /> is, in comparison to our normal practice in the courts any particular innovation here nor do I think that the House should have any great difficulty in deciding that, perhaps, one kind of breach of discipline is less serious than another.  Specifically, I would say it is very clear that if an allegation of oppressive conduct were made and a member were to be investigated and found guilty of discourtesy, I would think that oppressive conduct of the kinds set out in the schedule would be a far more serious offence than discourtesy.  Again, there is not a hugh innovation here.  As I said at the beginning in relation to Senator Harte's question, the tribunal cannot decide that a member is guilty of a breach other than that alleged unless it is a less serious breach.</P>
    <P>On a question of fairness, I point out to the House that it is very clear that the tribunal could always be made amendable to a court if it were held that there was a breach of natural justice involved. Finally, and in any case if a member felt that he had been hard done by being found guilty of a less serious breach than the one that was alleged against him, with a less punitive sanction at the end of it, if he felt aggrieved by that or, or indeed, felt aggrieved at all, there is an appeal provision built into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be in a sense quite as serious but there is another aspect of this that I think makes this subsection what should be quite irrelevant because what could be done under this is that the member concerned could be found guilty of a breach of discipline that had literally nothing whatsoever to do with the complaint made by the member of the public.  This Bill is to deal specifically with complaints made by the public.  If they, for one reason or another, feel they have been imposed upon in some way or that something has been done by the Garda that should not have been done, at the end of the day a garda can be found guilty of a breach of discipline that has literally nothing whatever to do with the complaint made.  The garda, if he re-establishes good relationships <Col N="1658" /> with the member of the public concerned, can say, &ldquo;as a result of your complaint I was found to be guilty of such and such a breach of discipline and the member of the public could say &ldquo;the law is an ass because I had no complaint whatsoever about that aspect of your behaviour, I complained about something different altogether and this just does not make any sense&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the qualification attaching to (c) but, at the same time, in the long run it comes down to the fact that he can be found guilty of something that he is not actually charged with, and on the basis of that some type of disciplinary action can be taken against him, even if it is less serious, less damaging than the others, he can probably suffer.  I do not know how far the procedure can go.  This is not clear.  If the tribunal decide that the allegations that were made against him are not substantiated but that something less of a disciplinary nature is involved, what sort of punishment is to be applied?  Will it result in a reduction in rank?  Will it involve a loss of pay?  Is it only a reprimand?  Is it only a caution?  Where does it go to? Where is the clarity?  Where does it stop? Where does it start?  There are five or six levels of punishment and if the tribunal decide that it is a less grave infringement or breach of discipline than was alleged, what punishment fits that?  If, in fact punishment attaches to it, I still believe that this is not the way things should happen. The fact is that he is to be punsihed for something.  Even a reprimand or a caution is a punishment.  The person is going to be punsihed for something he is not, in fact, actually charged with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know on the surface it looks very well for a tribunal to sit and consider allegations, or perhaps one allegation, and to say: &ldquo;he is not really guilty of that but we have to find him guilty of something and that will be a lesser offence. Therefore, we will find him guilty of that less offence.  The other one cannot be established.&rdquo;  As a result of finding him guilty of the lesser one, the punishment, too, will be less but, at the same time, it <Col N="1659" /> is punishment for something that he has not been charged with.  So I suppose, on the surface, it looks just.  I hope the Minister will prove to me that it is a just way of going about it.  On the other hand, my simple logic does not help me to understand how one can be found guilty of something that one is not actually charged with and arising out of that that there is actually some sort of punishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the problem here is that the waters are becoming muddied. They are becoming muddied because there is an interlinking between the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations, 1971, which deal with internal inquiries on the one hand, and the complaints Bill which will deal with complaints by members of the public on the other hand. It is interesting to note that a lot of the contents of the Bill we are discussing follow very closely the contents of the 1971 discipline regulations.  While we accept that the regulations in the Bill are for two different purposes they do mirror one another in terms of the language used and some of the procedures followed. Number 16 of the 1971 regulations provide that the inquiry shall decide that the member concerned has not been in breach of discipline, secondly, that such member has been in breach of discipline as alleged or, thirdly, that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline. One is forced to the conclusion that, perhaps, that is an appropriate matter to include in internal regulations <Col N="1660" /> which deal with internal breaches of discipline and which will be determined by the Garda themselves.</P>
      <P>Those regulations which will shortly be replaced also I understand, specify in the Schedule to them the types of breaches of discipline to which they apply.  It may be appropriate, to have a provision of that nature in the internal regulations where the member is purely subject to the rules and regulations of the force of which he is a member and the breach of discipline is determined within that force. On the other hand, the Bill deals with something which is based on a complaint by a member of the public, a complaint which is made in the manner specified in this Bill and which is processed in the manner specified in this Bill.  Is it right, therefore, that a complaint made by a member of the public in relation to a particular breach of discipline specified in the Fourth Schedule of this Bill should, in fact, leave the member open to conviction, as it were, in respect of another breach of discipline?  I see the two situations as being different and I am not altogether satisfied, therefore, that paragraph (c) is appropriate for inclusion in a Bill which deals with complaints by members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it a shade disingenuous of Senator Durcan to suggest that a provision of this kind may be suitable for the internal disciplinary regulations of the Garda but is not suitable in relation to complaints made by the general public, because what Senator Durcan would be suggesting there is that a fairly severe rule is perfectly in order when we are talking about internal discipline in the Garda but is not perfectly in order when we are talking about complaints made against gardaí by members of the general public.  I do not accept that point of view and I have made the point earlier in this debate and in the other House that members of the Garda have a right, as, indeed, have members of the public generally, to be treated in the same way as any other citizen against whom an offence is alleged.  I cannot see any reason there for treating them differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> Senator Harte still has some worries about the appropriateness of this provision and Senator Durcan has noted that the Bill follows the 1971 disciplinary regulations. For Senator Harte's benefit I should repeat that, that a very similar provision has been in the Garda Discipline Regulations since 1971.  It was inserted I am told &mdash; I was not involved in it then &mdash; at the request of the Garda representative organisations at the time. A similar provision is in the new discipline regulations which have been negotited recently with the Garda.  Therefore, so far as that goes there is no difficulty about this provision from the point of view of the Garda representative organisations. I must say, and I would ask the House to think about the matter on these lines, it seems to me to be perfectly reasonable and legitimate that we should have a provision of this kind.  Section 9 (2)(c) provides:</P>
    <P>It shall be the function of a tribunal to decide in relation to a matter referred to it as aforesaid &mdash; (c) that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline...</P>
    <P>Perhaps, it was a slip of the tongue on Senator Harte's part that he suggested that as long as there was a complaint against a member of the Garda Síochána the tribunal find that even though it appeared he was not guilty of the conduct alleged against him, they had to find him guilty of something.  I do not think that is the way the tribunal would go about its work.  If it were, the tribunal would deserve instantly to be dismissed.  If, following the provision of article 9(2)(c), the tribunal finds that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline, it would seem to me to be not very desirable at all that the tribunal should say to the member concerned: &ldquo;the following allegation has been made against you.  We find that you are not guilty of that alleged breach of discipline.  We find that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline but, since no specific allegation has been made against you for that breach of discipline, we are going to ignore it.  We will drop the whole thing <Col N="1662" /> and wait around until maybe some member of the public comes along and makes that allegation against you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it seems to me also to be reasonable and desirable that if the tribunal are faced with an allegation that a particular member of the Garda used unnecessary violence towards any person with whom he is brought into contact in the execution or purported execution of his duty and find on investigation, that he did not use unnecessary violence but that the facts established indicated quite clearly that he was guilty of discourtesy, that is to say, failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public, they should say so to him.  They should say: &ldquo;we find you not guilty of using unnecessary violence but we do find that in this particular case you acted with insufficient courtesy towards a member of the public and we, therefore, find you guilty of a less serious breach of discipline. While you are not guilty of the first, which would have carried a particular penalty, we find that you are guilty of the second, which carries a lesser penalty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems that is something both necessary and desirable in the interests of the general public and of good discipline and practice among the Garda.  It is to bring that about that this provision is in this Bill.  It was to bring that about that a similar provision was in the 1971 Discipline Regulations and it is to bring that about where no member of the public is complaining that the same provision is in the new Discipline Regulations that have been discussed and agreed with the Garda representative organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record, if it came across that I had doubts that the tribunal would concoct something, that that was not my intention. What I was concerned about was that if one charge was there and there was a possibility of exonerating the person on it, that that possibility should be taken up even though some evidence might be there that he was guilty of a lesser charge and arising out of that he would get a punishment.  Having listened to the Minister's <Col N="1663" /> explanation about the 1971 regulations and what the Garda have agreed, I accept the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one more brief remark.  I am sure Senator Eoin Ryan will forgive me for jumping in ahead of him on this.  I neglected to say at the conclusion of my last remark that we should also look at it from the point of view of a member of the public.  If there is a member of the public who believes &mdash; and I will take the same example that I used earlier on &mdash; that a garda used unnecessary violence towards somebody present while there is some unruly behaviour going on in a street demonstration, for example, by pushing him too roughly out of the way in an attempt to clear the street and made that allegation and complaint and had it investigated, that person, who might feel very strongly that the garda had done something wrong could very well feel aggrieved.  This is one of the things we want to deal with.</P>
      <P>If the only answer that came back from the tribunal was: &ldquo;we have examined this case and we find the garda did not use unnecessary violence&rdquo;, the person might say on reflection: &ldquo;well, maybe he did not use unnecessary violence towards me but he could have been a bit more polite and considerate in the way he dealt with me&rdquo;.  That person is more likely to understand that justice has been done and that his case was properly examined if &mdash; and I say &ldquo;if&rdquo; because one does not know &mdash; the answer that he got back was that the garda had been cleared of the charge and he would have to be cleared of each specific charge if it is not found against him.  If the answer came back: &ldquo;we found that the garda did not use unnecessary violence towards you but we found him guilty of discourtesy and he is being reprimanded accordingly or will have his ears pinned back one way or another&rdquo;.  That would explain far better to the general public that a reasonable and thorough view was being taken of the complaints made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making <Col N="1664" /> the convenient assumption that the breach of discipline found under sub-paragraph (c) would always be one of the same nature as the breach of discipline with which he is charged.  He has given the kind of examples which I gave myself in regard to dangerous driving and careless driving.  The trouble about it is that it is not under this section as it now stands.  It is not necessarily the case at all.  It may be completely different from the breach of discipline with which he is charged.  That being the case, it seems to me that this is undesirable because you end with a situation in which a Bill is designed and drawn up to deal with complaints from the public and you are going to find a member is found guilty of a breach of discipline in regard to something that the member of the public never complained about, is totally different as far as he is concerned.  At the end of the day he would not understand what happened.  He would say: &ldquo;this has nothing to do with my complaint.  I initiated this procedure and at the end of the day I find that the member has been found guilty of a breach of discipline that has nothing whatsoever to do with the complaint I made&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the same reason, if the breach of discipline of which the member is found guilty has nothing to do with the complaint against him, then it is more than likely that he would not have had the opportunity of defending himself against it because it was something completely different.  He would not be conscious that that is the problem and the case he has to meet.  He would not be in a position to defend himself, merely to say that it is going to be a lesser fine.  He would, in fact, not be able to defend himself.  He might regard the breach of discipline found against him to be thoroughly objectionable even though the fine might not be very serious.  It certainly could be argued and, possibly will be argued, that this is a breach of natural justice that he should be found guilty of a breach of discipline which he was not aware was being alleged against him and of which he had no opportunity of defending himself. For that reason this subsection which <Col N="1665" /> from one point of view seems to be reasonable enough and a common sense type of thing to put in, in certain circumstances it could be both irrelevant for the purposes of the Bill and very serious and contrary to natural justice as far as the member is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not starting off on the assumption that other charges would always be of the same nature as the original allegation.  I will go along with Senator Eoin Ryan to this extent that it is a simplifying assumption for the purpose of facilitating the exposition.  The principle remains the same because we are dealing with the requirement for this to happen under section 9(2) that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to section 9(l)(a) which provides that the chief executive shall determine the particular breach or breaches of discipline to be alleged against the member concerned before the tribunal.  The chief executive is the one who receives the complaint, pronounces on its admissibility and then formulates the breach which is to be alleged against a member.  Without a provision of this kind, there would always be a temptation on the part of the chief executive to allege a number of different breaches against the possibility that a particular one might not stick but that if they were formulated in a different way it might stick, and that is not, I think the House will agree, an entirely unkown situation.  It is undesirable.  I will come back to the point that for this to happen &mdash; the matter that the Senators are worried about &mdash; requires that the facts established constitute another breach of discipline.  As I said earlier on as regards the question of fairness, that is always something that can be referred to a court. It is equally something that would properly be the subject of discussion under the appeal procedure that is provided for in the Bill, a procedure which has been in existence since 1971.  As far as I am aware, it has not caused any particular problems or allegations of unfairness in practice, and unless it is demonstrated to <Col N="1666" /> the contrary, it is one that we should continue in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome section 9(3) and (4) in so far as they indicate a departure from the procedure specified in the 1971 regulations.  In the 1971 regulations, where a breach of discipline is found by an inquiry established under the regulations, the matter is referred to the Commissioner of the Garda for the purpose of determining what sanction should be imposed.  Under this Bill the tribunal who determines whether or not there was a breach of discipline will also decide the disciplinary action to be taken, and I welcome this.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the new disciplinary regulations, the new internal regulations, in so far as they deal with the imposition of a penalty will provide that the tribunal who determine whether or not there was a breach of discipline will also impose the penalty rather than having the matter referred to the commissioner as heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small matter to which I would like to refer and in referring to it I would like to briefly say that subsection (4)(b) is a welcome addition to the options which are available.  As a member of the Garda Síochána got older and nearer to retirement there was an undoubted temptation &mdash; I am not saying whether it was ever yielded to or not &mdash; in respect of a small breach of discipline not to bring about a situation where that person would leave the benefit of a livelihood and pension rights which he had accumulated over a long period of time.  The insertion of subsection (4)(b) which was inserted during the debate in the other House is welcome because it means that particularly older members of the force can be dealt with in a more humane fashion and that is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also included in an amendment in the other House was subsection (5) which, like so much of this Bill, is a repetition of what is already in the disciplinary regulations. It is an unfortunate limitation on the range of disciplinary actions which <Col N="1667" /> should be available.  It does two things: it limits the amount of any reduction of pay to four weeks and effectively says that when the amount of money to be deducted is determined no deduction in respect of any one period should represent more than 10 per cent of that, say, month's pay.  In other words, if four weeks pay is to be deducted in total it should be done in sums, any one of which do not exceed 10 per cent of the member's pay.  I understand that to be the meaning of the section.</P>
    <P>There is not sufficient flexibility in the matter of the reduction of the pay in limiting it to four weeks.  Many circumstances could arise which would fall somewhere between the reprimand and the reduction in rank and there is a need for a range of options with regard to disciplinary actions within those two sections which needs to be catered for.  To permanently reduce a member of the Garda Síochána's salary and status in one thing; to reprimand him is obviously more serious than a caution and is the other extreme and tending towards smaller disciplinary action.  In between the two of those the one available disciplinary action is a reduction in pay and to limit that to four weeks &mdash; I am not concerned about the 10 per cent element &mdash; is not sufficient.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation for the reintroduction of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>So that you are not forced by the circumstances to go to a more severe penalty.  If you give very cut and dried penalties you are forced then either to reprimand, which would appear to be very small, or to reduce in rank, which would be the next highest one.  I want something in between which I think would apply to a lot of the complaints.</P>

    <Col N="1668" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look at the sanctions set out here, (a) is unambiguous dismissal; (b) a requirement to retire or resign &mdash; a very useful addition for the reasons the Senator has outlined; (c) reduction to such other rank in the Garda Síochána as the tribunal may determine. That becomes more flexible the higher the rank the member starts at.  For a member of ordinary garda rank, there is no possibility of using that.  For a member who has reached the rank of sergeant there is only one reduction in rank that can be brought about and that is part of the reason why there should be a provision for a reduction in pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point that a reduction in rank is also a reduction in pay; otherwise there would be very little sense in having different ranks.  Obviously, the higher up in rank the member goes the more flexible the sanction at (c) becomes.  For a member or ordinary garda rank or sergeant rank it becomes more important to have another route that can be followed. A reduction in pay of such amount and for such period as the tribunal may determine subject to the qualification in subsection (5) then becomes the matter of discussion.  What flexibility is there?  A reduction in pay of four weeks can be a considerable amount of money.  In typical cases that could be an amount upwards of £1,000, which is a sizeable amount of money.  The higher the rank the greater the sum becomes.  At some levels in the force a reduction in pay of the equivalent of four weeks pay would certainly, if applied as a fine in a court, be regarded as a very stiff penalty, for example, if it was brought to the level of four weeks it could very often far exceed the fine which would be imposed in the District Court for a drunken driving charge.  That is only one example among many.  A reduction in pay of up to four weeks &mdash; leaving aside the 10 per cent provision which is not in dispute &mdash; can amount to quite a sizeable sum and the further on in service and the further up in rank the bigger it becomes when compared with the penalties imposed otherwise through our courts system, sums which fairly often are a matter of petition to the Minister <Col N="1669" /> for Justice for mitigation of the fine on ground of hardship or other grounds.  In fact, there is a wide margin of variation in response that would be available by going as far as four weeks pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made my case for me by reminding me that of course the rank of an ordinary garda cannot be reduced.  Many of the complaints may relate to gardaí in their late twenties or early thirties who have little or no service in the force.  The only option open then will be dismissal from the force and the requirement to resign or retire will not apply.  One way or the other, whether you require a person to resign or dismiss him or her it is almost the same thing except in terms of personal status.  The only other option available between these and a reprimand is a reduction in pay.  Did the Minister consider whether suspension should be considered as an appropriate penalty?  It is in order to increase the range of options that I put it to the Minister that there appears to be a very big gap and very little flexibility between reprimanding somebody and getting him out altogether. There is only one thing you could do, fine him up to four weeks' wages. This seems to be unnecessarily restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may feel it is unnecessarily restrictive.  Even for a young garda up to four weeks wages can constitute a sum of upwards of £1,000. If that is the alternative to contenting oneself with the reprimanding him there is a fairly wide range of penalties that can be applied.  If you are talking about a garda in his late twenties and you are looking at the difference between not fining him but simply reprimanding him and taking anything up to £800 or £1,000 from him by way of a deduction from his salary, it leaves a fairly wide range over which displeasure can be indicated to him.</P>

There is a fine under another name but of a very limited nature, one which is limited further by subsection (5).

      <P>I merely want to say to the Minister that my failure to put down an amendment to this section is not because I have changed my mind and that the parliamentary draftsman has won the battle concerning the disqualification for membership of various quangos and other bodies set up under the authority of the House of the Oireachtas of people who are nominated as candidates for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the special circumstances of this body, which is a quasi-judicial body, I do not mind the question of candidature inserted.  It is not a defeat; I have to agree with him for once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 30, after line 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.  Prohibited spare time activities, that is to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  identifying actively or publicly with a political party,</P>
      <P>(b)  behaving in relation to political matters in such a manner and in such circumstances as to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties,</P>
      <P>(c)  engaging (whether for reward of otherwise) in any activity which, though mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) or (b), is likely to interfere with proper discharge of duties, as being likely, to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties or as being, for good and stated reasons, inappropriate for members of the Garda Síochána to engage in.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new paragraph into the Fourth Schedule of the Bill.  The new paragraph which I seek to insert is as specified on the amendment sheet but there is one error in paragraph (c).  I have drawn the error to the attention of the Minister's officials.  After the word &ldquo;though&rdquo; the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; should be inserted.  The words I seek to insert are therefore as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.  Prohibited spare time activities, that is to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  identifying actively or publicly with a political party,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  behaving in relation to political <Col N="1672" /> matters in such a manner and in such circumstances as to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties,</P>
    <P>(c)  engaging (whether for reward of otherwise) in any activity which, though not mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) or (b), is likely to interfere with proper discharge of duties, as being likely to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties or as being, for good and stated reasons, inappropriate for members of the Garda Síochána to engage in.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations 1971.  Regulation No. 6 provides that:</P>
    <P>An act or omission described at a reference number in the Schedule shall be a breach of discipline and &ldquo;in breach of discipline&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the 1971 regulations includes a paragraph identical to the paragraph which I now seek to have inserted in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  The Schedule to the 1971 regulations also includes many other paragraphs which are included in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill as being breaches of discipline within the terms of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill 1985.</P>
    <P>The basis of my proceeding with this amendment is that I believe, first, that gardai increasingly, unfortunately, are engaging in politics and political activities at various levels and in various ways. This is something to be regretted.  It is something which happens within all political parties.  It is happening increasingly without regard to caution or propriety. The question is whether an engagement of that kind by a garda is appropriate for internal discipline regulations or whether it is a matter which is appropriate for the complaints Bill.  Activity of this nature by a member of the force is a matter which should be more properly dealt with by <Col N="1673" /> the Garda Complaints Board or by a tribunal established by such a board rather than by an internal inquiry established by the authority of the commissioner.  My reason for saying that is that there is a belief that there is a political complexion within the higher ranks of the Garda Síochána.  There is a belief that the senior ranks of the Garda Síochána are held by people who have very definite political views.  The question arises as to whether it is appropriate that alleged activity of this nature should therefore be dealt with within an internal police procedure or whether it should be dealt with by an independent complaints tribunal.  I believe it is something which is appropriate for an independent complaints tribunal.  I am surprised to find that this matter was not included in the Fourth Schedule.  Perhaps it can be suggested that if a member of the Garda engages in activity of the nature I mentioned it is possible that he may be charged under the Fourth Schedule, but I believe that it should be specifically stated.  I would ask the Minister if he would consider this amendment for the reasons mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would have the effect of adding prohibited spare time activities to the list of conduct set out in the Fourth Schedule which would constitute a breach of discipline.  There is, as Senator Durcan has pointed out, a provision in the Garda Discipline Regulations which specifically prohibits a member from active involvement in politics and confers on the Garda Commissioner the power to prohibit members from engaging in other activities which he considers to be inconsistent with their position.  Apart from the prohibition on political activity commissioners have prohibited some 12 other areas of activity, and involvement in them by a member constitutes a breach of the regulations. I do not intend to detain the House with these other areas but there are 12 other areas of activity which have already been specified by commissioners over the years as being areas in which activity would constitute a breach of <Col N="1674" /> discipline by members of the Garda force.  When the Fourth Schedule to this Bill was being drafted a decision was made to include in it only conduct which would be likely directly to concern or affect the general public and to leave to the Discipline Regulations conduct which would be more relevant to internal Garda disciplinary procedures.  It was considered that prohibitive spare time activity fell into that category and they were therefore not included in the Fourth Schedule.</P>
      <P>The conduct that is set out in the Fourth Schedule, I think the Senator will agree &mdash; and I think Senator Durcan agrees with this too by implication, at least, from his remarks or by inference from what he did not say &mdash; is conduct which in any circumstances would constitute an offence and would not be consistent with the kind of standards that we expect of public servants or indeed people in any position of responsibility. The conduct which Senator Durcan now seeks to have included in the Fourth Schedule is conduct of a different kind. It is conduct which of itself is a perfectly legitimate activity which can be engaged in by citizens generally and which cannot in any circumstances be regarded as being morally or criminally wrong.  I know that each one of us has ideas about particular flavours of political activity but there is none of us in this House who would regard political activity in itself as in any way morally wrong.  We might regard some manifestations of it as being misguided but not intrinsically wrong.</P>
      <P>It is the case that members of the Garda Síochána are precluded from involvement in certain activities; some of them neither morally nor criminally wrong, either because the Commissioner believes that such conduct would be likely to interfere with the proper discharge of their duties or to cause worry or apprehension among the general public in relation to the impartial discharge of the duties of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that with the exception of the prohibition on involvement <Col N="1675" /> in political activity, which is specifically mentioned in the 1971 Discipline Regulations, all of the other activities which are encompassed by this amendment have been prohibited by the commissioner at his sole discretion.  That discretionary power is conferred on him because he is the head of a disciplined force, as I pointed out before.  He is the guardian of its good name.  He is the person who is in the best position to decide what activities are or are not consistent with membership of the Garda Síochána and I believe that it is important, from a number of points of view, that his position and pre-eminence in relation to those aspects of the conduct of the Garda Síochána be emphasised and maintained.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that members of the public cannot complain if they believe that individual members of the Garda force are acting in a way which the Senator would wish specifically to identify in the Fourth Schedule.  If a member of the public believes that a member of the Garda Síochána at whatever level is acting in a way that is inconsistent with the line being taken by Senator Durcan with which I think we all agree, he has a perfect right to complain to the Commissioner about it and to have the matter then dealt with under the Garda Discipline Regulations.  In my view, for the reasons I have set out, I believe that that is the appropriate way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>In one sense the Minister has made the argument for me in relation to (a) and (b) of my amendment, that is dealing purely with political activities by a member of the Garda.  I accept the point and the Minister's response in relation to paragraph (c) of the amendment and that perhaps what is mentioned there is more appropriate for inclusion in the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations.  But he did not make the point that there are certain matters which are of a public nature as distinct from an internal Garda nature.  I think that the items mentioned at (a) and (b) are certainly matters which <Col N="1676" /> can affect the public in a very open way. I believe they have affected the public in a very definite way in the recent past. Activities of this nature by members of the force at lower levels are increasing. It is for that reason that I put down the overall amendment.  I would ask the Minister to consider between now and the Report Stage whether an amendment along the lines of the new Article 10 (a) and (b) I have suggested should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that the Bill as originally circulated would have included a provision of this kind by reason that the regulations were mentioned in the Bill and anything which was in breach of discipline under the regulations was a breach of discipline for the purpose of a complaint.  The Minister has quite rightly identified some areas where some breaches of discipline, for example, not being tidy in uniform and such things, are best dealt with in the way the Minister suggests.  I have no great objection to the introduction during the Dáil debate on it of a Fourth Schedule which we are now considering.  But I think that the question of controlling the extent, if at all, that members of the garda identify publicly with a political party is very important. It is very important that that would be an area where a member of the general public may complain and that the complaint may be dealt with in a public fashion.</P>
      <P>In all the cirsumstances the Minister's first thought on this was considerably better than the second thought.  The first thought was that exactly this, word for word, would be in the Bill indirectly, but it would have full power of operation, because any breach of the regulations was being made an offence which was capable of being investigated.  That included this precise amendment.  For that reason and bearing in mind the additional point made by Senator Durcan I think certainly with regard to the question of membership of a political party, it is very much a matter which should be capable of being referred to the complaints procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> I do not know to what extent engagement by members of the force in other activities for reward falls foul of paragraph (c) of the appropriate disciplinary regulations, but it is a matter about which complaints are made by members of the general public to each other and to public representatives on a fairly frequent basis. I think that it is reasonable that this kind of complaint about members of the Garda Síochána engaging in what appears to be other full time occupations, should continue to be the subject of public scrutiny, or should become the subject of public scrutiny.  For that reason I support the amendment of Senator Durcan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more frequently the case that Senator O'Leary disagrees with the Minister's first thought and it is, therefore, with some sadness that I find Senator O'Leary agrees with the Minister's first thought, but the Minister thinks that second thoughts are better.  It is true that the Schedule we are discussing here was inserted in the Bill as a Committee Stage amendment in another place.  The reason it was added was partly to simplify the presentation of the Bill and to assist the public by providing an easier reference.  Previously conduct which could be subject to a complaint was defined by reference to the disciplinary regulations contained in the Schedule to the 1971 Discipline Regulations.  I came to the conclusion, I think correctly, that it would be far more convenient for the public and those acting on their behalf to be able to find the grounds in one place in this Bill, longish and complicated as it is, rather than having to procure a copy of the 1971 Discipline Regulations.  The consensus of opinion elsewhere has been that this was a simplification that was well worth bringing about and that is certainly my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is how the Fourth Schedule got into its present form in the Bill.  In addition to that, before Senator Durcan leaps to the defence of his amendment, I would have to repeat again that some forms of conduct have been separately specified or identified by commissioners over the years as being forms of conduct that <Col N="1678" /> would be regarded as breaches of discipline. It is important that the commissioner be in a position to do that. Who knows but that some new form of conduct might not emerge, indeed over the next 15 years.  There are forms of conduct, which, if engaged in by members of the Garda Síochána would properly be regarded as breaches of discipline which did not exist before that.  I do not intend to go into all of that, but for example the proliferation of security firms over that period has certainly brought about a new area in which breaches of discipline might be committed by members of the force.  In all such areas, and the House is entitled to ask me to give particular attention to this, it should be made very clear to the general public that those kinds of conduct do constitute breaches of discipline and that the proper place to make the complaint is to the Garda Commissioner, so that they can be dealt with under the Garda Discipline Regulations.</P>
    <P>It has been my practice for some time, since I found out about it myself, which pre-dates my entry into my present functions, whenever a member of the public has brought a matter of that kind to my notice, to deal with it in that way, or when another public representative has brought a matter of that kind to my attention to tell him or her, that the proper place to make the complaint is to the commissioner.  That is the best way of doing it.  I attach very considerable importance to emphasising the role of the commissioner as the final curator of the good name of the force, and the chief disciplinary officer of the force.  As I said in another connection in relation to this bill, it is very important that that be maintained and be seen very clearly both by the general public and by members of the force itself.</P>
    <P>For all of those reasons, I am not disposed to accept the amendment because I think the point and other concerns that I have just developed are adequately covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The last day we had a very interesting debate on this report. The report deals with an area that has always traditionally been very close to the hearts of the Irish people.  For the Oireachtas it is a relatively new area but it is one with which the ordinary members of the public can readily identify.  For some years I have been encouraging greater numbers of colleagues from both Houses to avail of whatever opportunity presents itself to visit programmes which are being funded or part funded by money made available from the Exchequer. That is very important.  Successive Governments have endeavoured to work towards meeting the United Nations target of contributions in bilateral aid. The figure has been steadily climbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Irish media &mdash; Telefís Éireann in particular &mdash; created a great sense of awareness.  The people responded in a magnificent fashion to the Bob Geldof Band Aid operation.  The contributions were significant.  I am very <Col N="1681" /> glad to see that Mr. Geldof has received a number of distinctions on account of his initiative and his great charity and foresight.  I do not know which is the greater &mdash; the feat of focussing public attention on the problem of hunger and deprivation in so many countries of the world or the feat of raising the very considerable amount of money which Band Aid succeeded in getting the members of the public to contribute.</P>
    <P>We have many national and international agencies such as the United nations, the Childrens Fund, the Development Aid of the EC and the various inter-governmental bilateral aid programmes. To equal the contributions &mdash; which are on an ongoing basis from the United Nations participants to the developing countries &mdash; we would need one and a half Bank Aids per day to equate with the vast amounts of money which the Governments of the United Nations contribute towards the Third World.  I mention that to highlight the fact that from the civil servants' point of view and from the Government's point of view it is an ongoing problem.  It is well recognised in all of the countries that contribute. On behalf of the taxpayers of those countries Governments are making a considerable contribution and we should not lose track of that.  The big problem is that it has not been highlighted as it should be.  I would like to see more of our colleagues in this House and in the Dáil being given an opportunity to visit one or two of the projects which are funded from our NGO funds through the Department of Foreign Affairs or through our bilateral aid programme to the selected countries. it is important that we should be fully aware of that.</P>
    <P>There has been another significant shift in contributions to the Third World over the last number of years.  Since the Catholic hierarchy introduced the Trócaire organisation a vast amount of charitable funds are directed, by the diocesan clergy, to that organisation.  This is a laudable exercise in itself except that I think those funds were flowing almost to the same extent, down through the years, <Col N="1682" /> through the ordinary missionary societies, societies such as the St. Patrick Missionary Fathers in Kiltegan or the Holy Rosary Sisters in Killeshandra, the Holy Ghost Fathers, the Society of African Missions, the Dominicans, the Medical Missionaries of Mary or the Salesians and so on.  This change of emphasis by the Catholic bishops has redirected much of the funds.  Those missionary societies have done very valuable work.  Indeed, when one meets the Government people in so many of the African countries one finds that many of them have benefited educationally from one or other of those Irish missionary societies.  Moneys made available through the missionary societies and through individual missionaries percolates more quickly to those in need, especially when so many of our missionary sisters, brothers and priests tend to concentrate to a great extent on the development of co-operatives.  They adopt the Trócaire slogan of helping these people to feed themselves.  This is a continuing need.  When I drive through the country and observe huge hoardings, costing Trócaire thousands of pounds, which are dealing purely with political or social policies in South Africa or other countries, I wonder if the cost of that exercise would be more beneficial if it were directed to some isolated village or parish in one of the developing countries which we have selected as being more suitable for the kind and amount of bilateral funds which our Government have available to them.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity to discuss the report of the joint committee in this House.  I hope they will continue to press the Minister for Finance to make the maximum amount of funds available, demonstrating in a very practical way that we recognise the inequalities and the difficulties of the very large populations in those under developed countries. I would like to compliment the Taoiseach, his Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State and indeed the previous Minister of State, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, for the care they and the Civil Service took in selecting the specific projects in the countries which <Col N="1683" /> the Department have decided are best suited for Irish aid, having regard to the size of the aid in general.  If one looks at the progress in the Hololo Valley in Lesotho after ten years, that project has meant a significant improvement in the living conditions of a considerable number of people.  The Government selected a small country with a small population where the effort and the finance could readily be identified and one could measure the improvement.  That was a good idea.  In the developing countries there is a vast amount of manpower available.  With the NGO funds I would like greater emphasis placed on the development of co-operatives for agricultural production.  When I started working on the land we had a whole range of horse drawn implements.  Even though that was 30 or 40 years ago those implements would be a great advance on the oxen plough which is used in the developing countries.  That would be the equivalent of the old Oliver plough which was a wooden plough of 150 years ago.  If we could devise for some of the areas where diesel oil is not readily available light weight non-mechanical agricultural equipment it would be easier for them to manage and it would effect a great improvement in the situation.  The forestry department have made some manual equipment available for some of those projects.  I wonder how efficient or effective it has been in the areas to which it has been assigned.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the joint committee.  I wish them well in their work which must be looked upon as extremely important.  If we claim to care then we must be prepared to continue increasing our contribution to the entire question of equality of opportunities in the Third World.</P>
    <P>In the EC the Development and Aid Commission continues to spend massive amounts of money on the development of markets and on various programmes. This is extremely important in its own way.  Though many people would like to think we should be on a continuous buy Irish campaign, we should be conscious <Col N="1684" /> of supporting the goods from those Third World countries that we want to support. It is important that there should be a greater equalisation of trade between the developed countries and those developing countries which have just one or two exportable commodities.  Indeed most of them are one commodity economies. Although we must be conscious of buying Irish we should make some contribution in trade to the developing countries that we have identified as the ones where we want to concentrate Irish bilateral aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak as a member of the committee and as one who had the enormously enlightening opportunity of visiting a number of our priority countries last year.  The experience that our group had on that visit is reflected to a large extent in the report on the Bilateral Aid Programme.  It is important to put what we are talking about into its proper context. It is referred to in the report though not in the sort of detail it requires.  That is not a criticism of the report, it is just a statement of the way things are.  Two things are mentioned by the committee and two recommendations are contained in the report.  One, a recommendation that this country should devote itself with considerably greater enthusiasm to the struggle to establish a new world economic order.  At the centre of the problem of underdevelopment is the essential injustice of the way the world is structured. To suggest, as prominent spokespersons for the United States Government have suggested, that to let the free market loose all over the world would automatically produce some level of justice in the world is to fly in the face of even traditional economics.  Traditional economics would tell you that the powerful will create monopoly positions for themselves and that you need anti-monopoly regulations even in the most free of free market economies to prevent that happening.  Since there is no system of world regulation in a world free market system you would run into monopoly situations controlled by those who are already powerful.  That would make the existing situation even worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> The bedrock of real development in the oppressed part of the world is actually a new world economic order.  Perhaps the most specific symptom of the need for a new world economic order is the other general area of policy that is referred to in the report.  That is the question of international indebtness, the whole Third World debt crisis.  Probably the least romantic thing one can talk about either at public meetings or in writing is the international debt crisis.  The truth is that we have probably got to the situation where the scale of interest payments and capital repayments that are required to be undertaken by Third World countries are probably net contributors to the so called developed countries, in other words, they are paying back more than is being paid in aid.  That is not just cruel, it is an outrageous injustice.</P>
    <P>It is because this issue of injustice and a new world economic order is so fundamental that I regret Senator McDonald's attack on Trócaire.  It is outrageous that it should be suggested in this House that alerting people to the greatest obscenity in the world today, which is the system of apartheid in South Africa, would somehow be less important than giving aid in the form of cash grants through religious orders.  Archbishop Hurley of South Africa, in a most humble and enlightening address to the Trócaire tenth anniversary conference identified the fact that the Church and the missionary orders in South Africa has been shamefully negligent in their challenge to the apartheid system.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, regrettable that we should have to listen here to even an implied attack on perhaps the most enlightened area of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and, in the light of recent weeks, the areas of enlightenment in the Roman Catholic hierarchy are few and far between and are difficult to identify. Trócaire was one of them.  I suspect that the cabel of the old right and the new right and old Tories who defeated us last week will turn their eyes shortly on something as enlightened as the Church's attitude to South Africa and will begin to tackle that next.  It seems like an obvious <Col N="1686" /> target because much that is said by Trócaire is inconsistent with much that was said in this country in the past three weeks.  You cannot struggle for justice abroad and institutionalise injustice at home.  Something will give and I regret to have to say that I suspect it is the struggle for justice abroad that will be the victim of the institutionalised injustice that seems to be acceptable at home. Nevertheless it has to be said that Trócaire's contribution to enlightening Irish public opinion has been enormous at school level, through the Church, through church bodies and religious orders.  I would regret, resent and reject even an implied criticism of them.  My only criticism would have far more to do with the level of resources made available to Trócaire through the Church which to be fair, is considerable and is expanding.</P>
    <P>The report deals in some length with the policy framework within which a bilateral aid programme should develop. It identifies poverty and need as the basic principle to be used in determining where our Bilateral Aid Programme should be concentrated.  It is important to get away from a sometimes fashionable First World notion that we are becoming involved in a form of cultural imperialism by deciding whether people in Third World countries are poor.  I am consistently amazed by people who ask how sure are we that these people are so much worse off and say that we are interfering with a lifestyle which has a lot going for it and which has a lot of values which we in western society have lost.  Perhaps we are but we are also giving aid to societies where the infant mortality rate is of the order of 130, 150 or 200 per 1,000 live births by comparison with an infant mortality rate that is close to single figures here.  That as far as I am concerned is an index of absolute poverty which is unchallengable and those of us who saw what was trying to function as a hospital in one small town in Tanzania last year, a hospital without running water, have also very little doubt about the fact that there is no cultural imperialism involved in deciding that certain countries are unjustly poor and deserve and need a <Col N="1687" /> higher living standard.  Some of the liberal hand wringing that one hears about, the dreadful tragedy of introducing the consumer society to countries that have their own simple lifestyles, is nothing but the romantic whinging of people who do not want to make choices about which side they are on in a struggle for justice.</P>
    <P>The projects that I had the privilege to see and which we were involved with were poverty orientated and were run by people who were trying to work at the bottom of the heap with people who had very little to enable them to make progress. It is right too that we identify, as we have, small scale projects and that we try to deal as far as possible with basic needs because there is a danger of setting up a poverty industry at home and abroad.  There is equally a danger of developing a new culture of professional aid workers in permanent transit from one project to another.  Many people working in Irish aid projects spoke to me about the international new breed of professional aid workers working in one aid project after another.  You begin to get the feeling that the projects have far more to do with sustaining the industry than with actually doing the job they were set up to do which was to initiate a form of development which could ultimately continue on its own without the intervention of either personnel or funds from the First World.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise the requirement of local co-operation.  There is no point in implanting a large western European style operation into rural Tanzania, setting it up, getting it going and then expecting it to make some enormous difference.  One of the benefits of visiting these countries is that you realise there is only one way to make progress and that is by building on what is there.  There are no short cuts which would enable people to make the type of progress that impatient westerners like ourselves may want.  You have to make progress within the structure of the environment in which people live.  The necessity therefore for <Col N="1688" /> high level, well organised, local co-operation is properly emphasised in the report.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in the report that funding allocations should spring out of general policy framework is quite correct. The Minister at some stage should look at the development co-operation report of his own Department and look at one country in Africa which is not a priority country.  He should add up the sums of money that are allocated via the ambassador in that country.  He should consider whether that fits into any policy framework or whether it has far more to do with the fact that there is a substantial body of Irish missionaries working in that country who have I am sure quite pressing needs and claims.  However, it is hard to see a series of <i>ad hoc</i> grants here and there via the ambassador fitting into any overall policy framework.  If we decide that we want to do this then we should adjust the policy.  When the Minister smiles he knows what I am talking about. It deserves to be studied and looked at because any type&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is an interesting recommendation in the area of policy that needs to be elaborated on and that is that the amount of funding to priority countries should not have a great regard to the political complexion of the country that the aid is being given to.  I agree with that in principle but it is not the same as saying that we make no judgments about the political complexions of the countries we are dealing with.  The reason for that is that you could be involved in co-operating with a Government and in the process give credibility to them when they would have little or no credibility among their own people.  There are many who argue that our position in Lesotho was close to that.  There was a Government which many argued had little or no popular support and which was sustained in power by devices other than the will of the people.  Shall I put it like that?  At the same time the number of Third World countries that have or indeed could be fairly expected to have western style democracies are few and far between. We have to make choices but we must not fudge any of the issues involved.  If the political complexion of a country is such that we cannot guarantee reasonably corruption free operations and reasonably corruption free development then I do not know if we have any business getting involved in development there if all we are doing is making a further contribution to the enrichment of an already enriched minority.  I agree with the recommendation that the political complexion should not be a determining factor but it is equally important that we should not close our eyes to the political <Col N="1690" /> complexions of the countries we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>If we have a policy framework, the question that must preoccupy us is the scale of funding that we make available to implement that policy.  There is not much point in making a long speech here about the inadequate level of funding for our Bilateral Aid Programme.  Everybody, including the Minister, agrees that it is far too small.  The Minister and I will disagree about whether it is possible to make it larger.  It is pathetically inadequate and it needs to be said, not for the first time, that the scale of overseas development aid represents in terms of public expenditure about 5 per cent of what is spent on armaments annually in the world.  That choice of priorities underlines the fact that to say we cannot afford to expand overseas development aid is a load of nonsense.  It is a question of priorities.</P>
      <P>The priority we have chosen is to vastly inflate armaments expenditure and to keep overseas development aid severely restricted.  It would be quite possible, given the political will, to change those priorities fundamentally and even a 5 per cent transfer from armaments expenditure to development aid would represent a 100 per cent increase in the scale of overseas development aid.  I do not think there is any case to be made in the western world generally, whatever about in this country, for not giving greatly increased overseas development aid though I know enough about the question of development to realise that giving aid on its own is not the solution.  Anybody who has visited, even briefly, countries in need of development could testify that for every project that has been commenced, there are 100 others that could be commenced immediately.  While aid will not solve the problem of itself there is a lot that could be done if extra aid was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A quite proper decision was taken to move away from multilateral aid and put increased resources into bilateral aid.  It is one of the regrettable facts that most of our multilateral aid is a fixed commitment over which we have no real say.  Any <Col N="1691" /> decision either not to increase overseas development aid or even more tragically to reduce it produces a disproportionately heavy cut in the area of bilateral aid because the multilateral commitment must be met.  I hope we will develop &mdash; I would love to hear this said by somebody in Fianna Fáil &mdash; a political consensus to increase overseas development aid.  It makes a huge difference to people working in the field, particularly in non-governmental organisations, to be able to make some plans for the future.  It also helps the public service and the Department of Foreign Affairs to plan for more than a year in advance.  We are not much more than 18 months away from an election.  It is difficult to plan for the period after the end of next year if no commitment is given by the parties who might be in government that overseas development aid will be expanded and continued in the future.  I look forward to hearing that such a commitment will be given by Fianna Fáil in particular.</P>
    <P>Our development aid programmes have made considerable progress.  As the report identified, there are a considerable number of areas that need to be dealt with.  As regards personnel, the constant complaint we heard was that because of the continuous change in personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs who dealt with overseas development aid &mdash; this is not what the people in the field said to me but it is my version of it &mdash; one had to continuously help people to rediscover the wheel.  Just when somebody had really got a feel of the job they were moved elsewhere.  Someone else was appointed.  They had a reasonable general knowledge but none of the intimate detail which enables people to make informed recommendations or decisions.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations made by the committee which should be vigorously pursued by the Minister is to exempt the development aid area of the Department of Foreign Affairs from the embargo on public service recruitment. It would be tragic given the small number of staff involved if a vacancy was allowed to remain unfilled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> The report also deals at some length with the process of selection of personnel to operate overseas.  The quality of selection in some cases has been less than 100 per cent.  Most of the reservations I had before I visited Lesotho were adequately disposed of while I was there.  I could not find any grounds for criticising the Irish personnel I met.  There are some well documented cases which show that attitudes on the part of some professional personnel over the years towards the native peoples of Lesotho have been less than enlightened.  It has been recommended to me on a few occasions that one area that should be looked at very carefully is the area of conditions and criteria under which Irish aid personnel in that country recruit domestic service staff.  Sometimes these people are not paid proper wages.</P>
    <P>Particular sensitivity is required when dealing with Lesotho because of where it is located and because of the monster that surrounds it.  It would be tragic if we gave any comfort to those how wish to perpetuate the monstrosity that surrounds Lesotho on all sides.  It would be tragic if Irish personnel were selected to work there who did not have a proper sensitivity and understanding of the scale of the obscenity that is South Africa today.  Therefore it is important that volunteers and expert personnel be selected with the maximum possible rigour.  There have been complaints about differences in recruitment and training between NGOs and Government agencies.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that people can carry out a programme of development aid in either Lesotho or Tanzania if they do not have a working knowledge of the local language.  As part of the training programme for people working overseas we should have a proper procedure for teaching people a language.  Given that our diplomatic staff who work in those countries are particularly orientated towards development and since our development programme relies on the maximum local co-operation they must have a competence in the local languages. This may not be the easiest thing to develop given the turnover of staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> The objective of our development aid programme cannot be met if the staff involved do not have a reasonable fluency in the local language.  That is purely on a practical basis.  There is also the question of the increased acceptability of diplomatic staff who can speak the local language. We are talking of an area where there is a lot that sill needs to be done.  It is interesting that the non-Governmental organisations &mdash; at least the ones which I saw in operation &mdash; put enormous resources into ensuring that their volunteers can speak the local language.  If this sounds sentimental then perhaps it is.  It is impressive to see quite young volunteers in Tanzania, some of them barely out of college, with a fluency in Swahili and an ease of the language which most Irish people, including myself, would not have in our own second language not to mention a totally different African language. It also gives a sense of their own involvement in the development of the communities they work in.  They are not outsiders giving advice.  They are participants in the local community.  On the basis of the little I saw the whole area of learning languages will have to be extended.</P>
    <P>That brings us to another area which the committee quite rightly looked at. That is the area of project evaluation.  I was taken aback to be told by Irish people working on development aid projects in both Tanzania and Lesotho that people had visited them to evaluate the projects. They understood that reports had been drafted but they also understood that they would never see the reports or have an opportunity to comment on them. That sort of private evaluation may fulfil one function but there ought to be a proper feedback from personnel in the field about the conclusions in the evaluator's report.  Having an all-knowing, all-powerful omnipotent Department which can send out one person to evaluate a project and draw conclusions on that basis is far too simple.  It avoids the difficulties that arise when people can actually comment on what is said about them and their work.  Any evaluation report ought to be published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> There is a lack of any structured debriefing for people returning from overseas development work.  I understand from the Department of Foreign Affairs that they are quite delighted and pleased to hear people's views.  Nobody had got around to saying at the time of the drafting of this report that part of the conditions under which people would go to work in one of our development projects would be that on their return they must spend a week or three or four days with the Department of Foreign Affairs or some appropriate agency talking about their experiences, ideas and insights. There is a fund of knowledge which seems to be largely untapped.  I know a number of returned workers who hold strong views and who were quite taken aback when they discovered that once they arrived home their expertise was felt to be at an end.  There should be a formal process whereby returned personnel ought to be involved in project evaluation.  They have an important insight to share with us all.</P>
    <P>The report mentioned the area of women and training for women in developing countries or oppressed countries as I prefer to call them.  There are extra obstacles in the way of women in these countries.  There are enough obstacles in the way of women in this country as we discovered in the last three weeks, but there are even greater obstacles in the way of women in developing countries. The restructuring of agriculture in Tanzania and the restructuring of societies where women tended to be the people who provided food and men tended to be the hunters and the providers of cash crops, has meant that men have to some extent &mdash; this is something we remarked on &mdash; become redundant.  Women have been left with an increasing burden to carry because of the distances they have to travel to gather firewood as a result of the destruction of forests and so on. There is a considerable likelihood of an increasingly unjust distribution of work in many developing countries because of the way things are changing.</P>
    <P>The report also identifies a criticism that has come more and more to the front in recent times about the fact that we <Col N="1695" /> have, by and large, concentrated our priorities on one continent and have not as yet a programme for identifying a priority area or country either in Asia or Central or South America.  I enthusiastically endorse the recommendation of the committee that we should identify one or two extra priority countries outside of Africa.  I have one idea about a priority area in South Africa.  He should consider it.  It seems to be agreed that the practical level of Irish aid in Lesotho has now been reached.  It seems to be equally agreed that we cannot dramatically raise the level of aid in either Sudan or Zambia in the immediate future.  Therefore the extra funds that will become available because of the Government's guaranteed increase in overseas development aid funding could properly be allocated to a new priority country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that the choice of a new priority country is made on the basis of need.  It should not be made either on the basis of political acceptability to our good friends in the United States or anything like that.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in Central America, for instance, Nicaragua would be a very worth while and worthy country to identify as a priority country given the scale of the problems they have and the fact that there is an attempt to build a more just society there.  It is a country that is, at this stage, extremely well known to Irish people.  It is also a small country.  That is one of the countries of Central America which would be a very interesting area.  Some people have spoken about India as a priority country. The scale of the problems in India would ensure that Irish aid would be entirely lost.  A smaller country in south east Asia could well be considered.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on the record insights that I got from the brief two weeks we spent in Africa.  It is probably unwise of me because it is foolish for a politician to talk about his overseas travels.  He is liable to hit the headlines in every organ of the media.  I have no qualms in talking about it and people can <Col N="1696" /> say what they wish.  The first thing which strikes you is that no matter what you read or how well informed you are, once you land in the countries I visited poverty becomes a different thing.  Somebody tells you that communications are very bad in Tanzania.  You do not realise that means that even a landrover will have difficulty conveying you along some of the roads in the rain with potholes that are nearly as large as the wheels of a landrover.  Indeed one of my colleagues on that journey spent about a month on the flat of his back recovering from the experience of travelling in a landrover when, as some of my friends in the media would say, he was having a junket around Africa.  It was a junket for which he paid a very&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that what is wrong? The poverty that is visible here should be seen by as many members of parliaments of as many European and North American countries as possible because the actual experience of the poverty there can upset peoples consciences more than can any amount of reading or rhetoric.  It is not a poverty that can easily be shown on television programmes.  It does not have the intensity of starvation in Ethopia. Nevertheless it is very real and it emphasises and underlines the fundamentally unjust distribution of wealth and opportunity in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also to experience the pride people have in their countries and their achievements in spite of all the obstacles they face.  I was enormously impressed with the frankness of public officials in Tanzania about both their achievements and their failures.  It gave one a great sense of hope for the future of that country.  It confirmed my admiration for the person who had led that country for the best part of its period of independence. Material poverty is still considerable though great progress has been <Col N="1697" /> made, in the provision of basic services. The pride of the people in their own country has been enormously impressive. It would be a matter of great regret if, as has been suggested, a large part of the interest of the international banking community, of the IMS and of the World Bank in bringing about fundamental changes in economic policy in Tanzania would be as much related to a displeasure with the political policies operated by the Tanzanian Government as it would be with any sort of objective economic analysis.</P>
    <P>We also visited Lesotho and this was an enormously upsetting introduction at first hand to what apartheid really means. The first experience of this was at Johannesburg Airport where there were fewer black people visible than at London Airport for instance.  The airport is a sensitive area.  It is an area, to use a phrase that is now subversive in South Africa, where the white minority government do not trust the black population and, therefore, there is this lily white impression. This is meant to reassure European visitors that South Africa is a very peaceful, placid and likeable country.  But then one sees all the people with guns at exits and other places.  This is to a much greater extent there than is the case at any other airport I have been through.  I have been in a number of airports in eastern Europe and I have never seen anything like the military security presence there is at Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg.</P>
    <P>There were problems also in relation to development in Lesotho.  These were entirely related, both in the eyes of the Government and of many of Irish personnel there, to the regime that surrounds the country.  It was extremely difficult, for example, to transfer control of some projects from an Irish person to a native of Lesotho because if a native of Lesotho does business in South Africa he will be charged about 50 per cent more for the goods or services than an Irish man would be charged.  If a person is black he is expected to pay more, to wait longer and to accept poorer quality services and goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> At the centre of all the development problems in Lesotho is the problem of apartheid.  We were told this by government officials, Irish aid workers and so on.  It is the increasingly vocal opposition to apartheid on the part of a far from idealistic government that produced the obvious South African intervention which brought about the toppling of the government and the military coup in Lesotho.  One thing which is not tolerated in southern Africa is any attempt to operate the type of European values South Africans talk about so loudly.  They can criticise who they like, they can intervene where they like but other people do not have such privileges.  The attitude is that they are black so they could not be expected to have such privileges.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I admire the bravery of the people from Lesotho whom I met who said that, of course, sanctions were the only weapon left and that disinvestment was the only way forward. The southern African states, not just in Lesotho, that are bedevilled by the Frankenstein of apartheid have now said that whatever the short term sacrifices are, they are necessary to achieve the long term objective of destroying apartheid and then enabling what is a homogeneous unit of southern Africa to develop as a unit with the proper co-operation and development between the various independent states.</P>
    <P>Western society has three choices.  It can either support apartheid, which it effectively does at present by its neglect to do anything else; it can introduce stringent and increasingly biting sanctions of an economic kind or it can reconcile itself to the fact that apartheid will end through armed struggle and take the choice if it wishes of arming the ANC, having chosen to arm the other side over the last 50 years.  The least it could do in justice would be to give those who have to fight the equipment to do so instead of standing back and now regretting the violence which western society choose to institutionalise in South Africa over the last 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Like the last speaker, Senator Ryan, I am a member of the committee and was very much involved in the drawing up of this report which is the second report of this joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
      <P>As has been said by all of the speakers, the report has looked at the whole area of Ireland's bilaterial assistance.  I think &mdash; and I am not saying this merely as a member of the committee &mdash; that this is a very useful document because it will do something to increase awareness and information about our role internationally and what we do in terms of helping poor and impoverished countries.  As I have said before, there is an awful dearth of information about Ireland's role.  If these reports do nothing else they are very worth while in terms of the technical information they give.  They will increase awareness of this problem throughout the public generally.</P>
      <P>The committee prepared also a third report on apartheid in South Africa.  It has been available for about three months and I regret that we did not find time to discuss it during this session.  It was planned to discuss it before the summer recess next week but because of pressure of other business that will not be possible.</P>
      <P>One might commend the Seanad on the fact that it has discussed in full the first report of this committee and has now almost completed quite a long discussion on the second report on bilateral aid.  No doubt we will discuss apartheid and the report on development education which we are drawing up at present.  I am not aware that these reports have been discussed in the Dáil though they have been available to that House for as long as they have been available to this House. That is a great pity.  Again, the excuse will be that because of pressure of business it did not find time to discuss it.  This says something about our order of priorities, I do not agree in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I am a member of the committee and have been involved in the drawing up of this report, I take liberty of reading directly from certain sections of the report.  While Senator Ryan made <Col N="1700" /> an excellent speech there were a number of things he said which I thought were inadequate in relation to what the report said in terms of our overseas aid policy. To put the record straight on a number of things I will be reading into the record of the House the exact section which deals with what the reports recommends rather than having some of it said and the matter left a little inadequate from that point of view.  The very nature of Ireland's bilateral aid is set out as follows on page 3:</P>
    <P>Bilateral Aid Programme:</P>
    <P>The committee's discussion of the Bilateral Aid Programme and its recommendations should be seen in the light of its unanimous opinion that the Bilateral Aid Programme and its activities should have a clear poverty orientation i.e. that each programme should tackle the basic needs of the most poverty stricken people of a particular area in a manner directly beneficial to them.  In the light of this principle, it is the committee's view that, apart from the most exceptional circumstances, aid should be given without regard to the political complexion of the receiving countries.</P>
    <P>Here I found some of the things that Senator Ryan was slightly inadequate on. He said we talked about giving aid to all kinds of countries irrespective of political complexion and without making any judgments.  We have made judgments because in paragraph 57 the report states:</P>
    <P>Relative to the question of the effect on aid policy of the internal political situation in priority countries the Joint Committee recommended in its 1984 Report that emergency food aid, for example, be given without regard to the political complexion of the affected country's government.  The same principle should apply to longer term aid, apart from exceptional political circumstances where perhaps the lives of project workers are endangered or the political situation is so odious that any collaboration would be clearly construed both internally and externally as <Col N="1701" /> a betrayal of the population (para 7). However, although the Committee recommends that aid be given, in general, irrespective of the political complexion of the receiving country it suggests the establishment of ground-rules for cooperation with governments whose political systems or activities differ or are at odds with the Irish experience.</P>
    <P>That is the committee's total position on the issue of political complexion.  However, it is fully stated that our bilateral aid assistance has as its first principles absolute need and all its activities have a clear poverty ortientation.  The committee want the programme to be Ireland's commitment to the long term development of the poorest of poor countries. The committee want to see it as an essential plank of Irish foreign policy. Our bilateral aid is, in practice, assistance on the ground, for example, developing dairying systems, livestock systems, cereal production, rehabilitating a hospital as in Kilosa and the servicing of educational needs.  We would like to see what we are doing in these stricken countries as an effort, not alone to help, but also to identify with their problems.  We are like them, another small ex-colonial nation with an awful colonial past.  We have words in our history like &ldquo;Famine&rdquo;, &ldquo;pestilence&rdquo; and &ldquo;disease&rdquo;.  This is still in the memory of some of the older people.</P>
    <P>The committee make the point that we do not see well co-ordinated bilateral aid assistance on an international level and using the funds and expertise of the world's richest and most developed countries as any complete answer to impoverishment and underdevelopment.  The report recognises, and this point was well made by Senator Ryan, that only changing the terms of trade and the trading relations and the political relationships between the First and Third Worlds will fundamentally address the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the committee's comments on the debt burden.  This debt burden afflicts all developing nations and it is especially acute in the four priority countries where we are involved.  The point is <Col N="1702" /> made in the report that unless satisfactory rescheduling or a temporary suspension of the enormous debt accrued is agreed on between the lenders &mdash; the lenders are usually located in the world's great financial centres &mdash; and the borrowers who are often the poorest of poor countries, all the best efforts of the various international forum where this country parat nought.  We ask again that, in every international forum where this country participates, the Government press home this point.  I regret that two months ago at the Summit of the world's richest countries held in Tokyo, the problem of Third World debt was not on the agenda. In keeping the world's economic order, and we in the West have a greater interest in maintaining the present world economic order &mdash; this is the most fundamental question.  If nothing threatens the economic order of which we in this part of the world are the greatest beneficiaries, more than the debt problem in poorer countries, and, indeed, in not so poor countries.</P>
    <P>We make the point that only the wealthiest countries have the power to underwrite or to guarantee or to bring about that small change in the world's economic order which would relieve the debt burden on the world's poor.  Instead, leaders such as President Regan and Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Nakasone and Chancellor Kohl in Tokyo last April devoted most of their time to talking about terrorism and its prevention.  The summit was hailed as a triumph in that they came to an agreement on the prevention of terrorism.  Their only comment on economic issues and the change in the world's economic order was that they welcomed the drop in oil prices.  That to them was a sufficient change in the world's economic order to warrant progress as far as they were concerned.  More enlightened leaders, rather than discussing terrorism and the drop in oil prices and the economic effects that has on the Western world &mdash; of course I am aware that Ireland is a beneficiary of any drop in oil prices &mdash; ought to deal with the fundamental causes of terrorism which very often progresses from the resentment one finds <Col N="1703" /> among the have-nots in the world for people who have.</P>
    <P>I believe the debt burden is at the very core of the economic woes of the Third World.  Most of this debt in recent years arose because of the greatly increased need to import food because of natural disasters and disasters that might not be described as natural such as internal insurgence, political upheavals, external interferences such as the South African interference in Lesotho.  These developments, with the national ones, have caused enormous economic dislocations which in turn have led to enormous debt.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Third World as a whole in the 20 years from 1961 to 1981 food imports moved from 30 million tonnes to almost 100 million tonnes.  That is the increase in the amount of food that these countries have had to import just to survive.</P>
    <P>The saddest sideline to this development is that amongst Africa's poorest countries food production since 1981 is decreasing, mostly for the reasons I have already mentioned &mdash; internal political reasons, natural and unnatural disasters. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, in the sub-Saharan region of Africa &mdash; which is the world's most stricken region &mdash; food production has fallen by 1 per cent per person per year since 1981.  The shortfall can only be made up by food imports usually paid for by borrowings. Much of the shortfall is not made up and consequently we have famine and all the related horrors which we see on television and in very graphic photographs in the newspapers and in news magazines.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 of the report of the Joint Committee on Cooperation with Developing Countries deals with the fact that the Government has never issued a clear policy document on the whole area of overseas development assistance.  A number of organisations in the development co-operation field who gave evidence to the committee in the drawing up of the report made the point very clearly that this had led to a feeling of <Col N="1704" /> uncertainty because of a possible change in emphasis.  The Government had indicated that it will issue shortly a White Paper which will give a clear line on policy well into the future.  I would hope that these clear lines on policy would be upheld by this Government and by any other Government that may come into power over the next decade.  I would also like to see incorporated into this policy document &mdash; and I am sure that most of the members of the committee will agree with me as well as many Members of the House &mdash; a long term policy that we in Ireland would commit ourselves to seeking a reform in the world's economic order; such a reform to bring about a positive advantage to poor countries in their trading and economic relations with the developed world; that we would orientate our overseas development assistance, both bilateral and multi-lateral, towards the principle of attacking the fundamental cause of poverty and underdevelopment; that our assistance would always bring the people that we are attempting to assist along with us; that we would always have a sensitivity towards their personal, national and cultural pride.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of the report deals with the administration and monitoring by the Department of Foreign Affairs of the BAP &mdash; Bilateral Aid Programme &mdash; if I may use the initials, as this whole field of development co-operation is full on initials, like ODA, HEDCO, and so on. I commend it for the information it gives in this whole area.  Besides the Department's direct involvement in the administration of the programme in this part of the report, we have mentioned the other organisations involved.  I will mention a few of them by way of commending them for the very good work they do.  One of them is called APSO &mdash; the Agency for Personal Service Overseas &mdash; which is a State-sponsored body, promoting and sponsoring personal service by Irish people with special skills in developing countries.  They rightly receive a grant-in-aid for their activities.</P>
    <P>Higher Education for Development Co-operation (HEDCO) and the Irish <Col N="1705" /> Council for Overseas Students (ICOS) receive assistance to provide support services in the areas of education and training. I commend these organisations for the positive and good work they carry out.</P>
    <P>In Chapter 2 the joint committee make the point in relation to the role and status of development co-operation officers.  In at least one instance in Lesotho, the DCO (Development Co-operation Officer) had difficulty in operating as he should because of doubt as to his diplomatic status.  It must be appreciated in the House that the African political situation is unlike our own and leaders are very often given to vanity.  The prevalence of the one-party system is an inevitable product of this.  There is a practice which has grown up that all persons seeking permission to carry on work affecting the lives of possibly thousands of their people within their borders, should have an elevated diplomatic status.  The committee felt that in terms of ensuring their maximum effect with host governments, DCOs should have chargé d'affaires status.  I would ask the Minister to take note of this particular recommendation.</P>
    <P>I commend two members of the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs who were involved with the committee, namely Martin Greene and Gary Ansboro.  Both of these two fine public servants have been promoted to the office of DCO, one in Sudan and the other in Kenya.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>I regret that I have offended the rules of the House.  I was talking about them in a very complimentary way.  Two civil servants who were former clerks of the committee have been elevated to the post of DCO, one is being sent to Sudan and the other to Kenya; I am open to correction on this.  What I want to say is that both have given excellent service to the committee and I wish <Col N="1706" /> them well in their new postings in Africa. To say the very least, if they can give the kind of service they have given to the committee and in the way that they have shown an understanding of the problems, the bringing of that understanding to the ground itself will certainly have a beneficial effect on the way Ireland's bilateral assistance is carried through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said will reflect also on the Minister of State and on his predecessor.  I am aware that Senator Lanigan may be waiting to speak.</P>
      <P>Chapter 3 of the report deals with policy implementation and funding.  We welcome the growing increase in bilateral assistance relative to multilateral assistance. In 1970 the BAP was less than 4 per cent of all of Ireland's overseas development aid.  In 1984 it was 40 per cent, while multi-lateral was 60 per cent of all ODA.  Very hopefully a 50:50 ratio will be achieved next year in line with the national plan and hopefully Ireland's total ODA will amount to about £50 million in 1987.  That will bring us closer to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product, which is the UN target for overseas aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to welcome the fact that we have given funding under the bilateral aid programme to the South African Development Co-Operation Conference. This is a loose inter-state organisation comprising of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These countries comprise this loose economic and political partnership to promote their economic development and lessening of their dependence on South Africa <Col N="1707" /> for trade, et cetera.  Crucial to the activities of this inter-state organisation is a food security policy and all the countries mentioned have shortfalls in basic food needs and the assistance we are giving is to fund a project to establish an inventory of the agricultural source base in these countries.  This is a basic move in establishing a food sufficiency policy for the region.  We all support the concept of attacking the fundamental cause of poverty and hunger.  This funding in my opinion addresses the very core of the problem.</P>
    <P>Another area dealt with in Chapter 3 is the choice of priority country and, again, this outlines the history of how the four priority countries which we operate in were chosen.  May I read into the record of the House, with the permission of the Leas Cathaoirleach, what the committee had to say as to why we chose the four countries we did?  Basically, they were chosen because of relative poverty; ability to absorb and use aid effectively; the suitability of structures and policy to facilitate the flow of aid to the most needy; historical cultural, language and administrative links.  That, I would take it, is that the four countries involved were ex-British colonies like ourselves and they had certain liknesses like language particularly and certain administrative structures which we would all have inherited from the British.</P>
    <P>The last one I see here &mdash; the special circumstances &mdash; for example, the effect of the South African policy of apartheid in Lesotho &mdash; was one good reason as to why we should have got ourselves in Lesotho.  I will make the point again because very often we have inadequate reasons as to why we were involved in those four countries and there has been at least a measure of criticism about the countries that we chose and, of course, there is also the criticism that we have not spread our aid over a wider canvass and more countries.  I would share that view but I appreciate the money constraint.</P>
    <P>A number of the witnesses who came before the committee, especially Trócaire <Col N="1708" /> and Concern, made the case for another priority country in Asia.  Trócaire made the point that another country should be outside of Africa and should be located in Asia.  I would wholeheartedly agree.  Given our established criteria of absolute need, the obvious choice in Asia would have to be India or Bangladesh.  I would recommend that we might, if we are to extend to another priority country, choose India.  I am not pre-empting anything the Minister might say but I think there is a feeling within the Department of Foreign Affairs that, given better resources and greater level of development in the four priority countries, the level of involvement can decrease, thus releasing resources to go elsewhere.  I have had the experience of travelling for one month in the fairly recent past in southern India and experienced poverty and poverty-stricken people at a most appalling level: a level of squalor, not just in the large towns and cities but also in parts of rural India, that part that is called Village Loch.  For that reason I would love to see this country taking India as a priority country and initiating projects under BAP, particularly agricultural projects which we are very good at. Our agricultural projects in any of the four priority countries are absolute paragons. Of course, we recognise the practical difficulties of extending into another priority country and the fact that the available scarce resources for the foreseeable future will be absorbed in the ongoing process of developing the various schemes to a state of viability in the present four priority countries.  Only in Lesotho is the Department of Foreign Affairs satisfied that the projects undertaken have reached a satisfactory level. It would be disastrous and, indeed, a betrayal to make any premature rundown or withdrawal from the projects in existing countries, even if this was done to make way for another priority country. Nevertheless, the extension of the project must always be a live one, especially as the BAP gets to and possibly exceeds 50 per cent of ODA, and each year brings us closer to the UN target.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will return to general <Col N="1709" /> comments rather than deal with specific chapters in the report.  Again, I want to comment on the total lack of necessity that anyone in Africa or in Asia or, indeed, in Latin America should suffer the scourge of hunger and famine.  The supply of food in the world over the past 20 years at least has been greater than the demand to consume it &mdash; that is in a market sense.  Nevertheless, in that period countless thousands and maybe more have died as a result of famine and of hunger-related diseases.  This has happened purely because these unfortunate people lived in countries which had not the purchasing power to procure essential food for their populations.  At present world food surpluses are historically high, especially the surpluses generated by the European countries and by the United States of America and Australia and the other major agricultural producers. Dr. Allen Matthews writes a very interesting article in this year's Departmental Report on Assistance to Development Countries published last month.  He makes the point that the food aid requirement for all of Africa amounted to 8.5 million tonnes, that is the food aid requirement of countries with food deficits. This is at a time when the world grain stocks stand at 190 million tonnes surplus to demand.  That figure gives us some idea of how unbalanced the world's food supply is and how such a small proportion of the western world's food surplus would wipe out the famine and hunger could it be got to people who need it.</P>
    <P>This massive piece of grotesque immorality must be tackled.  The EC food mountain is a direct result of the Common Agricultural Policy.  This country naturally is a major economic beneficiary of the CAP.  We also must bear in mind that it protects this country from much poverty among small farmers.  It is relative poverty I am talking about but, nevertheless, poverty.  I object to this blind storage of surplus food grains, and meats and dairy products.  All of these products probably deteriorate by one third of their value for every year in storage. Some of them have been stored for <Col N="1710" /> so long that they are likely to become or have become unusable.</P>
    <P>This blind policy, if I may call it that, is pursued because of the kind of conventional economic wisdom that this food had to be paid for, that its storage had to be paid for and that its disposal or its use must somehow be related to market values.  There is an inbuilt resistance to entering into any kind of negotiations by which at least some of these surpluses could be sold to countries with food deficits on favourable terms.</P>
    <P>I would see two cold economic advantages to start with by such an approach being taken to the European food surplus situation in particular.  The food would be disposed of at prices below intervention prices but in many instances it would be disposed of at prices higher than it would be worth if left in continued storage.  The point I am making is that the value of this food stored in such huge quantities for such lengths of time deteriorates quite rapidly and, consequently, the money value of it deteriorates also.  That seems to me to be a point lost completely by the policy makers, especially the food mountain management people within the European Community.</P>
    <P>There is the other effect that cheaper food imports would inevitably lead to a lessening somewhat of the debt burden of very poor countries.  That would have the effect of relieving the nerves of the international bankers who lend to them. That is another cold economic advantage that would accrue from a new bold policy in relation to disposing of our surpluses to poor countries on favourable terms to them.  That leaves aside completely the amount of misery and the amount of hunger and the amount of starvation that it would relieve throughout the poor parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that, as a member of the committee, I had some small participation in drawing up this report.  I said at the beginning that I would not be indulgent in saying that because I am a member of the committee.  It is a comprehensive document and very well balanced but it sets down in very reasoned and in a very reasonable way <Col N="1711" /> Ireland's role in terms of its Bilateral Aid Programme.  This country of ours is a small country.  We do not belong to any great power bloc.  We have no great influence on the world's military situation or the world's military balance, nor, indeed, have we any great influence on the world's economic matters.  I would submit to the House that we can have a great influence on the balance of morality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in international relations in the way one country relates to another, in the way rich countries relate to poor countries and <i>vice versa.</i>  Because of our history we are in an especially good position to take that kind of stance in terms of our foreign policy.  I would submit, and I think I have said it already, that an essential plank of Ireland's foreign policy should be a special relationship with poor countries.  This country of ours, living in the First World, being part of the First World, should use its position of living in that privileged circle to talk to the other members, to say that many of the policies that are being pursued are wrong and certainly do not serve the interests of the Third World and long term they certainly do not serve our interests either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this report.  The report itself gives a fine indication of the work that is being done by both Government and non-Government organisations in an effort to stem the tide of poverty that stretches right throughout the world at present.  I am not, in the main, a great supporter of bilateral aid programmes because there is always the problem in bilateral aid that you may get drawn into the trap of giving aid with one hand for your own purposes and taking it back with the other.  I am afraid too much of what is given as aid in the world today is not aid.  It is being given in a mode of charity by the bigger nations who are seeking in many ways to solve their own <Col N="1712" /> conscience, on the one hand, while supplying arms and armaments on the other to these countries which are poverty stricken.</P>
      <P>It is totally wrong that at a time of extreme want, particularly in Africa, the larger and richer nations of the world are pouring arms and armaments into these countries and, at the same time, not providing the basic levels of food and sustenance that the people need.  Because of that I am very sceptical of bilateral aid programmes but it has to be said that the bilateral aid programmes that we in Ireland have got involved in seem to be monitored in such a way that it cannot be said that we are in it just for the sake of funding programmes, on the one hand, and selling products or expertise on the other hand.  The nature of the projects we have got involved in are of benefit to the African Continent and if they are followed through in a rational manner, can be of long term benefit.  It is interesting and I suppose it is not unusual that the countries getting aid in general are former colonial countries, countries which were raped by the colonialists in the past.  They were raped of all their wealth.  They were raped of their food producing capacity.</P>
      <P>No matter where one goes in Africa, one can see that this rape has resulted in the levels of poverty and deprivation that exist in these countries.  The changeover from the traditional slash and burn methods of farming in Africa to the European type of farming did away with the soil structure in these lands and has resulted in the extension of the desert. The desertification of many thousands of extra acres of land every year is an enormous problem.  It will be hard to change that to a method of farming which can sustain, in the long term, the people of the countries.  Extensive tree planting will have to be done so that the roots, when they take hold, will hold water and will not allow the water to run off the soil during the rainy season.  I am glad to see that the report does state that in Lesotho there is an attempt being made to have planting and farming projects going side by side.  That is the correct method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> The main thrust of the report is on the policy decisions which are needed to ensure that aid is orientated towards a reduction in the levels of poverty.  We are addressing levels of poverty and our priorities will be the countries which have the highest level of poverty.  I agree with the sentiments which have been expressed that we should not get involved in political arguments on whether or not we should send aid to countries which do not have the type of Government we might like to see.  The aid should be addressed to the areas of greatest poverty irrespective of the political situation in the receiving countries.  It has to be said that much of the poverty has been created sometimes because of internal problems but in a large number of cases it is due to lack of political stability because of incursions by outside influences who are not there for the good of the people.  This applies particularly to some of the African countries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear speakers talk about the need to look at the debt problems of the African Continent and countries in all the Continents of the world at present. It has been said that much of this debt has been caused because these countries have to import so much of their food. Equally, it can be said that a lot of the debt has been incurred because of the greed of bigger nations who send in machinery and armaments to countries which they know cannot pay for them. Unfortunately, the debts are mounting up in strong currencies and there is no hope of these countries ever repaying the capital.  In fact, they will have no chance of repaying the interest which is being charged.  The larger countries to whom the debt is due, generally speaking, have made large profits out of the sale of goods and services into these poverty stricken countries.  This problem should be addressed by the international community but, of course, it will not be.</P>
    <P>There is no point in our pretending in this House that we have any influence in what will happen at world banking level or at International Monetary Fund level. The facts are that the richer countries are <Col N="1714" /> raping the poorer countries, the rich are getting richer and the poor are definitely getting poorer.  Unfortunately, the instability which is caused because of this is beginning to show itself not only in political unrest and poverty but also in attacks, increased militarism and a rise in the wish of the people to get rid of their own governments whereas it is not their own governments who are at fault in the first place; it is the major capitalist countries who have created the problems.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the report which is a little problematic.  It is mentioned throughout the report that consultation should take place on a regular basis with people who have worked in the Third World and that when people come back from the Third World there should be some formal method of getting there to talk to the Department of Foreign Affairs and to give their experiences on a formalised basis.  There is mention of consultation with the NGOs and so forth.  The report does not seem to address itself sufficiently to the need to consult with the people on the ground in the receiving countries.  There is mention of consultation with governments of the receiving countries but there should be more consultation on the ground.  Too often, the perception we have of what is needed in African countries is not the perception that the Africans themselves have.  Too often, the wishes and the expertise of the African people are not taken into account when we get involved in aid programmes. There should be more co-operation and consultation with the people on the ground.  Mention is made of the need to have expert analysis of each project at all stages.  It is all right to say that you need experts to analyse the problems and assess the progress of these projects but, in essence, we are talking about, generally speaking, small type agricultural projects. A small farmer would have as good an idea as the best expert in finance as to how to keep some of these programmes going.</P>
    <P>Mention is made of the problems of cash cropping in African countries.  There is no doubt that there is a major problem in that too often people will get involved <Col N="1715" /> in crops for cash and then have to import food to sustain themselves.  That problem will have to be addressed, how to get a balance in the agricultural system of these countries, to ensure that there is a certain amount of cash cropping but also a level of farming for sustenance.  Otherwise, there will be a continuation of poverty. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Education is addressed in the report. It is good to see that more emphasis is placed on the need for primary education in these African countries than education at higher levels.  I would totally agree with that.  If these countries can get a basic educational standard, they will mature and get the benefits which are needed from an educational system.</P>
    <P>I am glad that mention has been made in the report of the problems of migration and the problems particularly of the Lesothans who have to emigrate to South Africa to work.  It is suggested in the report that there is need for training of these migrants who will be away from their families and their homes for many months, indeed, in some cases they are away from their families for life.  They come back for a very short time only to leave again.  The disruption in family life because of that is immense.  Of course the major problems that these people face when they are working in South Africa are horrific.  They are treated as less than human at all times.  I am glad that this is partly recognised in the report before us.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that we should extend our area of operation of the Bilateral aid Programme to countries other than those with which we are involved at present. With the funding that we have available, and even if we reach the 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I think it would be a mistake to extend too much our present commitments. I am not suggesting that we should stay in these particular countries but we should follow through the aid programmes we are involved in until such time as they have come to fruition, in other words are of permanent value to the people of the country in which they are operating. If we extend ourselves we weaken the <Col N="1716" /> value of what we do.  I can see the point that was made by Senator Connor about the major problems in India at present. Indeed there are major problems in more places than India and I think that it would be as I have said creating problems to extend ourselves too far with the very limited funding there is available even though we seem to be heading towards what is the United Nations norm for aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the situation of migrant workers in South Africa, the appalling conditions under which they work and the need for some sort of a training programme which would allow them to adapt themselves if they are driven by need to go into South Africa to work in the appalling conditions they experience there.  The situation for these people is atrocious and they have no lifestyle by our standards.  Their families, of course, are in a similar position.  Every day they face the fact that the husband or father is away working in slave labour conditions for very little money.  The unfortunate part about it is that this money is being earned in South Africa and they are contributing in the main to international companies which could not care less about the conditions under which these migrant workers have to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very disappointing, as Senator O'Connor said, that at the last international forum in Tokyo where the heads of all the major nations met, that the economic problems of these people, the problems of poverty and deprivation were not confronted at all.  The only major announcements that were made after that meeting was that every attempt would be made to eliminate terrorism from the world.  They did not define what they meant by terrorism and, as Senator Connor and Senator Ryan did say, what the United States and Britain called terrorism, people fighting for their just rights, fighting to establish themselves in their own countries, should not in any <Col N="1717" /> circumstances be considered as terrorism. There is an international terrorism which does not recognise borders and the problems of anybody but there are freedom movements in the Third World countries, countries of the Middle East, and when they confront governments from outside their States, when they confront corrupt governments within their own States in no circumstances should they be considered to be terrorists.  The underlying cause of a lot of unrest in quite a number of countries is that people live very, very close to the poverty line and it is very hard to expect them to conform to modes of living that we would expect in a society such as we have in Ireland or in any other developed country.</P>
    <P>The plight of refugees from countries like South Africa and from Afghanistan is addressed and the report says that in a submission to the committee, the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement have drawn attention to the plight of refugees in Africa and in particular to the situation of South African refugees.  It goes on to say that the committee note the distinction between refugees driven by hunger and those in South Africa or Afghanistan driven by political oppression and that it is felt that from the point of view of bilateral aid, action relative to the former is properly in the area of disaster relief. We learn from the report, too, that the Anti-Apartheid Movement has suggested that the latter category, members of which may well become their country's future leaders and administrators, should receive direct aid from the BAP particularly in the areas of education and training and that the committee feel that this suggestion is worthy of consideration and recommend that the Department of Foreign Affairs seriously consider its feasibility.</P>
    <P>When the plight of these refugees was being considered it was a pity that the plight of the refugees who are in UNRRA camps right throughout the Middle East and which were seen at first hand by Senator Ferris recently, was not also addressed.  The situation of the refugees from the political oppression of the <Col N="1718" /> Israelis in camps on the West Bank and in the camps in Beirut is horrific.  Through the efforts of Senator Ferris, the Department of Foreign Affairs did increase our allocation to UNRRA this year and the people in UNRRA and the people in the camps are particularly appreciative of that action.  It is UNRRA's role in the areas that are mentioned in (g) of paragraph 78 to direct their major attention to the areas of education and training and were it not for the education and training that these people get from UNRRA I am afraid that the very low level of sustenance that they have would be much less.  I sincerely hope that when the committee get out a future report they will address themselves to refugees driven out of their country by political oppression, that area of concern will be enlarged to take in countries other than South Africa or Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>The report is very important but unfortunately it is a report which is not going to get very much attention in the media or indeed in public debate.  As Senator Connor did say it is a pity the Dáil have not given time to consider many of the reports that have issued from joint committees of the Oireachtas over the past three or four years.  It has to be said that the present Government have done a reasonable job in the setting up of these committees and the committees themselves have worked extremely hard.  Of course all this good work is brought to nought when the Dáil does not take time to debate the issues involved.  Much of the legislation that comes through the Dáil could be strengthened if before the Bill were brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas the reports of the committees were first considered.  I feel there would be a much more balanced and educated level of debate and that legislation would be strengthened if the Dáil took the time to address itself to these reports. The Seanad has gone through 33 reports in this session.  The Dáil have debated three or four.  There is imbalance as between the Dáil and Seanad in debating reports from joint committees.  I would appeal to the Government to get into the business of debating reports not only <Col N="1719" /> from this joint committee but from other joint committees.  There is a joint committee on acid rain which has issued a major report which will not be debated in the Dáil but which is being debated in the Seanad at present and the discussion will continue, if not tonight, next week at a time when the problems of acid rain and air pollution are very much in people's minds.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I was not very much in favour of bilateral aid programmes because they can be tied too much to tit-for-tat bargaining.  &ldquo;If you support the way I think, I will give you aid&rdquo; seems to be the motto of the larger countries at present.  I sincerely hope that the Department of Foreign Affiars never allows itself to get into a situation where we would trade off the hunger and poverty of people in the African Continent for some minor gains in trade or jobs.  There is a suggestion in the report that a spin-off in terms of tying aid to the use of expertise or goods and services should not be an end in itself.  I sincerely hope that the Department will follow that line to the very end because it is essential that we in this country who have no colonial background, who have nothing to fear from being involved in aid to those who are deprived should give that aid as a right to the people who need it and not as a trade-off for goods, services or jobs.</P>
    <P>The report addresses itself to the idea that Ireland should, at various international fora, push the idea of aid being given to countries which need it for projects which will be of ultimate benefit to the people of those countries rather than to the donor country.  The Department of Foreign Affairs through the bilateral aid programmes and the NGOs who are working here have done a tremendous job in helping the people of Third World countries to sustain themselves and in giving them hope in areas where they did not have hope before.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of some of the work done by Gorta and Trócaire throughout the years.  Tremendous work is being done by teams from GOAL and various non-Government organisations. <Col N="1720" /> The work that they do is of inestimable value.  It cannot be quantified in terms of moneys donated for aid programmes. The work that is done by volunteers is done, not because they are going to be financially better off or because it is a job of work but because of the desire to do something for the people of the Third World.  Obviously, the volunteers work exceptionally hard.  They are dedicated to the projects in which they get involved. The results of this extremely hard work could not be valued in money terms.</P>
    <P>The idea of pursuing, in the international fora, the objective of a more balanced economic world order is one that we should not be afraid to address ourselves to.  Unless the First and Second Worlds do address themselves to the problems of the Third World the problems of the Third World could become so great that they would overpower the First and Second Worlds.  The people of the Third World are not going to go away. They are growing in numbers.  The birth rate in these countries is higher than the birth rates in the First and Second Worlds.  I would not like to express fear but there is a definite move towards militancy in all the countries of the Third World which could eventually break out and the consequences for those of us who live in the relative comfort &mdash; even though we might have our own problems &mdash; of the countries of western Europe and North America could be serious.  The debate was directed towards the localisation of aid projects.  The degree to which localisation should be allowed to occur is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>Fear was expressed in the report and, I think, in some of the contributions here that people from the Third World might not be able to take over some of the projects which have been started and brought to reasonable levels by the residents of Third World countries.  I would not have that fear.  Unless there was political or outside interference, if the projects have been developed in co-operation with the local inhabitants these projects can be brought to a very successful outcome &mdash; I cannot say conclusion <Col N="1721" /> because conclusion is not what we are after.  We aim at a situation where the project will be of ongoing benefit to the people of the area to which the moneys are being directed.  The situation of Third World countries is such that unless you visit them you can have absolutely no idea about them.  The unfortunate part about it is that the media presentation of poverty is a false one.  People are horrified when they see pictures of starving children and people on television.  They are horrified by pictures of starving children on the papers.  The scenes are horrific. In television there is sound and vision. The element that is missing is the smell of abject poverty.  Anybody who has not gone into a refugee camp or has not gone through a Third World country has no realisation of what poverty is like.  One has to go there and see it at first hand, one has to get the smell of death and deprivation.</P>
    <P>Water is something that we have rows about at county council meetings, about charges for it but the lack of it is one of the elements which make up the major problem of deprivation because sanitary systems break down.  There is no sanitary system if there is not water.  From birth to death the lack of water generates every type of horrific disease.  It is said that the people in the countries where they have not got enough water are dirty.  That is the same as saying that the egg inside a dirty shell is dirty.  The shell on the outside can be dirty but inside there can be something which is useful and beautiful and the very same applies to the people of the countries to which we have been addressing ourselves here this evening.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the work of the Bilateral Aid Programme is publicised more and that we keep up a reasonable level of contribution even though some people may feel that we have enough problems here in Ireland without getting involved in the problems of the Third World.  The problems of the Third World are problems that, unless we see them or live through them, are beyond our comprehension. People die of starvation as a matter of course, people die of starvation daily, people die of starvation not by <Col N="1722" /> choice and not because they have not got access to government services but because they just have not got food.  We as a small country, without any colonial background, can play an enormous part in addressing the international fora, in trying to get them involved in aid programmes which are for the benefit of the recipient nations.  We should use our influence in the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the EC to try to get the bigger nations to get away from tying aid to trade and services.  If aid is tied to trade and services it becomes charity and the people of Africa or the Third World do not want charity.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs over the past number of years have been doing their best with limited resources to secure the best value for the small amount of money we give in aid.  When I say a small amount of money, 0.7 per cent of GNP is the United Nations suggestion for aid for Third World or deprived countries and we are approaching that 0.7 per cent but, unfortunately, the bigger nations of the world are well below us in regard to aid to the Third World.  I read recently that there was more money spent last year in America on beauty treatment in hair salons and on facials than on aid to Third World countries. That gives some sense of the priorities in that country.  But they are not alone in their unfeeling attitude towards Third World countries.  Great Britain, Russia and the bigger nations definitely have not lived up to their responsibilities in the Third World and unless they do &mdash; there is no point in putting a time scale on it &mdash; I fear the Third World will rise up in a single tide and when that tide hits the First World I would not like to be around. I can understand the feelings of people who might develop a more militant attitude towards the type of world they live in.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the committee for this excellent report and I am glad to see that the next report they have prepared and which will be coming here shortly is a report on the apartheid system in South Africa.  Apartheid is a crime against humanity and it is essential that <Col N="1723" /> we discuss that report here as soon as possible and in doing so tell the Government of South Africa that even though we are a long way away from them, under no circumstances do we as a small country without much influence in the world, condone what is being done to a race of people because they are a different colour from us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with Senator Lanigan in paying a tribute to the members of the committee who have submitted this excellent report.  Seven Members of this House sat on that joint committee to deal specifically with the question of aid, whether multilateral or bilateral, to the Third World.  In dealing with bilaterial aid assistance we have chosen priority countries such as Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and the Sudan and members of the committee who visited these countries recently expressed satisfaction with the way our aid was being deployed to get the best possible response from the amount of resources we make available.  The committee assume that on present thinking an attempt may be made in the next two years to bring the programme in Sudan, Zambia and Tanzania up to the minimum funding level achieved in Lesotho which is £3 million in each case.  The level of funding in 1984 for Sudan was £.36 million, for Zambia, £.87 million and for Tanzania, £1.77 million.  These figures might sound considerable to us when we relate them to the overall budget figures available to us but in real terms they are minute when related to the actual problems that these people have in the underdeveloped countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Lanigan has said, it is only when one senses the problems on the ground there that one realises that these people just cannot be left to die of starvation for the want of assistance from small countries like ourselves, rich in generosity towards people in trouble.  We have come through traumas ourselves and we have come through famine and that has conditioned us to be compassionate towards other less fortunate nations <Col N="1724" /> in the world.  As part of the European Community and part of the United Nations we play a major role in elevating the awareness of our colleagues in other nations, much wealthier than we are, to the problems of these developing countries. Recently we were all suddenly confronted with the spectacle of Ethiopia. We had in the past assisted other countries prior to that.  There have been calamities throughout the world following earthquakes, floods and so on and we have helped them all but it was when the starvation in Ethiopia was brought into our homes through the media that we realised that human beings were dying for the want of people to take care of them or to take an interest in their problem.  For that reason alone we are grateful to people like Bob Geldof and his colleagues in the entertainment world who have devoted so much of their talent to sharpening awareness among all of us of the need to contribute in these situations.</P>
    <P>The Irish people can be very proud of what they contributed and proud of Bob who represented our view in such a way that he made world leaders sit up and take notice of the major problem there. He brought it to the very floor of the United Nations where, unfortunately, because of the power of politics that are applied at that level, small nations, particularly in the developing world, can go practically unnoticed.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the section which deals with refugees and while it does not specifically deal with the refugees under the United Nations subsidiary, UNRRA, I must point out that this year we have increased our contribution to the UNRRA refugees by 10 per cent, which makes a major contribution to a race of people who are homeless, who have no identity and have no opportunity to use their talents or even to do the basic thing of going to work.</P>
    <P>From having seen them at first hand I would suggest that the conditions in parts of Gaza are not unlike the famine days in Ireland.  They have been looked after by that subsidiary of the United Nations. Their allocation of funds is divided in consultation with the refugees themselves. <Col N="1725" /> Their first priority, out of very scarce resources, is education for their children and training their children to be competent and skilful, vocationally and academically.  Their second choice is the health of their fellow refugees in a health care programme and health advisory programme and all matters pertaining to the women in that society who have had the major task of bringing up large families in hunger situations.  Their third priority is food.  In other words, what is left over after the two priorities of education and health, they devote to giving food to people who are unable to provide it for themselves.</P>
    <P>Those are the problems that face the world in 1986.  People would need to see it to appreciate the difficulties they experience.  The Government have been generous, they have increased their allocation for this year and they have a commitment to further increase it.  In our four priority countries in which we try to deliver the aid that we have agreed we have followed the kind of policy that we believe will deliver to the people themselves the ability to look after themselves. At page 33 the report the priority infrastructural development projects are outlined.  They would devote 39 per cent of the aid to rural/agricultural production, 33 per cent to education, 10 per cent to infrastructure, 7 per cent to industry/trade and 5 per cent to health. If we look at that and see that, applied in that way, it can produce on the ground the results we want, we come to the point raised by Senator Lanigan, that our aid should not be tied in any way.  Indeed the committee were emphatic that at any future date our aid should never be tied to conditions.  Admittedly the Irish people can produce a type of expertise which, if we link it in as part of our aid, can produce excellent results on the ground.  At page 46 of the report where they refer to tied aid they are talking particularly about the kind of expertise that we can produce, deliver on the ground and help people to help themselves. In that way we do not expect anything in return but we will ensure that whatever we give them by way of expert <Col N="1726" /> advice and training programmes will have the greatest spin-off.  I want to join with Senator Lanigan and the members of the committee in saying that that is the only way we should tie our aid, that if the agencies dealing with these problems consider it should be done in any other way in the future then we should, if we are as generous as I hope we are, ensure that we do not put in provisos that it must be spent in any particular way.</P>
    <P>Part of the recommendations also for the expenditure of our Bilateral Aid Programme talks about research for agricultural development.  The multilateral assistance is developed mainly through the United Nations and the European Community.  There is a surplus situation in the European Communities at present. There are mountains of butter, massive amounts of beef in intervention, milk and wine lakes.  Because of the powers that be and the politics that are played at certain levels about the protection of the markets we are unable to move this food to people who are in need of it.  The Community, through the Commission, are now recommending that good productive agricultural land within the Community, including Ireland, should somehow be taken out of production. Farmers will be paid not to till their land. Farmers will be paid to be non-productive, to reduce production of those elements of food which are so vital to feed the hungry people.  Community farmers are being asked to either change their style of farming or get out of farming and leave land idle and be paid for doing so. Yet we send experts elsewhere to teach people how to till their land.  It is difficult to relate one problem to the other but they are interlinked.  We are fortunate that we can produce more than what we require in the line of food.  We can export food to developing countries, we can have GATT arrangements with the United States, we can have all sorts of inter-Community policies and yet we have massive surpluses and we are wasting public money in the Community by paying people to stop producing when half the world is starving.  We are sending out people to ensure that the developing <Col N="1727" /> countries are capable of researching agricultural development.  Somebody somewhere will have to address this problem. If not we could all starve because there will not be anybody left in a producing situation.  It will be uneconomic to produce. If that happens we could have a repeat of crises that have happened in the past in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>We have had one of the worst years in farming.  Animals have gone hungry and farmers have become bankrupt as a result of bad weather.  In our own small way we are trying to assist them from resources within the State and having access to Community funds.  There are millions of ECUs available to people to stop producing. I would suggest that in addressing this problem, the Department of Foreign Affairs should have regard to this and should continue to promote the idea within the Community and the Commission that there should be a movement of foodstuffs to people who need it which will not disturb the market price. These people will never be able to afford to buy it.  They should be as entitled to benefit as the Russians or anybody else who benefits from food that eventually has to be dumped.</P>
    <P>I commend the committee on highlighting the programme.  It is a programme we can be proud of.  By comparison with other countries and by comparison with our own gross national product, it is a reasonable effort to ensure that we are not unmindful of the problems of our fellow man in other parts of the world, particularly on the African continent where there has been such a devastation of life.  Those people are unable to fend for themselves because of climatic and political conditions, like the political conditions in South Africa outlined by Senator Lanigan where the ordinary people are suffering from a political system of apartheid that is totally unacceptable to all of us who have any sense of concern for the ordinary democratic process.</P>
    <P>It is an unacceptable political system and it is leading to violence which is taking the lives of the people of that <Col N="1728" /> country, not people who occupy the country, not the landed gentry, but the people who were born and reared there and who are looking for an identity and a voice in their own political systems. That whole continent is one of problems. The sooner white men realize that there are people of other coloured skins who are capable of looking after their own interests if they were left to do so the better.  By giving them assistance and expertise and with these bilateral assistance programmes that small countries like Ireland develop for them, there could be a future for the African continent.  I commend the report to the House and I hope that the other House get an opportunity to discuss this type of programme which is of tremendous importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an opportunity to speak at length on the report.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on development co-operation it is appropriate at the conclusion of the debate that some few words should be said to wind it up.  It falls on me to do this.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs who has responsibility for development co-operation for being with us in the main during the course of the debate in the House.  I also thank his substitute the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare for being here briefly this evening in the absence of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to all contributions from all sides of the House during the course of the debate.  I always find it of great value to hear what my colleagues have to say about development co-operation.  One of the things that struck me forcibly was that the contributions from the members who had been privileged enough or fortunate enough to go on field trips in the Third World countries had a particular quality which made them stand out, without wishing in any way to denigrate the contributions from other Senators who were not so privileged.  Those Senators who had travelled to countries where our development co-operation programmes could be seen and visited by them, and indeed Senators who spoke movingly of <Col N="1729" /> visits to refugee camps in the Middle East, though not the subject matter of the report, conveyed a strong emotional feeling that they had got from experiencing, at first hand, the living conditions of people in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that the majority of people in the world live in underprivileged conditions.  It is high time that those of us who are, relatively speaking, very fortunate remember this more frequently than we do.  The contributions from those travelled Senators had a quality of compassion and understanding and feeling and also a wish to see our development co-operation programme, and in particular our bilateral aid, develop and receive more funding.  This is to be welcomed. It has underlined the significance and importance of actually giving parliamentarians the opportunity to visit Third World countries and to see Irish aid in practice on the ground.  I concur with the remarks of Senator Brendan Ryan when he said that too often such trips are lightly dismissed as being junkets. This is not so.  As somebody who was privileged under the auspices of Trócaire to visit the Philippines recently, I state firmly that it is not a junket to share at close hand the lives of the poor, to sleep on a coconut mat in a shanty town, or to enter refugee camps to see death, hunger, deprivation and poverty.  It is an extremely telling human experience and one that I would wish more colleagues took the opportunity of experiencing.  It sharpens the perceptions and it brings about a keen awareness of what exactly the problems are in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to some remarks which Senator MacDonald made in the course of his contribution dealing with Trócaire.  He is not the only parliamentarian who has in the past expressed certain reservations about the particular role and functioning of that Third World body.  Senator MacDonald stated, and I quote from column 377 of the Official Report for 5 June 1986:</P>
    <P>I have been saddened of late to find that Trócaire are departing from the <Col N="1730" /> charitable role and perhaps would appear to be embarking on the murky waters of international politics.  Perhaps it is this liberation theology that prompts them to advocate strikes, lockouts, or embargos or whatever.</P>
    <P>He goes on to talk about sanctions and so forth and to develop the theme.</P>
    <P>In the context of development co-operation we have to recognise that there are many ways of going about the business of bringing aid and assistance and development to people in Third World countries.  Trócaire has chosen a particular role.  It is one of changing structures within societies, not from without but assisting people to see inequality and to arrive at solutions which are appropriate in the context of that country; to change the system and to bring about a greater equality.  This is a basic way to go about getting improvements and raising the standards of living of the poor.  It is teaching people how to fish rather than giving them fish, which I assume is the charitable way that Senator MacDonald referred to in the course of his contribution.</P>
    <P>From my albeit relatively limited experience of the work of Trócaire I approve of what they are doing; they are heightening awareness in the developing countries but more importantly they are achieving a remarkable distinction in their role in this country by bringing about an increased awareness amongst the people of the structural problems, both political and infrastructural, of Third World countries.  I commend Trócaire for their role in this.  It is important that this establishment group, backed by the Conference of Irish Catholic Bishops, should call for sanctions against South Africa; it is important that they should display their notices and billboards throughout the country pointing out the evils of apartheid and asking the people to address themselves to this, it is necessary that they should have a view and a voice and to bring them forward in the Irish forum.  Trócaire's work is no less valuable than that of Gorta or Goal or the many other agencies who work in <Col N="1731" /> the Third World with a slightly different <i>modus operandi.</i>  There is a role for all of these bodies to play and if they overlap or if they diversify in order to show up a different facet, so much the better.  We are all the richer for this and so are the people in the Third World countries when this multifaceted approach is adopted by our aid groups.</P>
    <P>All Senators made reference to the wish to see a White Paper emerging from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The report is an excellent one.  I congratulate all colleagues in both Houses who were members of the committee and in particular its chairperson, Deputy Nora Owen, and of course the secretarial staff who did a trojan task in preparing and bringing forward the report.</P>
    <P>The report will have a relatively limited impact.  I share the view expressed by Senator Lanigan that it is a great pity this report and so many others have not been debated in another place.  In the Seanad we have an excellent track record of addressing ourselves to important reports of select committees.  We should give ourselves a bouquet from time to time for our work rate and for the depth and analysis which we have put into the reports which come before us.  We can stand over that record.  Senator Lanigan mentioned a figure of something like a ratio of 33 reports considered in Seanad Éireann and three in another place.  This is a monumental imbalance and it is one that should be addressed, not by us of course. All speakers made reference to volunteers. They are dealt with in some detail in the course of the report.  I would just like to emphasise again the significance and importance of availing of the expertise, experience, insights and attitudes of returned volunteer workers.  One of the Senators speaking in the course of the debate referred to the possibility of a debriefing few days with either members of the Department of Foreign Affairs development co-operation division or some of the NGOs so that all that wealth of information and insight would be tapped and used in order to enrich, expand, develop and improve on our activities in the Third World.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> Reference was made by many Senators to South Africa, because Lesotho is one of our bilateral countries, and one cannot talk of Lesotho without reference to South Africa.  It goes without saying that I deplore the apartheid regime in South Africa.  I have had contact with it and been familiar with it for some 25 years and I grow daily to despise it more and more and to wish speedily for its demise. There is a further report &mdash; the third report of the all party committee &mdash; which is due to be debated in this House.  In a way I regret the fact that we are not debating it now when matters are so crucial in South Africa.  It would have been important and significant if it had been on our agenda now because, though we are due to debate it again in October, who knows what will have happened in South Africa in the intervening months? I feel there is a cauldron steadily and slowly boiling there which will reach the point of no return.  I hope that early in October we can get to grips with that report and discuss it in the light of current events in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Basically those are the few points I felt were significant and that I wanted to say by way of concluding remarks to the debate.  We have had in the last month two debates on Third World matters; one a Fine Gael Private Members' motion on the Philippines which was addressed by Senators from all sides of the House and also the debate we are concluding here on bilateral aid.  Both were valuable because although we are particularly preoccupied with our own domestic and constituency concerns, it is important that we would look outside the narrow confines of our own interests and realise that what we are talking about is one world &mdash; the family of man.  We need to keep that in a certain focus because by so doing our own urgent, pressing problems attain a certain perspective and that manages to keep us all balanced to some degree.  I would again express my appreciation and thanks to the all party committee and say how very much I look forward to continuing reports from that body.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the House for asking it do deal urgently with this motion, and in particular to any Senator who wished to contribute to the debate and whose contribution may be affected by this very short notice.  The Government had hoped that this Bill would be enacted before the summer recess but it has not been possible due to the pressure of business to have it passed through the remaining stages in the Dáil.  Given the urgency of the situation the Government feel that it should be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation from where it will be reported back to both Houses.  Indeed, given the fact that discussions on this <Col N="1734" /> Bill will be of a fairly technical nature I believe that this is the most appropriate course of action.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a new statutory basis for the making and administration of building regulations. The purposes for which regulations may be made under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 are those set out in the Public Health Acts, 1878 and 1890, and relate only to matters of public health and safety.  However, since the enactment of the 1963 Act a number of factors, such as the need to provide for energy conservation and for a more flexible system of building control as well as developments in the EC, have rendered the power available under the Act inadequate to deal with the range of purposes for which building regulations are now considered necessary.  Section 3 (2) of the Bill, therefore, expands the purposes for which regulations may be made to include not just public health and safety but also the welfare and convenience of persons in or about buildings. The regulations may also provide for the special needs of the disabled, for energy conservation, for the efficient use of resources and for the encouragement of good building practice.  Section 6 contains the provisions relating to the procedures for the administration of building regulations and for a more flexible system of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Draft regulations were first published in 1976 for comments.  Late in 1980 the evaluation of the technical comments was completed and an amended draft of the regulations was published in March 1981 taking account of the comments received. At about the same time a draft of a control system based on certification by the industry was circulated to all interested parties for comment.  Comments were received and following discussions with interested bodies further drafts of the proposed control system were circulated, the latest being in April 1982.  The publication of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry on the Stardust fire in July 1982 necessitated a further review of the content of the draft regulations and indeed another look at the proposed certification <Col N="1735" /> system.  The tribunal's recommendation that some form of approval by local or central authority would be required in relation to the fire parts of the regulations was particularly relevant in this regard. The tribunal considered that it would be undesirable to rely solely on a certification system where fire safety is concerned. The provision in section 6 of the Bill for the issue of fire certificates by local authorities takes account of the tribunal's recommendation in this respect. The building regulations themselves have also been revised to take account of other recommendations made by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals the relevant sections of the Planning Acts dealing with building regulations and sets out in one piece of legislation the statutory provisions which will apply to the control of the construction of buildings.  Section 2 of the Bill designates as building control authorities those local authorities which are fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the power to make building regulations and specifies the buildings to which they will apply and the purposes for which they can be made.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides the power for building control authorities to dispense with or relax particular provisions of building regulations in individual cases.  Power is taken in section 5 for the Minister to dispense with or relax generally any requirement of building regulations where he considers that compliance with the requirement would be unreasonable in relation to any particular class of building operation, works or material.  Section 6 of the Bill provides for the making of building control regulations which will deal with the control arrangements necessary to ensure compliance with building regulations.  The section provides a flexible power which will enable different systems of control to be applied to different kinds of buildings or to buildings in different areas or in relation to different provisions of building regulations.</P>
    <P>The provisions of sections 7, 8 and <Col N="1736" /> 9 enable building control authorities to serve a notice requiring action to be taken to ensure compliance with building regulations. Section 10 of the Bill provides for inspections of buildings by a person authorised for the purpose by a building control authority.  The power in section 11 for a building control authority to seek an order from the High Court is additional to that contained in the sections dealing with the enforcement notice. Section 12 enables the Minister to prohibit the use of certain materials.</P>
    <P>The building regulations advisory body, provided for in section 13, will be a body broadly representative of the building industry.  Proposed amendments to the regulations may be referred to the advisory body for their comments and it will also be open to them to initiate amendments.  Penalties for offences under the Act are generally similar to those under the Fire Services Act, 1981, and will depend on whether an offence is of a summary or indictable nature which in turn will depend on the different circumstances of each particular case.</P>
    <P>As a result of the existence of building bye-laws in some areas it is necessary as a transitional measure to provide in certain circumstances for the continued operation of building bye-laws after the date on which building regulations come into operation.  Section 20 is the general transition section but there is one provision, subsection (7), to which I should like to refer.  Senators are probably aware that, in areas where building bye-laws are operated, small building works, particularly house extensions, have often been carried out in the past without bye-law approval.  This has caused problems in house sales as evidence of compliance with bye-laws may have to be shown to intending purchasers and this caused hardship in a number of cases.  Subsection (7) covers such cases.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill provides a suitable framework for the introduction of a comprehensive and flexible system of building regulations and building control. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was completely taken aback when I learned after 2 o'clock this afternoon that it was intended to take this motion this evening.  I have a particular concern in this area.  I am a practising architect.  I am in this House through the nomination I received from the Irish Architects Society.  I have a duty to perform as far as the society and its members are concerned.  I was disappointed that I did not have an opportunity to get my notes which I prepared some considerable time ago.  This is rather unfortunate where an important Bill is concerned.  Luckily it does not happen too often.</P>
      <P>The Second Stage debate took place in the Dáil on 28 March 1984, 5 June 1984 and 19 June 1984.  I find it very difficult to understand that it must now be rushed through with such haste.  The Bill is an important Bill and I would certainly not want to impede it.  It would be churlish of me not to say that I have a certain regard for the Department of the Environment, from which I have often got help in the past from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  It was an unusual situation for the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge.  I thank him for his courtesy in postponing the debate for the few hours to give me an opportunity to read over the Bill.  Under the circumstances, unfortunately, my contribution will be brief and I will simply deal with some of the most important parts of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 13, which deals with the building regulations advisory body, this should be representive of all the parties involved &mdash; the professions, the consumer, the trade unions and, of course, the building industry.  The Minister should be satisfied that it has as wide a spectrum as is possible and that all the various interests are catered for so that no party would have a vested interest nor could any undue representation of influence be exerted by any party on the advisory body.  In this area reference might be made to the procedures adopted in the United Kingdom at the time of the Architects Registration Act.  All the existing bodies were given representation <Col N="1738" /> on the architects registration council.  An examination of this may be helpful with regard to the building regulations advisory body.</P>
    <P>I understand that low rise residental buildings are to be exempted from the control system, at least in the initial stages.  Of course, they will not be exempted from the regulations.  It will be necessary to comply with the regulations in all these cases.  It is simply that they will be exempted from the control system.  This might be looked at again to see is it advisable.  It is in this area that a high degree of control is needed because of fire fatalities and injuries which occur. When preparing my notes, I got out the records of accidents and fatalities in this area over the years but unfortunately I do not have them now.  The Minister would agree that a large number of serious accidents have taken place in this area.  For that reason I ask why housing should be excluded.  There will be no proper control from that point of view. As a result, local authorities will not have to do spot checks.  The volume of certificates will be reduced.</P>
    <P>It is important that people who have heretofore been in practice and carried out similar functions should not be excluded and care should be taken to ensure that they are included.  Otherwise they would be deprived of their employment and livelihood.  It is obvious that it is not possible to practice as an architect if the right to certify is taken away.  That is very important for a number of people. If people who heretofore had been engaged in the practice of design and the supervision of the construction of buildings are deprived of the right to certify, I can see the spectre of compensation arising.</P>
    <P>Most of the problem could be solved by the expeditious introduction of an architects register.  This is a fundamental area.  It is a very far reaching Bill, both socially and economically.  There is no point in saying it should not be rushed through.  After a lapse of two years, this latest rush is very difficult to understand. Even at this late stage, a hard look should be taken at some of these sections.  I am <Col N="1739" /> not too sure if the Minister clarified in his introduction speech why this course was being taken.  I presume it is because of the serious consequences that are involved and because it is a highly technical Bill.</P>
    <P>The building regulations are sensible and reasonable.  I should like to congratulate all those who were engaged in the drafting of them.  It was an onerous task while the language is phrased in legalistic terms and may present difficulty in many ways, nevertheless, it was a mammoth task.  There are people who suggested that it would be more straightforward and would cost the country far less to pay a certain amount of money for the regulations which are in effect in the United Kingdom but the proper course was taken, to deal with these ourselves. Everybody concerned &mdash; the Department, the technicians, the draftsmen&mdash;without exception, should be congratulated on the result.  However, difficulties may exist in the profession with regard to interpretation.  The problem will be greater in small offices where perhaps one individual will have to be familiar with all the details of the building regulations.  This is a task and a study in itself.  The larger offices will be better prepared, where one individual could be concerned with different sections of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The regulations, to a certain extent, have made building construction as we knew it in the standard texts and treatments obsolete.  Of course, this is progress and is unavoidable.  It would seem, with regard to interpretation, that this may end in the courtroom.  Therefore there should be an ongoing monitoring and assessment of the regulations.  I presume that this will be a priority with the Department.</P>
    <P>One extremely important consideration is the question of professional indemnity for certifiers.  It is becoming more expensive and difficult to obtain indemnity insurance.  This cost factor will increase the cost of building.  In this area, it is difficult to know with any certainty when indemnification will expire.  Does it <Col N="1740" /> expire at end of a year or can provision be made &mdash; I am sure it would be very expensive if it could &mdash; for it to continue indefinitely with regard to a particular job?  I am thinking of work done in a particular year.  I am sure the Minister is not in a position to clarify that but it is one of the areas of concern.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 16, which deals with penalties, it appears that these are very onerous &mdash; £800 fine and a prison sentence for making a simple mistake on a certificate or in the case of a conflict of interpretation it will cost £150 per day beyond a specific period and a term of imprisonment with a fine of £10,000 on indictment.  These are very heavy penalties. Further thought should be given to them.  In many areas there is a feeling that we are criminalising architects and builders.  This is regrettable.  As I understand it, the designer will have to prepare certificates where this method is adopted &mdash; a certificate before the work is started, a certificate when the work is in progress and a final certificate when the work is completed.  The builder will have to provide a certificate of completion stating that the works have been carried out in accordance with the building regulations.</P>
    <P>The practice of architectural building is today surrounded by so much legislation, expense and hazard that this move towards criminalising the profession will certainly be the last straw.  It should be carefully reviewed.  Those who drafted the regulations will prove to be a great help in relation to the constant monitoring of them.</P>
    <P>It is time that all the old bye laws were replaced, with all the changes there are in design and materials.  For example, with regard to timber frame construction, while it is not new by any means, the method is new.  In many other areas, such as drainage, plastic and PVC have taken over from earthenware and all the old methods are obsolete.  It is only proper that our standards should be updated in this respect.  The Department of the Environment and An Foras Forbartha completed the drafting of these regulations as far back as 1976.</P>
    <P>Public safety, as the Minister has told <Col N="1741" /> us, is very important.  Yet, as I mentioned in this House a short time ago, accidents continue to increase on building sites in spite of the good legislation we have such as the factories Act and other Acts. Despite legislation these accidents will happen.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to all those responsible for the preparation of the guidance manual.  This will not be regarded as a legal document in the same way as the building regulations will be. This is unfortunate.  Perhaps the Minister will look at that.  The guidance manual sets out to interpret the regulation and includes many diagrams and illustrations which are most helpful.  Unfortunately it is a rather expensive manual to buy.  I suppose it is a necessary textbook in third level education establishments and perhaps in second level schools also.  It is unfortunate that it could not be sold at a lower price.  Perhaps this will be possible in the future.</P>
    <P>The building industry is in a very bad way.  I never saw it so bad and there is no great prospect for improvement on the horizon.  Anything that would interfere with the industry and make the situation worse should be avoided.  With regard to the preparation of plans at present, architects and those in established offices have a problem because in many instances there are people who, although employed, are doing this work as a nixer. They have no overheads or VAT to pay. Established offices find it very hard to cope with that.</P>
    <P>I should also comment on the importance of the construction industry.  It would be unfortunate if anything was done to drive people out of this industry during the recession because when things pick up &mdash; I hope they will in spite of the portents &mdash; we want the building industry to be in a stong position.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, State, semi-State and local authority buildings generally will not be subject to the control system. This is a mistake.  Local authorities should have to apply for planning permission for schemes within their own areas. At present they do not have to do so. This would give the public an opportunity <Col N="1742" /> to participate in their proposals and plans.  A review of that area is overdue.</P>
    <P>With regard to certification there are always problems which the public would not be familiar with.  In my capacity as an architect I would on many occasions be asked to prepare a certificate of compliance and in some instances, for example, here a septic tank and well should be separated by a distance of 100 feet perhaps the distance might be only 99 feet, 95 feet or 90 feet and it is very difficult for an individual to know what to do in such case.  Do you refuse to sign the certificate because of one foot, two or three feet?  On the one hand you have an individual to whom the certificate of compliance is important and, on the other hand, to sign that certificate is wrong.  It is often difficult to come to a satisfactory conclusion.  If a house should be built, say 80 feet from the road and when I measure it it is only 79 or 75 feet, do I refuse to sign the certificate for somebody who, as I say, may be in a bad way?</P>
    <P>These problems arise and very often the designer has to make a very difficult choice.  With regard to the responsibility of the designer I am not too sure where this ends.  With regard to negligence it ends in the court.  I am not too clear about that.  There are practical problems in this area.  Where concrete is used, I might make a cube test of the concrete and it may prove satisfactory but that is no proof that the concrete used in the actual work will be exactly the same.  It could be different.  I know of one case where a one-inch mild steel bar was lifted and snapped.  There are always these contingencies that it is very difficult to cater for.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that we got such short notice about this Bill.  This is understandable under the circumstances and I want once again to thank the Leader of the House for his courtesy in giving me that little bit of extra time to read the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Bill has been taken off ice is welcome.  Since this Bill was moved in the other House and the Second Stage was passed, many people wondered what became of it.  The <Col N="1743" /> Opposition appealed, for some reason or another, for a delay in the passage of the Bill.  I am not too clear why they made this request.  However, it would appear that their request was adhered to.  However the Bill is now being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation. I hope that it will not take as long to get to that committee as it has taken to come through to this House.</P>
      <P>The motion before us is to refer the Bill to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation.  I understand we are now having a Second Stage debate.  I am not too clear what the position will be when the Bill comes back from the committee. I presume it comes back to the other House for Report and Final Stages.</P>
      <P>Section 13 empowers the Minister to set up a building regulations advisory body.  We are discussing in this House at present the Air Pollution Bill.  The building industry could contribute towards a reduction of air pollution and this could form part of the regulations.  I ask the Minister to have an environmentalist on the advisory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that we have not made greater progress with regard to the provision of facilities for the disabled in public buildings and in buildings generally. A lot of attention was given to this some four or five years ago.  We have been reminded from time to time to provide for the disabled in all future buildings. We have also been asked to make provision for the disabled in buildings which are being renovated.  There are a number of instances where renovations and building operations have taken place without adequate provision for the disabled. When this Bill comes into operation I hope it will bring about an improvement in this area.  The fire regulations were front page news in the recent past, particularly since the tragic Stardust event in this city a few years ago.  Again I am not happy that we have made adequate provision for fire prevention in the building regulations or bye-laws.  I should like to see greater emphasis put on this aspect of the regulations and also to see a publicity campaign with regard <Col N="1744" /> to educating our citizens on the dangers of fire.  From time to time there is a tragedy involving death.  Those who are closely associated with the victims of these tragedies fully realise how simply life can be lost through fire.  There are still great fire hazards in many buildings used by the public.  I take particular notice, when I go for socialising or entertainment, of the fire regulations and despite the great efforts of the local authorities and the fire authorities, there are still potential dangers and some of them not too far from this building.  I shall not name them.  Certainly I would consider them potential fire hazards and I would like to see the powers extended to cover existing buildings to ensure that all buildings used by the public generally, are as safe as is humanly possible from this terrible hazard which can have such tragic results.  A few years ago when I was leaving this House one night &mdash; when the other House normally used to sit until 10 o'clock &mdash; I was driving out the Merrion Street gate and down Mount Street when I saw smoke coming from an upstairs window.  There were no people in the street at the time.  There was a person coming around the corner from Merrion Street and while I knocked on the door of that building I asked him if he would get to the nearest phone and summon the fire brigade, which arrived within minutes.  I left the scene of that fire when the fireman smashed the upper window thinking that no harm was done except to property.  I was shocked the following morning to hear on the radio that two people had died in that room while I was standing there.  That happened very quickly.  There are many amazing instances that many of us could relate where death occurred from the smoke such as comes from materials that are in most homes and buildings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely say this to emphasise the danger.  I realise I am <Col N="1745" /> speaking to the converted but there are a great number of people who do not realise the danger of fire.  I would like to see a publicity campaign mounted &mdash; something on the lines that we have during the Clean Up Ireland Week &mdash; for a week or a month every few years to highlight the dangers of fire, to try to bring home to people that there are fire hazards in practically every home and that it is necessary for every family to have fire drill.  It is only those people who are closely associated with a tragedy or who live near where a tragedy occurs who realise how quickly death can occur.</P>
      <P>I have always held the view that we in Ireland have paid insufficient attention to the insulation of buildings and in particular our homes.  During the sixties and seventies there was a great rush to provide as many houses per year as possible. Indeed successive Governments would boast of the number of houses that they could build in each year.  A very necessary objective, of course, was to provide homes for those who could not provide homes for themselves.  I am afraid during those years in the rush to provide as many homes as possible and to get as much kudos as possible for the Government in power we got to some extent inferior houses.  I would have preferred, and I am sure that the vast majority of those who now occupy these houses would have preferred to have waited a little longer for the houses to give the authorities time to give a little more attention to the construction. Of course, it would add a little to the cost of every house.  The provision of a renting system in course of construction would have adequately compensated for the extra cost in the construction of the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is this my view but I have discussed this over the years with a number of builders and most of them agreed that insufficient attention was given, particularly during the sixties and seventies, when there was this great rush to boast about the number of houses being provided in each year.  In our climate, anyone building a house today would be well advised to install double glazing and I know that Government <Col N="1746" /> Departments and local authorities are reluctant to advise people of this mainly because of the cost.  Many of the houses that were built and some even today being built by local authorities were constructed without adequate insulation in the roof, which is far more important than double glazing.  I do not believe that the cost would be prohibitive of giving some attention to greater insulation in the building of houses.  I do not believe that the cost of double glazing or the cost of wall and roof insulation would be prohibitive and I am convinced there would be a saving over the next two, three, four or five years depending on the amount of heat that a family would require.  It would be a saving to the family and to the nation, because we would be conserving the energy about which there has been so much publicity.  During the great house building rush great inconvenience was caused to the families who eventually occupied houses which did not have insulation and in some cases had not open fire-places.  There was an anxiety for people to switch to oil central heating. In the mid-seventies we know what happened when the oil prices escalated and people found that they just could not afford to continue burning oil.  They were faced with the added expense of conversion to open fires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope that this Bill when passed will assist many people who are frustrated with the building by-laws, particularly those people with small and some with not so small extensions, which the Minister spoke about, who discover, when it would come to selling the house, they did not have proper bye-law approval for the extension. In many instances which I am aware of, it was not possible to sell the house. I am even aware of some instances where they eventually did not sell the house because their buyer had gone or their financial difficulty was over &mdash; I suppose they were the lucky ones &mdash; perhaps the opportunity of moving to another locality, <Col N="1747" /> either to improve their standard of living, or to improve their employment had passed them by because of the difficulty of obtaining by-law approval after the extension had been carried out.</P>
      <P>The Bill will expedite the building of houses, because certainly I know in the Dublin area the by-law office has been stretched to the limit in providing the best possible service.  In very many instances they were over cautious in giving bye-law approval lest there be a mistake.  I am not faulting them for that.  Certainly in my own local authority area they do a good job generally.  They do as efficient a job as is possible for them to do. Because of the work load many people had difficulty in obtaining bye-law approval. I would hope that this Bill when passed will ease the problem of obtaining by-law approval.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious to see greater regulations with regard to the provision of insulation and fire precaution and prevention and the hightening of peoples' awareness of the dangers of fire and how simply they can happen.  Very many lives could have been saved in the past.  People who were caught in a fire situation will be the first to admit that lives could have been saved if only people had realised the dangers that they were living in with regard to fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that this motion will pass here tonight but that after the summer recess the Oireachtas committee will examine the Bill and will send it back as quickly as possible to the Dáil.  Then, I am sure, it will come back to us here. Perhaps the Minister in his reply would let us know if that is the way it works.  I am not familiar with how Bills which are dealt with by the Joint Committee on Legislation come back to us.  The Bill will arrive here at some stage and we will have an opportunity to speak on Report Stage, if I am correct, and hopefully guiding, with our experience in local government the Minister and his advisory body of the future.  The Bill is lengthy and technical but it is an extremely important Bill.  Because of its importance, I do not think it should be put on ice again.  I <Col N="1748" /> would hope when the Oireachtas committee receive it they will deal with it expeditiously and return it to us so that we can make our final remarks on it.</P>
    <P>I, too, like Senator Fitzsimons, have not had an opportunity of studying the Bill in detail.  At the time that the Bill went through the Dáil as we all realised, it was put on the bottom shelf.  Of course we were so busy with other things, we did not bother to study it.  It was foisted upon us rather suddenly today. Not that I am complaining too much about that because the committee, I am sure, will deal with it in fair detail.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know if I am correct in saying that it will come back here on Report Stage and we will have an opportunity at that stage of saying something further on it?</P>

      <P>Again I would like to apologise to the House and to thank them for taking this motion at such short notice.  I do appreciate that somebody like Senator Fitzsimons, whose name is a household word in the building industry right across the country, would have quite a lot to contribute in this area.  It would be unwise of me or indeed any Minister not to heed some of the points he made.  He is an architect of some standing.  I have no doubt the points which he and Senator Larry McMahon have put before us here tonight will be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Both Senators raised questions which I will have to respond to regarding representation on the advisory board.  Senator Fitzsimons asked that it would be broadly based and that certain interests would not have undue influence on the decisions.  I can assure him that it will be a broadly based board.  It will be representative of all sections of the community.  Senator McMahon did say that there should be representation for conservationists and environmentalists.  These points will also be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to low rise housing it has to be said that what is proposed is a first phase of what will be essentially more detailed legislation.  It was felt necessary <Col N="1749" /> that the various authorities would first have an opportunity to familiarise themselves with and set up the systems which would be necessary to implement these regulations.  This is essentially the first step.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the Senators feel a little perturbed as to why this matter is being rushed through.  It is not being rushed through.  It is actually being referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation. The Taoiseach, in reply to a question on the Order of Business stated in the Dáil the reason why it was going to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  He said that the purpose was to ensure that the Bill would get greater consideration in detail.  The Government feel that this legislation warrants that type of detail. Events of recent times have shown this and both speakers mentioned the Stardust fire &mdash; and rightly so.  People are concerned and it was as a result of the Stardust report that further consideration was given and that there was a review of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many Members of the Seanad had done much preparation for this Bill and that it was foisted on them at fairly short notice today, but they will have another opportunity to discuss this. I have no doubt that the Senators will then have an opportunity to make their points to the Minister who will be here on that occasion.</P>
    <P>A further point made by Senator Fitzsimons was the effect the penal element would have on the professions involved in the building industry.  This is a matter essentially for the Minister for Justice. The Minister for the Environment already has been in contact with the Minister for Justice in this regard and an amendment has been circulated to that effect.</P>
    <P>I apologise to Senator McMahon for leaving during his contribution but the division bells sounded.  I have no doubt that when the Bill comes back to the Seanad each and every Senator will have sufficient notice and will be armed with <Col N="1750" /> the detail teased out at the Joint Committee on Legislation.  This should contribute more and broaden the debate considerably.</P>
    <P>There is a further plus by letting the Bill go to the Joint Committee on Legislation inasmuch as, unlike both Houses of the Oireachtas, the committees will still be functioning during the recess and we are gaining time by putting it to the joint committee.  Of course they will not meet every month but when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Legislation we met on several occasions during the recess.  By the time the House resumes in October I hope that some progress will have been made.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, with particular reference to Senator Fitzsimons, who is not a member of the Joint Committee on Legislation, what facility is available to him to make a submission to the committee for the Committee Stage because by the time this Bill comes back to this House it will have completed its Committee Stage and will be on Report Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with a number of points last evening before the adjournment and I welcome this opportunity to refer to more general areas of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I realise that this Bill is primarily concerned with smoke and sulphur dioxide. Indeed it has been claimed that it could be regarded as a smoke screen from the point of view that nothing effective will follow from it, but I have taken it at a more serious level than that.  Once again, I would like to emphasise that legislation is not enough in this area.  As I mentioned yesterday evening a history of legislation in this regard would not convince anyone that the legislation will achieve what it sets out to do and I refer in particular to the Water Pollution Act, 1977, among many others, and I demonstrated the failure in this area.  There is a well known song which has a section that goes like this:</P>
      <P>As red as the rose</P>
      <P>That in yonder valley grows</P>
      <P>As fair as the lily of the valley</P>
      <P>As pure as the water that flows in the Boyne</P>
      <P>My love is fairer than any.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the rose is still very red, the lily of the valley, I am sure, will always be fair, but unfortunately and sadly the water that flows in the Boyne is not as pure as it used to be or as pure as it should be.  Thomas Hood in that lovely poem &ldquo;I remember&rdquo; said:</P>
      <P>But 'tis little joy</P>
      <P>To know I am further off from heav'n</P>
      <P>Than when I was a boy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is little joy for me coming from the plains of royal Meath to realise that the waters that flow in the Boyne are not as pure as they might be.  The river Black-water has been raped through drainage schemes, unfortunately.  My point is that <Col N="1752" /> the Water Pollution Act of 1977, which was hailed as a very far-seeing important Act, did nothing as regards pollution of rivers and streams and I am afraid that this Bill will turn out to be the same.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the same situation with regard to litter.  There is a serious litter problem in the urban and rural areas of Ireland.  Recently through regulations the fines for those who contravene the Litter Act were increased but that in itself will not cure the problem.  The problem is in the hearts and souls of the people and legislation cannot solve that.  It will take a long time to resolve this problem and it will have to be an educational process. I mentioned also the Factories Act and the fact that there has been an increase in serious accidents and indeed in all accidents every year despite the fact that we have these comprehensive Acts.  Those who look to this legislation to cure all our ills in the area of air pollution will be very disappointed.  There is no finance available for this and, as I said last night, local authorities are in no position to provide financial assistance in this area.</P>
    <P>I referred last night to the deficiency in the Bill with regard to the control of traffic pollution.  This is a very serious deficiency. With regard to domestic dwellings, terraced housing, densely populated areas, in the winter months and particularly when temperatures are very low, fires are lit and the problem is aggravated.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic pollution, there is emission at breathing level or below that level which is more drastic.  We have it at all times of the year.  We have it in the centre city area.  Anybody who walks by College Green, over O'Connell Bridge into O'Connell Street is well aware of the situation.  The traffic spews out poison into the faces of the people on the street.  Yet there is no attempt in the Bill to deal with that problem.  We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to table amendments.  I am glad that we will have considerable time during the recess to look at all the areas and to table amendments.  We do not have the <Col N="1753" /> necessary back-up.  We do not have the proper facilities.  We are not in a position to get the proper briefing.  Even with regard to secretarial help, there is only one secretary for every four Senators. Everybody will appreciate how overstretched a secretary would be trying to cope with all the work.  It is unfortunate that we do not have sufficient help in this area. As I have already said, I belive that this is a Bill which we will have to deal with in great detail on Committee Stage.  I will be tabling many motions and amendments in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of noise, this was dealt with in that very comprehensive report by Dublin Corporation that I referred to so many times.  It is proper that that should be regarded.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to the control of traffic pollution, the Minister of State made the point that heretofore an attempt was made to deal with the situation by administrative means and that the Bill is going to change that situation by providing legislative means of complying with the EC Directive.  Unfortunately, administrative means would not be adequate to deal with the traffic pollution problem.  Therefore, the deficiency in the Bill is more to be deplored.  Traffic pollution is not just a question of insisting on proper maintenance of engines, supervision in that area, although that is important.  The whole feasibility of traffic diversion and traffic in relation to the central city area comes into question. This is a very complicated area and will not be easy to deal with through amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been welcomed by many people.  I pay tribute to Mr. John Reilly who is in the Environmental Health Section of Dublin Corporation and whose reports are so legible and understandable. I should like to quote his <i>Comment</i> in the March Monthly Bulletin:</P>
    <P>It is fitting that a new monthly environmental pollution report should begin its life by greeting a new piece of legislation &mdash; the Clean Air Bill, 1986.</P>
    <P>This will be an important enactment and is intended to form the basis of <Col N="1754" /> legal controls on atmospheric pollution for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is comprehensive in that it will apply to all premises, including premises belonging to or occupied by the State.</P>
    <P>It provides for controls applicable to both the industrial and domestic sectors; the first by way of licensing provisions and the second by powers to designate special control areas &mdash; or smoke free zones.</P>
    <P>It is intended that progress will be made in a methodical manner by having air quality management plans and standards.</P>
    <P>Its introduction and implementation will benefit every citizen.</P>
    <P>It will be welcomed by all who seek to improve the environment and aspire to a better qualilty of life.</P>
    <P>With regard to individuals and groups whom I have met and we in the Seanad have met and who had what I regard as a vested interest, they all welcomed the Bill.  All are concerned to get a better environment and a better way of life. Nobody wants otherwise.  I want to pay tribute to those I met by being so forthcoming and so helpful at all times.  It is important to have on the record that everybody welcomes the Bill and welcomes any attempt to improve the environment and to tackle the problem of air pollution.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a small paragraph from <i>Air Quality in Ireland, The Present Position</i> by An Foras Forbartha, which I found very helpful and which was published in 1984.  The continuation of this is included in <i>The State of the Environment</i> for the following year.  Following is the paragraph:</P>
    <P>The domestic sector was found to be the main source of smoke in the area, accounting for 81 per cent (12,900 tonnes/year) of the total with 75 per cent of these emissions originating from the combustion of household coal (Fig. 7).  Road vehicles contributed a further 14 per cent, much of it derived from the use of diesel fuel.  In regard to sulphur dioxide emissions the ESB <Col N="1755" /> power stations contributed about 65 per cent of the sulphur dioxide amount emitted during 1981 with 12 per cent from domestic sources and 20 per cent from commercial/industrial emitters. However, it should be emphasised that the 35,800 tonnes of sulphur dioxide emitted from the power stations are dispersed at a high level and so the 6,400 tonnes/year originating from domestic and also the quantities from the other sources will have a greater impact on ambient ground concentrations.</P>
    <P>With regard to that, it is clear from all the reports that I read in this regard that the domestic sector was found to be the main problem in the area.  Of course, this would not be the situation if the nettle had been grasped in time.  I was very interested to listen to Senator McMahon's contribution on the previous motion.  He spoke about the fireplace and the changes which took place in relation to the oil crisis.  I was also very interested in what he had to say about double glazing and insulation, but, unfortunately, the Government have never done anything in this regard to change the situation &mdash; no Government.  I feel that it would have been easy to encourage people through the educational process, through publicity and particularly through financial incentives by way of grants to install stoves or enclosed appliances.  It would have been in their individual interests because, as we know, they have much higher efficiency than with the open fire and yet no Government have attempted to do that.</P>
    <P>Even in the latest grant scheme in 1985 &mdash; the house improvement grant scheme which I have praised on many occasions as a very fine scheme, it has its drawbacks. By and large, it is a generous scheme and even there there is no attempt to influence people to install an enclosed appliance, a stove or a cooker. There is no grant for double glazing which is unfortunate.  It would be in line with Senator McMahon's contribution.  There is no attempt in any scheme of new house <Col N="1756" /> grants or house improvement grants to change that situation.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to blame the domestic sector, but at the same time, we must remember that the Government must take a considerable portion of the blame. I have been reading reports from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards over a very long time with regard to efficiency of fireplaces.  I spoke last night about progress in this area where efficiency has increased many times, particularly where boilers are installed, the efficiency is far higher.  But there are many areas where boilers are not needed.  In this situation a stove or a proper appliance burning fossil fuel, with many of those it is possible to burn smokeless fuel, would not be nearly as bad. It is wrong to blame the domestic sector. This was allowed to get out of hand.  If this had been done and if the Government had acted in time, it would not in my view be necessary at this stage to introduce a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to what the Minister had to say, this would be strictly within the administrative level.  Legislation would not have been necessary.  It is interesting, too, that this section I read also dealt with road vehicles and the 14 per cent of pollution which I mentioned last night. In passing, also I could say that many people feel with regard to Moneypoint that it is Dublin and places far away from it that will suffer in the long term.  When dealing with acid rain in my contribution I would like to refer briefly to that matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McMahon that the question of energy is very important, apart from conservation which he mentioned and which is most important.  It is something that we are only now beginning to grapple with.  I could mention any areas in regard to conservation, but I do not think it would be appropriate.  I agree with Senator McMahon on that.</P>
    <P>I also feel that there is a potential input available from many other sources.  The Government have failed to give financial encouragement in this area, for example, solar energy.  I remember not too many years ago it was possible to go into a hardware or builders providers store in <Col N="1757" /> Dublin to get a package which provided a means of heating the water for domestic purposes by solar energy.  It is no longer possible to do that, presumably because there was no demand for it.  Yet we know that there is great potential in this area.</P>
    <P>Wave energy, I am sure, has potential also and many of us in this House had representations made to us with regard to a particular scheme where experimentation was being carried out regarding wave energy.  There was not much that could be done, although, again, I felt that finance should be available from the EC for this kind of experimentation, and particularly for an island nation surrounded by seas, wave energy in the future must have great potential.</P>
    <P>Air energy is another area.  I remember in the last World War we had many houses with propeller-type schemes to provide electricity.  Indeed, near my own town of Kells one of them was in use up to three or four years ago.  I feel there should be more research in this area.  I know a certain amount has been done but there has been no great breakthrough.  As regards water energy some of the small rivers we have have been harnessed satisfactorily. In the area of conservation to which Senator McMahon also referred no grants are available.  There is no incentive. Only when the incentive is provided will we make any useful headway.</P>
    <P>With regard to natural gas, I am not altogether clear about the position.  I know from the reports that sulphur dioxide is decreasing because of the increased use of natural gas, which is a smokeless fuel.  According to an editorial in today's <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; and I am not going to quote it; I just simply want to refer to it &mdash; natural gas, in the way the Government have dealt with it, is costing the country a lot of money.  Many people would be dissatisfied with the arrangements about natural gas.</P>
    <P>There is no harm in saying, in passing, that a senior member of the Government resigned honourably in this regard.  If some of the money which the country is losing in this area had been spent in the areas that I mentioned by way of grants for enclosed appliances, grants for conservation <Col N="1758" /> and for the other sources of energy and for experimentation in this area, it would have been better spent. Remembering, and I stand to be corrected on this, that the Kinsale gas field has a life span of less than 20 years.  I am sure, when looking to the future, we will be very hopeful that there will be another gas find.</P>
    <P>Also with regard to the situations in estates, I note from the 1976-83 report on private house building in Ireland by An Foras Forbartha that use of solid fuel for central heating increased to a very considerable extent between the years 1976 and 1983.  Again, there were many reasons for this, the reasons which Senator McMahon has given and also the reason because the Government by reason of the influence they exercised with grants were determined to achieve this result.  It seems strange that having set out deliberately to do that and having achieved the objective, now in relation to this Bill, we seem to be arriving at a situation where we will try to undo all of that.  That is rather unfortunate and shows a lack of planning and a lack of foresight.</P>
    <P>I found many treatises and books on this subject very helpful: those which had contributions from Professor Frank Convery, the booklet produced by An Foras Forbartha, which I have already referred to, the publications of Dublin Corporation and, indeed, the Department literature. I could also mention, and I will deal with it later on, the publication by the Coal Information Service towards a planned improvement in Dublin's air quality. I found that very helpful.  One of the most helpful of these books was the <i>State of the Environment</i>, which was published by An Foras Forbartha.  The editor was Mr. David Cabot.  This was published last year and dealt with this matter in very great detail, as well as all the aspects of the environment.</P>
    <P>I should just like to refer to a few areas covered in this book, <i>The State of the Environment.</i>  Under the heading &ldquo;Air&rdquo;, it states</P>
    <P>air polution is difficult to define.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> In one definition air is described as being polluted when a constituent in the air is present to the extent that there is a significant hazard to present or future health, or to the environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 129.  It continues:</P>
      <P>The main implication of this definition is that an emission to the atmosphere is not air pollution <i>per se;</i> air pollution arises when the concentration of the emission in the atmosphere reaches a level which is harmful.</P>
      <P>By that, I take it to mean that pollution in the sense of being harmful to the environment would not include simple emissions, which in an accumulative way, would involve pollution.  The definition in the Bill is much fuller in that regard, where it states in section 4:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Air pollution&rdquo; in this Act means a condition of the atmosphere in which a pollutant is present in such a quantity as to be liable to &mdash;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(1) be injurious to public health, or</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(ii) have a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or damage property, or</P>
      <P>(iii) impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment.</P>
      <P>That is a far fuller definition of air pollution.</P>
      <P>On page 133 of <i>The State of the Environment</i> I quote the following:</P>
      <P>While full information is not yet available on pollution emissions in Ireland, it is, nonetheless, apparent that the combustion of fuel is the major source of air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that full information is not available.  It is unfortunate and unwise to go ahead with a Bill of this kind without having full information.  It illustrates that the push for the Bill comes from the EC Directive and is an attempt to show that we are conforming to this directive.  As I have already said, if we had taken and if we still take some steps <Col N="1760" /> in the administrative area, it would equally be accepted that we are making an honest attempt to comply with the directive.</P>
    <P>As I have said, overall, the picture as presented to me and as I understand it, is not a serious one.  I realise that it is an emotive area.  For some people it is very difficult to consider the situation objectively but those who would consider the graph which I have referred to on page 110 of last year's report from Dublin Corporation could not come to the conclusion that the situation is as serious as many people would want us to believe.</P>
    <P>This report also stated on page 133 that in the case of smoke the major factor was the level of consumption of solid fuel in the domestic sector.  I have already covered that and there is no point in going over it again.  That was because of the failure of the Government to deal initially with the problem, as the time passed.</P>
    <P>On page 134 it states:</P>
    <P>It is important to note, firstly, that figures for emissions are estimates, not measurements...</P>
    <P>Again, this is unfortunate.  Estimates could be very much off the mark.  Certainly in dealing with a problem of this kind we should have accurate measurements. That case is made by some of the parties concerned in this area.  We should have accurate measurements.  There is no excuse for not having accurate measurements. Estimates as a basis for an important Bill of this kind are not good enough.</P>
    <P>Further on the report states:</P>
    <P>The methods of estimating coal and other fuel consumption in Dublin, or any other estimates with regard to a basis for an important Bill of this kind is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Further on it states that the methods of estimating coal and other fuel consumption in Dublin or any other estimates with regard to a basis for an important Bill of this kind is not good enough.  Further on it states that the methods of estimating coal and other fuel in Dublin or any other area are not as satisfactory as one would like.  The only satisfactory way <Col N="1761" /> to arrive at the actual consumption of fuel in Dublin is to know exactly what is burned in Dublin and where it is burned. The thrust of what is said here is that, by and large, in many areas we have nothing better than an educated guess.  That is not a sound basis for an important Bill of this kind.  On page 137 it states:</P>
    <P>Although only about 12 per cent of the sulphur dioxide in Dublin originates from domestic sources, this source has a much greater impact on ground level concentrations because the height of emissions above ground level is an important factor.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with that.  I pointed out that it is a far more important factor with regard to traffic pollution; the emission is at breathing level and is concentrated for the whole year, not just at the times when we may have what is regarded as an inversion situation, we have it right through the full year.</P>
    <P>On page 138, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In the short term it is unlikely that nuclear energy or alternative sources such as biomass, solar power and wind will have any significant effect on the consumption of fuels as mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with those considerations and I feel that that should not preclude us from, even at this late hour, doing whatever is necessary to see what progress could be made with regard to energy from these areas.  Clearly, the Government have made a mistake in not trying to come to grips with possibilities.  We have the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards; we have An Foras Forbartha and we have many very highly qualified graduates.  If an opportunity were given to those people, while possibly in the short term there would be no great progress made with alternative sources, it is important to investigate the possibilities even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>On page 144 it states:</P>
    <P>If the use of solid fuel for domestic and to a lesser extent commercial space heating purposes continues to increase, it will inevitably result in a further <Col N="1762" /> deterioration in the quality of the air, in which case the 1981-82 concentrations could be repeated and perhaps exceeded, given meteorological conditions similar to those experienced during that winter.</P>
    <P>That needs to be qualified.  Clearly, if we proceed haphazardly, without making some attempt to encourage people to provide enclosed appliances then we will have a problem.  But if enclosed appliances, stoves and cookers, are installed clearly the situation will improve.  This should have been stressed in this book; otherwise people reading it might come to the wrong conclusion.  With regard to the directive the EC should be prepared to provide some finance for incentives in respect of these schemes.  After all, it is their responsibility to see that the directive is complied with.  In a situation where they have that responsibility I am sure that some finance should be made available to encourage the installation of appliances.</P>
    <P>With regard to acid rain the report tells us that in 1979 a conventional long-term trans-boundary air pollution convention was signed by 32 countries, one of which was Ireland.  Apparently the number fell eventually to 24 countries.  I am glad that Ireland is one of 24 countries who have signed a convention to deal with acid rain. I will deal with this on a later section.</P>
    <P>On page 152 it states that many members of the population may already have blood levels in excess of 4 per cent as a result of smoking, which is an important source.  I came across this reference in all the books and articles I read in conjunction with this Air Pollution Bill.  I suppose we are all familiar with the cliché that if God intended human beings to smoke he would have provided them with a chimney, a flue or an exhaust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>If God had intended man to smoke he would have provided him with a couple of extra lungs and an extra heart or two because smoking is <Col N="1763" /> very hard on these organs.  It is very hard to understand why or how intelligent people still continue with these suicidal tendencies.  I suppose it is some defect in a person's character, perhaps related to the area of psychiatry, where human beings are under stress.  It is something like a baby using a &ldquo;dummy,&rdquo; the only difference is that the &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; does not harm anybody.  But cigarette smoking, pipe smoking and cigar smoking harm the individual and many other people also. It is difficult to understand why people continue to harm themselves healthwise in this way.  It would be unfair to expect that a Bill of this kind could have any input in that area.  It is no harm to mention in passing that in all the reports I read there is a reference to the problem which is inherent in this country as a result of smoking.</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau could possibly do more work in this area.  I know that their funds are restricted but the bureau do very important work and this is one area where they could concentrate to good effect for the health of all the people in the country.</P>
      <P>On page 153 there is a reference to a recently published European study, carried out in 19 geographical areas of the European Community.  It lists those areas and it states, rather strangely, that the findings were contradictory.  Further on it states:</P>
      <P>The Report recommends that the now traditional epidemiological method for estimating the effects of air pollution, on experiencing different levels of air pollution &mdash; be abandoned. It is a methodology which, at current ambient smoke and SO2 levels, which have been achieved in many areas of the European Community by appropriate air pollution control measures, leads for the most part to confusing and arguable results even when all precautions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a rather strange, and I might even go as far as to say an alarming statement, that the current methods with regard to health, are more or less condemned with <Col N="1764" /> regard to consideration of epidemics in this area.  That is strange, first to state that the findings were contradictory and then that the methods applied at present and heretofore should be abandoned and there is no further clarification with regard to that.  On page 157 we are told: &ldquo;As yet, the EEC has not adopted air quality standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or nitrogen oxides in general, although a draft Directive on air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide has recently been adopted in principle&rdquo;.  We know that all these hazards and pollutants are also involved and I am sure there is provision in the Act to deal with them if the situation arises but by and large this Bill concentrates solely on smoke and carbon dioxide.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wanted to make with regard to that booklet which, as I say, I found very helpful.  I found it very well presented in a simple way and of course it deals with the whole area of the environment.  I want to compliment everybody concerned with the compilation of that booklet.  One of the groups who made representations to us was the Irish Fireplace Manufacturers Association. They are very much involved with regard to the provision of fireplaces.  In the letter which they sent me they stated that it is desired in every way to cooperate in the eradication of air pollution and to comply with any directives which will emanate from the introduction of the proposed Bill but the danger inherent in the introduction of schemes where chimneys are prohibited and open fires eliminated completely are causing concern to members.  I do not believe there will ever be a situation where a chimney will be prohibited or where a fireplace will not be provided and in a sense it is fair to say in passing that I feel that some of the vested interests in this area have overreacted to the Bill.  They see dangers which will never arise and certainly not in my view in the foreseeable future.  I can never envisage a situation where a chimney would be prohibited and perhaps I am wrong in that regard.  I spoke last night regard the place of the fire in Irish culture and Irish tradition and <Col N="1765" /> indeed I remember in my young days, a very popular programme was &ldquo;Around the Fire&rdquo;.  One of the stars of that programme was the late and great Albert Healy.  The fire has always been central in Irish culture and I cannot see the situation changing.  The group, the Irish Fireplace Manufacturers Association, point out that the open fire is the preferred option of householders for heating their homes, providing a focal point in most kitchen-livingroom areas around the country.</P>
    <P>I do know, like every other Member of the House &mdash; and the case has been very well made &mdash; that for most people it is not possible to buy fuel in bulk; they are dependent on small quantitites of coal at periods when the weather gets very cold and, as far as I am concerned, that situation will continue.  A situation where there may be some control as regards smokeless zones will I am sure be arrived at over a very long period.  It will be arrived at by taking maybe 4,000 to 5,000 households. Again I cannot envisage a very large area involved.  The point was also made in that presentation that solid fuel, be it smokeless fuel or bituminous coal can be bought in small quantities allowing the weekly family budget to be kept in balance thereby eliminating the worries of two monthly bills.  I have already mentioned that.  That is most important and would have to be considered with regard to any regulations the Minister might want to bring in.</P>
    <P>They make the case that the open fire provides more than a method of heating a house.  It also provides a natural ventilation system for a house.  I am very conscious of this and I know of many areas where, because of a want of natural ventilation, there has been serious deterioration in the building.  This is most important.  It is unfortunate that at a time when there has been considerable progress with regard to the design of fireplaces, their efficiency, the method of providing underfloor air for combustion, proper throats for chimneys, proper size of flues, that the fireplace does seem to some to be under threat.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that situation: I do not believe that time will come.  As I say, <Col N="1766" /> importance of the contribution they in the area where controls by way of regulation will come into operation there will be the alternative of the enclosed appliance.  I know that in the United Kingdom grants of up to 70 per cent of the cost were provided and in the case of disabled persons or where there was hardship of any kind, grants of 100 per cent were provided.  I am sure the same will have to apply here in the same situation.</P>
    <P>Extensive research and development work is currently under way in such bodies as Bord na Móna, Coal Distributors and the manufacturers of fireplaces. Raised hearths and fireplace fittings will result in the reduction of smoke because smoke, by and large, I believe is the result of incomplete combustion and the development of ways to increase efficiency will reduce the smoke.  The Irish Fireplace Manufacturers Association also point out that their industry is a labour intensive industry producing a product of high added value.  The industry employs people both directly and indirectly.  Directly 350 people approximately are employed in the manufacture of the product which is a guaranteed Irish product.  I would say from my experience that many more people are employed because I know in my own area, small factories in nearly all of the towns and in quite a few rural areas where fireplaces of a very high standard are produced so that the figure of 350 is a very conservative one.  If the situation does arise where the enclosed appliance or a stove will be mandatory this will not interfere with the fireplace manufacturers. This in time will become incorporated as part of the fireplace, maybe not as attractive as the open fire, but when I see some of the appliances with the glass fronts and the possibility of opening in front I personally would not be too worried in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Irish Fireplace Manufacturers Association that I understand their concern and their concern indeed would be my concern.  They have understated the importance of their association; they have understated the <Col N="1767" /> make to the building industry and the building situation both in terms of the product that is manufactured, the aesthetic quality of it and the functional design of it.  In all those areas they have seriously underestimated the importance of their association.  I want to assure them that I have their concern very much at heart.</P>
    <P>We had representations made to us by the Coal Information Services and I want to say that I found their booklet called &ldquo;Towards a Planned Improvement in Dublin's Air Quality&rdquo; very readable, helpful and, by and large, I would have to say that it helped me to come to a conclusion in certain areas with regard to this Bill.  I would like to refer to a few of them.</P>
    <P>The first point that is made in the literature which we received from the Coal Information Services is that a serious problem does not exist.  I would have to agree with that.  It is an emotive issue and there are people who have taken on messianic roles in this regard &mdash; I suppose there are people who do this in many areas and I am not denigrating them for that in any way &mdash; but to leave aside the emotive issue and to look at the facts as presented to us by Dublin Corporation in the environmental reports, as I have already said, I would have to agree that a serious problem does not exist.  Even if it does exist, in my view, it is in relation to the emission from traffic in the centre city area, an area which is not taken care of in this Bill.  In my view the serious problem is in that area if a serious problem exists at all.</P>
    <P>That statement by the Coal Information Services is factual and it is borne out by the reports of Dublin Corporation and again it is rather unfortunate that we do not have the latest annual report from Dublin Corporation.  The one I have mentioned dealt with 1984-85 and the 1985-86 report is not yet available.  It is a pity that the report is held up for the sake of being printed.  It reminds me of the very many areas where the ship is spoiled for a ha'port of tar.  I remember a few years back in the Ordinance Survey <Col N="1768" /> Office in Dublin, in dealings with the chief place names officer &mdash; indeed a very helpful individual &mdash; he was held up because he did not have a secretary.  Here was an important, erudite, experienced man in the area of Irish place names and he was inhibited by reason of the fact that he did not have somebody to do his typing.  I thought that was unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The booklet which we got from the Coal Information Services went into some detail with regard to the present situation in Dublin.  In that regard, the latest report for the past winter shows a less serious situation than that which was dealt with by the Coal Information Services.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention some of the points made and with which I would concur.  One is that the home should be inviolate.  That is important.  Personal liberty is the great privilege of a democracy and there is provision in this Bill to enter a person's home to get certain information.  I recall with regard to legislation related to the health tax, which I think was inflicted on this country some 30 years before the battle of the Boyne and continued as far as I can recall until about 1822, that there was provision to enter a person's home to get certain information. At the present time this is unacceptable and this is an area in which we will be tabling amendments.</P>
    <P>Certain sections of the city had particular problems &mdash; Ballyfermot is one &mdash; with regard to measurement of air pollution. I believe that the Semperit factory which manufactures rubber tyres has an industrial process which is intended to deal with the colour of the products and the point has been made, rightly or wrongly, that the problem there has nothing to do with the burning of fuels.  This is something that should be investigated; it should be measurable.  It is important with regard to this Bill and certainly before the building controls would be made for any area that there should be a very serious attempt to assess the situation exactly.  This is one problem area and an attempt should be made to look at the situation in Ballyfermot.  Rathmines I believe has also proved a serious <Col N="1769" /> problem.  First there was suspicion of a smelter and then it was discovered, I understand, that the measuring device was located close to the corporation yard where diesel engines are started.  This is a contention.  It may not be true but again we do not know conclusively; there is no scientific research and this also is important.</P>
    <P>The great polluter is industry.  Everybody realises that.  One cause of the decline in air pollution in England is the decline in industrial production.  The same applies to Dublin.  Dublin Port is almost free of pollution, simply because there is no industry there.  Last week I took the trouble of going down to examine the Dublin port area in relation to the Bill which we were considering at that time regarding the development of the port and docks area and it is easy for anybody who walks over that area to see that there could be no pollution precisely because there is no production, no activity, <Col N="1770" /> unfortunately.  That is the simple reason.  No fuel is free of pollution.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to argue that you can have absolutely clean air.  You can, of course, if there is no industry, no transport, no fireplaces because all of these pollute.  It is necessary to have a very balanced approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>As I said, with regard to the Bill there is no money to back it up.  In my view the most important aspect is the financial aspect.  In one sense, the Government, by not providing finance with regard to this problem demonstrate that the problem is not out of control, that the Government do not regard it as very serious.  In fairness to the Minister, in her introductory speech that was the main thrust of her contribution as I understood it.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 July 1986.</P>
