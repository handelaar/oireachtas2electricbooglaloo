      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for clarification by the Minister for Education on the principles by which teachers will be recruited and promoted in view of the recent statements from the School Managers' Association that conditions above and beyond professional training, competence and general suitability will prevail in the schools under their management, such schools being the overwhelming majority in the country.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Lynch of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the progress to date in the renovation work to the Garda barracks at Oldcastle, County Meath, since the matter was raised in the House on 20 November 1985.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme in West Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> The need for the Minister for Justice to instigate a public inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts into the circumstances of the death of Fr. Niall Molloy.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Higgins, Lynch and Kiely as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Higgins's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 10 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Lynch and Kiely may give notice for another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Senator Connor is too wide to be dealt with under the half-hour Adjournment procedure.  In the circumstances.  I must rule that the matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, as on the Order Paper. It is proposed to have a tea break between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  I should like to advise the House that agreement has been reached on No. 10, to be taken tomorrow between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  It is the all-party motion on apartheid in South Africa.  It will be taken earlier, if the business ordered for tomorrow has been concluded before that time.  If the business has not been concluded we will interrupt it at 5 p.m.  A Minister will be available to respond.  It has been agreed also that there will be a ten-minute contribution from each group in the House. How the ten minutes will be taken up is a matter for the groups &mdash; they can divide the time between two speakers if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to No. 7 on the Order Paper.  I appreciate that agreement was reached last week on the business to be taken before the adjournment of the House. That agreement did not include No. 7. During the weekend I tried to reach <Col N="1885" /> agreement with the various groups to take the initial stages of Second Stage of the Status of Children Bill, 1986.  I still hope to get agreement and to be able to announce it tomorrow morning on the Order of Business.  The intention is that at least one speaker from each side would contribute, the Bill having been introduced by the Minister.  Then we would adjourn the Second Stage debate until after the summer recess.  I hope to be able to get agreement during the afternoon about when we will take that Bill tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreement on the Order of Business for today and that No. 10 will be taken tomorrow.  However, I suggest to Senator Ferris that it is wrong that the Status of Children Bill should be introduced in the manner proposed. The Senator said we may have an opening statement from the Minister involved and one from each side of the House.  This Bill has been awaited for years by many people because it affects the lives of many people throughout the country.  I cannot understand why, immediately before the summer recess which will take us, from what we can gather, to October, it is proposed to take only the opening stage of the Bill.  The Bill should either have been introduced earlier in the session or left over until it can be adequately dealt with in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the value of having opening speeches which may or may not give publicity to the Minister just before the summer holidays.  That seems to me to be the only purpose of the proposal.  We want to see a speedy discussion of the Bill.  The attitude of this side of the House will be constructive.  The Bill contains many technical points.  It is necessary to regularise problems regarding the status of children.  Many problems will arise as a result of this Bill because of succession and property rights and the rights of parents and children.  I appeal to the Deputy leader of the House to accept that we will deal with this Bill in a very constructive manner when it comes before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  The Bill is very comprehensive and the intention is to launch it so that it will attract further examination and discussion over the summer period.  It is a very complicated Bill containing over 50 sections.  Therefore, it should not be rushed.  It is a good idea to introduce it.  We would then have time to study it at our leisure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse what Senator Lanigan said.  I do not understand why this Bill is being taken in part. I do not understand why it cannot be taken this week and next week, because it is a Bill of some urgency.  I got up for the final time this session to ask about item No. 14.  Over the year we have had constant assurances, nods and winks and reassurances from both the Deputy Leader and the Leader of the House that this Bill would come up at a suitable time. I gather this is part of Government policy and the only reason why it cannot be introduced is that there is no time.  We have three and a half months to introduce it.  Why can we not take it this week or next week?  Why can we not take the Air Pollution Bill and the Status of Children Bill next week?  What I do not accept is the leader of the House saying we have not taken it for two years because we have not had the legislative time to do so. Not having legislative time is no excuse whatsoever for not taking any legislation. We could take one month's holiday instead of two and a half.  I would like to know from the Leader of the House now what the intention of the Government is about the abolition of capital punishment, whether they intend to abolish it, whether they intend to duck it, or whether they intend it not to be brought up for another year until they go out of office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Ross said about the abolition of the death penalty.  This has come up on the Order of Business on several occasions.  On nearly all occasions assurances have been given that it would be ordered shortly for decision.  A consensus now exists in the House and in the country. We should dispose of it.  On Senator Ross's point, as to the merits and demerits of listening to opening speeches as opposed to a full discussion on the Status of Children Bill, I feel almost provoked to make the remark that when a Status of Children Bill was introduced by other Senators and myself 11 years ago, we needed a longer period of time for people to make up their minds that they could support it.  Maybe on this occasion we are reflecting an evolution in social thinking in that we may all be of one mind about passing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan that it would not serve much purpose for the Minister to move the Status of Children Bill followed by a speaker from each side and adjourn the debate until after the summer recess.  After the summer recess we might have a different Minister, a different Government or a different Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I mentioned that negotiations were continuing in order to reach agreement.  I would like to reach agreement if at all possible. Senator Lanigan will be aware of the consultations I had with the representative of his party over the weekend.  There will be no objection from this side of the House to finishing Second Stage of the Bill.  It was indicated that many people want to contribute on this legislation. Therefore, I confined myself to getting whatever contributions were required from the individual groups but I would be open to the suggestion to carry on discussing Second Stage of the Status of Children Bill tomorrow and Thursday, if necessary though it was intimated to me that that was not the wish of Members from various sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> I welcome Senator Lanigan's commitment to a constructive debate on what we all agree, as Senator Michael D. Higgins said, is a very important piece of social legislation and one that has evoked a certain interest.  Since the result of the referendum particularly, people have been anxious about the status of children and what exactly the legislative arm of the Oireachtas intend to do about this question.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with some of the problems which have been raised.  I hope that during the day, with continuing discussion and dialogue with my colleagues, we can reach agreement.  For the benefit of Senator Ross, I had discussions with Senator McGuinness over the weekend and she represents the independent group on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  She intimated that the independent grouping would have no objections but would have reservations about completing Second Stage because all of them, like Senator Ross, want to contribute on this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Senator Ross's comments on item No. 14.  I share all the sentiments he expressed on the abolition of the death penalty.  I took the opportunity on the occasion of the anniversary of the setting up of Amnesty International to make a special plea to the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Members of this House regarding No. 14 and I asked when it was likely that Second Stage would be resumed and whether the Government will introduce their own Bill.  I had a positive and constructive response from the Minister for Justice in this regard. This Bill is a replica of the Government Bill which is presently before the Cabinet. Until such time as that has been cleared by the Cabinet I have no idea whether we will be taking this Bill or a new Government Bill.  There is a commitment, for the Senator's information, from the Government either to introduce their own Bill or to continue this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not privy to all the Cabinet discussions but I understand this <Col N="1889" /> matter was referred to ten days ago by the Minister for Justice when he said it would be decided on within the next number of weeks.  I take it, then, that as soon as the Cabinet have an opportunity to discuss it, agreement will be reached as to whether they will introduce their own Bill.  If they do, I hope the Bill will be initiated in this House, particularly as we have before us a Second Stage Bill dealing with the issue.  I hope to continue discussions during the day to reach agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil Éireann has made the following Order:</P>
      <P>That the Building Control Bill, 1984, be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation pursuant to paragraph (1) (e) of that Committee's Orders of Reference.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Building Control Bill, 1984, be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation pursuant to paragraph (1) (e) of that Committee's Orders of Reference.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will remember that we agreed to this proposal last week. This is an expediency motion to set up the process of referring the Building Control Bill, 1984 to the Joint Committee on Legislation in compliance with the committee's orders of reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unusual motion.  From my experience in the House I cannot recall a precedent for a Bill being discussed through to the completion of Second Stage in the other House and then come before us by way of motion, as is the case here.  I made clear last week that I had a particular concern in this area.  I understand that it would not be in order to discuss the Bill <Col N="1890" /> as we have completed that discussion but I can refer to the motion before us.  I made it clear on the last occasion that I have a particular interest and concern in this area.  It is a very important Bill.  I am a practising architect, nominated to be a Member of this House by the Irish Architects Society; therefore I have a very particular interest in this Bill.  I was very disappointed, as I made clear last week, that I did not get a proper opportunity to consult my notes.  Nevertheless, it is a very important Bill and I would not want to hold it back in any way.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution did not make it clear why this procedure was being adopted in this case.  I would like to ask that question of him if it is in order. I would also like to refer to paragraph (1) (e) of the order of reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation which states:</P>
      <P>to consider any Bill referred to it by either House with the concurrence of the other;</P>
      <P>Why was this procedure adopted in this case?  The final question is in relation to paragraph (7) of the orders of reference which states:</P>
      <P>That any Member of either House may attend and be heard in the proceedings of the Joint Committee or a sub-committee in relation to a matter comprehended by paragraph (1) (a), subject to the prior consent of the Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>In view of my special concern in this area, will I be afforded an opportunity to appear before the joint committee with regard to any matter which I would consider important enough to raise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, as a member of the Joint Committee on Legislation, to remind the House that we did adopt a procedure similar to this in the case of the Bankruptcy Bill, which was hanging around for many years and which had not been dealt with by either House in Committee.  It has now been dealt with fully by the joint committee. The Committee Stage in both Houses has been completed and the Report Stage is <Col N="1891" /> now before the Dáil; it will come back to us for Report Stage later.  The system worked very well.  In extremely technical matters, even in matters of more widespread interest than building regulations but not necessarily of more importance, the Committee Stage of Bills in this House is becoming the preserve of one or two people.  I do not think that is good. The House should not get into a situation where, for long periods of time it is meeting in public, it should only be the preserve of one or two people.  Very technical legislation seems to accentuate that problem.  I am in favour of very technical legislation such as this and perhaps the Companies (Amendment) Bill &mdash; the Bankruptcy Bill was a good example of it &mdash; being sent to Joint Committees for examination by them.</P>
      <P>While obviously I cannot commit the Joint Committee to anything, I know that the attitude of the members of that committee is at all times to let all Members of the House participate fully in their discussion.  For example, while the Bankruptcy Bill was being discussed, facilities were made available to enable the Opposition spokesman on justice &mdash; who was not a member of the joint committee &mdash; to have the right of audience on the joint committee and its committees, including the committee considering bankruptcy. That was done and it worked very satisfactorily indeed.  I do not think there is any problem in getting the kind of facilities the Senator requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that it was the intention of all parties in this House that the membership of a joint committee should not be permanent.  It was specifically the intention that when a Bill of a particular importance and of technical detail was being considered by a joint committee the membership of the committee representative of a party should be changed to reflect that fact.  I have no doubt that full participation other than voting participation will be available to any Member of the House who wants to exercise it.  In addition to that, most Members will in respect of a non-controversial committee like a Committee on <Col N="1892" /> Legislation be able to arrange a transfer with another committee, should they require to get more involved, including the right to vote.  I do not think any Member should have a difficulty in that regard.  It is sensible, to use the Joint Committee on Legislation for exercises like this and it worked very well in the area of bankruptcy where no progress had been made for over 20 years.  For all these reasons the decision to refer this Bill to the joint committee, as proposed in the motion is one which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Senator Fitzsimons in connection with obtaining some guidance from the Leader of the House with regard to the referring of this Bill to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  I have a different view to Senator O'Leary's regarding that committee. It is a talking shop.  We recently brought it to the notice of the Minister that under the terms of reference we cannot make any recommendations to the Minister.  We have a very able committee who have heard submissions on various Bills but in the final analysis we are unable to take decisions and make recommendations to the Minister.  While it may be that the Committee Stage of any Bill in this House is the preserve of a few, if we had a widespread Committee debate our productivity in this House would be nil.  The productivity in the Joint Committee on Legislation is nil.  We listen to submissions from the bodies concerned with the legislation that is going through the House but at no time are we allowed to make recommendations of any sort to the Minister.  Until the terms of reference are changed, I cannot see any reason for referring this legislation to that committee.  It is only a delaying tactic, in my view.  It will stagnate for months during the Recess.  About this time next year it may surface again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would share the views of Senator Fitzsimons.  Of course, he has the right to attend the Joint Committee on Legislation and make his submissions in the same way as any group or individuals who request to be heard.  The committee has <Col N="1893" /> no productivity and no right to make recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this motion but the area has been broadened sufficiently to suggest that the Committee Stage of Bills in this House would be done away with, that the joint committees would take over the Committee Stage of Bills and that we would go directly from Second Stage in the Houses to Report Stage.  When this was agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in both Houses the implications were not adequately addressed. It would be wrong if Committee Stage was given over to a committee.  It is a committee of the House, but it is not the House.  All Members of this House should have the right to address themselves to the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary said that of course the spokesperson for each group would have the right to attend and speak at these joint committees but that is limiting the rights of the Senators.  It is not alone the spokespeople for a particular grouping who would generally have an interest in a Bill.  For instance in the case of the Building Control Bill it would mean that Senator Fitzsimons would not have the right, because he is not the spokesman on that matter, to go into the joint committee, to address it, to query the Minister or to vote in that committee.  Doing what is proposed here would mean a diminution of the rights of Senators and of the control of this House in dealing with Bills.  I sincerely hope we will get an adequate reply from the Leader of the House.  If we do not get an adequate reply, we cannot accept this message from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to all the contributions on this motion. The motion reflects the decision of last week's sitting of the Seanad and the resolution which was passed by the Dáil. When we discussed this last week we dealt in detail with the problems that had been raised.  Senator Fitzsimons expressed <Col N="1894" /> his reservations.  At the winding up of that decision last week I clarified the matter for the benefit of Senator Fitzsimons. I said that because he had a special interest and expertise in this area I hoped he would be afforded every opportunity to make a submission and contribution in the Joint Committee on Legislation when they are dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The Cathaoirleach intimated that it was a matter for the committee. We were at one in suggesting that Senator Fitzsimons, and indeed any other Member who has a special interest, would be facilitated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee in receiving submissions, in listening to submissions and allowing Members to make a full contribution. I do not share the comments of Senator O'Toole that the Joint Committee on Legislation is just a talking shop.  It has a specific statutory role to fulfil under the Standing Orders of this House and the other House.  This Bill is not just something for the convenience of the Minister.  This is a Bill from the Houses of the Oireachtas, being referred to a Joint Committee to discuss the Committee Stage of the Bill because it is highly technical.  I understand that last week it was agreed that the sections that were worrying people were so technical it would need a special sitting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation to deal with the technicalities of the Bill. The Bill, as I understand it, will come back from that committee amended and it will come before this House for Report Stage.  Members will be afforded an opportunity to further amend it then if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Building Control Bill, 1984 has lain dormant for some years because it had not addressed itself to the problem of the amendments that were required on Committee Stage.  The other House wisely decided on this occasion that this Bill needed that action to be taken.  Other than that, I share all the views of the other Members of the House on both sides that I would not like to see this as a precedent for legislation generally.  This House has addressed itself adequately and diligently at all Stages of legislation. <Col N="1895" /> It has proved over the last three months that it is a House worthy of note and certainly much more worthy of recognition than it gets from many quarters.  We have done some excellent work.  We have changed Bills radically, dramatically and correctly.  We have changed Bills that have come from the other House in areas where we considered it necessary.  As Deputy Leader of the House I defend the right of this House to do so.  I hope when this section of the Bill comes back from the Joint Committee on Legislation it will be subject to our final perusal on Report Stage.  I hope that agreement can be reached.  We agreed last week and this is a final, formal technical step to set up this motion so that it can be referred to the committee.</P>
    <P>May I assure the House of the Minister's statement last week, that although the Houses of the Oireachtas are in recess for the summer the committees of the House are not.  The committee dealing with this legislation will be dealing with it through the summer months.  That is what I understood last week from the Minister and I just want to put it on the record of the House in case anyone may think that matter will lie dormant for another 12 months.  There would be no useful purpose served by that.  I am looking forward to this coming back to the House in its amended form so that we can continue our discussions on it.</P>

      <P>What is the constitutional situation arising from the referral of a Bill to a joint committee which precludes the whole membership of the Seanad from addressing itself to Committee Stage of any Bill?  Under the Constitution, as a Member of this House I have the right to discuss any Stage of any Bill.  I would like to have a ruling now on that.  The Constitution states that the Houses of the Oireachtas will address themselves individually to the Bills put before them through all Stages.  I think that the Constitution is being overruled here by this ruling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Orders of Reference of the <Col N="1898" /> Joint Committee on Legislation be amended by the deletion of the existing paragraph (14) and the substitution of a new paragraph (14) as follows:</P>
    <P>(14) That the Joint Committee, or a sub-committee appointed by it pursuant to paragraph (2), shall be empowered to take evidence in public for the purposes of paragraph (1) (d) and that the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish from time to time minutes of such evidence together with such related documents as it sees fit,'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under paragraph 14 of the existing orders of reference, the Joint Committee on legislation were empowered to take evidence in public for the purpose of their law review function and to formulate proposals for law reform &mdash; paragraph 1(d) of the general enabling paragraph in relation to the law review function.  The present amendment requested by the joint committee proposes to extend the power to take evidence in public for the purpose of this law review function, paragraph 1(d), to a subcommittee appointed by the joint committee.  The joint committee requested the amendment because they felt there was a limitation on their ability to operate their law review function by way of subcommittee under the existing orders of reference under the terms of the motion, only the joint committee would be empowered to print and publish minutes of evidence taken before the subcommittee.  The subcommittee will not have this power.  I hope that is clear to Members.  This is a request from the joint committee to set up a subcommittee to review this law review function.  I understand this was discussed and agreed.</P>

      <P>Since Senator Ferris is au fait with what happens in the Joint Committee on Legislation and knows the workings of that committee even though he is not a member, would he tell me what he means by taking evidence in public as against the system that obtains at the moment?  Would he elaborate and tell the House what it is intended the <Col N="1899" /> subcommittee will do in the future?  What does he mean by &ldquo;taking evidence in public&rdquo;?  I would like to hear what the Senator has to say in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of one Oireachtas joint committee and I am aware only of their functions but I read the reports of all the other committees, although I am not a member of them.  I suggest that Senator O'Toole do likewise and then he will see exactly what they do.  This committee suggest that there is a limitation on their ability to set up a subcommittee to receive evidence or submissions. The committee can do this but they want to extend the power to a sub-committee. If the subcommittee wish to summon somebody before them in the interests of the proper functioning of their committee, they want to have the power of the Oireachtas as set down in Standing Orders to do so.  The existing Standing Orders do not permit the committee to do this.  They have made a formal request, which has been agreed by another House, that this additional power be extended to them by this House.  Committees function only with the approval and the agreement of this House, which answers the last question Senator Lanigan asked.  If this House agrees to refer something to a special committee or to an Oireachtas joint committee, then that power is conferred, but if this House does not agree to a motion the House continues its business in the normal way.  Because certain technical amendments might need to be discussed, requests may come from either House of the Oireachtas to address a particular piece of legislation in this way. That is the reason the Oireachtas joint committee have requested this amendment to their standing orders.  All parties are represented on that committee in accordance with their strength in either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the views being expressed by Senator O'Toole and Senator Lanigan will also be expressed in the committees. There is no particular advantage to any party in referring specific items to or by <Col N="1900" /> increasing the powers of subcommittees, because all reports come back to us for discussion and decision, and when they amend legislation, the legislation comes back to us for further discussion and amendment, if necessary, before it becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will remember that during the Second and Committee Stage debates I made the point on a number of occasions that I was concerned at the lack of representation for the workforce and the labour force generally, on the Shannon Port Authority. I was also concerned that, given the composition of the authority it would be impossible to have any member representative of the workforce or the labour force generally appointed to the board of management under the procedures set down in section 5.  I said that this appeared to be not in keeping with the spirit of legislation enacted in the Oireachtas since 1977 and certainly could be seen to be insulting to the labour movement and the workforce of the harbour Authority at Shannon in particular.  I made the point that the matter is not of relevance to just the Shannon Ports Authority but could, given the content of the Minister's Second Stage speech, be relevant also to other port authorities who will come to be reconstituted under section 15 of the Bill.  In these amendments I am attempting to increase the labour representation on the Shannon Ports Authority and to ensure through a further amendment that there will be labour representation on the board of management which, as we know from our previous debates, is perhaps the more important institution of the two in terms <Col N="1902" /> of the day-to-day functioning of the port area.</P>
      <P>The amendments which I have put down are designed in the first instance to ensure that the labour force of the Shannon Ports Authority will have at least four labour members.  I hasten to add at this stage, lest there be any misunderstanding, that I am not talking about Labour Party members but representatives of the workforce and the labour movement generally.  There should be at least four such members on the Shannon Ports Authority who at present comprise 21 members and who under section 4 of the Bill offer the possibility of only two out of 21 members of the Shannon Ports Authority being representative of the labour movement.</P>
      <P>Second, I want to ensure that in the board of management the workforce will have at least two representatives out of a total of nine as proposed in my amendment.</P>
      <P>Those two suggestions must be seen by reasonable people to be reasonable proposals because in the case of the Shannon Ports Authority, if my amendment were to be enacted by the House the labour force would have only four representatives out of 23 which cannot be assumed to be in the least outrageous or indeed even novel in the context of public bodies throughout the country, and in the context of the board of management the labour force would have two members out of a total of nine, again not an outrageous or extraordinary suggestion. Indeed, the extraordinary aspect of the whole matter is that in drafting sections 4 and 5 the Minister chose to give so little representation to the workforce and labour movement on both the Authority and the board that that was in a sense insulting to that section of our national life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are appropriate suggestions in the case of the Shannon Ports Authority and they are even more appropriate in relation to the proposed reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board which the Minister has indicated he intends to carry out under section 15 of the Bill without much further delay.  On the two <Col N="1903" /> previous Stages I said that I am not at all convinced that the format for the Shannon Ports Authority is necessarily appropriate for the Dublin Port and Docks Board as reconstituted but apart from that the representation I suggest &mdash; which is a minimal representation for the labour force &mdash; at the very least must be seen as being a minimum acceptable level of representation for the workforce in the context of any reconstruction of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    <P>I have gone, further in my amendments in suggesting that the procedure for appointing the labour representation, both on the port Authority and on the board of management of the port, should in time be provided for under the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  All of us who were involved in introducing that legislation in 1977 understood that the principle and strategy behind it were that it should be extended beyond the limited number of commercial semi-State bodies to whom it now applies and applied then to a whole series of other public bodies who acted in the commercial world.  For this reason I have suggested in amendment No. 1 and other amendments that the representatives of the workforce or the labour movement on these two bodies should in time be elected under the terms of the 1977 Act but that in the meantime the four representatives who I am suggesting should be appointed to the ports Authority would be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and that those four, in turn, would select from among themselves two members to go on the board of management.</P>
    <P>I do not think that my proposals should be turned down by the Minister.  On Committee Stage I raised the matter as to why the composition for the Shannon Ports Authority should be as proposed in section 4.  We had a long debate at that stage about the geographical distribution of the eight local authority members who are to be appointed, but I made the point that beyond the question of a reasonable geographical distribution of the local authority members another point of fundamental <Col N="1904" /> significance in many ways was that of the 21 members proposed for the Authority in section 4, while the labour representation was to be two, the chambers of commerce &mdash; who in function, authority, representation and nature are a movable feast in the context of Irish society &mdash; would have representation equal to that of the workforce.  Again, manufacturers, presumably in the region, would have an equal number to the labour side.  Ship-owners apparently were to have an equal representation to the workforce.  These three groups together would have three times the representation on this Authority that the workforce are to have under section 4.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I asked why this composition was devised and the only answer I got was that this was an historical pattern for the composition of port authorities.  Of course we know that roughly a similar pattern applies in relation to the Dublin Port and Docks Board but it is a pattern which does not make much sense.  Even if one allows that it makes sense, the proportion of representation between labour and other interests in the port is, to say the least, inadequate. Equally, if we are to have a board of management of seven, as proposed in section 5, given the composition of the Authority there is no possibility whatsoever that a representative of the workforce could become part of that board of management.  That is not just unfair and not in keeping with the trend in representation on public bodies since 1977 but is also a recipe for very serious difficulties in the operation of the port because Uncle Tom Cobbley and all will be on the board of management or at least have the potential to be on the board of management given the composition of the authority, whereas the workforce have no chance of being on it given the composition of the Authority.  That is inappropriate and a recipe for very serious difficulties in regard to industrial relations. For that reason I would wish to see the amendments I suggested accepted by the Minister and the House.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go on at inordinate <Col N="1905" /> length on these matters because they have been discussed already.  To date there has been no response from the Minister beyond saying on Committee Stage that he would bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Communications. We have heard nothing since and there are no amendments from the Minister for Communications or the Minister of State to try to meet the points I made.  Those are the principal points. We must come to grips with the fact that the workforce is one of the major institutions in this society.  The only way in which we will make significant progress as an economy is by attempting to involve the workforce more and more in the running of economic affairs both at the enterprise level or, in this case, at public bodies level and in general macro-economic policy making.  We do not do this very well at any level in society now and as a consequence we are paying a very heavy price.</P>
    <P>In looking at the composition of the port authority and the board of management which appear to be a model for other port authorities which may be either set up, reconstituted or amalgamated in the future we should try to get it right in this case so that if it is to be a model then it should be one with which we are happy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper to discuss the amendments because they raise very important and fundamental points about the nature of the future of harbour authorities, ports and docks boards or whatever they are called.  There were some very good points and observations made by Senator O'Mahony in proposing this series of amendments.  It is important that the labour movement in the widest sense should be adequately represented on these boards.  I do not think that the two representatives which the Minister proposes is an adequate representation in view of the substantial number of other interests and the area from which they are drawn</P>
      <P>Senator O'Mahony made a very valid point when dealing with the Shannon Port Authority.  He said that there will be eight local authority members.  It is proper that they should be there.  I realise the special difficulties of that area, encompassing such a substantial number of important local authorities having to adequately represent all the various interests. There will be two chamber of commerce members, two manufacturers' members, two elected members and five nominated members.  While recognising that it is open to the Minister to include some representatives of the labour movement among the nominated members, the two members of the labour movement which it is proposed to include under the provisions of section 4 (b) (iv) are not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality of the co-existence of the various forces which together make up a modern industrial country must recognise that labour has an important part to play in that.  I agree that the thrust of what the Senator had to say, in particular that the number should be increased from two to four, represents a legitimate viewpoint which the Minister should give very serious consideration to acceding to, either now or before the matter is discussed in the Dáil.  There is nothing wrong with a request that the labour representatives, however they are selected, <Col N="1907" /> should be increased from two to four. The representatives of the trade unions, organised and unorganised labour, are entitled to an adequate representation. I doubt if the two proposed under this heading are adequate.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for us to question whether the concept of worker participation as we know it under the auspices of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, is an appropriate method of having representatives of the wider labour and trade union movement, or an appropriate way to get representatives of labour on to boards in circumstances where the authorities or boards they are joining are essentially representative in character.  It is right and proper that commercial enterprise, even though it might have a social function as well, like CIE, the ESB or Aer Lingus, should have a greater amount of worker participation, a better quality worker participation and a better system of ensuring a better quality of worker participation. Where I would slightly call into question the suitability of this particular framework is where the board which it is proposed the workers should join is itself essentially representative in character. Nobody would suggest that the workers employed by a county council should be able to select two of their number to become members of the county council because it is not appropriate to what one would call a representative type of organisation. In so far as it is proposed that port authorities in general, and particularly the Shannon Port Authority, should be an essentially representative group of people, I wonder whether worker participation in that context has any greater validity than worker participation in the context of workers being able to nominate two people to be members of the county council or indeed people who are working in Dáil Éireann being able to nominate two people to be members of Dáil Éireann.  We should be careful to recognise that the formula of worker participation has limitations when one is dealing with bodies which are essentially representative in character.  It is only on <Col N="1908" /> that aspect of the matter that I would find difficulty with the series of amendments about which we are now speaking.</P>
    <P>The importance of the amendments is that they bring to the attention of the Minister the necessity for looking again at the scale of representation which he proposes to introduce in this new Authority representative of the labour movement in general, and also the importance of getting some other forum within that employment where the management and the workers can, in fact, make a real contribution to the running of the organisation and to its wellbeing.  However, where port authorities, harbour boards or bodies in general are essentially representative in nature, the worker participation legislation which we have at present is an inappropriate formula. Having said that, I want to re-emphasise that the Senator has made a very valid point with regard to the number of labour members.  The Minister should give that matter further consideration between this and the conclusion of the debate in this House on the one hand, or alternatively at least during the consideration of the measure in Dáil Éireann. This will be a large Authority and it is only reasonable to expect that in those circumstances a substantial number of the local authority members will be business people themselves; the Chamber of Commerce members will be business people; the manufacturer members will probably be business people.  It is important that that is balanced in a proper way, and the increase in the numbers of labour members from two to four, which is one of the underlying thrusts of the amendments, is something we could usefully consider and which the Minister could usefully accede to during the course of this debate or alternatively when it goes to the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed some of Senator O'Mahony's contribution, but from what I heard of it, it seems to agree with the case I have been making which is for greater representation of the labour force on the authorities.  I have long held that <Col N="1909" /> there is a need for greater involvement by workers in the affairs of the organisations in which they are employed.  I am satisfied that there will be fairly substantial worker involvement in the Shannon Ports Authority, if it develops as all of us want it to.  Therefore Senator O'Mahony made a very reasonable case.  Others have made cases in other directions at other stages of the debate and perhaps we will do likewise today.  I therefore hope the Minister will give these arguments, made here in relation to many aspects of this Bill for the purpose of improvement, the consideration they deserve between now and the introduction of the Bill in the other House.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Mahony and O'Leary argued in favour of four labour representatives. The present proposal is that there would be two labour members and six others apart from local authority members and nominated members &mdash; two Chamber of Commerce members, two manufacture members and two elected members who, if I understand it correctly, would be representatives of shipping interests.  There is a certain imbalance there as there has been in other aspects of the representation.</P>
      <P>I support the argument that has been made by Senator O'Mahony in relation to worker representation.  I earnestly request the Minister to give consideration to the points made by Senator O'Mahony.</P>

      <P>Lest the impression was given that we did not intend to support Senator O'Mahony, I want to put it on record now that we did.  I would like to thank Senator Dooge and my own party for not taking this last week because I had a sad bereavement in my own family and would not have been able to attend. This may have been only part of the reason it was postponed.  Nevertheless I want to convey my thanks to Professor Dooge and my own party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been here all through the Second Stage of this Bill and all through the nine-hours Committee Stage and now through the Report Stage and I cannot understand where the Minister, Deputy Mitchell is. <Col N="1910" /> Yesterday he could be changing tyres on a 1928 Bentley but he has not yet appeared in this House for this very important legislation.  I say this with absolute respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon and I do not want in anyway to make him feel that he might not be an even better Minister than Deputy Mitchell.  But I must say this because I have been in the House during every hour this Bill has been debated and I think the Minister should be here also. It would pay him better to stop changing 1928 Bentley tyres and come in here.  It might be even better if he got a helicopter and threw in a few of the officials or the people who drafted this Bill and went down and saw what the Shannon Estuary is.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I support the strong views of Senator O'Mahony.  When one sees a composition in section 4 of this Bill where there are 21 members of a new Authority and only two members from the workforce, then that is definitely an imbalance.  Maybe it will change with chats in the corridors during the summer months, which seems to be the new type of Government, and it will eventually arrive in the House, having been amended in the other House.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Mahony's view that there should be more worker participation. What Senator O'Leary said is quite correct.  Perhaps the way of selecting the persons who eventually sit on these authorities representing the workforce may not be correct, but that is their business.  The whole composition of 21 members is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the point about imbalance relating to employee representation on the Authority, there are additional compelling arguments for including employees on the Authority.  What is often forgotten or neglected, I think, is that there is considerable expertise among workforces in various enterprises, including public enterprise.  I am convinced that if their expertise were usefully employed through board membership, they could make a very valuable contribution to <Col N="1911" /> policy making.  Regrettably, Irish Shipping Limited are no longer with us.  One cannot help thinking that, if there had been worker representation on the board of Irish Shipping Limited, that could have made a considerable contribution to their survival.</P>
      <P>At this point, following examination of the operation of the Worker Participation State Enterprises Act, 1977, there is considerable evidence as to how these board members are working out in practice.</P>
      <P>I shall make two points.  First, the board members other than worker directors have been agreeably surprised with the very substantial and useful contribution that worker directors are making to policy making and, on the other hand &mdash; we know this from concrete evidence &mdash; the worker representatives have been, in turn, agreeably surprised at how well they have been accepted and their contributions have been acknowledged and the degree of co-operation that has been achieved between the traditional membership and the workers directors.  There is considerable evidence of this and I am happy to say that the Department of Industrial Relations in UCD have conducted research into the operation of worker directors in practice on State boards.  The worker director experiment is a welcome development and should certainly be extended to a considerable number of additional enterprises, at least in the public sector.  The Minister for Labour has long since promised the extension of the Worker Participation Act, 1977, to an additional number of State enterprises and I hope that that motion will come before the House very soon.  It is already overdue.</P>
      <P>In support of Senator O'Mahony, the opportunity now is there to double the membership to four which, after all, is not asking too much given the membership composition especially in relation to what might be termed broadly employer interests on the proposed Authority.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Mahony: there should be more worker representation on the Shannon Ports <Col N="1912" /> Authority.  From my limited experience of industrial relations, when you give a say to workers, you will get a better return.  This should prove successful.  The workers must be recognised and get adequate representation for their needs. The Minister might object that the extra representation might make the Shannon Ports Authority, or the board of management too big.  Senator O'Mahony's amendment, No. 7, would probably increase the board of management from seven to nine, but I do not see anything wrong with such an increase.  They are to be appointed by an Authority and as stated in the Bill, there is no guarantee who would be the representatives on the board of management, whether they would represent the workers' interests or the manufacturers' interest.  It would be only fair that the workers' and other interests should be represented and that there should be fair representation on the board of management.  We should not be obsessed with the idea of keeping these boards, or the harbour Authority, small. If we feel that it would contribute to their success, we should not in any way be loth to make them bigger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the suggestion from Senator Honan that the Minister for Communications, Deputy Mitchell, should go down by helicopter and see the situation there, it is only right to put on record that I know of few examples where any Minister has carried out more thorough and exhaustive consultations with the various local interests than Minister Mitchell did in this case.  Indeed, it was so impressive that I read into the records of this House the efforts he went to in seeking the views of all of the people in the particular area before embarking on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, was referred to by Senators O'Mahony, O'Leary and Hillery.  It provides for the appointment of worker directors to a number of semi-State bodies in the Schedule to that Act, for example, Aer Lingus, B &amp; I and CIE.  Of course, this Schedule can <Col N="1913" /> be extended.  The primary responsibility for the functioning of that Act belongs to the Minister for Labour and I am not aware of any proposals at present for bringing harbour authorities within the scope of that Act.  If that does emerge, it will be given consideration &mdash; any such proposal, naturally, would be given consideration by the Minister for Communications. As the primary responsibility is with the Minister for Labour, it would be inappropriate for me to introduce provisions materially affecting the methods and progress of implementation of the Act in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Harbours Act, 1946, labour representatives have two members each on the main authorities, while there are four Chamber of Commerce and elected members.  In the present Bill, representation from all these organisations will number two members each, given the smaller size of the Authority.  While it does not represent any increase in numbers as far as labour representatives are concerned, comparatively speaking it does better the situation.  There is a reduction in the number of Chamber of Commerce members from four to two and the elected members also.  There is a reduction in the overall size of the Authority, so comparitively speaking while it does not meet the wishes of Senators O'Mahony and O'Leary and the other Senators who spoke, it is an improvement in the situation which previously existed. We are not, however, endeavouring in this Bill to change the general structure of harbour authorities under existing legislation.  I would not consider this an appropriate forum in which to attempt to change the entire structure.  If an amendment were to be made to this Bill to increase the number of labour members it would, indeed, be a change of structure and while I am not disagreeing totally with the principle of the matter as expressed by the Senators, and persuasively done so by all of those who spoke, it will have to be considered in the context of an overall review of harbours legislation.</P>
    <P>Any major change in the level of labour representation would have to be considered, having regard to the implications <Col N="1914" /> this would have in respect of other harbour authorities, especially the main harbour authorities at Cork, Dublin and Waterford.  As I said, further consideration will be given to the points raised, but it should be done in the overall context rather than in the context of this legislation going before the House.  I was asked by many Senators to take back many of the arguments made and I will do that.  Consideration should be given in an overall review because of the knock-on effect this will have as far as other Bills are concerned.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by Senators O'Mahony and O'Leary that there may be no labour representation on the board of management.  In response, I must again advert to the fact that I do not want to limit the Authority to electing specific people to the board of management.  It was in that context that I agreed to delete the restriction on the number of local authority members on the board of management. Regardless of the benefits which might accrue from having guaranteed participation of any particular sectional interest on the board, I want to enable the Authority to choose the most worthy people for the board and not to inhibit the choice in any way.</P>
    <P>If each sectional interest were to be guaranteed permanent representation, a board of management could not work satisfactorily.  It is understandable that each interest would like to see its own position fully protected, and, indeed, this has been the thrust of many of the contributions during the other Stages of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill, however, is to co-ordinate the various sectional interests for the overall good of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>Great efforts have been made to get the appropriate balance in the membership of the authority.  Certainly, as regards geographical location which will come up later in amendments concerning the local authority, it is impossible in a membership of 21, or, indeed, in any type of membership, to get the balance that will suit everyone.  The Minister has got as near to it as possible.  I am not disagreeing totally with the principle suggested in <Col N="1915" /> the various amendments as regards the labour representation but it would be best considered in the context of the whole format as far as the harbours are concerned. Under the circumstances it will not be possible for me to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who spoke on these amendments. Without exception they spoke in favour of the general principles underlying them.  Senator O'Leary had one reservation about those principles.  He felt the election of the four members to the port Authority under the 1977 Act, as I proposed in my amendments, was not necessarily appropriate.  He did not rule out the possibility that it might be the appropriate method to use.  He made the point that it might not be the appropriate method because the Authority is intended to be a representational institution. There is truth in that but I suggest that representation for the workforce can best be achieved in that representational institution through their ability to elect their own representatives to participate in the Authority or, under the other amendment, to participate on the board.</P>
      <P>May I give the House one reason beyond the reason of principle, why this is so?  I have a lot of experience of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Indeed, two years ago I was deeply involved in trying to suggest methods whereby that port could be turned around from the position of financial precariousness, to put it mildly, to a position where it might begin to grow and develop and become financially viable again.  As I looked at that problem it became very clear to me that part of the reason at least was that there was not an adequate awareness on the part of the workforce in the port, which is varied and large, as to what the real problems were, what the forward planning was, and what role they were to play in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely to overcome that kind of difficulty which exists not just in the port of Dublin but in all large public enterprises, that the Workers Participation Act, 1977, was put in place.  While I <Col N="1916" /> understand the difficulties which Senator O'Leary raised about whether the additional numbers, which I proposed and with which he agrees, should be put in place either through nomination by, for example, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or through election under the 1977 Act, those fears do not seem to be well founded for the reasons I have given. The reality is that in any large enterprise &mdash; large ports now as in the past are large enterprises &mdash; the way one secures the co-operation of workforce in the future is by involving the workforce in decision making about the future.  It is best, in my view, that the workforce be involved through direct representation under the 1977 Act rather than by the appointment through, for example, the Congress of Trade Unions, of persons who may not in all cases be familiar with the life of the authorities concerned, or the ports concerned or, indeed, have much experience in that area.  Ports are very specialised places which require special skills at Authority level.  While welcoming very much the support of the Senators who spoke, I should like in return to say to Senator O'Leary that his fears about the use of the 1977 Act in this case may not be well founded.</P>
    <P>I was seriously disappointed with the reply of the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister.  It is true to say that the 1977 Act is confined at present to a limited number of semi-State companies, but it is not true to say that the responsibility for deciding whether that Act should be extended to other public bodies should rest, necessarily, with the Minister for Labour.  There is also the obligation on us where we think it right as an Oireachtas, or as one House of the Oireachtas, to extend the provisions of the 1977 Act to other institutions should we, the sovereign Oireachtas, decide to do it. It is precisely that that I am proposing, that, given the fact that we have this legislation before us that all of us who spoke believe that the worker representation should be increased, we should decide, irrespective of the view of the Minister for Labour of the day, that this is the best way to proceed.  If the principle <Col N="1917" /> objection to the extension of the 1977 Act to this Bill is that the Minister for Labour has not been consulted and, therefore, had not been given the opportunity to give an opinion, then the fault does not lie with this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also said that it is not the purpose of this Bill to change the structures governing all port authorities. He said it was a more limited Bill but we know that it is not a limited Bill at all.  Section 15 confers on the Minister a very substantial power to reconstitute all port authorities or to amalgamate or disband them.  That is a very sweeping power, indeed, which we have managed, with the co-operation of the Minister of State and I assume the Minister for Communications to limit in a substantive way by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  This is the only Bill that will come before us in the foreseeable future which is of any consequence to the composition or constitution of the port authorities.  I accept that there will be other transportation legislation in the future.  I cannot see that there will be any other legislation dealing with the composition of port authorities, with their amalgamation, reconstitution of disbandment in the foreseeable future, given the powers conferred on the Minister of the day in section 15.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also said that the representation given to the workforce in section 4 is an improvement on the position under existing legislation relating to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  I accept that it is an improvement but it is marginal.  I cannot remember the figures involved but I think that the workforce will now have two out of 21 in direct representation compared with, I think, two out of 25 under the Limerick Harbour Commissioners Act.  I accept, at token level, there has been a marginal improvement in the proportion of representation provided for the workforce under section 4 of this Bill.  As the Minister of State appeared to agree, it is very marginal and does not take account of the views expressed by all of us in the course of this discussion.</P>
    <P>The position remains entirely unsatisfactory <Col N="1918" /> from the point of view of employee representation.  The proposals in section 4 for the composition of harbour authorities are discriminatory against the workforce.  The composition of the board of management provided for under section 5 of the Bill is discriminatory to a degree which is quite extraordinary. Section 5 precludes, except under the most accidental circumstances, the possibility of representatives of the workforce becoming members of the board of management.  That is an extraordinary suggestion to make at this time.</P>
    <P>As I said, a great deal of time has been given by the House on the different stages of this debate to the balance of membership on a regional basis as between local authority members.  That is as it should be if this is the format for the Authority which we are going to adopt.  As the Minister of State said, the Minister in preparing this proposal spent a great deal of time considering how to get an appropriate regional distribution of representation among local authority members.  I do not dispute that that was a complex question and one which would have taken up considerable time.  I am not aware that the Minister for Communications, in preparing this legislation, spent even a tiny proportion of that time considering what the appropriate representation for the workforce would be.  In so far as this matter was discussed, and I can be corrected if I am wrong, the representation for the workforce would only have been discussed in the context of trying to get right the representation for the local authority members on a distributional basis regionally and trying to get right the representation for the various commercial interests who will be represented on this authority.  Representation for the workforce was strictly a residual matter. I object to that very strongly.</P>
    <P>Some very welcome comments were made by Senator O'Leary and others.  He did not note that there is no possibility under the Minister's proposals that there would be any labour representative on the board of management, except in the most accidental way where a member of a local authority might happen to be a <Col N="1919" /> Labour Party representative.  That would be an indirect representation of the workforce. Nobody, including the Minister of State, has attempted to justify why representatives of the workforce or the labour movement generally should be excluded from the board of management. There has been no attempt to say why at least one of the seven board of management members should not be a representative of the employees.  We know that the board of management will be the effective decision-making institution on a day to day basis in the proposed institutional arrangements for the ports.</P>
    <P>I now have a choice as to whether to press these amendments or to accept the very limited commitment made by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister to have the points made in these amendments considered between now and the introduction of this legislation in the Dáil.  The commitment given by the Minister was a slim one to put it mildly. I can only hope it is the intention of the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Communications, in stronger language than he conveyed it to us here today, that he is concerned to enact changes of the kind suggested in these amendments between now and the debate on the Bill in the Dáil.  In those circumstances, given the very limited or least partial commitment on the part of the Minister of State, I am prepared to withdraw these amendments.  I suggest, in the absence of agreement of some form between our political group, the Labour Party, and the Minister, that between now and the introduction of this Bill in the Dáil, the amendments should be put down again.  I hope the kind of progress we made on other legislation over the last few months can be made on this Bill also. The important thing for the Minister of State to consider is that there is a will on the part of the Seanad to support these amendments.  The fact that the Minister himself is not here today places all of us in difficulty, including the Minister of State.  The reality is that we will continue to press these amendments during the course of the summer and, I have no <Col N="1920" /> doubt, in the autumn in the Dáil, should that have to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am extremely pleased that the Minister saw fit on Committee Stage to withdraw the original section 16, which dealt with the question of pay, and that he has been prepared to introduce a very substantial qualification of section 15 of the Bill, also on Committee Stage.  These two developments indicate that we have been able to make progress on this Bill. I hope further progress can be made in the Dáil in the autumn.</P>

      <P>These amendments are identical with amendments in my name on Committee Stage.  These amendments were different from those with which Senator O'Mahony dealt in that they are not amendments of principle.  Rather are they drafting amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill amends section 7 of the Harbours Act, 1946.  Section 4 (a) of this Bill provides for the insertion in subsection 7 (1) of the 1946 Act, of certain words after the words &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; where those words appear in section 7 (1) of the 1946 Act.  The problem is that the words &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; appear three times in section 7 (1) of the Harbours Act, 1946.  I put down amendment No. 2 for the purpose of introducing an element of clarity into the amended subsection of the 1946 Act.  I believe that the words &ldquo;where it firstly <Col N="1921" /> occurs&rdquo; should be specified to make it quite clear that the amendment to section 7 (1) of the 1946 Act is deemed to take effect immediately after the words &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; where they first appear, that is, in the first line of section 7 of the harbours Act, 1946.  The words &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; appear in section 7 (1) (a) and again in section 7 (1) (b).  It is for that reason that I move this amendment, in the hope that the Minister and his officials will have been able to appreciate better the point I was endeavouring to make on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is simply to provide for the inclusion of a table in the amended section.  Again, this is a question of legislative clarity.  The practice of introducing tables commenced in the mid seventies under the Attorney Generalship of Declan Costello.  It is a practice which has continued principally in relation to Finance Bills.  It is a wise practice in that it allows one to read legislation with greater ease and to understand and comprehend legislation without the necessity of having to resort to the parent Act.  That is the reason I suggest that we introduce a table into this Bill.  It is important &mdash; by virtue of the Minister's reference, throughout the debate in this House at Second Stage, on Committee Stage and this morning on Report Stage &mdash; that we have an all embracing review of the harbours, legislation at some future date.  We have not had an all embracing review to date.  This Bill is not intended to constitute such a review.  It is meant to be an amending Bill.  To lend clarity to the provisions of the Bill and greater comprehension to those trying to understand them I suggest the table be introduced.</P>

The Bill has been drafted by the parliamentary draftsman and approved by the Attorney General.  The words which the various <Col N="1922" /> amendments seek to add are unnecessary from a legal viewpoint.  I do not think there is any dispute on that.  Nevertheless, I accept the good intent of what Senator Durcan is trying to achieve here. The best way to approach the matter would be by means of consolidating legislation. We have now the Harbours Acts of 1946, 1947, 1976 and this one.  It will be necessary to introduce consolidating legislation in this area.  Accordingly, I intend to leave the provisions of the bill, which Senator Durcan seeks to amend, as they are.</P>

But that does not render it a better Bill. Nor does it render it a Bill which is not in need of amendment for technical reasons.  Frequently in the courts technical defects appear in legislation.  There are technical defects in this section, of the nature I have mentioned.  To make reference to consolidating the harbours legislation is not quite fair when there is no timescale set for that consolidation particularly when one remembers our practice of not producing any form of composite legislation.  We have that form of legislation in relation to the Income Tax Acts only.  If we had procedure whereby legislation could be produced in a composite form then one would not have the objections such as I have raised here today.  But our Attorney General, parliamentary draftsmen and those who work with them do not deem it necessary to produce composite Acts in relation to all legislation passing through these Houses.  I believe it is our job to produce the best possible legislation and the Minister's response today is one which leads us to produce the second best type.</P>

      <P>Though my opening remarks a short while ago may have been somewhat sharp we now have a much better Bill than when this Bill was introduced in this House.  I thank the Minister for the amendments he introduced, for his kindness to Senator Rory Kiely and me and for those amendments he accepted.  On Report Stage we again have amendments dealing with the representation from the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must put again on record, regardless of whether it bores people, the points regarding the north bank and the mileage. This is Clare County Council's case.  Of the total of 166 miles of estuary coastline, 93 miles is in County Clare, 37 miles in County Limerick and 36 miles in County Kerry.  Kilrush has a fine natural harbour where major improvements could be carried out at a low cost.  Their Castle Harbour has recently been leased <Col N="1924" /> to an importer who has purchased warehouses and is at present improving the harbour.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard and I recently attended the meeting of the estuary advisory committee to the Clare County Council.  It is an all-party advisory committee and we met in the famous courthouse in Ennis.  All they are asking is that Clare gets common-sense representation. Senator Rory Kiely and I have amendments proposing two representatives for Kerry, three for Clare, two for Limerick Corporation, two for Limerick County Council, one for Tipperary North Riding and two for Kilrush.  At the end of discussions Clare County Council or the persons sitting around that fine table would be prepared to settle even for four representatives from Clare County Council, Kilrush, SFADCo, Shannon and Clarecastle, because of recent important developments. I hope I took out of that meeting exactly what they would eventually ask and settle for.  That is not in any way putting a gun to anybody's head because this legislation, improved as it is by this House &mdash; again proving the importance of the Seanad, on which I have strong views &mdash; will go to the other House in October and perhaps the Deputies will do better with the Minister for Communications, Deputy Jim Mitchell, when he appears there.</P>
    <P>I would like advice from the Minister. I did ask him to come back to me on the question of the dues, where they were and what account they were in.  We have an extraordinary situation in County Clare, even though we have a highly paid legal adviser to the said county council. I and persons like me and others who have served far longer are confused about whether Clare County Council is a harbour authority.  I say it is.  Other people with longer service than I also say Clare County Council is a harbour authority because they have accepted dues at certain ports and piers along the Clare coastline for a long time.  Yet there is some delay from the Clare County Council's legal adviser in declaring whether Clare County Council is a harbour authority or not.  I would ask the Minister to find that <Col N="1925" /> out for me.  Persons who say it is not a harbour authority are contradicted by the fact that dues were collected in Kildysart and paid to Clare County Council.  There is a Mr. O'Connell, who was harbour-master for a long time.  I want to clarify these aspects before they go to the other House so that there will not be confusion at a later date.</P>
    <P>As regards the end part of section 4 (b) this is what we voted on at Committee Stage.  This is really dynamite because the Minister may by regulations specify the manner in which the local authority members are appointed.  That is a crazy provision in a Bill.  Not alone is he going to decide but the local authorities are only getting eight representatives on the new Authority of 21.  There will be 13 representatives of other bodies.  The Minister by regulation is going to specify the manner in which the local authority members will be appointed.  This is the section we voted on and we were beaten. I presume we will vote on it again today. It is all right for somebody else to decide who the 13 other members will be, but the authorities of the region in Kerry, Tipperary, Limerick and Clare have to be dictated to by the Minister.  Eight is not sufficient, but now the Minister is going to dictate how those eight are elected.  That is not democracy at all.  I want to clarify why there will be a vote on it.  It is not one party against another. It is just wrong.  I would equally say it was wrong if a Fianna Fáil Minister was bringing it in.  That is crazy power, as indeed we have in a later section of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcomed this Bill.  I recently saw the following quote: &ldquo;Doubt is not a pleasant condition but certainty is; to believe with certainty we must begin with doubting.&rdquo; That is how I feel about this Bill.  That is how this Authority might finish up. However, some part of it may do good for the whole area and indeed for the nation.  The Shannon Estuary does not belong to Clare or Kerry; nor does it belong to Limerick, as some geniuses in Limerick think it does.  I am not talking about the county council or about Senator <Col N="1926" /> Rory Kiely; I am talking about the man who had the greatest input into this Bill.  He is not a member of this party.</P>
    <P>I want to correct an impression given by young Senators when they were speaking on Second and Committee Stages.  I had my young days in the Seanad, too. Other senior Senators at the time, like the present Minister for Education, Deputy Cooney, educated me.  It would be best for me to correct the impression given that I found out only when this Bill came into this House that the Shannon had two banks, a north bank and a south bank.  I would like to tell Senator Deenihan and his colleagues that I sailed every inch of the Shannon and I know every port and pier of the Shannon.  I was well aware that the Shannon had two banks long before this Bill came into this House. Senator Deenihan was probably in short pants in Kerry when I was sailing the Shannon.</P>

      <P>I do not mind.  I want to be quite clear and let everybody here be quite clear.  I will make one admission &mdash; Senator Howard may support me on this &mdash; perhaps the people and the senior officials in Clare may not have paid enough attention to this part of Clare. They allowed certain people in the Limerick Harbour Authority to get far too much power and far too much scope over the years.  I picked up an interesting document during the week where the RDO, who are supposed to be a regional organisation, practically left out the Clare coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may worry that Fianna Fáil &mdash; because we have the majority on councils &mdash; will only allow Fianna Fáil persons to serve on authorities.  I want to put it on the record of this House that Fianna Fáil put Shannon Airport there, Fianna Fáil kept Shannon Airport there but we never gave a big job to a Fianna Fáil man because all the top jobs went to Fine Gael men in Shannon.  It would be wrong for people to think that because we are looking <Col N="1927" /> for more representation for the local authority that we are not big enough to give other parties representation if it makes the Authority a better one for the whole area and the nation.  I speak from experience; I know Shannon Airport. New and young councillors and new and young Senators have an idea that because we have the majority on county councils and on elected authorities as a result of the last local elections that we are going to grab all.  That is wrong.  I live and I serve in an area where we did not behave like that but that cannot be said for some of the Ministers or the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I know that Limerick and Kerry are well able to look after themselves.  I ask the Minister to allow us four members instead of two.  Even if the county council are only going to get one, even if Kilrush is only going to get one, I ask that SFADCo be given one member and also Clare Castle because of recent developments. I ask that Clare should get four members.  I know that the other elected people from the other constituencies will look after their areas.  The constituencies I talk about are also my electorate but from the very beginning I believed this Bill was wrong.  I thank the Minister and his officials for the Government amendments he brought in but I ask him to take back to Minister Mitchell my strong views on the matter.  If they are acted upon, the Bill will be a better measure.  I must ask that we vote on 4 (b).  It is dynamite.  It is not leaving any democratic right to the local authorities even to nominate their own persons without dictation or naming them by a Minister.  For present and future Ministers that is too much power.</P>

      <P>I am surprised first of all that Senator Honan has this amendment down.  The membership and composition of the Authority was discussed at length on Committee Stage and that was the place for any changes to take place.  I am disappointed with her parochialism.  To borrow a phrase from herself, she must <Col N="1928" /> be joking when she mentions that there should be five from County Clare, three from Clare County Council and two from Kilrush Urban District Council.  I have nothing against County Clare, but she cannot be serious in disproportionate representation she advocates here today.</P>
      <P>In my own amendment on Committee Stage I pointed out that if there were three from County Kerry, three from County Clare and three from Limerick &mdash; that included two from Limerick Corporation and one from Limerick city &mdash; the Authority would be far more representative. I also pointed out that that would not affect the overall composition and the overall number of members of the proposed harbour board which was 21.</P>
      <P>I made my views clear why I felt it was the right decision to have a 21-member board and to have a board of management. I also pointed out that it was important that each county should be represented on the board of management to ensure that local authorities, if they were excluded, would not feel left out in the cold.  I would like to make that point to the Minister.  I know the Minister accepted that at least three of the management board would be local authority members.  Again, I would have preferred if it could have been stressed that at least one of them would be from each county or that each county would have one representative on the board of management. I still stress that aspect.  The proposal in this amendment is far too unwieldy and I think it could not be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling. As regards the amendment, as was mentioned already today and on Second and Committee Stages there are two banks to the river, the south and the north banks, I am from the south bank.  It might seem strange that I am looking for extra representation for the north side, but section 3 states:</P>
      <P>The power, functions, duties, assets, rights and liabilities of</P>
      <P>(a) the Limerick Harbour Commissioners;</P>
      <P>(b) the council of the urban district of Kilrush, and</P>
      <P>(c) the Clarecastle Pier Trustees ... shall ... be transferred to the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that since, because of section 3, the power, functions, duties, assets, rights and liabilities of the Kilrush Urban District Council are being transferred to the Shannon Ports Authority, they should be entitled to some representation other than from Clare County Council. At present, Tipperary (North Riding) County Council have the right to nominate <Col N="1930" /> a member to the Limerick Harbour Commission and they should have the right to nominate a member to the Shannon Ports Authority.  As I mentioned already, this will probably mean increasing the number of members of the Authority but we should not be reluctant to do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is obsessed with keeping the size of the Authority to 21 members, but if increasing it would contribute to its success we should not be reluctant to make this move.  I believe that Kilrush, with their experience in harbour operations, and Tipperary, through their contribution to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, would make major contributions to the success of the Authority and they should be given the right to nominate a member, if not two members, to the Harbour Ports Authority.  Senator Honan and I are anxious, that that membership be increased by two to ensure that these bodies would have representation on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on amendment No. 4 and in particular, to dwell on the parts which apply to County Clare, indeed, to the northern bank of the Shannon.  May I compliment Senator Kiely on his generosity and understanding of the need for balanced representation for the northern side of the river? He was only being logical when he said that if the Kilrush Harbour Authority, in the form of a council of the district of Kilrush are abolished in conjunction with the Limerick Harbour Authority and the Clarecastle Pier Trustees, it follows that if the Limerick Harbour Authority are considered to deserve representation on the new ports Authority through the two corporation members, the same should hold good for the other two harbour authorities which are being disbanded under the legislation.  Three harbour authorities listed in section 3 are being disbanded &mdash; the Limerick Harbour Authority, the harbour authority in Kilrush in the form of a council of the urban district of Kilrush and Clarecastle Pier Trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to a meeting <Col N="1931" /> which took place in the courthouse in Ennis last Friday evening.  I was present at that meeting which represented the interests in County Clare directly affected by the proposals in this legislation. Members of Clare County Council and the Kilrush Urban District Council were present.  The primary purpose of the people on the Clare side of the river is to ensure that there is progress and development on the river.  When they revert to the question of representation, their concern is that unless the balance of representation is right, you will not get development of the type or scale necessary to make the most of this great natural resource we have in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The people at that meeting were quite adamant that the representation being granted on the northern bank in the shape of two members of the Clare County Council out of a total Authority of 21 was totally inadequate.  It was put quite clearly that Kilrush as a harbour authority being disbanded under this legislation is, on any basis of justice or morality entitled in its own right to direct representation on the Authority.  I support and share that view.  Views were also expressed that the town of Shannon with its substantial oil jetty, also has a legitimate claim to representation.  It is unquestioned that the Shannon Development Company should and must have a role on the Authority in view of their performance and their track record in industrial development in the mid-western area.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that has worried many of us since the publication of this measure is that because of a wrong balance of representation there would be undue influence in the new port Authority by a group of people who have not distinguished themselves in port or river development over the past 20 years.  To complicate that problem, it appears that the two best development agencies on both sides of the river are not participants in the new Authority, one by right and the other by choice &mdash; the Shannon Development Company on the northern <Col N="1932" /> side and Foynes Harbour Commissioners on the southern side.  Therefore there is that lingering fear that, if you exclude those whose record in the field of development and progress is excellent, you are restricting the expertise, the experience and the success which these bodies have acquired over the past number of years. The Minister is not making these crucial elements available for the new Authority, particularly in relation to their development role on the estuary.</P>
    <P>The Clarecastle Harbour Trustees as a result of a recent deal with private enterprise in Clarecastle appear now to be promoting the beginning of what could be a very successful programme of development for Clarecastle, the Fergus and the Shannon and there is a fear among the people of Clarecastle, due to their disbandment under this legislation furthered by the fact that there is no provision for them to have direct representation on the new ports Authority, that their justifiable expectations in the arrangements they have now made may not be realised to the degree that they would like for the sake of their community and for the sake of that part of County Clare.  Therefore, as Clarecastle are the third authority being disbanded by section 3 of the Bill, they have a legitimate claim, as the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have, to representation on the board.  Also, there are reasons for believing that Clare County Council are a harbour authority in their own right and, while the opinion of counsel has not yet come to hand, I have no doubt that by the time this legislation arrives in the other House that opinion will be available then.  Therefore, if Clare County Council are conclusively shown to be a harbour authority in their own right, the Minister must without question consider that the representation as proposed in this Bill is totally imbalanced and needs to be rectified in favour of the north bank.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes a certain breakdown of representation and I will not complain about the two for County Kerry.  In relation to the three for Clare County Council the feeling that emerged from the meeting last Friday night &mdash; it <Col N="1933" /> has been referred to already by Senator Honan &mdash; is that, while we would like to see the representation referred to here on Committee Stage, we are talking about adequate representation from the northern side of the river and, if it is divided between Kilrush, Clare County Council, Shannon and Clarecastle, that is acceptable.  Once we get the additional representation that ensures that the interests on the northern side of the river are preserved in the decision making process within the Shannon Ports Authority and then we will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>An expectation emerged from the discussion last Friday night that Foynes would come in at some stage to the new Shannon Ports Authority, and, indeed, there is provision for that.  Of course, should that develop nobody, including the Minister, expects that the Foynes Harbour Authority will disband and come into the new ports authority unless they get direct representation on that ports authority.</P>
    <P>Taking all these points into account, an argument is still raging in relation to what is regarded as an imbalance of representation on the proposed ports authority.</P>
    <P>I have no great argument against the question of representation for North Tipperary except that if we consider North Tipperary we should perhaps argue that the area of jurisdiction should go as far as Killaloe.  If we leave it as proposed in the Bill, no great argument can be made for the North Tipperary representation, but I am not opposed to it.  It would, simply perhaps, help to maintain a certain balance that we are all striving to maintain within this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, give the Bill a qualified welcome.  We are now discussing the proportion of representation on the proposed Authority.  Earlier in the debate the Minister of State said that Senators may feel that Limerick is over-represented &mdash; I certainly share the view that Limerick is over-represented &mdash; but he went on to argue that at present most of the estuary is under the control of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  This <Col N="1934" /> leads me to my main criticism, which, of course, has been made by others, that the representation as proposed attempts to preserve the status quo.  It does not give fair representation to the north side of the estuary which, as Senator Honan has illustrated, accounts for over half the territory involved and over which Clare County Council currently have jurisdiction. This disproportionately large role given to Limerick is underlined further by the fact that berthing fees paid by shipping lines for the use of harbour facilities at Tarbert Island and Moneypoint go to Limerick Harbour Commissioners. Limerick is 50 miles up river, and that authority have not invested anything in the development of the harbour facilities at Tarbert and Moneypoint.</P>
      <P>Surely fair play would demand that docking fees in respect of Moneypoint should go to Clare County Council to help improve infrastructual development such as roads and communications in that area of Clare.  The same should hold for Tarbert, with fees going to Kerry County Council for similar purposes.  Clare County Council have had to bear the cost of maintaining the roads and the environment in the wake of the construction of a major power station at Moneypoint. This maintenance work, of course, has cost a great amount of money and the docking fees for ships at Moneypoint would make a valuable and justifiable contribution to the necessary expenditure in which Clare County Council have had to engage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that our amendment seeks to improve representation for Clare.  Kilrush has been mentioned specifically.  I have a special interest in Kilrush, not least because I have considerable local knowledge of the area.  My mother is a native of Kilrush and my late grandfather, John O'Dwyer of Kilrush, was a member of Kilrush Urban District Council and Clare County Council for many years.  Therefore, I know the people involved in operating the pier at Kilrush and they have a detailed knowledge of it and a comprehensive understanding of the estuary as a whole and its potential. As we have talked about the contribution <Col N="1935" /> worker-directors can make to the running of enterprises, we should also be alert and sensitive to the fact that people who know the local position and have experience on the ground can contribute very effectively, not alone to the development of Kilrush Harbour, but to the entire estuary, which, in turn, would be a contribution to the development of the country as a whole.  The Shannon Estuary is a major national resource.  I share the view that has already been expressed that Kilrush in its own right, given its history and the expertise of the people who are involved in operating the pier, should have representation on the new Authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan and Senator Howard have joined together across the floor in making the case for Clarecastle and Shannon.  In relation to Shannon, obviously we all want to see the Shannon Estuary contribute to industrial and other types of development.  Shannon as an entity, and SFADCo in particular, have gained many years of extremely valuable experience in development, especially industrial development, and that in itself is a success story.  Therefore a considerable amount of expertise is available in Shannon, which makes the case even stronger for representation for Shannon on the Authority.</P>
    <P>At the more general level, the Bill represents on the theme of development a lost opportunity for the estuary which is a national asset.  After 20 years of consultation and discussion the Bill is a major disappointment.  I regret that it is little more than a policing agency for the collection of revenue rather than a development agency, a role it could serve. Having said that could I appeal on grounds of equity to the Minister to take on board our seriously argued case for a representation for at least four members for County Clare in the new Shannon Ports Authority?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the specific question asked by Senator Honan and dealt with later by Senator Howard as to whether <Col N="1936" /> Clare County Council are a harbour authority, without attempting to give the definitive legal position, the position is that it is not a harbour authority under the meaning of the Harbours Act, 1946, which has a schedule and lists the various harbour authorities under it.  For instance, Kilrush is listed.  There is some basis for the beliefs the legal adviser may have in Clare County Council about the position of Clare County Council in this respect and I have been seeking to find out the basis.  Kildysart Pier was transferred to the grand jury of County Clare by an order from the Commissioners of Public Works of 16 December 1886 and Querin Pier transferred to the grand jury of County Clare by order of 16 December 1886.  This transferred certain rights and powers on them as regards those areas and they remain with Clare County Council.  It is possible, therefore, that that may have been the basis for the belief.</P>
      <P>There is no end to the possible permutations of the kind of representation one might get on the size of the proposed Authority.  Having listened to all Members &mdash; there were conflicting views depending on what geographical location the speaker came from &mdash; the option the Minister has chosen gives the most even spread of representation providing equal representation from the county councils of Clare, Kerry and Limerick as well as Limerick Corporation.  The counties of Clare and Kerry may feel that Limerick is over-represented but it should be borne in mind that at present most of the estuary is under the control of Limerick Harbour Commissioners and that any change in this situation is an improvement for those counties in terms of having a voice in affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill goes further in giving those with a legitimate interest in the estuary as fair a representation as can be devised in the circumstances.  Having said that I accept that there is no system which would be totally acceptable to everyone. For instance, bodies such as Kilrush Urban District Council, Clarecastle Pier Trustees, Shannon Town Commissioners <Col N="1937" /> and Ballylongford Development Association have sought direct representation on the Authority.  It is not possible to give direct representation to all these groups, otherwise one would have a totally unwieldy authority.  It is generally accepted that an authority of 21 is about the optimum size.  The fairest way is to confine representations to four main local authorities who have power to select their representatives from within those smaller groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister can also redress any imbalance which he may perceive from among his own five nominees.  In this regard he has said that he will pay particular attention to Kilrush Urban District Council.  As regards Tipperary North Riding which is the concern of Senator Kiely and Senator Honan, I should point out that the local authority have one representative appointed to Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  This appointment was made by way of ministerial order under section 8 of the Harbours Act, 1946, in recognition specifically of financial assistance which had been afforded some years ago to the commissioners by the local authority &mdash; Tipperary North Riding.  Accordingly, Tipperary North Riding was not among the original local authority members on the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  It would be inappropriate to include them in the original membership of the Shannon Ports Authority especially in the context of the overall reduction in local authority membership within the new Authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan expressed opposition before to the provision in lines 35 to 41 on page 4 relating to the power enabling the Minister to make regulations specifying the manner in which the local authority members are appointed to the Authority.  The House divided on that provision.  The four local authorities who are the appointing bodies cover a very large geographical area including areas which are quite remote from the estuary. Local authority members from the remote areas could not possibly have the same interest in the development of the estuary as those from electoral areas bordering <Col N="1938" /> on the estuary.  The enabling powers in paragraph (b) accordingly enable the Minister to devise a system whereby only those local authority members with a legitimate interest would have the right to appoint local authority members.  It goes without saying that regulations under this paragraph would only be made after the fullest consultation. The situation will be monitored closely to see if a clear need arises for such regulations.  This is in the overall interest of the estuary.  Subject to any regulations which may be made under the section, the appointment of the local authority members to the Shannon Ports Authority will be carried out in accordance with the procedures under the relevant local government section.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery referred to the possibilities of dues from Moneypoint for road development.  Section 119 of the Harbours Act, 1946, provides that the revenue of a harbour authority shall be used for purposes related to the harbour itself. It would not be possible to use harbour revenue for general local authority purposes such as road development.  Senator Hillery also referred to his disappointment with the Bill, that it was not a more vital instrument for the development of the area, but we have put the structure on the ground.  It will form the foundation from which a dynamic ports authority can do precisely what Senator Hillery is saying and particularly with the two-tier structure which will be more effective in modern conditions.  I hope that what Senator Hillery has in mind will come from this, because the potential is there. The legal structure that we are now in the course of putting into operation will allow the movement he wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not an inch has been given.  We have eight groups for which I asked for representation.  Like other Senators, I put a lot of work into this and all I can do is my best.  Clare County Council, Kerry County Council, Limerick County Council, Limerick Corporation, Kilrush, Clarecastle and SFADCo constitute seven places.  From the beginning <Col N="1939" /> I tried not to be parochial, although I was accused by a Senator not now in the Chamber of being such.</P>
      <P>I had to come in here to make a case for more representation of elected local authority persons on this body.  I repeat this again today.  County councillors are elected by the people and understand what is needed in their areas.  Out of 21 members the Minister sees fit to elect only eight.  I totally support also Senator O'Mahony's views that workers should have greater representation on this Authority. When the Bill goes to the Dáil I hope that there will be further discussion on this.  I am not saying that the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, is not <i>au fait</i> with the amount of discussion the Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, had with the people this legislation will affect directly.  However, I do not know of any discussion the Minister had with the Clare authorities and by that I mean those elected by the people of Clare to both the Oireachtas and the county councils.  They sought to have a deputation received in this House when this Bill was printed, because they had not been consulted.  If there was consultation with senior officials from the Department, two senior officials from Clare, without the elected members, then that was wrong.  We criticise the newspapers and the media for knocking the elected representatives of this nation.  I cannot understand why we have Ministers accepting advice from senior officials of Departments, thus creating the greatest knockers of all when they are knocking the elected people whose advice should be more often listened to.</P>

I said this on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage.  I see this board as being the boys with the power.  They are the boys who will dictate while I am here, codding myself, looking for greater representation for the local authority members, and while Senator O'Mahony is looking for greater representation for the workers.  But it is the seven boys at the luncheons and meals with the wine who will dictate what will be done on the Shannon Estuary.  I have seen it happen; I have never been in on it.</P>

There will be conflict and trouble and the board will have the power and not the Authority where all these people should have the say.  We even had to ask them to have a monthly meeting.  The missing Minister saw fit to have only six meetings in the year just to tell the people out there what the seven bosses had done on the board, in the inner sanctum.  I know well whose brainchild this Bill was.  I know who the Minister consulted and I am disappointed.  I have done my best.  I have put a lot of work into this Bill.  I hope that some of the things I have said might be reflected on before it is passed by the Dáil.  I think that the representation, the number of elected people, is still wrong.  The only thing we did achieve is that there will be local authority representatives on the board whereas there will not be worker participation on the board and that board could be increased.  But there is another day and I suppose legislation has been repealed before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not being parochial as Senator Deenihan said.  But I am deeply concerned about this issue.  I always held the view, which was held by Derry before me, that one Authority would be the making of the Shannon Estuary.  He understood the estuary and knew it well <Col N="1941" /> and I do not think he would agree to that composition if he were here today. Certainly the last piece of section 4 (b) is dynamite.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question arising out of the Minister's reply.  I am glad that the Minister clarified what he has in mind in the context of 4 (b). There is a lot of merit in what he said as to those local authority representatives elected in electoral areas adjacent to the Shannon Estuary being best equipped to provide local advice and expertise.  I would like further elaboration from the Minister by way of an assurance that, in making the regulations specifying the manner in which the local authority members are appointed, such regulations <Col N="1942" /> would not extend to the political party composition of the local authority members and that such would be left to the councils themselves to decide.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 9 to 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove section 13 entirely from the Bill. I am seeking to remove what I regard as legislative verbiage and I hope the Minister concurs with my reaction to section 13.  I react in this way bearing in mind the contents of section 15.  That section, which we discussed at length on Second Stage and was the subject of <Col N="1943" /> amendments on Committee Stage, gives the Minister power to dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate, as he may consider necessary, a harbour authority by order. It was amended in this House in a realistic way, already referred to by Senator O'Mahony on Committee Stage.  The amendment was to the effect that a draft order under the section should first be debated in the House.</P>
    <P>My objection to section 13 can only be made in the light of the existence of section 15 and, bearing in mind the existence of section 15, section 13 is totally unnecessary.  It seems to me that Foynes Harbour Trustees may be dissolved by the Minister, exercising his draconian powers under section 15, subject to the laying of a draft order before the Houses for resolution.  Therefore, section 13 is absolutely unnecessary.  Indeed, if one reads section 13, one will see that in essence the powers conferred upon the Minister in relation to the Foynes Harbour Trustees are similar to the powers conferred upon the Minister in relation to other harbour authorities.  The Minister is smiling to himself and he may catch me out by saying that the Foynes Harbour Trustees are not specified in the Schedule to the 1946 Act.  I may be made to feel foolish, but if that is the case I suggest to the Minister that, in ease of those who have to find their way through this complex legislation, a further amendment to the Schedule of the 1946 Act should be introduced rather than introducing this entirely new section 13.</P>
    <P>I know the Bill is in measure concerned with the Shannon Estuary and that the Foynes Harbour Trustees are being gently teased along the way to total assimilation with the new Shannon Ports Authority, but the Minister can exercise his powers in achieving that end under section 15.  The only reason I have put down this amendment is in ease of those who have to read legislation.  It seems to me that the object of Ministers is to make legislation as confusing as possible for the general public, so that none but the most skilful and intrepid explorer can find his way around the complex legislation <Col N="1944" /> emanating from Ministers.  I am trying to simplify legislation for those who will have to consider it.  We can simplify the Bill by removing one section which appears to be unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I tabled the amendments to this section on Committee Stage and even suggested that the section be deleted.  I accepted the Minister's amendment on Committee Stage, in regard to section 13 (4) which reads: &ldquo;Where the Minister proposes to make an order under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House&rdquo;.  Like Senator Durcan, I wonder if the section is necessary.  The Minister, in drafting the Bill, included this section so that he could dissolve the Foynes Harbour Trustees and transfer their functions and powers to the Shannon Ports Authority.  The Foynes Harbour Trustees have been very successful.  The increase in the number of ships unloading in Foynes in recent years has boosted employment in the area.  Any body which is successful, such as the Foynes Harbour Trustees, should be allowed to continue on that successful note without interference.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's reply to Senator Durcan's proposal that the section be deleted.  If the Minister accepts amendment No. 8 the independence of Foynes will be copper fastened. I cannot see any reason for including it. If Foynes Authority feel like becoming part of the Shannon Port Authority they should be allowed do do so of their own free will and when they think it will benefit the Authority and Foynes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided, in relation to the Shannon Ports Authority, that the Authority should be established excluding Foynes initially. However, the legislation enables Foynes to be included at a later date.  It is the ambition of most people that it should be possible for Foynes to join without any coercion when it is found to be the most desirable thing to do.  The main purpose <Col N="1945" /> of the Bill is the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority.  Section 13 provides especially for the possible future amalgamation of Foynes with the Authority and with no other body.  It would be totally inappropriate not to make specific provision in relation to Foynes Harbour Trustees in the context of a Bill which is dealing with the port Authority for the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>In the run up to the publication of the Bill it was not possible to have Foynes included and it is appropriate that it should be included here.  This provision will ensure that Foynes may become part of the Shannon Ports Authority and no other body.  I know there is considerable substance in the arguments Senator Durcan has put forward, but it is a useful provision that will not make the reading of the Bill any more difficult.  It shows clearly the intent and the hope &mdash; I accept that legislation is not the appropriate place for expressing hopes or aspirations &mdash; that Foynes will one day become part of the Shannon Ports Authority.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that section 13 should stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express disappointment at the Minister's response.  The Minister accepts, on the one hand, that there is substance behind the argument I have put forward, but, on the other hand, he is allowing this legislation to get muddier and muddier. It is a pity that the Oireachtas is used for producing very grey, very muddy and, indeed, increasingly incomprehensible legislation.  That is what we are doing today in producing this type of Bill.  That is my objection to the inclusion of section 13 and that is why I put down this amendment. As I said in relation to an earlier amendment, I have not put down any amendments to deal with the principles <Col N="1946" /> underlying this Bill.  This is merely a drafting amendment.  It seems now that Foynes can be dissolved by the Minister, either in the exercise of his specific powers under section 13 of the Bill or in the exercise of his general powers under section 15 of the Bill.  My objection to section 13 is, to state it again, the duplication. This section is not necessary.  It is a pity that we are going to make this Bill one section longer when we could achieve the same purpose just as well, if not better, by having one section less in the Bill.  With those words I reluctantly and with a certain feeling of legislative constipation withdraw the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;sixty&rsquo; were substitued for &lsquo;thirty&rsquo;&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&lsquo;sixty linear miles&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;thirty miles&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 14 of the Bill which has the effect of amending section 19 of the Principal Act.  Section 19 of the Principal Act specifies seven circumstances within which a person may be disqualified from being appointed, elected, nominated or being a member of a harbour authority.  One of those circumstances is specified in section 19 (1) (c) of the Harbours Act of 1946 which provides as follows:</P>
      <P>A person shall be disqualified for being appointed, elected or nominated or being a member of a harbour authority if&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  except in the case of being appointed or being a local authority member, the place where he ordinarily resides is more than thirty miles from the principal office of the harbour authority.</P>
      <P>In this Bill in relation to the Shannon Ports Authority the Minister proposes to extend that distance to 60 miles.  The question was raised on Second and Committee Stages as to how one would measure those 60 miles.  I think it was Senator Honan who raised the question of whether it should be measured as the bird flies.  Various comments were made as to precisely how one would measure the 60 miles.  Concern was expressed that in so far as residence of a member of the Authority is concerned, residence should be reasonably within the area of the Shannon Ports Authority.  In response to questioning on this point on Committee Stage the Minister said it would be 60 linear miles.  The purpose of this amendment is simply to give greater clarity to the Bill. There are already a number of grey areas. There are already areas of duplication in this Bill.  We are attempting simply to provide better legislation.  The purpose of this amendment is to follow the words used by the Minister on Committee Stage.  In the interests of clarification I would hope that the Minister will not depart from the words he used on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It is seldom that Senator Durcan and I are on the same wavelength. I spoke on Second and Committee Stages about miles &mdash; 30 miles and 60 miles.  Senator Durcan has talked about rendering Bills more clearly understood. Now we have a new phrase: 60 <Col N="1949" /> linear miles, which will warrant some explanation.  The world is sufficiently confused at present without bringing in new kinds of miles.  If I recall correctly, I asked what kinds of miles these were. Somebody in response waved their hands in a particular direction.  I asked that the headquarters of this Authority be located at Shannon Airport.  I do not want it located in headquarters already tabbed for that purpose in Limerick city, a building bearing a reserve sign.  My fear would be that the people who will eventually comprise the Authority may be located further away, whether in ordinary miles as I understand them or in the new miles as mentioned in Senator Durcan's amendment.  I am concerned that whoever may be lucky enough to be elected as members of the Authority will be located within striking distance of their meeting place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <P>Section 19 (1) (c) of the 1946 Harbours Act provides, as Senator Durcan pointed out, that elected or nominated members of the Harbour Authority must ordinarily reside within 30 miles of its principal office.  The reason the Minister inserted section 14 in this Bill was to extend the distance to 60 miles, given the great size of the estuary. Amendment No. 9 proposes the insertion of the word &ldquo;linear&rdquo; into this section. As I explained on Committee Stage, the reference to section 19 (1) (c) of the 1946 Act relates to radial distance, not distance by road or otherwise.  The very fact that it is not qualified in the 1946 Harbours Acts means that no other interpretation can be put on it.  If it were to be constructed as meaning distance by road &mdash; and if that is what we had in mind here &mdash; then we would have to insert it and the Bill would have to say so specifically. The premise on which the Senator has based this amendment is somewhat flawed on this occasion.  I cannot see any necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <P>At this stage we are only wasting our time speaking at length about powers given to Ministers or asking that any amendment on the clár before us should have any responsible reply, with all due respect to the Minister.  The power in section 15 is very serious.  I understand there was some change made on this section.  I am not going to exhaust myself any further on it. I have moved my amendment but there will be no vote.  I still have my worries about the power in section 15 of this amended Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage of the Bill and in the course of the Committee Stage debate Senators from all sides of the House expressed their serious concern at the rather sweeping nature of the powers given to the Minister under section 15.  The section gives the power to the Minister to dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate harbour authorities by order and that, of course, is a very sweeping power indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said during the course of both the previous Stages that the most immediate effect of this section would be to give the Minister the power to reconstitute the Dublin Port and Docks Board, since he has indicated on a number of occasions that it is his intention to do so.  As I said at the earlier Stages also, any proposal to reconstitute the organisation of the port of Dublin, which organisation is not in itself undesirable, should be a subject for serious deliberation on the part of the Oireachtas, given the importance of the port in the nation's economic and social <Col N="1951" /> life.  I would have thought that any suggestion the Minister might have to reconstitute an economic entity of that size should come before the Oireachtas in the form of legislation or a legislative proposal.  In section 15 as originally drafted there was power whereby any order made by the Minister under the section would be subject to review by the Oireachtas within 21 days of its being tabled.  As we know, this is a rather negative power of scrutiny for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage the Minister in response to suggestions from all sides of the House put in a provision whereby any order which he might wish to make under section 15 would have to be approved in the first instance by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is a step forward certainly from the initial provision.  I must say, despite the fact that I have no intention of pressing the matter any further today, that it still remains a sweeping provision. It is one that causes all of us concern, even in its qualified form now.  The effect of it, even as qualified, is that should the Minister table an order before the Oireachtas and seek a resolution from both Houses of the Oireachtas, for example, to reconstitute the Dublin Port and Docks Board or to both reconstitute it and amalgamate it with other harbours on the eastern seaboard area, the only opportunity that the Members will have will be to make one speech each on the topic when the resolution comes before the Houses.  We will not have the opportunity to scrutinise in detail and to seek amendment to the order.  We will simply have the option of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that seems to be unsatisfactory, given the scale of what might be proposed in relation to Dublin port.</P>
    <P>While I accept entirely that there is need to do something to reconstitute the organisation of Dublin port, this is not the right way to go about it.  It would have been better to have developed legislation which, for example, would have dealt with both Shannon Port Authority and Dublin Port and Docks Board in the same Bill if necessary.  Everybody agrees that <Col N="1952" /> these are the two largest ones which stand to be dealt with in the short term.  We have not been able to make very much progress on this matter.  I hope, as in the case of the suggestions I made this morning about representation of the Shannon Ports Authority and the board of management of that port, that between now and the time the Bill reaches the Dáil the Minister will have had time to take account of the valid and non-contentious suggestions that were made on both of these latter matters.  By taking account of what has been said and by introducing amendments to meet what is in effect the general will of the Seanad, the Bill as finally enacted would be an improved Bill on the one we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Senator Honan and Senator Hillery that this section 15 definitely gives a sweeping power to the Minister, as does section 13.  The Minister did go part of the way by introducing a new subsection under which a draft of an order will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and will not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House. However, it is obvious that when the Minister lays such an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas he knows it will be approved because of the majority in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 13 and subsection (4) of section 15 are only &ldquo;window dressing&rdquo; because a Minister if he is under pressure from Members of the Oireachtas within a special area who want to dissolve the Foynes Harbour trustees or the Dublin Port and Docks Board can just ask the Cabinet of the day and it can be approved.  They might think they were acting in the best interests but it might not eventually work out in the best interests of the locality.  These things can be done for sectional or personal reasons.  No harbour board should be dissolved under section 13 without the consent of the body itself.  That is a right that they are entitled to and it should be in some way enshrined in both section 13 and section 15.  There are sweeping powers in these sections.  I am not saying <Col N="1953" /> that they would be used wrongly, but there is a danger that because of sectional or personal interests the powers in these sections might be misused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the Minister has gone some way towards meeting the concerns of the Members by amending this section where he provides that where the Minister proposes to make an order under this section a draft of the order shall be laid before each House. That, of course, is welcome.  It adds to the control the Houses have over the legislation.  At the same time I want to join with other Senators in expressing my disquiet about the sweeping powers, as we see them, outlined in the relevant subsection of the Bill.  Perhaps I could conclude by asking the Minister why section 15 (2) (b) has to be so powerfully and finally worded?  Can he not find it possible to go some way towards us in allowing the Authority that might be dissolved in the future a direct say in that decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything that has been said here.  I do not take this section in isolation from what appears to be the thrust of Government policy in a variety of new Bills which have been introduced into this House.  All of them in turn have contained a section which gives very deliberately quite excessive powers to the Minister of the day.  I see this as a further tier in the over-centralisation of policy-making in the country.  It leads to paralysis, over-interference, and it cuts back on the initiative which can be displayed in the regions and by local authorities of one kind and another.</P>

    <P>It is all very fine for the Government of the day or the Minister of the day to have power in aggregate, to have power as to how funds are dispersed in a general way, but where it comes down to the absolute nitty-gritty of too much domination, too much interference, it has a paralytic effect.  Whatever the arguments for and against giving powers to Ministers of the day, I can say from some small personal experience that one of the great problems facing every Minister now is <Col N="1954" /> the crippling burden of minutia laid on his desk without giving him full opportunity to deal with overall policy on national and international matters.  Passing legislation of this kind is adding further to the necessity for political and ministerial interference with the day-to-day running and management of authorities around the country.  Changes have to be made, rationalisation and matters of that kind have to be taken in hand, but when there is a serious matter like this the power to do it by order should not reside with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers enshrined in this section are enabling powers which would permit the reorganisation of the harbour authorities Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946, in line with the Government policy as outlined in the Green Paper on Transport Policy which was published in November 1985.  I accept that the enabling powers under section 15 are wide, as was said by many of the Senators now and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is the intention not to use these powers in specific cases without total and absolute consultation in advance.  It would be nonsensical to attempt to do it otherwise.  As Senators have pointed out, the amendment which I have introduced requiring a draft order be laid before each House of the Oireachtas which will be subject to resolution approving of the draft prior to its being made, will provide an adequate safeguard against abuse of the powers.  I know full well that it has not gone all the way, or even gone remotely as far as many of the Senators who spoke would like to see it going but it is a very powerful safeguard in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of accuracy, the Minister said that I drew attention to the draft order.  I saw it as an improvement but I certainly did not see it as an adequate safeguard.  I think the Minister ascribed that term to me, which is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did that I had no intention of doing so.  What I said was <Col N="1955" /> that it went part of the way but that I knew it did not go nearly all of the way the Senators required.  I was making that point as regards all Senators who spoke on this aspect.  I said I believe it provides an adequate safeguard.  That was my opinion and I certainly had no intention of ascribing that to any of the Senators who have just contributed.  Otherwise it would be obvious I was not listening to what was being said.  The point was made very emphatically to me and I was recognising the fact that what we had done, which I described as adequate, was not being accepted as adequate by the Senators in their contributions.</P>
      <P>On another point Senator Hillery made, the Government have already decided in the context of devolution to local authorities that harbours that now cater for little or no commercial traffic should be handed over to local authorities. It is intended that this decision be catered for in the present Bill and section 15 also makes provision towards that end.</P>
      <P>Senators referred to section 15 (2) (b) which they said was strongly worded.  If the consent was required then it would be giving a total veto to the particular Authority and progress could not be made that is required in this matter.  What is being attempted to do with all the harbours is to give us a better and more up-to-date system as far as they are concerned. There is a general acceptance all round &mdash; although I know there is a disagreement on this point about the sweeping powers &mdash; that something must be done about the harbours, both the larger ones and also the smaller ones which are of no further commercial use. Perhaps they can be better looked after by the local authority for amenity purposes. The present system is cumbersome and unwieldy because the Authorities in some of these cases were set up for dealing with commercial traffic that no longer exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Laying the draft order before each House of the Oireachtas will I believe provide adequate safeguards.  On the other hand, I must note what Senators <Col N="1956" /> have said and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 (b) has too much power.  Section 15 (3) states, &ldquo;The Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under this section...&rdquo;.  Before the Minister concluded he made reference to giving power back to local authorities. I do not know why this Bill needs section 15.  There is massive power here and Senator Smith, who for a short while was a junior Minister, referred to that. No Minister is capable of watching everything go through his Department.  We talk about decentralisation.  Why is this kind of power in section 15 needed for this new Authority and why does the Minister have to hold this kind of power? If the Minister is happy with the composition of the Authority, why does he require the kind of powers as set out in section 15.  Section 15 (2) (b), (3) and (4) gives massive power to any Minister. Senators Hillery, Smith and Kiely referred to this.  I know Ministers have vast workloads but if we have faith in this Authority why do we need this section? As I said on Second and Committee Stages, the Minister could have brought in the Harbours Bill, 1986, with just this one section, section 15 which sweeps everything aside.  I do not have Senator Durcan's legal mind, and maybe I am not reading this section properly, but I have asked other opinions on that section and I find the ministerial power in it frightening. As I said before, and I am going to repeat it, there are people who are capable of being Ministers and not abusing power when they get their seals of office, but there are people who do abuse their power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Authority will be what we all hope.  As Senator O'Mahony said earlier, there is all-party agreement in this House on the kind of Authority we want but the powers given to a Minister under this Bill scare me, and that is why I say again that I am worried about giving this type of power to one person.  If the Minister holds the responsibility, he also holds the power under section 15.  The <Col N="1957" /> change at the end does not change my mind or my deep worries about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said it all before and I am sure the Minister has noted my remarks.  There is a new body of trustees at Clarecastle and I would ask the Minister to convey my views that Clarecastle should have representation on the Authority.  Clarecastle has a future.  If we are sincere about job creation we should remember that there is great potential for job creation in Clarecastle.  Today, there is an input by private investment in property and barges in Clarecastle of roughly £180,000.  By today's standards, in a small constituency like Clare that is a big commitment.  You have been a businessman a long time, a Chathaoirligh, and you understand finances much better than I do.  Clarecastle will not have even one representative on the new Authority.  I do not know where it will end.  I am not putting this to a vote but I must make this case.  I know Deputies from other <Col N="1958" /> counties will look after their people when this Bill goes to the Dáil.  I have been at Clarecastle pier, I have gone out on a boat and I have seen the dredging being done.  As I said on Second Stage, Kilrush, Kildysart and Moneypoint, should be taken into consideration when ministerial appointments are being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage.  I obtained clarification from the Minister in relation to the Clarecastle Harbour Trustees.  Under section 3 the powers, duties, functions, assets, rights and liabilities as of now vested in the Clarecastle Pier Trustees will transfer in their entirety to the new ports Authority.  The effect of this will be to ensure that the developments that have now commenced as a joint venture between the pier authorities in Clarecastle and private enterprise will continue unaffected within the new ports Authority. I obtained that assurance from the Minister and I am grateful for it.  Bearing in mind that two of the Clarecastle Harbour Trustees are Members of the other House, I am content to let this section wait until it is discussed there, and with their immediate involvement, I will let it rest with their judgment.  Having got the assurances from the Minister that the arrangements, the rights, the liabilities, the duties and responsibilities that prevail at Clarecastle and are within the powers of the present trustees will transfer in their entirety to the new ports Authority, I am satisfied to leave it to the judgment of the other House whether this section should stand.</P>

      <P>The case for Clarecastle has been strongly made by both Senators Honan and Howard.  The Minister will, of course, have time to think further about the contents of the Bill between now and the autumn when it comes before the Dáil.  He has already promised, in respect of several sections discussed here today, to give serious consideration to the strongly held views of the Members of this House, and I hope that in adhering to that promise he will give due consideration to representation <Col N="1959" /> in Clare, which includes Clarecastle, on the Authority.</P>

      <P>The overall purpose of this Bill is really to set the scene for all-round progress and development in the area and, while I cannot claim to have the local knowledge that the Senators have and have expressed in expressing their fears about Clarecastle, I hope that the all-round benefits will be shared by Clarecastle as well as the other areas and that we will have benefits flowing to Clarecastle rather than any diminution of them.  The effect of the section we are dealing with is that responsibility for Clarecastle Pier is being transferred from one public body to another.  Because the trustees will have no further function in relation to the pier it is necessary to provide for the repeal of the 1933 Act, as is being done now.  A difficulty arose previously about the legal situation arising from the High Court order of November 1982 appointing certain persons to act as trustees of Clarecastle Pier.  That matter has since been discussed with the Attorney General and there is no difficulty in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general points as we conclude our discussion on this Bill which now will go to the Dáil.  The discussions that we have had here on one very long day and indeed, in today's performance which must be considered a mini-marathon, and on Second Stage which took up some time also, have shown the capacity of this House to go through a measure such as this in detail, establish its weaknesses, point them out, raise them with the Minister and seek improvements.  We have got improvements from the Minister and for that I thank him.</P>
      <P>The Minister, the Seanad and other parties have the same objective: to ensure that this national resource, which is the Shannon Estuary, is developed in a manner that will give the greatest possible return to the nation.  To achieve that we must get the right people at the helm and the right balance &mdash; I regret that I am bringing back this term again &mdash; in the constitution of the Authority and on the board of management that may emerge from them.</P>
      <P>As the other House is now in recess, the Minister and his Department will have from now until the autumn to consider the arguments and the points that have been put forward in this debate here and to ponder on them carefully.  The Minister for Communications and the Minister of State will see that the points made and the arguments advanced here contain issues that have not yet been resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned and that will need to be resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned to ensure a proper outcome.  I expect that some more changes will be made in the Bill, certainly with regard to representation, the constitution of the Authority and perhaps also of the board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I believe that this House did well in its examination of this Bill.  It leaves the House a much <Col N="1961" /> better document than it was when it was introduced here.  Let us hope that the other House will continue the good work we have begun here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Howard that this Bill was very widely discussed in this House on Second Stage. Committee Stage and today on Report Stage.  It was disappointing that this House today decided to refer another Bill to the Joint Committee on Legislation. We are very capable of dealing with Bills here in this House, as this Bill relating to the Shannon Ports Authority has proved. We all hope that this Bill will meet its objectives, which are the development of the Shannon Estuary in which other bodies are involved also, more ships using the ports and eventually more employment being created.  I see nothing in the Bill that will create immediate employment, and that is disappointing.  The dissolving of some port authorities will, if anything, reduce employment in the Shannon Estuary.  However, I hope that personnel with knowledge of management will be on the new Shannon Ports Authority and the management committee.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I moved an amendment to section 4 to delete subsection (1a) (b) which provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations specify the manner in which the local authority members are appointed....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to raise that earlier in the day but the Cathaoirleach told me I could not do so.  I respect the Cathaoirleach at all times and I bow to his ruling on it.  Subsequently, the manner in which the Minister can regulate the appointment or the election of local authority members to the Shannon Ports Authority was mentioned. Members of local authorities are elected by the people and they should command respect and high standing. Some people are inclined to disparage them.  The paragraph I have mentioned undermines their standing and status.  As elected representaives they are fit to make appointments themselves in what manner they see fit.  I think that members <Col N="1962" /> of local authorities, for whom I have great respect, are discriminated against in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I moved an amendment to section 5 and the Minister met me half way on it be removing a provision limiting representation on the board of management to only two elected members of local authorities.  However, there is no provision whereby any member of a local authority will be on the board of management as applies in the case of a representative from the workforce.  This is discriminatory so far as elected members of local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (d) of the Bill proposes that three members of the Authority shall be elected by the Authority.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which I withdrew in favour of the Minister's suggestion that he would delete another section which said that not more than two elected members of a local authority could be on the Shannon Ports Authority. Now, it is proposed that three members of the Authority shall be elected by the Authority, two of whom shall be elected members of local authorities.  They deserve that recognition in view of the fact that they have gone before the people and been elected to these authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the Minister thought it necessary to make regulations to ensure that these authorities when appointing their members to the Shannon Ports Authority would ensure that they would be from electoral areas nearest to the Shannon.  I am very familiar with Limerick County Council who appoint members to Limerick Harbour Commission and Foynes Harbour Trustees. They always act in the best interests of authorities and appoint members who contribute to the success of those bodies. As far as Foynes Harbour Authority are concerned their members come from the electoral areas of Newcastle West and Rathkeale.  Members are never appointed, as was suggested by the Minister when he was defending the inclusion of this subsection, from the Kilmallock or Bruff areas, they are always from the adjacent local authority electoral areas. <Col N="1963" /> We should have confidence in the elected members of local authorities and let them mind their own business.  We should not specify the manner in which local authority members are appointed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State in his discussions with the Minister for Communications to introduce amendments in the Dáil to rectify the anomaly of discrimination against members of local authorities.  I am concerned also about sections 13 and 15.  I know the Minister came part of the way by amending the section to include subsection (4) but it is not sufficient because the ministerial powers in both those sections are excessive. Power can be abused.  I would be disappointed if the Government appointed a Minister who would abuse power, but there is always that danger. It happened before and it could happen again.  I should also like to ask the Minister to have a look at the dangerous and sweeping powers which the Minister has in these two sections and to amend them in the Dáil where the Bill will be discussed before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we are at the conclusion of this debate I should like to warmly thank the Minister for his long hours and patience with us.  The Bill leaving this House is much better, but I am sorry that more of the amendments were not carried.  However, contributions in this House by all Senators will help the Minister, the Minister of State and his officials to be prepared for the debate in the other House.  When they see the composition of the representation they should be as big as Ministers to whom I referred earlier on today when there were senior appointments to be given at Shannon under former Taoisigh like Seán Lemass and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an Authority which would create tremendous employment if it was evenly balanced and if politics could be kept out of it.  I do not see why this could not be done because we have already taken the Bill in this House &mdash; a House often decried for not playing the role the Constitution intended it to play.  It always <Col N="1964" /> floors me when I hear people, from Ministers down, who have served long years in politics decrying the Seanad. They might be glad in future years to serve here and might think differently when they leave it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to rectify &mdash; if there is a gap in representation &mdash; the composition of the elected people to this Authority.  I ask for representation for Clare, Kilrush, North Tipperary, Kerry and Limerick city and county.  The long hours given to the legislation in this House show the determination and commitment of the people of the west which is often underestimated when legislation is being drafted.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the long hours they spent in this House and for the amendments accepted. I also warmly thank the Cathaoirleach for the hours that I did not occupy the Chair as Leas-Chathaoirleach when I should have while this legislation was going through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of thanking the Minister of State for his patience regarding this Bill.  He was most accommodating.  While the Bill is not what we would all wish it to be, it is now a better Bill than it was when it came into this House.</P>
      <P>We should look at the Bill now in view of the overall effect that the proposed new harbour Authority will have on the region.  If the Bill is interpreted in the right spirit, I see no reason this Authority should not be very effective in promoting the whole region of the Shannon and ensuring the future of the area.  The potential of the Shannon Estuary was well articulated here by various speakers and I am convinced that there are major opportunities here if they are given a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I would like to mention the whole aspect of representation.  Certainly, I would like to see more representatives from Kerry, and I am sure the Clare people feel the same.  Nevertheless, the whole spirit of this Bill should go beyond just representation for the reasons I stated at the beginning.  I feel <Col N="1965" /> that if the proposed harbour Authority was larger it would take away from the dynamism of the Authority.  It will be far more effective as the small cohesive unit that I expect it will be.</P>
    <P>I would like especially to welcome the concept of a board of management.  I feel that this will be the boilerhouse and the driving force of the Authority.  While I sincerely hope that each local authority area will be represented on the board of management to ensure that Clare, Limerick and Kerry will feel that they are involved in the decision-making, nevertheless I feel that this board of management will have the overall interests of the area at heart.  This legislation has been awaited since the late fifties and it is historical that it is now coming through. I am disappointed that Foynes is not involved, but I feel that, if the new harbour Authority can prove itself, if it shows that it has potential and that there are prospects for the area, Foynes will then consider it prudent to come into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be evident from what I have said during the debate today that my reservations and worries focus primarily on representation and on the lack of a direction in connection with industrial development contained in the Bill.  With regard to representation as being fully teased out now as far as this House is concerned, I hope the Minister, given the months that will be available to reflect further on it, will give that degree of serious consideration that we consider necessary to the Clare representation as well as to Kerry, Limerick and North Tipperary.  As a Clareman, my primary interest focuses on that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the development aspect, the Minister is optimistic that today's Bill will provide a structure that will act as a catalyst for development in the future.  I hope he is right.  I would like to have seen more of the developmental aspect in this Bill.  The development aspect is of key importance, given the most pressing economic and social problem in the country, namely, unemployment. I hope the Minister, in his concluding remarks, will give us an assurance <Col N="1966" /> that all the points which have been genuinely held and not met in the course of the debate will be seriously considered during the summer.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister for one thing in particular, namely, the fact that he initiated the Bill in the Seanad.  We welcome that in this House and hope that he and his colleagues will continue that practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few things to say about the legislation.  The Minister knows that I have reservations with regard to section 15.  It is quite inappropriate that a Bill like this should contain the powers which it is proposed to give the Minister, not only in respect of the Bill as it is now before us but even more so in respect of the Bill as it originally came to us.  This is the Fifth Stage and we are restricted to what is in the Bill now.  But what is in the Bill is, in fact, still quite inappropriate.  It is of very doubtful constitutional validity that the Minister should be given the power to unilaterally abolish an authority which was established by Act of Parliament.  That appears to me to be most extraordinary, and an extreme power.  Members might confuse that or might be confused in their minds that local authorities, of course, can be abolished; a common expression is used that they are abolished if they fail to do this, that or the other.  But, of course, the local authority is not abolished.  What is abolished there is merely the elected representatives for the time being.  The local authority continues in existence. What applies in this case is the actual abolition of the Authority itself.  By what constitutional authority could the Minister decide to take property owned by one group of individuals &mdash; for example, the Cork Harbour Commissioners &mdash; and give it to somebody else?  It must be evident to the Minister and to his advisers that that is totally unconstitutional.  One cannot just take property from one group of people and give it to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that the Minister of State has done more with regard to meeting our genuine concerns in this matter than most other Ministers of State, and <Col N="1967" /> indeed most Ministers, would have done during the course of legislation.  However, I feel that it is necessary for me to say that if we are lucky enough to have competent Ministers of State &mdash; in this case we have an extremely competent Minister of State &mdash; it is only right that that Minister of State should be given all the authority necessary to accept amendments in this House.</P>
    <P>I have not spoken to the Minister and I do know whether he has that authority, but I suspect he has not.  If one is going to trust a Minister of State to take a complicated Bill like this through this House one must entrust to him the authority to concede during the course of the debate.  There is no Minister of State in this Government whom I would consider more capable of carrying out that than Minister Ted Nealon.  He has shown by the way he has mastered this Bill, and indeed other Bills that have come before us, that he is well capable of discerning what is the essential element and what are the really critical points we are making from the general points which we all like to make from time to time to expand our own knowledge and get across our own personal interests in various aspects of the legislation.  For all these reasons I would ask the Minister of State and the Minister to whom he reports to give the most serious consideration to the points that have been raised so that this Minister, or whichever Minister is taking it in the Dáil, can take it in the same spirit as it has been taken in this House and that further improvement can be made in the Bill during its course through that House.  If that happens I think that both Houses of the Oireachtas will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief remarks.  On Second Stage and also on Committee Stage I said that in my opinion the spirit of this Bill was extremely important to the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority.  I am satisfied from the goodwill of the Minister and the measure of co-operation forthcoming in the various areas that have <Col N="1968" /> been discussed at length, that a good spirit obtains with regard to the establishment of the Shannon Port Authority. I reiterate that it does not materially matter where the representatives come from provided broad account is taken of geographical and other representation, resulting in the right type of Authority, which includes people who are competent and capable of doing the job well.</P>
      <P>The potential of the estuarial Authority is enormous, encompassing the entire region of Limerick, Kerry, Clare and, indeed, extending further afield into other counties as well.  There is vast potential for great industrial development which has been impeded by lack of a really dynamic Shannon port authority up to now.  I, therefore, look forward to this very significant development where we have in train the establishment of a Shannon Port Authority which, I believe, will have the co-operation of all concerned.  The point was made already, and I emphasise it again, that it is vital that the board, in the first instance, the management board in the second instance and, indeed, the personnel at professional level who direct the Shannon Port Authority, be of the calibre required to do the job right.</P>
      <P>When the Minister comes to the stage of making his nominations to the board he must take account of the various areas that need to be considered, for example, the areas of trade, the workforce, the various entrepreneurs and geographical aspects as well.  Above all, and I urge this very strongly on the Minister, the question of the type of person acting on that board is of paramount importance having regard, of course, to all the other points mentioned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, who has spent much time in this House listening to various views expressed at the various Stages of this Bill, has helped enormously the Members of this House to understand more clearly what is involved and it is hoped that he has learned a good deal from the views and aspirations expressed here, which are a reflection of what people are thinking at this time in that general area.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I would like to thank Members of the House for their valuable contributions. These as Senators have said, have been long and very detailed, but they have been also worthwhile.  The Bill now, as amended substantially in some vital areas, is a well balanced instrument to achieve the overall purpose and desire of the single ports Authority.  Naturally, the opinions that have been expressed here do not die once the debate ceases. They obviously must be taken into consideration as the Bill is carried on further to the Dáil.  They will be considered by me and brought to the attention of the Minister where strong opinions and in some cases consensus of opinion have been expressed.</P>
      <P>I genuinely think this marks a time of new opportunities and new possibilities for the Shannon Estuary.  The true potential of that area could never be realised &mdash; and it has enormous potential &mdash; until there was a single ports Authority.  The Seanad has given a very good start to that process.  Once the Bill goes through the Dáil and has been enacted, the Minister will be pressing ahead with the necessary back up orders and regulations to ensure that there is no undue delay in the full establishment of the Authority.  As many Senators said during the course of the debate, it has been a very long wait but the turning point has obviously now come.  The Seanad has made a major contribution through the excellent debate here in ensuring that the best possible results will be gained.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1970" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like an explanation for an extraordinary phrase on the definition of a &ldquo;lottery game&rdquo;.  One gets the impression that somebody dug out the broadest possible definition.  The Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, appears to better represent a healthy public attitude to the whole area of gambling in the sense that it does permit it but it permits it as, at worst, a necessary evil or, at best, something that can be indulged in but with considerable limitations.  It has a definition of gaming as meaning &ldquo;playing a game whether of skill or chance or partly of skill or chance for stakes hazarded by the players&rdquo;.  It goes on to define a lottery as including all competitions for money or money's worth involving guesses or estimates of future events or of past events, results of which are not yet ascertained or not yet generally known.  What we are actually going to have is a definition of a lottery in the 1956 Act and a definition of gaming in the 1956 Act which mean one thing and a defintion of a lottery game in this Bill, which means something completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What troubles me is not so much the legal nicety, but the breadth of the term involved here.  While only one licence can be issued at any one time, according to my understanding of the Bill, any number of forms of lottery games could be introduced by the licensee.  It would not necessarily be one single game; we could have ten, 15 or 20 different things all going on at the one time, all swamping the nation in a morass of something that traditionally is looked upon with the same healthy scepticism that the consumption of alcohol is looked upon, something that can be tolerated in small measure but which is extremely dangerous if we get carried away with it.  What we seem to have written in here is the broadest possible definition to allow the broadest possible usage of this national lottery by whoever gets it, in as many ways as possible. I agree that it is subject to certain constraints, particularly ministerial approval, but nevertheless the term &ldquo;lottery game&rdquo; as defined means &ldquo;any game, <Col N="1971" /> competition or other procedure in which or whereby prizes, whether money prizes or otherwise, are distributed by lot or chance among persons participating in the game, competition or other procedure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary wide ranging term and it has to be taken in conjunction with the broad exemptions that are given in section 32, when in a one and a half line section all of the restraints society has imposed on the holding of lotteries are swept away.  This new lottery is a whole new creation, entitled to do all sorts of things and with a definition which is broader in sweep than anything contained in previous legislation.  I should like to know is there a specific reason for this breadth or is it one of these catch-all phrases thought up in the hope that it would embrace the broadest possible number of activities which could be regarded as revenue raising.  As I said on Second Stage, I do not want to become the moral conscience of the nation.  This country is more than awash with moral consciences as it stands and I do not want to add myself to the list of people guarding the morals of the nation.</P>
    <P>I do think society has an obligation to confront moral issues, not just in the areas where it feels safe confronting them, where traditional morality has a very rigid meaning, but in all areas where human values and morality are called into question.  The first place it is called into question is in this extraordinary definition of a lottery game.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>What is important to bear in mind is the fact that, under section 28, there is a provision whereby the company shall, in relation to each lottery game comprised in the national lottery, prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme setting out the rules of the game.  Any suggestion that there will be a free for all in this area is without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the definition, essentially this is only indirectly related to the definition of lottery in the 1956 Act.  In effect, it is a <Col N="1972" /> definition which is broadly designed to cover the type of games that are proposed; but, of course, allowing some margin for flexibility in case that some variations of same become sensible alternatives in years to come.  What is proposed initially are two types of games. The first, hopefully, launched late this year, will be an instant game cum draw. The tickets will have rub-off symbols similar to the promotional games operated by the petrol companies.  The second game, lotto, will be added at a later stage and will involve more preparation.  The preparation will involve the installation of about 400 or 500 data input terminals on line to the lottery's computer in sales locations throughout the country.  Broadly speaking, the definition has been devised to cover, in particular, those two games and as I mentioned earlier, of course, with the possibility of some variant thereof emerging in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have a reasonably broad definition because it would not be very sensible that if a variation was proposed by An Post in three year's time for very sensible reasons and a new scheme of rules presented to the Minister that the Minister, for some very technical reason, would have to come back to the House because the initial definition was too narrow.  From the point of view of the protection of the public interest, we have, firstly, a subsidiary of a semi-State body, operating the lottery and, secondly, we have the residual control with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I mentioned one section under which a scheme of rules has to be submitted for approval to the Minister, but there are many other provisions in the Bill permitting the issue of directions by the Minister if he is concerned about a particular aspect.  The fact that the definition is expressed in somewhat broad terms is sensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister talked about the public interest, having had an opportunity over the last week to read about the operation of lotteries my view is quite simply that in the public interest this whole thing should be scrapped.  But <Col N="1973" /> since we cannot do that at this stage, one has to do one's best to make sure, first, that we know what we are dealing with and, second, that what we are dealing with is clearly defined.  Given some of the catch-on phrases that the Minister has provided to make sure that this works as he desires it to work, any extra ambiguity is worrying, to say the least.  I do not see anything in the definition of lottery game which is not included in the definition of gaming in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  The Minister has conceded the point I made: that it is a very broad definition.  It is at least broad enough to incorporate new concepts of gaming that are not currently practised or permitted in this country.  It depends on the good sense and the view of the Minister of the time, whoever he may be, to ensure that we do not have a multiplicity of games being operated by the one company.  The only thing that is restricted is the licence.  We are giving one body a monopoly to run as many lotteries as the Minister permits it to run. Given the pressures on people, is it not arguable that we will have a series of local-type lotteries being generated by the same body who run the national lottery to raise funds for desirable local causes?</P>
      <P>The Minister, like myself, knows that this House and the other House are made up of people of the same level of integrity as the rest of Irish society, which is by and large reasonably high.  It is not made up of saints and neither is the other House.  Therefore, if pressures are to surface and if we have a very broadly based definition, we are liable to have temptations to extend these activities more and more.  Since I am more convinced that there are moral questions that have not been addressed, not to mention questions that have not been answered, it is regrettable that the definition should be as broad as that, particularly in the light of the later section which simply dismisses the whole regulation that society has imposed in this area of activity up to now.</P>

      <P>Perhaps unintentionally Senator Ryan may be a little partial to the Government from the point of view of the moral aspect.  I do not think he intended to convey the impression that this aspect was in anyway ignored by the Government.  I do not want to get into a Second Stage reply because this aspect was raised on Second Stage.  We have looked at the operation of this type of gaming in other parts of the world.  We have looked at reports from other parts of the world.  We are satisfied from the reports that are available that we are embarking on what is regarded elsewhere as a harmless form of legalised gambling. On Second Stage I mentioned the recent UK Home Office study on gambling generally. This concluded that there was evidence to show that lotteries and pools which provided a natural limit to participation &ldquo;are unlikely to be a significant potential danger to the participant&rdquo;.  I would like to put on the record that these aspects were looked at before we launched the proposal for a national lottery.</P>
      <P>I indicated that the national lottery was drawn up generally to cover two types of lottery games that are proposed.  It was also to allow some margin of flexibility in case it is necessary or desirable to introduce some variant thereof.  At the same time the definition prescribes that any such game or competition must involve prizes which are distributed by lot or chance.  Even within the definition there is a restricting factor.  This is the appropriate kind of definition bearing in mind the type of lottery games that are proposed.</P>

      <P>I do not want to join in a discussion on the definition of lottery. I agree with almost everything that Senator Ryan said, but there is no point in going into a Second Stage debate.  There are other sections of the Bill on which I will be expressing similar views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 1 the Minister defines the national lottery as any lottery game.  Why did he not say a national lottery?  The national lottery means any lottery game or combination of lottery games.  Surely <Col N="1975" /> what we are talking about is a national lottery.  He states that he is establishing two different types of games.  One is a kind of an instant game and the other a lotto game.  How can he say that there is just one thing called the national lottery? I do not understand that.  One of the problems with this Bill is that it is very hard to understand.  When we come to some of the other sections I would like some of the Members to explain to me what they mean.  I do not think anybody in this House or the Minister without assistance, could possibly understand it. It is obscene how difficult it is.  This complicated type of legislation can give rise to a situation where we read problems into things that do not exist.  Can the Minister explain why it is not defined as the national lottery?</P>

      <P>On that point, section 3 provides that the Minister may grant a licence to a person authorising the holding on behalf of the Minister of the national lottery.  Not more than one licence under this subsection shall be in force at any time.

This is almost a fiat from on high which we humble peasants are not supposed to question.  Yet, we have been presented here, as Senator O'Leary rightly says, with a load of gobbledygook. Whichever person, under the august title of parliamentary draftsman, drafted that section should resign on the spot.  That is gobbledygook of the first order, written in such a way as to mean I think, the Minister can amend legislation by decree if he finds that he cannot work within the legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say that I completely stand over the efforts of the parliamentary draftsman in relation to this subsection.  We are talking about a technical provision in the event of the Minister having to hold the lottery under section 1.  The general idea is that the Minister will issue a licence to an authorised body, as we intend to, like An Post.  But there is a provision in the Bill that the Minister can directly hold the lottery.  In that situation we need some cover for the operation of the lottery by the Minister.  This is a technical provision which, in that event, applies the provisions of the Bill &mdash; which otherwise legislate for the operation of the national lottery by licensee under section 3 &mdash; to the Minister when the Minister, rather than the licensee, holds the lottery.  If the Senator reads the subsections carefully he will find that that intention comes through very clearly.  I prefaced my remarks by saying that this is a technical provision.  This is not the intention at all but it could arise in certain circumstances. In those circumstances, while the Bill is drawn up generally on the basis that the operation will be run by a licensee, we need to apply those provisions to the fall-back situation if the Minister were to be running it himself.  I would feel that those Senators who made not very complimentary remarks about the draftsman might now withdraw those remarks.  I do not think they are quite fair.</P>

      <P>Can somebody explain to <Col N="1978" /> me under what legal principle this whole subsection has to be contained in one sentence?  Is there a legal principle which says that things have to be made excessively complicated by putting in about half a dozen subordinate clauses?  I do not understand why, if something is as complicated as this, it should be expressed in one sentence only.  The rest of us have been taught and have had it drilled into us by various means, fair and unfair, that long complicated sentences with a whole host of subordinate clauses guarantee confusion, guarantee that people will not understand what you are saying.  Can somebody explain to me why, under some obscure principle of drafting, the way to do it is to put it all in one sentence. It seems to me that a series of simple sentences could say exactly the same thing and we would understand them. The Minister just said what it was intended to do.  Why could the subsection not be written in the same simple English instead of this long sentence with God knows how many subordinate clauses?  I stand over what I said, that if that is the skill of parliamentary draftsmen then we could do without them.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying &mdash; perhaps it is a new one &mdash; that for every complex problem there is a simple answer which does not work.  I am not one to discuss the merits or demerits of draftsmanship.  I understand that it is a career which involves very extensive training.  Not having gone through that training I cannot really comment on it.  It seems to me, having carefully read this subsection, that it clearly expresses what we want it to express.  We want to give the fall-back powers to the Minister in the event of his having to run the lottery direct.  The subsection clearly does that. I am not sure that anything much would be gained by a discussion as to how it is put together by the parliamentary draftsman. It seems quite all right to me.  On Senator Brendan Ryan's point as to whether it is usual to have subordinate clauses all in one sentence or broken up into separate sentences, I am not an expert. From my point of view what is important <Col N="1979" /> is that, in relation to the instructions which are issued to the parliamentary draftsman, he comes back with a wording which effectively puts into writing what we want.  That is what he has done in this case.  I will not enter into any hassle with Senator O'Leary except to say that his comments are perhaps a little unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that in subsection (1) (a) the reference to &ldquo;a person&rdquo; may mean a company or it may mean a person?  If I am right in that &mdash; and I think I am right &mdash; would the Minister explain the meaning of subsection 7 because it is very important. This is not just a drafting point.  This is much more important.  Subsection 7 reads:</P>
      <P>A licence shall be in writing and shall be expressed to authorise a company, being the licensee or a subsidiary of the licensee or in a case where the licensee is not a company, a company which, if the licensee where a company, would be a subsidiary of the licensee, to hold the National Lottery on behalf of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear what is in mind.  It is proposed to grant a licence to a company. That company will be authorised to operate the lottery or, alternatively, have a subsidiary company which is operating the lottery.  That is quite understandable and I accept its merit.  It is also envisaged that it is possible that an individual will be appointed as licensee and that that individual will operate through a company. It then goes on to say that if an individual is appointed and the company operates, the relationship between the company and the individual must be the same as between a company and its subsidiary. How could the relationships between an individual and a company be <Col N="1980" /> the same as between a company and its subsidiary?  That is what it says.  The Explanatory Memorandum says, in brackets at the end of the explanation of section 3:</P>
    <P>In circumstances where the licensee is not a company, the relationship between the authorised company and the licensee will be that of a subsidiary company to its holding company.</P>
    <P>In other words, what is being said is that you can appoint an individual, and he can use a subsidiary company, provided the relationship between him and the subsidiary company is the same as that between a holding company and a subsidiary. How could you have a situation where the relationship between an individual and a company which he owns is the same as the relationship between a holding company and a subsidiary company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to subsection (1) the licence may be granted to a person but under the Interpretation Act &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes &ldquo;company&rdquo;.  That clarifies that point.  The purpose behind the provisions of subsection (7) and of section 10 is to ensure that the lottery is run by a corporate entity within the Companies Act and should have as its sole function the operation of the national lottery.  Irrespective of who gets the licence, whether it is an individual or a body corporate, the lottery must be run by a company whose sole function is to operate the lottery.  Here we are talking about the subsidiary of An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If in the future a licence were to be given to an individual rather than to a company, the subsection provides that the relationship between that individual and the authorised company should mirror the relationship between a holding company and a subsidiary.  My understanding of a definition of a subsidiary company &mdash; an perhaps Senator O'Leary who is rather an expert in the company law area may be able to assist here &mdash;is that the holding company has to hold more than 50 per cent of the shares of the subsidiary.  The effect of this subsection <Col N="1981" /> is that, if the licence were issued to an individual, to mirror the relationship between a holding company and its subsidiary that individual would have to own more than half of the normal value of the equity share capital of the authorised company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, why did we not say that?  That would have covered that point.  The Minister might be aware that it is not a simple matter of saying because you own more than 50 per cent you are a subsidiary.  There is a 50 per cent subsidiary, there is a 75 per cent subsidiary and there is a 90 per cent subsidiary &mdash; all different subsidiaries recognised for different purposes under law.  It is not just one subsidiary; there are subsidiaries and subsidiaries within the Companies Act and within the Finance Act.  It is not clear which one of these it is intended to apply to.  I have no objection to what the Minister said.  I agree it should be run by a corporate entity.  I do not disagree with what the Minister is seeking to achieve there, but it does not make it clear.  Where he wants to appoint a licensee, what he is saying is that the licensee must be in a relationship with a company as if it was a holding company and a subsidiary relationship. That obviously begs the definition of what kind of subsidiary they are talking about in the first place.  If all he meant was that the licence holder must hold more than 51 per cent of the authorised share capital of the company, he should have said that instead of going into these extraordinary situations where a licensee must in relation to a company be in the same position with its company as a company would be to its holding company.</P>

      <P>I would not pretend to be such an expert on company law, as Senator O'Leary.  My complaint is rather similar to that of Senator Brendan Ryan in that I think this is being made unnecessarily complicated.  I, too, can see and understand why in section 10 the Minister says that it should be only a company running this lottery and I see the reasons behind that.  If that is so, why <Col N="1982" /> do we have to go into the complications of section 3 (7) at all?  Why not just issue the licence to the company that is running the lottery?  Why go into this business of the company being a subsidiary of the company?  We can say it is going to be a subsidiary of An Post but then the licence should be issued to the subsidiary.  Why envisage a situation at all where the lottery is run by a person who has a sort of subsidiary company?  Even leaving aside the difficulties raised by Senator O'Leary, why not just issue the licence to the company that is running the lottery?  If you have a person who is owning, say, 51 per cent or 76 per cent or 91 per cent of the shares of this company, then basically it is the person who is running the lottery because the person owns the company. We are thereby in a way undermining to some degree the provisions of section 10 which envisage only a company doing it. We do not want to get into the situation where a person, whether it is an individual or a person who owns the majority shares in the company, is running a national lottery of this type.  The simplest thing to do is to amend subsection (7) to say that the licence is to be issued to whatever company is actually running the lottery, whether it is a subsidiary of another company or whether it is a company that is partly owned by somebody or whatever.

      <P>That might not appear very significant in the remaining scheme. Members might look at what we will be discussing later on, namely section 14 which says how the directors of the company are going to be appointed.  It has two different provisions.  It has a provision in subsection (2) that the directors shall be appointed by the Minister.  That is fair enough.  That could be the normal situation. It also provides in subsection (3) that if and whenever one person is the holder of more than one half in nominal value of the total issued shares he shall appoint four of the directors.  That is to cover a situation, presumably, where a person is in a position where he is the <Col N="1983" /> licensee and has a subsidiary company, a company which is in a subsidiary position to himself, if such a thing can exist; he must own more than 51 per cent of the shareholding and then as a result of that he appoints four of the directors.  Does the Minister envisage that an individual is going to get the licence and, if he does, who is this individual to be?  Is he to appoint four of the seven directors?  I know the Minister's approval is required. I understand all that and we will come to a discussion on that later.  The suggestion made by Senator McGuinness is perfectly reasonable.  Why do we not have a company set up and give a licence to the secretary of the company on behalf of the company, if we must give it to the individual, and just do the job that way? Why all this unnecessary complication?  I do not understand it.</P>

      <P>What we are talking about is establishing legislation which is enabling legislation, but we have to be aware of the facts.  The Government have decided that a subsidiary of An Post will run this lottery and will get a licence for ten years.  That is the practicality of the situation.  We have to bear in mind that a different situation could arise in ten years.  We also have to bear in mind the kind of submissions that were made by different individuals and consortia bidding for this licence.  The licence will be granted to a subsidiary of An Post.  In ten years time, would it not be proper that the Government of the day should not have their hands tied, that they could look at all the options again as this Government looked at the various bids that were made in relation to the start of the lottery?  That is the reason for this kind of provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the bids were not made by corporate bodies; they were made by groups.  We want to be in a situation, in the unlikely event that the licence of An Post would not be renewed and the question would be opened up again, that the Government of the day should have the same flexibility and freedom of manoeuvre as we had in granting the <Col N="1984" /> original licence.  That is the reason for this kind of provision.  It is only proper when we are establishing enabling legislation that this is what we should do.  If we just push everything into one narrow channel it does not give the flexibility that may be necessary in time to come to the Government of the day when the licence will come up for renewal.  It is absolutely unlikely under the provisions of the Bill that the licence will be revoked but the Government of the day at that time must have the flexibility to deal with the situation and not have their hands tied and thus not have freedom of manoeuvre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister does not want to be tied to a subsidiary of An Post in the future.  One of the groups that sought the licence was the Rehabilitation Institute.  If the Government were going to give control to the Rehabilitation Institute they would not appoint one named individual in the Rehabilitation Institute.  If they were not a corporate body themselves, the Government would get them to set up some kind of a company and would appoint the company under the care, control and management of the Rehabilitation Institute.  I would consider it grotesque to appoint one named individual to run the national lottery, but this is what the Minister is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is saying, quite rightly, that the lottery should always be run by a corporate entity but he is not taking the next logical step and saying, therefore, the only people he will actually appoint are corporate entities.  It seems to be that the same corporate entities who are actually going to run it should be appointed as licence holders.  If it is necessary to appoint the secretary of that company that is understandable but that is not what is being done.  The suggestion is that, if at any time in the future the Government want to move outside the corporate sector, they may want to appoint an individual and they would force that individual to establish a limited liability company who would operate through that company.  It appears to me it would be a lot more sensible for the <Col N="1985" /> Government to say the lottery would always be operated by a corporate entity and that they would only appoint corporate entities.  What is wrong with that? Why do you want the flexibility of appointing individuals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things involved in this, one of which Senator O'Leary has not mentioned.  It appears that we could effectively privatise the entire operation of the national lottery without any great difficulty because of the way this is written.  As the Minister said, if for some reason the licence was revoked, one individual could be asked to take it over.  Why do we have to wait until after an individual is granted a licence before the Government will be told who are the four people he proposes to name as the majority of the directors of the company which will run the lottery?  It seems to me that it would be in the interests of good government and of proper knowledge that the Government should know in advance who it was that a private individual proposed to put in the company or to name as directors of a company which was to run something as sensitive as a national lottery.</P>
      <P>I do not think something as sensitive, important and central as a national lottery should be run by a private individual. There is an issue of fundamental principle involved.  We are probably running around looking for the mythical entrepreneurs who do not exist anyway but that is not an issue I want to pursue too much.  I do not understand why we cannot insist that anybody who wants to apply to run the national lottery must in the first place set up a company.  It does not cost that much money to set up a company, and to name the directors of the company in advance.  If people want to run something on the scale of a national lottery and they are not prepared to stump up the cash to set up a company to apply for the licence, they are not the sort of people who should be considered for running a national lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points <Col N="1986" /> here and one is the question of the directors. We will be coming to that on a later section.  It quite clearly specifies that directors, even if nominated by a company, cannot be appointed without the consent of the Minister.  There is the control there.  We are talking here about the distinction between the licensee and the actual running of the lottery.  The provisions we are talking about permit that kind of scenario in all situations.  I do not want to go into any details of those who were bidding for the lottery.  Let us take an hypothetical example of perhaps a group of charities who would have trustees and who would be interested in running the national lottery.  This Bill, when enacted, would enable the Government of the day in that situation to grant a licence to a nominated person on behalf of that group of charities.  There might be a number of those charities.  The actual running of the lottery would be by a separate corporation or a separate company.</P>
      <P>We are talking about enabling provisions. We are talking about a situation where the decision has already been made.  Immediately this Bill is on the Statute Book the necessary steps will be taken to appoint a subsidiary of An Post. It would not be proper merely to put into the Bill the necessary enabling sections to allow us to follow that road.  This is what we intend to do now, but in the future the necessary flexibility should be there to enable the Government of the day to have all the options open, as they were to us when we were coming to the decision in relation to An Post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I get the impression that the Government, as this legislation is drafted, are encouraging sloppy thinking and sloppy activities on the part of people who could apply for a licence to run the national lottery.  Why can they not be required to fulfil proper legal requirements, like setting up a separate company, before they apply for the licence rather than wait until afterwards?  There may be legal obstacles in the way, and if there are I would be very interested to hear about them.  More and more I get the impression that legislation is being <Col N="1987" /> drafted as far as possible to avoid that great horror of horrors, which is, that the Minister might have to come back to the Oireachtas and explain himself.  We seem to be getting to the position where the executive want the maximum possible flexibility and the minimum possible accountability to the one body to which they are accountable, the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As one who will probably never have much chance of being part of the Executive, I am particularly sensitive to that.  We regularly see this with tail ends of legislation.  Rather than draft something which could have a particular meaning, we have something which could have any possible meaning given changes of policy and personnel in the future.  I still do not understand why we cannot insist that anybody who wants to apply for a licence to run the national lottery should not first set up a company, with named directors, in advance so that the State would know to whom the licence was being given.  I appreciate that it is a <i>post hoc</i> right of approval by the Minister, but that is not as good as knowing in advance, as it restricts the breadth of the decision that can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think I had the same interest in the functioning of parliamentary democracy as Senator Ryan.  I would see the Oireachtas having an entitlement to discuss the operation of the lottery in the same way as it would have been entitled to discuss the operations of any other matter in the national interest.  The Bill provides that annual reports have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  There are other provisions in both Houses whereby these reports, or any major aspects of them, can be discussed; but that is different to providing enabling legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Senator Ryan is aware of the rather complicated procedure that is involved in putting legislation through the Houses but, as I see it, it behoves us in the establishment of the national lottery and in bringing before the Houses enabling legislation, to provide for various eventualities.  This does not in any <Col N="1988" /> way preclude the House from discussing the operations of the lottery in years to come.  Suffice it to say that it is not an easy matter to be running back to the Houses of the Oireachtas on small technical points as they arise.  It is incumbent on a Government to cover as far as they can various technical possibilities when the enabling legislation is brought before the House.  Let me emphasise that it is certainly not the intention of Government to restrict in any way the Houses of the Oireachtas having debates in the future; that option will always be there.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear the Minister try to visualise what might happen in ten or 12 years' time.  We find ourselves year in year out trying to correct what happened the previous year or the previous month.  It is interesting to hear the Minister say what he sees will happen in a ten year period before problems arise.  In the granting of a licence to a subsidiary of An Post, will the Minister seek to control advertising and the remuneration to the subsidiary arising from the operation of the lottery?  While we are concerned that the lottery will be a success &mdash; and there are many competing needs for it &mdash; one of our fears is that it will have a detrimental effect on existing voluntary and other organisations.  Does the Minister seek to control in some way the capacity to advertise which would leave smaller units around the country at a disadvantage?</P>

      <P>There were two points raised in Senator Smith's question. There will be an agreement with An Post on a cost framework.  There have been very substantial discussions on this and the broad outline of this agreement has been settled.  I do not think it appropriate at this stage to go into detail, but essentially there is broad agreement, which we feel is satisfactory and fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of advertising and the voluntary and charitable bodies holding periodical lotteries we went into this in considerable detail on Second Stage.  We also have an amendment to a later section in regard to advertising, and we will have <Col N="1989" /> an opportunity then of looking at the advertising situation of the subsidiary of An Post in the context of that amendment. In an effort to improve the situation of the voluntary bodies we have lifted the present restrictions on advertising imposed by the 1956 Act.  In relation to the national lottery, I would anticipate that it will be run on a commercial basis and advertising will be part of that commercial operation.  We will go into it in more detail on the amendment on that specific point.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall not grant a licence to a person unless he is satisfied as to the suitability and competence of the person to hold, or, as the case may be, procure the holding of the National Lottery.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that there will be some financial criterion under which a licence can be granted?  How will competence be adjudicated?  What penalties can be imposed if somebody who is supposed to be suitable is deemed not to be suitable? I would like the Minister to look at subsection (7).  To me it is gobbledegook, and I would like him to put it into plain English.</P>
      <P>A licence shall be in writing and shall be expressed to authorise a company being the licensee or a subsidiary of the licensee or, in a case where the licensee is not a company, a company which, if the licensee were a company, would be a subsidiary of the licensee, to hold the National Lottery on behalf of the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is an administrative matter.  Going by experience to date, I would suspect that detailed submissions would have to be made and all queries raised would have to be fully and satisfactorily replied to before there would be any question of giving serious consideration to any contender.  Even after a tentative decision was reached, very detailed and substantial discussions would have to take place between the officials of the Minister and the prospective licensee to ensure that the national interest was looked after properly. That is only proper.  We have the enabling provisions here.  There are many other provisions in this Bill for the protection of the public interest.  There is the power of the Minister to issue directions and to revoke the licence within the period granted.  We have been very anxious at all times to ensure that there are enabling provisions so that the public interest can be looked after the whole time.</P>
      <P>We discussed subsection (7) earlier, but because of the enabling provisions which permit the possibility of the issuing of a licence to an individual with regard to the running of the lottery by a company, provisions had to be made to cover the necessary relationship between that individual and the company running the lottery. We are talking about a subsidiary and the relationship between the subsidiary and the holding company.  If the licensee happened to be an individual he would have to hold more than 50 per cent of the shares in the company running the lottery.  That in simple terms is the clearest explanation I can give on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 4 (2), I would like to ask the Minister of State something which I know he will not tell me anyway.  Can he give us some breakdown of where he envisages the other 60 per cent of the moneys received by the company will go?  It is envisaged, that, taking one year with another, the prizes distributed shall be equal to not less than 40 per cent of the total moneys.  What provision do the Government intend to make for profit for the operating company? In particular, what provision do they propose to make for advertising the moneys received by the company?  Has he even a rough estimate on the breakdown of the other 60 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to mislead the House.  Let me say that the 40 per cent for prizes is not, in fact, 40 per cent.  It is at least 40 per cent. Therefore, particularly in the initial stages, that figure might go up to 50 per cent.  Again, it is an enabling provision. The minimum must be 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>The next part of the equation is the cost.  Again, it is not possible to be absolutely specific on this, because to a certain degree the amount of the cost will depend on the annual turnover.  There will be certain basic costs of the operating company. Those costs as a percentage of a small or medium turnover would be higher than as a percentage of a very big turnover.  I do not want to appear evasive in any way, but again it is not possible to be specific on this.  I do not think it appropriate to go into detail about the discussions between my officials and An Post, but generally we are talking about a cost recovery plus management fee basis with An Post.  Therefore, I cannot be specific as to what that will work out at. As a percentage it will relate to how successful the lottery will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third part of the equation &mdash; I hope I am using proper terminology &mdash; is the surplus we talk about in section 5.  That <Col N="1992" /> is as fairly as I can put it.  In certain circumstances it could be 40-20-40.  In other circumstances the prize moneys might be higher and the percentage of the expenses could be lower.  I cannot be very specific on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a private company were trying to persuade shareholders to become involved in a new venture like this I understand that they would have to make some sort of estimate of future profits in order to persuade their shareholders to become involved.  No self-respecting shareholder in a private company would ever envisage a risk of the scale that might be involved in this being taken without some fairly hard and fast estimate of future profits.  That is how I understand the private sector operates. Usually one of the virtues of the private sector that is paraded before us is that because of the emphasis on profitability there is less likelihood of pigs in pokes being purchased.  Am I to take it that the shareholders in An Post, who are the people of this country, are not to be given similar estimates of profitability about a risk being taken by An Post; or is it that we know and are supposed to trust the Government to accept this on our behalf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in two things.  I am interested in the level of profitability and in the scale of advertising budget that will be available.  What scale of advertising budget will they have at their disposal, given that we are talking about something of the order of £40 million or £50 million in turnover, as I understand it, or in moneys resulting from the sale of tickets in the lottery?  We are talking about what would seem to be around £30 million to be allocated to promotion, profits, equipment, etc.  Even if we can do it only in the plus or minus 10 per cent bracket, are we talking about an average budget of 5, 10, 15 or 20 per cent of total moneys taken by the company or profits in the order of 5, 10, 15 or 20 per cent of the total moneys received by the company as profits or as surplus, whichever one likes to call it?  I appreciate that we are talking about rough estimates, but in a proper commercial environment we should not <Col N="1993" /> be talking in terms of rough estimates. We should have people with reputations and expertise in this area putting their reputations and expertise on the line by producing profit estimates.  That happens in the private sector when people are asked to take risks.  They get people who take considerable corporate and sometimes legal responsibility for profit forecasting. We should have the same thing in the case of something like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Going on the views that Senator Ryan expressed, let me ask the Minister a few questions.  I fear that the profits arising out of this lottery will not be used in the best interest of the area I am most interested in, sport.  When the prize money is taken could An Post take the remainder of the money because of excessive advertising costs or for administrative or organisational costs?  Is there a certain definite percentage that An Post can take from the proceeds?  It has been the experience with semi-State bodies that costs can run very high and we have seen that in the recent past.  I would be reassured if I could have guarantees that there will be considerable funds available when all the expenses of running the lottery, including advertising, organisation and prize money, are taken from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We should try to estimate the likely income from the lottery. Figures between £75 millon and £100 million have been trotted out.  However, on the basis of a total income of £100 million and assuming a 40 per cent payout in prizes, could the Minister give a rough percentage of the likely organisational and advertising costs for An Post or the subsidiary company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be more realistic if I talked about the anticipated income in the first full year of the lottery's operation, which is estimated at about £40 million.  About half of that would be earmarked for prizes and of the balance of £20 million about £10 million would be for costs and expenses and about £10 <Col N="1994" /> million for the purposes as defined in section 5.  The figures indicate that the costs should be about 25 per cent but we are operating on a lesser figure, around 20 per cent.  As the national lottery develops and the turnover increases the percentage of the total would be less.  They are the figures for the first year and thereafter it is anticipated that more and more funding by way of surplus will be available for the purposes specified in section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear, therefore, that the fears expressed here and in the other House in relation to the sharp effect this is likely to have on other voluntary and charitable organisations have not been exaggerated because, while the Minister is talking about the initial stage and making sure it is a success, it seems that a 25 per cent of total take for organisation and advertising is out of this world compared to what competing agencies could consider.  If that initial expenditure is necessary, the income arising from it is being totally underestimated and the overall effect will be to pay out a huge amount of money in organisation and advertising which would be very considerable if we had it for more deserving needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am horrified that the Minister intends to organise a lottery with a turnover of £40 million in the first year. I could not support such a lottery.  How many economically active people are there and how much would each of them have to contribute to get a total of £40 million?  Is the Minister joking?  How many people are in receipt of incomes here?  One million?  That is £40 for every person.  The Minister can whisper all he likes but I can do my division as well as the next man.  There are 3.5 million people and the Minister is talking about £11 or £12 a head.  In other words, there are five in our house and the Minister is expecting us to pay £60 a year.  I have news for him: he will not get 60p out of my house.  If the Minister will not get 60p out of my house he will have to get a lot more than £60 from other houses.  A <Col N="1995" /> lottery to the extent of £40 million could not be supported.  The Minister is off his head.  He has seven or eight children, does he know what is expected of him &mdash; £120 a year?  I know the Minister is an extremely sensible man who will not spend £120 a year.  Has anybody stopped and considered the implications for the poorer people because they will spend the money.  Is the Minister joking?  Perhaps he is talking about £4 million and slipped a nought in somewhere?  The idea of having £40 million is totally unacceptable. I am not talking about the effect on other organisations.  They can look after themselves.  They will raise money some other way; they always have and they always will.  That does not concern me.  I assure the Minister that if he is thinking of running a lottery which in its first year will have a total of £40 million he is imposing a tax which I could not support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this section with trepidation.  There is no doubt that it is another element of bureaucracy in which there is a major tax element.  I will not go into the figures because they will not stand up.  A sum of £40 million could not be generated in one year from a national lottery.  I should like to know if the Minister has the figures from the tote for any one year over the last five years. The tote is well organised with regular gamblers.  I would like to know what the turnover has been from that and what benefit has been derived from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's figures are extremely vague when it comes down to the cost of running this lottery.  The only thing that is definite is that the take for sport and culture will not be a major element.  The costs will be 60 per cent of the take. Whether that 60 per cent is taken up by salaries, wages, transport or advertising makes no difference.  It just means that some advertising agency is going to have an absolute bonanza and there is no reason to believe that it will be otherwise. If this Bill goes through there will have to be a major effort made by some advertising <Col N="1996" /> agency on behalf of An Post to sell this lottery against every other lottery in the country whether they are for charity, sport or whatever.  The main beneficiary in the first year will be the advertising agency.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister give us an indication as to what percentage of the 60 per cent will be taken up in salaries?  How much of the take will be given out in commission?  In regard to the point made by Senator O'Leary, I sincerely hope that the Minister will get up and say that the noughts were placed in the wrong place. It might be a little like the official liquidator in London recently when an individual was up for a £600 million bankruptcy and the official liquidator suggested that there was little difference between that bankruptcy and any other bankruptcy; the only difference is that there is a larger number of noughts at the end of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill purports to be a Bill to help sport.  It was originally meant to help sport only.  It has been extended now into the area of the arts and culture.  But it would seem as if there will not be much money available as a result of this lottery for either sport or culture and I think that the Government, without the addition of what is in effect a tax on the poor &mdash; and it will be the poorer sections that will feel that there is money to be made out of this lottery and who will mainly contribute to it &mdash; should have looked at the possibility of providing more money for sport, recreation, amenities and cultural activities. I do not mind having a gamble.  But this is not a gamble; it is another element of taxation and the benefits to the community will not be enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I would like to ask the Minister to expand on the take of An Post from the lottery.  This is a very important point and as we are at that stage of the Bill it should be clearly defined here.  I can visualise a situation arising where the Minister for Finance could say, when asked what profit the lottery made in any one year, that it made very little profit because An Post, because of very high costs, had to take <Col N="1997" /> 40 or 45 per cent of it.  I would like to have some guarantee that there would be some restriction placed on An Post to ensure that their advertising and running costs would not be too high.</P>
      <P>Going back to the fears that have been expressed by voluntary and charitable organisations as to whether they will be able to compete with a very high-powered, vigorous advertising campaign which is funded from the proceeds of the lottery, I doubt if they will.</P>
      <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister to clearly state what he envisages.  The Minister has mentioned a figure of 20 per cent.  There is no guarantee that the figure will remain at 20 per cent.  It is very important that we know for sure before this Bill leaves this House that the main beneficiaries will be in the areas as set out in the Bill, and not An Post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad we have come to this issue of the income of the lottery because it is at the crux of the questions that we should be addressing that are central to this.  I want to give the House a figure quoted from the <i>Toronto Star</i> of Sunday, 7 October 1984 which stated that in 1983 Canadians spent 1.4 billion Canadian dollars on lotteries.  I am not sure what the population of Canada is but I think it is probably around 50 million.  It may be far less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take 25 million and leave it at that.  That is about seven times our population, and those are very crude figures.  That means a country of our size would spend the equivalent of 240 million Canadian dollars on national lotteries.  Senator O'Leary mentioned a figure of about £40 million.  The £40 million is not an exaggerated figure. Spending seems to be compulsive when a national lottery gets going and this was recognised by the Canadian Government. In <i>The Toronto Star</i> the Canadian Sports Minister stated that the Federal Government was getting out of the lottery business for good because the lotteries <Col N="1998" /> were a tax on the poor, perhaps even an immoral way of collecting taxes.  He also said in an interview that there was no question that lotteries were an indirect taxation and that statistics proved that the lower income people spent a higher percentage of their income on tickets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are walking into that.  Senator O'Leary mentioned £40 million and that is bad enough.  The Canadian figures suggest that £40 million is not, in fact, an excessively high estimate.  At a later stage I will quote other aspects of this article from authorities in Canada as to why people spend so much, and there are a number of reasons for it.  It is true that what we are actually legislating for here is a form of taxation on the poor based on the sort of suffering the poor have and the need they have for some illusion of a possible escape from their own poverty.  That is why poor people tend to spend large sums of money on a lottery; it is the only way out.  The figures that have been quoted here, figures I am sure the Minister would insist are conservative first time off figures, are still excessive and, given that many of us will not be spending much, somebody is going to spend an awful lot of money on it.  There is the questionable extent of advertising.  The figure there would suggest that we will be talking about £2 million, £3 million or £4 million a year in advertising which is a massive advertising budget which will transform the content of advertising in this country because a whole new area of advertising will blossom.  As Senator Lanigan quite rightly suggested some advertising agency will make a fortune.  Radio Telefís Éireann will make a fortune, if they are allowed, and undoubtedly the newspapers will make a fortune.  But they will make a fortune, on the international evidence, not from an evenly distributed few bob fluttered by everyone in the country but by a massive syphoning off of funds from people who by and large, according to international evidence, cannot afford it.  The £40 million is bad enough.  It is quite conservative and I believe it will end up nearer the figure of £100 million mentioned by Senator Smith.  It raises again the fundamental <Col N="1999" /> question of the State being involved in issues like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide variety of points were raised here.  I will attempt to tackle them in the course of my reply. Essentially I gather that some Senators have the view that the total sales of this lottery could not possibly run into the kind of figures we are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, the theme from Senator Ryan and now supported by this comment from Senator O'Leary is that the figure should not be anyway high.  We can only deal with the facts as we see them, based on the best assessment looking at the situation internationally. Having got the best advice, the figures I am talking about are the consequence of that process.  Before I go into that, let me knock one thing on the head.  Anybody who is talking about a tax when we are discussing a lottery is, I believe, talking about a totally different ball game.  The establishment of a lottery has nothing to do with a tax.  There is no compulsion on anybody to buy a lottery ticket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about it.  If we are talking about tax we are talking about a system where there is a requirement to pay.  Here there is no such requirement.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amounts projected, let me first reply to Senator Lanigan's point, to put the thing into perspective.  I have not the figure for the current year, obviously, but I have the figure in relation to on and off course betting for 1983.  That figure is £215 million and that will give the House a sense of perspective.  As I mentioned earlier, lotteries are run in about 80 different countries.  I am not saying that every country was looked at but quite a considerable assessment was done internationally, in a wide range of states in the United States and in a wide range of countries.</P>
      <P>There was an examination of countries with different levels of population, different disposable income and so on.  Based on that, the advices we received suggest that in the first full year of operation &mdash; I emphasise the full year &mdash; the turnover would be of the order of £40 million. Obviously, I cannot go beyond that.  This is the best assessment that is available from the experts who have examined the situation internationally and got comparative figures.  From that £40 million, depending on the level of prize money, we expect that there will be a surplus of about £10 million.  Let me look at the different aspects of that £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me knock on the head, also, the quite unfair reference by Senator Lanigan, to costs of 60 per cent.  There is a prize aspect which would be at least 40 per cent; it could be more.  If you regard that as a cost, that is stretching it somewhat. Surely somebody who has a flutter in the lottery must have a reasonable chance of participation in the proceeds. I know that Senator Lanigan would perhaps not be averse to an occasional flutter himself, but if we are talking about prize <Col N="2001" /> money in relation to the total proceeds, we are talking about a virtually even money in regard to the pool of prize money, or almost even money &mdash; six to four.  Obviously, the chance of the individual is very much smaller, but we believe there has to be a reasonable pool of prize money.  This is as opposed to the charitable lotteries where the motivation, very largely, is support for the cause running the charity.  Here we are talking about people having a flutter and, therefore, there must be a reasonable pool of prize money.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost factor, obviously there will be, in starting up, non-recurring costs and most Senators will accept that.  Let me say that there was a number &mdash; around seven &mdash; of serious contenders who submitted detailed proposals and as a rough guideline virtually all the proposals were suggesting an expense and cost factor of the order of about 20 per cent.  This is once the lottery is running.  That is what we anticipate, but there initially would be non-recurring costs and obviously they have to be covered as well.  Roughly, that is the order we are talking about.</P>
    <P>There is no question of runaway costs under any heading.  Detailed discussions have taken place between my officials and those of An Post and these have focussed on all the possible areas of cost, with various estimations and fairly tough negotiations.  The House need not be concerned, if it is considered that a semi-State body should run this lottery, that there is any question of costs being allowed to run ahead of themselves.</P>
    <P>On the question of advertising, we will be coming to that as a separate issue on Senator Ryan's amendment.  I do not see how a new venture of this kind can become properly established unless there is proper promotion and advertising of the lottery.  There will not be the surplus generated for the very worthy causes that we want to devote them to unless there is a sufficient turnover in the lottery.  Perhaps I could be reminded of any specific point that is still outstanding that I have <Col N="2002" /> not covered.  I have tried to cover the various points that have been raised.</P>
    <P>Essentially, what I want to get across to the House is that this was not just a case of the Government sitting down and deciding to run a lottery, producing a Bill and rushing into the House with it.  This has been going on over a number of years. This is referred to in the national plan, consultants were engaged and details of reports produced.  The whole issue was examined very carefully and to some extent, on the other hand, we could possibly be accused of taking it too cautiously and too slowly.  I note from my file that the official announcement of the Government decision goes back to October last. I want to emphasise that we have not rushed into this and that we have considered all the aspects.  Both from the point of view of the enabling legislation and the administrative arrangement, every effort has been made to ensure that the public interest is protected as far as possible in every conceivable situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point which some of my colleagues raised and which I would also like to raise on this section.  The question was asked not only about how much the costs would be, but also what percentage profit would be allowed to whoever was the licensed holder for running the lottery.  In one of his replies the Minister made a passing reference to a management fee which would be payable to An Post.  A management fee is a nice way of calling it, just as calling it a flutter makes it sound much more harmless.  It should be fairly carefully arranged and this House should be informed what kind of level of management fee or profit will be allowed to the person who runs this.  After all, here we are talking about An Post but the Minister emphasised earlier that the legislation is to cover periods long into the future when we might be reconsidering this or, indeed, having it run by one individual who may own 51 per cent of the shares in the company running it. It is important to know what will be the gain to the person who is running this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that this has been <Col N="2003" /> very carefully considered and so on, but, after all, it is the job of this House to tease out legislation and to criticise it however carefully the Government may have gone into it beforehand.  That is all very well, but we are here to represent our constituents and the people of the country when discussing legislation. While it might not necessarily be correct to describe this as a tax at the same time this kind of lottery tends to be entered into much more by people in lower income groups than those in higher and more educated income groups.  It is typical that Senator O'Leary is saying he, or his family will not spend money on this. I am quite sure I will not spend money on this, nor will my family, and, probably, Senator Ryan will not either.  One has to take the example of something like bingo which can be a very great social evil. Many women of the lower income groups become totally addicted to bingo.  They spend money which should be spent on food for their children on bingo.</P>
    <P>This kind of national lottery can become a sort of addictive gambling for lower income groups.  This is something that should have been said on Second Stage but, unfortunately, I was not able to get in to speak on Second Stage.  I disapprove of the whole idea of us financing objects, however worthy, through national lotteries.  I come from a background which disapproves of gambling as a social evil anyway, a background which involved the Adelaide Hospital refusing to benefit from the sweepstake because it was gambling.  However good one's object may be one is getting into a situation where one is going to cause quite a lot of human suffering.  I have seen this over and over again.  In various cases I have dealt with I have seen, how much damage gambling can do to the family, perhaps even more damage than drinking.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this needs to be very carefully controlled if we must do this sort of thing.  I do not think it is in the national interest at all.  Perhaps we should consider putting some kind of limit on the number of tickets a person can buy in <Col N="2004" /> any one lottery, or something to prevent poorer families spending too much money on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points and also put some queries to the Minister.  We should not get bogged down in suggesting that all the evils will fall upon the poorer sections of the community. Gamblers Anonymous say that the problems associated with excessive gambling go right across all income groups and social strata.  We should not take it that only the lower income groups can be affected by this extension in the national gambling scene.  People far above the lower scale of income have got themselves involved in gambling to the detriment of their families, and that will continue.  This lottery will be another opportunity for people who are affected by the need to gamble excessively.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say if the seven or eight companies who made submissions to him costed those submissions?  If they did not cost them, it would have been impossible for the Minister to come down on the side of An Post as against others in the field.  When talking about the element of cost and profit, we must have had a costing done by An Post.  Will the Minister say what element of advertising will be involved before this lottery takes place in the first year?  There must have been a submission from An Post as to how much they intend spending on advertising. How many people do they intend employing and how much will they pay them?  How much do they expect to spend on distribution, printing and so on? Having made the comment about the spread of gambling.  I should like to ask the Minister how much will be spent by An Post to launch this lottery?  How many people will be employed by them in the launch?  How many people will be employed prior to the launch of the lottery? What is the estimate for the cost of printing and the distribution of tickets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was putting the question of the revenue from this in perspective when he mentioned the total amount spent on off-course and on-course <Col N="2005" /> gambling.  He mentioned the figure of £212 million, which means that what we are proposing to do is to increase gambling by 20 per cent in one fell swoop, according to the conservative estimates and I presume they are conservative. I again invite the Minister to address the question as to whether that is a good thing, whether the fact that well-recognised good causes will get a certain amount of money justifies a decision by the State to extend national expenditure on gambling by 20 per cent. I do not think even the Minister will suggest it will come from a redistribution of expenditure from one form of gambling to another.  I suspect there is no provision in the estimates of revenue from betting tax this year which would reflect any presumption of such a transfer, nor will there be in 1987, I am equally confident.</P>
      <P>We are effectively talking about an increase.  Let us not fool ourselves about this £212 million.  It works out crudely at £50 per person, £100 per adult.  If one assumes that only about half the adult population are earning, it works out at about £200 per earner.  That is a frightening sum of money.  If one assumes that a larger percentage of earners do not gamble at all one is probably talking about the average gambler involved in gambling at present spending in the order of £300 to £400 a year on gambling.  That is not small money; it is £8 per week.  We are talking about increasing that expenditure further.  In the light of the evidence available, we are talking about increased expenditure by those in our society who can least afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As most politicians will say gambling and drink are the cause of greater marital disharmony than any other more fashionable subject.  There are many other topics which are much more fashionable to talk about but drinking and gambling do more damage to family life than all the other things which all the moralists here would have us believe are destroying us.  It is a matter of great regret to me that the moral guardians of this country have seen fit to remain silent on what is to me a far more serious moral issue than many of <Col N="2006" /> the issues they wax eloquent on.  I have said that on a few occasions.  Is the Minister happy that there is no question of morality involved in increasing gambling here by a figure of at least 20 per cent, which I am sure in future years will be much higher?  There is a moral question to be addressed and I invite the Minister to address it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are perhaps reopening some questions that we addressed before but I am quite prepared to go into them again.  I would say, particularly to Senator McGuinness, that there is no question on my part of any feeling of resentment about discussing the issues involved here.  In fact, I welcome the interest shown by Senators. It is an indication that a House of the Oireachtas is keenly interested in public welfare.  Even though I would not agree with some of the views presented I am quite glad to see them presented.</P>
      <P>Going back to the morality of the situation, the contention that lotteries are a tax on the poor is based on the assumption that the poor or less well-off are the predominant participants in lotteries. Evidence available to us, in particular from the United States, while not conclusive, indicates the contrary, that the participation rate of the less well-off in lotteries is lower than their arithmetic share of the population generally.  In so far as that evidence has any weight at all it tends to rebut the suggestion that the poor or less well-off are the predominant participants.  Senator Lanigan made this point in relation to gambling generally. It is sufficient for me to say that it is not proper to jump to the conclusion and state categorically that lotteries are a tax on the poor.  The evidence is sufficient to suggest that there should not be a categoric statement along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of cost, we talked earlier about a framework which will involve cost recovery and a management fee.  The cost framework has been the subject of very serious discussion and indeed heavy negotiation between my officials and An Post over a considerable time.  Each of the items has been very <Col N="2007" /> carefully looked at and negotiated.  The profit factor &mdash; we might call it that in so far as An Post is concerned &mdash; is related to the management fee.  While I do not want to anticipate what, I hope, I will be arranging after the passage of the Bill and the completion of discussions and arrangements of licences and so on, I would anticipate that the management fee will be slightly over 1.1 per cent.  This is roughly what I think may be the area about which we are talking.  That is so that the House will have a general idea of the scale of the operation.</P>
    <P>In regard to salaries, again this will be dependent on the two types of lottery games being operated.  I cannot be exact, but we are talking about direct employment of the order of 50 to 60.  Some final details will need to be tied up there.  We are not talking about an extravagant gargantuan organistion gobbling up whatever moneys that are subscribed to the lottery.  We are talking about a trim, cost-effective, commercially-orientated organisation which will run this lottery in the best and most cost effective manner possible so that we can have a good distribution of prizes and a surplus available for distribution.</P>
    <P>The figures in relation to printing, marketing and so on have been the subject of discussion.  The House will appreciate that it is difficult for me to say exactly what the cost of printing will be.  If the lottery is very successful obviously there will be more printing costs in producing more tickets.  From the point of view of cost, the documentation, tickets and so on that will be produced will be a major factor.  They will have to be of a fairly sophisticated kind to make sure that everything is above board.  Any figure I would give in that regard could be misleading. The objective of my officials in the discussions is to ensure that we will have a printing system which will be as foolproof as possible in the public interest. Taking that and taking all the necessary sophisticated modern methods into account, from the point of view of achieving that aim, it will be as cost effective as <Col N="2008" /> possible.  You can be absolutely sure so far as I am concerned that that is the approach being adopted.</P>
    <P>There is concern about advertising: an amendment has been tabled in that regard.  Again, I have to reiterate that I do not see this lottery being successful unless there is advertising, promotion and marketing.  There will be no surplus unless this lottery is sold.  Anybody who thinks otherwise is not thinking of the hard business world we live in.  I hope I have covered the various points that have been raised.</P>

      <P>If we could get answers there might not be need for repetition of questions.  I asked the Minister, how much money An Post included for advertising in their pre-lottery submissions. This might give us some idea as to the cost of advertising?  The other question I asked was what amount of money it is envisaged will be involved in setting up the lottery to the extent of having the first set of gamblers or whatever.  That must have been addressed.  On the question of the sophistication of the tickets, I presume they will be printed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very vague on everything so far from the money point of view; we are getting percentages and projected figures. How much money is the Exchequer putting into the setting up of the lottery?  I should like to have a breakdown of what An Post said they would spend on advertising and on marketing this lottery.</P>

      <P>The start up costs are anticipated to be of the order of £2 million.  This will involve the provision of equipment, all kinds of machinery, the establishment of ticket stocks, arrangements for distribution and preliminary promotion.  We are getting into all sorts of detail now.  I would not see much point in heavy expenditure on funding advertising and promotion until the lottery is about to start.  That does not appear to make commercial sense.  On the other hand perhaps the advisers in this area might think differently.  Certainly it does not make sense to me to spend money on promotion until one is starting up. I suppose there might be some modest amount spent shortly before the launching of the lottery.  I do not have a separate figure as to exactly what is proposed. I do not even know whether a final decision on that has been made. Certainly it would not be a sufficient sum to warrant its being separately costed at this stage.  They are the kinds of details that will be ironed out between my officials and An Post in the period between now and the commencement of the lottery.</P>

      <P>The Minister's figures do not seem to add up at all.  He is suggesting now that £2 million will be enough to put in a stock of tickets and to advertise and market.  He suggests then that, before the lottery is set up, there will be no need to market.  Surely the biggest need for marketing and advertising this lottery will be before the first lottery takes place? There will be ongoing advertising and marketing costs thereafter.  But surely the ongoing marketing and advertising will not cost anything like the initial expenditure in that regard?  To suggest that before initiating a new project one would spend only a minimal amount on advertising and marketing and thereafter a much bigger proportion is to suggest or ensure that, in this case, the lottery could not take off.  The Minister says that costs of approximately £2 million will be involved in its establishment, which will include printing and building up of stocks <Col N="2010" /> of tickets and so forth.  Then he suggests that the annual operation of the lottery will cost about £10 million.  I do not think those figures add up.  If the Minister is thinking of spending a minimal amount only on marketing and advertising beforehand, then I suggest that we might as well pack it up now because it will never take off.</P>

      <P>If I revert to the Minister's figures for the United States, first let me say that in Ronald Reagan's America there is a large section of the poor who have no income, thanks to President Reagan's deliberate policy of crucifying them.  Of the poor in the United States there are three million who are living on the streets, homeless with no income whatever.  They do not count.  To use statistics about the participation rate of the lower income groups in a lottery is to deceive oneself.  It is the proportion of the income of lower income groups consumed in expenditure on lotteries which is the critical factor.  There are hugh numbers &mdash; perhaps the majority of people who are poor &mdash; who make enormous sacrifices in terms of every pleasure that is available in life to look after their children. Therefore, there is a huge number of poor people who cannot afford to have a pint, go to a film or engage in any activity because their position is so bad. They have no discretionary income and they do not use any of their income on any of these discretionary activities.  But the truth is that there is a large section of people, in Canada at least, among the relatively poor who spend a disproportionately large part of their income on this sort of gambling.  That is the issue which has to be addressed, not whether there is some sort of global participation rate but the unacceptable fact that a large proportion of poor people in other countries appear to spend an unacceptably high proportion of their very small incomes on this sort of gambling.  There are perfectly good reasons for it &mdash; the illusion of the prospect of immediate riches, although the odds are about a million to one against, is created by very sophisticated advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> On the question of advertising, the Ontario lottery in Canada spends 3 per cent of its income every year on advertising. In the case of An Post that works out here at about £1.2 million a year minimum.  That is a large sum of money to inject into advertising.  It will be a particularly choice plum for the advertising agencies.  I must take issue with the Minister on his quoting figures from the United States, of all countries, about the participation rate of the poor, given that large sections of the poor go unrecognised by the Federal Government. One should pick a country with a decent welfare system like Canada.  I quoted already what the Canadian Government thought about lotteries, that they were effectively a tax on the poor.  I believe a reasonably benevolent welfare State like Canada far more quickly than I believe Ronald Reagan's United States.</P>

      <P>If I might take the second point first, I respect Senator Brendan Ryan's outlook on this.  I can only go on the available statistics, the research which we have undertaken and the objective conclusions which we have drawn therefrom.  I understand Senator Brendan Ryan's concern for the poor.  It is a concern which I share.  Having talked about our investigation of the report from the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries, I can only say that I honestly do not see the lottery as a tax on the poor.  The available evidence is that, because of the kind of lottery gains proposed, the possibilities of addiction seem to be quite remote.  The evidence from other countries suggests that there are unlikely to be adverse sociological consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back to Senator Lanigan's point, we are getting into a degree of administrative detail here.  If we do that we have to be fairly clear as to what we are talking about.  We can discuss figures, projecting ourselves into the future of the lottery in full operation and what the costs will be at that stage.  But, of course, that will depend on how successful it will be.  We are not at that stage yet.  We are <Col N="2012" /> talking about starting <i>ab initio.</i>  Obviously there will be a somewhat higher level of costs initially because of the start up.  I mentioned the general start up costs as being projected at around £2 million to cover a variety of expenses.  Thereafter, there will be the recurring costs.  There will be the normal costs of running any commercial operation; any of us could list those.  There will be provision for staff, accommodation, telephones, etc.  It will be a commercial operation and it will be on a basis of cost recovery, plus a management fee.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, who is no stranger to the business world, will accept that the higher the level of turnover the higher the costs will be, but they will be lower as a percentage of total turnover.  Of necessity, we are talking of projections, but the House can be assured that my approach will be consistent with ensuring that we will have a viable, commercial operation by An Post, as cost effective as possible, with a reasonable level of prize money.  I want to see as large an amount as possible available for the purposes specified in section 5.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" /> In page 5, subsection (1), lines 8 to 13, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) the purposes of sport and other recreation, and in such amounts as the Government may determine from time to time: provided that sport shall receive not less than 50 per cent of the amount of moneys so applied under this section in any given year, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason for the amendments is because I fear that sport will not be a major beneficiary of the proposed lottery, though the concept of the lottery was to support sport.  As a former sportsman and a physical education teacher the one great hope I had when I came to this House was that a national lottery would put sport on some kind of financial footing. It sorely lacks that.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, even with the national lottery, sport will still be the poor relation from the point of view of funding.  The definition in section 5 is far too broad. The definition of recreation alone is very broad.  I am glad to see so many sport minded Senators here tonight and they will know what sport is.  However, it is very hard to define what recreation is.  It can include library facilities, parks, and the promotion of chess.  When we try to define national culture, including the Irish language, we get into a vast area. When we come to the arts &mdash; I am not familiar with the Arts Act of 1951 &mdash; we will find it is just as wide.  The health of the community is referred to.  This is boundless and indefinable.  He would be a very wise man who could define clearly what is &ldquo;the health of the community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) provides that the Government may at any time and in such amounts as they consider appropriate, decide on the allocation of funds towards whatever cause it may be.  In times of recession like we are undergoing, there is a danger that a Government might isolate one cause, perhaps a hospital, and allocate the total amount of the funds available to that cause.  The Government, by extension, could allocate funds to <Col N="2014" /> many causes that would have no connection with paragraph (a) and sport and recreation.  We have been presented with a great opportunity to acquire the necessary funds to put Irish sport on such a footing that we could compare favourably with other nations.</P>
    <P>When we look at Government funding for sport throughout Europe and in the UK, America and Australia, we should not even pretend to feel proud.  This lack of Government commitment to sport here has continued over many years and it has been demonstrated in various ways.</P>
    <P>With the creation of the post of Minister for Sport &mdash; we have had good Ministers in charge of sport such as Deputies Tunney and Seán Barrett &mdash; sport gained some form of respectability here.  However, sport will never properly be promoted here and will never be developed as it is elsewhere, from the point of view of facilities and expertise, unless money is made available to back it.  Here is an opportunity to ensure that sport will be adequately funded.</P>
    <P>I have no opposition to support for our national culture or the arts, but we must find other ways of supporting them outside this Bill.  I am suggesting that the definition should be narrow to include just sport and recreation.  The effect of my amendments would be that 90 per cent of the money available would go to support sport and recreation, with sport getting 50 per cent of the fund available and the remaining 10 per cent going to other purposes.  These would include national culture and the arts.  In proposing the amendments I accepted the distinction between sport and recreation. I inserted the stipulation, however, that at least 50 per cent of the moneys should go to sport.  Therefore, the allocation of moneys should be nudged in the direction of sport or sporting activities in view of the fact that recreation, by definition, is very wide.  As I have already explained, it could include library facilities, provision of parks, promoting chess or other activities which we recognise as being recreational by definition.  My main concern is that sport and recreation together should be allocated 90 per cent of the <Col N="2015" /> moneys collected under this section. Under the amendment, the remaining 10 per cent can be allocated for such purposes as the Government see fit.  I am sure the Minister of State understands what I mean.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators on both sides of the House will support the overall thrust of my argument, that is, for the first time in the history of this State we have an opportunity to provide a continuing source of funding for sport.  On the question of the morality of such a lottery, there are other areas of gambling which are just as immoral.  It is unfortunate that Senator Brendan Ryan is not here.  If he is so opposed to this Bill on moral grounds, he must be a hypocrite.  Why has he not been opposing horse racing, casinos or one-armed bandits which are taking the pennies out of the pockets of every youngster in this country?  I never heard him mention once in this House that he was opposed to such activities.</P>

I do not think this Bill is morally wrong, or that collecting money through a national lottery is in any way immoral.  The Minister of State may not accept the amendments, but I would appreciate it if he could give a definite commitment to ensure that sport will be adequately funded from the proceeds of the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments in the name of Senator Deenihan. <Col N="2016" /> When the national lottery was first mooted it was definitely stated that the proceeds would be used for sporting purposes. The money available from this lottery will be spent in other areas that can be funded at present in various ways. The concept of spreading this fund into the area of health worries me especially at a time when so little is being spent by the Government on health.  There are enormous Government cut-backs on health expenditure.  Sport can prevent illness.  The more we spend on sport the better chance there is that fewer people will end up in need of hospitalisation or medical care.  It has been proved that, as spending on sport rises, the need for very expensive medical services decreases.  As Senator Deenihan has said, the definition of recreation is very broad.  Recreation encompasses everything people do which is to their benefit and which is outside the ambit of their job.  There is virtually nothing that could not be included in the sphere of recreation.  It is very hard to say we should spend a larger amount on sport than on culture, particularly Irish culture.  There is no doubt that not enough money is being spent by the Government on the promotion of Irish culture.  But, since the initial thrust of the Bill was meant to be towards spending on sport, it should stay that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State would benefit in having the bulk of the moneys spent on sport as it might take advertising out of sport.  I have said time and again that we are hypocritical, &mdash; not in the sense of calling anyone a hypocrite, but in the sense that we as an Oireachtas are hypocritical &mdash; in that we stopped cigarette and tobacco advertising on Radio Telefís Éireann but we allowed a golf tournament to take place over four days and every single hour of each of those days we saw a cigarette company's name sprawled all over the television screen.  RTE give an inordinate amount of time to motor sport.  I am in the motor industry to a small degree.  RTE give an amount of time to grand prix racing which to most people is a boring and loud event but which advertises the John Players Special and the Marlboro cars lap after lap, hour <Col N="2017" /> after hour.  We have got to ensure that whether the sport be golf or motor racing cigarette companies, who are banned from the screen, are not the major funders of the sport.  Golf organisers should be able to produce a four day event of international status here with moneys contributed by their own members, by the State and, if need be, by advertisers who are not selling death, as is the case at present.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is disgraceful to see the advertising by cancer spreaders being used supposedly to help sport.</P>
    <P>If one feels that sport receives enough money from the State one has only to look at Cork city sports which are being held tonight.  Up to about eight weeks ago there were grave doubts as to whether or not Cork city sports could be held.  I would like to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, for giving a very good subvention to Cork city sports to enable then hold their events tonight. Because of problems with funding, this year Clonliffe will not be holding their major international event for the first time in years.  It is no tribute to this country that an event set up by the late Billy Morton should fall by the wayside. A lot of people think that major sporting bodies such as the GAA and the Irish Rugby Football Union have funds galore and that there is no need for them to look for funding to provide the facilities in which they are involved.  There is absolutely no doubt that these are the best at organising the collection of money and in organising the games in which they are involved, yet they are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up the standards that are necessary in the games and activities in which they take part.  The moneys that central Government put into sport have been totally inadequate.  We are not the laughing stock of the world when it comes to spending on sport but we are very close to it.  Countries which are much less well off spend much more money on sport.  That money is repaid a thousand fold in terms of the benefits of a healthier attitude towards life and in keeping down the cost of medication and the major financial costs of capital projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> The case for the amendment has been well made by Senator Deenihan.  The Minister should go along with the amendment. The initial reason for setting up this national lottery was to provide money which would be put into sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Deenihan in moving his amendment and he made a very strong case for support for sport and recreational facilities.  I do not disagree with him that it is important as a country with a young population that we promote both, but he failed to make the case he had to make in moving this amendment &mdash; the case for preferring sport and recreational facilities over the other objectives which are set out in section 5.  These are the other important objectives in terms of the areas that are to benefit from moneys to be raised under this national lottery, namely, promotion of the national culture including the Irish language, promotion of the arts and promotion of the health of the community.  If we are having a national lottery, and that is a policy decision, it is important that we decide on broad-based recipients for it, that we ensure that the results of it are available in a well thought out but, I emphasise, broad-based way.  I do not see how Senator Deenihan is trying to make a case and a special pleading for sport in this regard.  I listened very carefully and he did not seem to make that case.  I could, I hope with equal eloquence, make a similar case for the importance of any of the other three areas selected, equally validly and I think equally convincingly. On that criterion alone I would favour the way in which section 5(1)(a) is set out since it allows for a broad-based range of purposes to which the funds can be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where I have more sympathy for Senator Deenihan's approach is in his attempt to ensure some limit on the scope of the Government discretion under section 5(1)(b).  I do not share his view that this should be done with a view to preferring sport but in his second amendment, which is being discussed with his first amendment, he says that the moneys <Col N="2019" /> allocated under section 5(1)(b), should the Government decide to identify a purpose under that subsection, should not exceed in the aggregate 10 per cent of the amount of money.  This leads me to raise a number of questions which, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, you may feel are more properly raised on the section but they arise from Senator Deenihan's second amendment.  It seems to me strange to have a section so drafted that although there are defined purposes and they are set out there &mdash; sport and other recreation, national culture including the Irish language, the arts, within the meaning of the Arts Act, and the health of the community &mdash; these could all in effect be displaced by a decision of the Government for undefined, unnamed, unspecified purposes under section 5(1)(b).</P>
    <P>I know this is a matter the Minister has been questioned on but I question him again.  Why is there such an open-ended provision in subsection (b) of 5(1)?  Why is there no restriction as to amount?  What are the potential purposes the Government could possibly have in mind and am I correct in interpreting the section as it stands as meaning that the Government could in fact disregard entirely section 5(1)(a)?  Could they disregard sport and recreational pursuits, the national culture, including the Irish language, the arts, the health of the community and decide instead to give it all to some other purpose that suddenly arose and was to be furthered under the proceeds of the national lottery?  There is no limit on the amount, there is no limit on the scope, there is no pre-condition at all other than the very minimal pre-condition in subsection (2) where there has to be notice of the purpose published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> How many of us read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> every week, how many of us would know even if it was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil?</i>  It seems to me that subsection (1)(a) and (1)(b) are framed in a very unusual way for the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the thrust of Senator Deenihan's second amendment that there be a limit on the unspecified <Col N="2020" /> unnamed purpose, though I would not be of the view that it should all be allocated in a way that very substantially preferred sport and recreational facilities over the other named purposes.  I think that those purposes should be preferred over the unnamed potential purpose, that it should be limited to not more than 10 per cent of the total to keep that under check.  I would keep the spread of purposes without any limit on what could be allocated, in other words a certain amount of discretion in any given year to how the funds of the national lottery would be allocated.  I would like further information and clarification from the Minister on this and for the reasons I have given I cannot support the main thrust of Senator Deenihan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the plea for the division of the money to help sport but I am not sure whether section 5 is sufficient in itself and I am sure the Minister will clarify that.  We are all talking about sport.  When the lottery was first mentioned it was in connection with getting support for sport.  I think the other things are being put in as an offshoot.  I agree with what is being said about the value of sport even though I have not got as many All Ireland medals as my colleague.  I have not got any and I think I am over the age of getting one, but I have spent a lot of my time in promoting sport, athletics and GAA.  I attended the Community Games last Sunday and saw the number of young children there and the parents as excited as if Santa Clause were coming for the first time.  It is marvellous to see people involved in sport; they are so occupied and they have some interest instead of getting into mischief.  I can see the potential for sport but I will not go over it because it has been mentioned already here.  I am not so sure that I support the idea of 10 per cent or 90 per cent because you can get into a knot if you start tying things up in percentages.  I certainly expect that the vast bulk of the money will be going to sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the idea of supporting <Col N="2021" /> our own culture and all the activities that go with it, and I suppose sport can be included in that.  I welcome the idea go mbeidh cabhair le fáil do athbheochan na Gaeilge, mar tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeimid i ndáiríre má tá airgead againn le tabhairt amach go mbeidh airgead ar fáil don Ghaeilge freisin.  Therefore, I do not want to say that sport is everything: our Irish culture and music also play a leading role in our lives and we should be seen to protect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 5 (1) (a) the Minister has endeavoured to disperse these funds over a fairly broad spectrum. In the course of my Second Stage speech I said that I did not want to pick out one particular area for special treatment.  One can make the argument for sport and it goes beyond question that sufficient money is not being spent on providing adequate facilities in the general sporting area, particularly with such a large percentage of our population being so young.  There are competing considerations and we have seen an upsurge of interest in historical, archaeological and other developments throughout the country which need to be encouraged. They are starved of finance and but for the voluntary activities and efforts of people who are personally concerned to help in this area we would have perhaps a dismal picture.  Therefore, anything that can be afforded from the lottery as laid down under subsection (1) (a) is fairly acceptable.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister in subsection (1) (b) puts a coach and four through the principle and character of what is enshrined in subsection (1) (a).  He has <i>carte-blanche</i> to spend these funds for any purpose and may, as Senator Robinson has already said, eliminate the possibility of expenditure on the Irish language, recreation, sport, arts and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years we have become used to situations developing where finance for one reason or another is sucked into the Exchequer.  If we want this lottery to be doomed to failure, to include subsection (1) (b) is the way to do it because the public will want to identify with <Col N="2022" /> developmental projects and will want to see specific results from the lottery.  If money is not provided for sport and other purposes and instead at the end of the year, because of Exchequer demands and stringencies, it is diverted to the Department of Finance to be spent anywhere, it will ensure that the lottery will be a failure. Therefore, I am totally opposed to subsection (1) (b).</P>
    <P>I am not concerned about percentages. We are talking about £10 million.  Let us say that £5 million of that goes to sport and the remaining £5 million is divided between the promotion of the Irish language, other recreational areas, the promotion of our national culture, perhaps health education linked with sport and so on.  That is a very small sum of money being dispersed into a fairly broad area. We may argue about how much is going to one area or another but there is a fair degree of acceptance on all sides of this House that the range being covered is fairly correct.  I have already indicated how bad the situation is with regard to funds for sport and how anyone can afford the Minister the opportunity to usurp the money under the clause as defined in subsection (1) (b) is beyond comprehension.  There is no need for the subsection.  There is not nearly sufficient moneys to deal with the areas concerned. The Minister may say that we do not know at present what could emerge. There could be other developments and the Government might, from time to time, want to include something which we cannot foresee at this stage.  That can be done in the budget.  There are many mechanisms available to the Government with their billion pounds of a budget to deal with these areas without interfering with the areas into which we want to see this lottery going.</P>
    <P>For that reason, on this side of the House we will be pressing for a total elimination of that subsection.  It is unnecessary and unwarranted and it is an interference by the Government with the dispersal of these funds which, in effect, will totally undermine the national lottery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the previous speakers.  In general I agree with much of what has been said and certainly my worry also would be the retention of section 5 (1) (b).  As Senator Robinson said, it seems that the Government could, if they wish ignore section 5 (1)(a) and deal only with 5 (1)(b).  It is far too much of an all-embracing section, one that could mean anything and, as Senator Smith said, it could be used for any purpose that the Government may wish.  Section 5 (1)(a) can be ignored and that is not acceptable to me and to many on this side of the House.  This point has been made many times.  My main objection to the Bill is that this all-embracing section is imposed on us.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with section 5 (1)(a).  There are one or two aspects of it which I will comment on.  I have to agree with Senator Deenihan and, I think, Senator Browne, who said that when we initially talked about the idea of a national lottery we spoke in terms of it being used for sport and recreation.  At that time that seemed to be the only purpose for which the proceeds of the lottery would be used.  I can recall specifically it being suggested that the proceeds of the national lottery would be for a national sports centre, whether it be sited in Limerick, Athlone, Dublin or wherever or whether sections be sited in a number of different venues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember what is envisaged when we talk about a national sports centre.  We are talking about, perhaps an international sports gymnasium, about an international athletics track, about an international swimming pool.  We know that the Irish Olympic swimmers cannot do their qualifying trials in this country because there is no pool large enough for them to do those trials and therefore, they must go abroad to do them.  Overall, whether this national sports centre is sited in one particular area or in a number of venues, it is going to cost a lot of money and the running costs will be huge.  The Crystal Palace pool is losing £1.5 million a year, so we will have losses on a national sports centre whether we like it or not. <Col N="2024" /> The idea should be that the losses would be picked up from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>As Senator Deenihan has said, the lack of commitment to sport by various Governments has been obvious over the past years.  I felt that the national lottery was an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.  I thought, it would be specific and the largest amount of the money would go to sport and recreation. I can stay with section 5 (1)(a), but if section 5 (b) were deleted, I would be reasonably happy.  I have no objection to our national culture, including the Irish language, benefiting from this lottery.</P>
    <P>On the community health aspect, I would prefer a much clearer definition. The Minister will have to tell us what exactly he means by the health of the community.  Is he talking about hospitals, nurses' salaries or aspects of health boards that we know are part and parcel of the Department of Health?  If he tells us it is related to the Health Education Bureau and creating a greater awareness among the people of Ireland and about health and the importance of sport in their lives to promote good health, I would see nothing wrong with it.  However, the Minister needs to clarify what he means by &ldquo;the health of the community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with the main thrust of section 5 (a) &mdash; I am not opposed to it &mdash; but I am totally opposed to section 5 (b).  Section 5 (a) can be totally ignored by the Government but section 5 (b) if introduced, would not be acceptable to me.  I have to oppose it totally.  If the Minister can meet Senator Deenihan's amendments we would be happy.  The best thing to do is to satisfy everybody and make sure the national lottery is a success.  If there are doubts about how the money will be used, it could prove a disaster for the implementation and running of the national lottery.  I have no qualms of conscience about the national lottery. Senator Brendan Ryan compared the national lottery to a brothel &mdash; obviously he was referring to the morality of the <Col N="2025" /> lottery &mdash; which was a very unfair comparison. If the Minister could delete section 5 (b), it would meet my wishes.</P>

      <P>I will confine myself to commenting on Senator Deenihan's first amendment and I will reserve the overall thrust of my comments until the second amendment is discussed.  The Bill is an infrastructure providing for resources to be channelled into specific areas.  This is the nub of the Bill in terms of who is to receive support and funding from the national lottery once it is established.  I want to put one other viewpoint.  There seems to be an imbalance in the arguments put forward so far on this section. On Second Stage I argued very strongly in favour of resources being available for the provision of a national sports facility which was the <i>raison d'être</i> of this concept. Equally and strongly, I contend that the need within communities for arts funding remains to be answered.  We do not need to outline again the value of regional art centres that have developed in recent times in some communities.  The input of these regional art centres in terms of enriching ordinary people's lives has been very spectacular.  Unfortunately, they exist in very few areas and we need funding from some source. There will never be enough resources at the disposal of central Government from the normal tax revenue to endow the arts sufficiently well to provide the proper range and scope of community art.  I am familiar with how these centres operate and I think this provision should be clearly stitched into this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House supports the concept of sports funding.  I totally accept the underlying thrust of section 5 (a), as outlined in the Bill, that funds would be at the disposal of our national culture and the arts, within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951. There is a tremendous amount that can be done with limited resources.  There are a great number of embryonic arts groups flourishing in communities.  In my own home town two amateur arts groups have <Col N="2027" /> estalished theatre companies &mdash; the Wexford Co-Operative Theatre and the Pocket Theatre Company.  These exist on funding from the Department of Labour social employment schemes and Teamwork schemes and grants from local authorities and vocational education committees.  These groups must be allowed more reliable funding and the national lottery is one mechanism to do that.  I would strongly argue that there is an unanswerable case for funding for sport, but there should be equal funding for the arts, community artists and the enrichment of communities through artistic endeavour.  I appeal to the Miniter to ensure that when it comes to the distribution of resources under the national lottery the arts should receive equal funding to sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with section 5 (1) (a) of the Bill but I have a reservation about paragraph (b).  I am very anxious that sport will benefit from whatever moneys are raised by the lottery.  I would like to see also national culture, including the Irish language, benefiting from them and so I agree with the original section 5 (1) (a).  Sporting organisations have suffered through the imposition of DIRT in the Finance Bill and I doubt if whatever moneys sport will receive from this lottery will compensate in any way for the loss sustained by sporting bodies as a result of DIRT.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that some Senators were not more vocal about their concern for sport when we were discussing the Finance Bill.  However, I hope that whatever moneys will be made out of the lottery which are intended for sport and national culture will go to benefit them.  The national sports centre was mentioned.  I make an appeal that it be sited in Limerick at the NIHE.  I am delighted that my colleague, Senator Deenihan, a former pupil of that college, is plugging for that area.  It would be an ideal centre, central and easily accessible to people from all parts of Ireland.</P>

I was an admirer of Senator Deenihan in his sporting days, except, of course, the days when Kerry were playing Cork, and I know that he has continued his interest in this area.</P>

      <P>It was the same old story &mdash; an scéal céanna.  On the other hand, I have difficulty in accepting his amendment for a variety of reasons, some of which have appeared in the course of the debate in the contributions from both sides of the House.  I say to him that I anticipate that the national lottery will be of major benefit to sport. While I cannot anticipate the amount or what the surplus will be and I cannot predict a percentage at this stage as to what will be available, I can confirm on behalf of the Government that a significant proportion of the surplus will be allocated to sport.  That is as far as I can go at this stage.  I suppose that I cannot spend money which we have not yet got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very strong case has been made in this House and in the other House for support for the arts, for instance.  Senator Howlin made an eloquent plea on behalf of the Irish language.  Indeed, of all the items mentioned under section 5 (1) (a) the only one that seemed to arouse a little suspicion was the reference to the health of the community.  Let me explain, first <Col N="2029" /> of all, the reason for using the terminology &ldquo;of the community&rdquo;.  Initially in the Government's announcement there was merely the word &ldquo;health&rdquo;, but I have been advised by the parliamentary draftsman that it is necessary to specify &ldquo;health of the community&rdquo; as otherwise one could be talking about bovine health. The first term was too wide, and that is the reason it is expressed in that manner. There should be no question of suspicion on this point because there are many charitable and voluntary bodies who are doing excellent, outstanding work in the health area and I anticipate that some support could be forthcoming for some of their activities.  I would like to have the flexibility and freedom to consider applications from that sector.</P>
    <P>Let me return to Senator Deenihan's first amendment.  I accept the thrust of his argument that sport must be catered for to a significant extent from the surplus of this lottery, but in regard to specifying percentages in the manner in which he suggested, I ask him to take on board the points I am making and the points made by his colleagues in this House and from that point of view to accept the undertaking from the Government that sport will be a significant beneficiary from the lottery fund.</P>
    <P>His second amendment leads me to paragraph (b).  Several suspicions have been raised in relation to that paragraph which were discussed on Second Stage and I will not go into the matter in too much detail.  However, when we are establishing enabling legislation a certain degree of flexibility is necessary.  The Government have made quite clear the beneficial uses to which the lottery surplus will be devoted.  When the Bill was drafted originally they were not specified in the section at all.  In response to points made in the other House I decided that it was proper to put them into section 5 (1) (a).  At the same time there has to be enabling legislation to permit the Government of the day at some future time to accept some other purpose for which there might be unanimous or very major agreement among the people.  If <Col N="2030" /> they have not that power they will be unable to do so.</P>
    <P>Another factor in relation to section 5 (1) (b) is that a strong case has been made by Senators that the situation of those charitable and voluntary bodies who run lotteries at present should be given special consideration.  I said on Second Stage that I did not anticipate that the national lottery would be competitive, but the bottom line was that if charitable bodies at present running periodical lotteries could show from their figures that as a direct consequence of the national lottery they had sustained a drop in their income, the Government would consider an application from them for support from the lottery by way of &mdash; I think the word used was &mdash;&ldquo;compensation&rdquo;.  I gave that commitment because I felt it was justified, yet if we removed section 5 (1) (b) I would not have the power to entertain such an application.  Therefore, in essence there has to be that enabling power.  That is why it is there.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the amounts allocated for other purposes will be of any great significance.  Yet a charitable body doing outstanding work and needing funds in a particular year for some special project which it hoped to fund from its own periodical lottery might be considered to be worthy of special support. That is why, while the intention of the Government is not to avail of that provision to any degree, it is unwise to specify percentages in enabling legislation. Correct me if I am wrong but Senator Deenihan put down this amendment by way of additional reinforcement for his argument in favour of sport; and, if that is so, I ask him to accept the assurances which I have given in the sporting area and on that basis to withdraw both amendments.</P>
    <P>Without making a Second Stage speech, I want to comment very briefly on a few of the points raised by Senators on the amendments and on the section in general.  Senator Lanigan &mdash; understandably, in the light of his sporting background &mdash; pleaded for sport and said that when the lottery was first mooted it was solely for sporting purposes.  That is <Col N="2031" /> not correct.  When the lottery was referred to in the national plan in 1984 it was introduced on the following basis:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that a national lottery should be established, part of the proceeds of which will be allocated for the promotion of sport.</P>
    <P>That is as far back as 1984.  Therefore, while sport is very important in the context of the national lottery, it was not the sole basis for its introduction.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson would not have been entirely unhappy if the powers in paragraph (b) were excluded.  As I mentioned earlier, this is enabling legislation.  The purposes to which the Government propose to apply the proceeds have been announced publicly and are incorporated in section 5 (a).  There is a need for this residual power.  I mentioned one instance regarding the specific use of funds for a particular purpose where that power might be needed.  But there is no question of using that power for the purposes of, as it were, highjacking proceeds from the lottery into general Government expenditure. I accept Senator Robinson's point that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not the most popular daily or weekly, but there will be full transparency in that there will be the opportunities for debate.  I have to accept that that will be more in the other House rather than here because of the procedure whereby funds will be channelled through Departmental Estimates under a separate subhead.  There will be a full opportunity for debate so there can be no sleight of hand involved.  This is really what I am trying to emphasise.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne made a very telling point when, having voiced a support for sport and, indeed, the Irish language, he pointed out that you get tied up in a knot if you get involved with percentages. That is how I feel, because we have competing demands: a strong case from both sides of the House for sport but also for the arts, the Irish language and so on, and it will be a question of a balance when the lottery is in operation.  When <Col N="2032" /> we have a surplus to distribute different bodies will be invited to make applications and it will be a question of considering them and having a fair balance. There will certainly be an emphasis on sport, but I do not know if I should go on any further on that point.  We discussed the section fairly extensively on Second Stage.  I ask Senator Deenihan to accept, in the light of the assurances I can give him on behalf of the Government, that a significant proportion of the surplus will be allocated to sport and not to proceed with the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the Minister's assurances with regard to the funding of sport.  Nevertheless, my experience tells me otherwise; and, without the safeguards included in the amendments, I believe that sport will be a loser in the long run.  I am not questioning the commitments given by the Minister here tonight and I have no reason to doubt his honesty.  Without being repetitive and holding up the House too long, I feel &mdash; and other Senators agree &mdash; that the case for sport is outstanding.  While I have no wish to enter into any argument with regard to the benefit of sport <i>vis-a-vis</i> the arts or Irish culture, nevertheless in the context of the Bill I feel an opportunity has been afforded to us to ensure that sport will now be put on some form of permanent funding and not left to the whim of the Minister for Finance.  For that reason I am disappointed with the broadness of the section and the assurances involved.  I sincerely hope the Minister is right, that the Government are committed to sport and that the funding for sport which will come from the proceeds of the national lottery will not prove me wrong.  Rather reluctantly, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be very brief in saying that I have some sympathy for the spirit in which Senator Deenihan has put down these amendments seeking specific provision for sport.  The only point I want to make, and it is a point which has not been made already, is that we are presented with a real difficulty in this section of the National Lottery Bill in that some of the interpretations as to the usage of the funds it might generate are ones that would more normally be made in appropriations for specific Departments.  I would like to give an instance of this.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the provision that has been made for the area in which I probably have most experience as chairman of a regional arts committee for eight years, is through the normal channel.  In the case of the Department of Education and in the estimates for the Department, apart from the question of the provision for the arts in the curriculum, there should have been provision long before now for the remodification of buildings and for the design of new buildings in such a way that they could become multipurpose buildings for arts activities in the evening for wide ranges of people.  The position we have at present is unfortunately one where not only is there no provision for the arts in the curriculum, but where many of the buildings and structures which are provided are useless for purposes specifically of dance, in relation to the floors provided and of music in terms of acoustics and so on. We are in a position where there is a widespread demand within communities for arts, a demand which is of two kinds, one in relation to formal provision for the more institutionalised places, locations and practice of the arts, and then the growing participation in community arts. The point has already been made by Senator Howlin, and it is one I support, that at least in the region in which I have some experience, the Galway-Mayo region, at this stage more money has been spent by the Department of Labour than is being spent directly through the Arts Council in terms of the total number of people who are participating in the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> To change tack slightly, equally within the Department of Education one could have expected that there would be normal provision made for sport.  What I worry about, and it is just something that I wanted to place on record, is that it is terribly important that the moneys should be allocated within the context of some policy.  I am very bothered about the fact that there is not a White Paper on the arts at this stage that would indicate the level of funding that is required over the period of years to come.  Therefore, in the absence of a policy, it is very difficult to put a figure on what will be required so we could say that what is the necessary budget of the arts over the next ten or 20 years can be reasonably expected from the lottery.  Unfortunately, what has happened in relation to the arts is that people are being told that something is coming from the lottery.  I can tell you straightforwardly, a Cathaoirligh, and Members of the Seanad, that nobody involved in making provision for arts and culture anywhere wants haphazard grants, or bits of money delivered on promise, which unfortunately could be delivered, as many things are in this country, on the basis of the strength of lobbies and on the basis of the relative strength of an application at one particular time or another.</P>
    <P>While I have sympathy for the case that is being made for sport, the case in relation to the arts in this country is truly appalling.  We have, at present, one music school for 870,000 of the population. In the report which has fallen on deaf ears in the Arts Council and in any of the other reports which have come out, the case is made again and again, that despite our pretentions internationally as a very artistic nation, we have not made it possible in communities or schools or institutions for regular access and experience of the arts.  I feel very strongly that the fullness of section 5 (a) be implemented.  What I do worry about &mdash; and it is a point made by another Senator to which I lend my voice &mdash; is that at (b), the point the Minister has <Col N="2035" /> touched upon, &ldquo;such if any other purposes and in such amounts as the Government may decide from time to time&rdquo; has all the characteristics of haphazard expenditure, even interpreting it most benignly.  Of course, the malign interpretation, the people would say, is that the money will be spent for purposes that would be part of routine expenditure, which is a point that might have been made already.  I do make the point very strongly.  I will give practical examples of what I have in mind.</P>
    <P>There are places under the enabling Act under the arts, for example, of the seventies, whereby local authorities can give certain amounts out of their yearly budgets for the promotion of the arts. Most of that money is limited to actual performances within the particular year. It is only by twisting schemes that one could allow, for example, electricians to work in an old building to prepare the lights in a particular building.  There is no funding for fixed work.  At the moment we have urban renewal and development schemes.  I might make the point that these buildings could have been acquired, refurbished and developed.  It is necessary to spend in that area.  I would much prefer that the interpretation of a section like this be removed totally from the realm of politics.  I would like to see, for example, within the general demand for sport, that a certain sum of money is expressed as necessary, and that meaning a commitment.  What I do think is that it is almost like a war among the poor, for us to be arguing the case for the arts and the case for sport.  The fact that we are looking for regular funding for both sport and the arts in a National Lottery Bill rather than in an education or fine arts Bill, makes its own comment on the absence of policy in both areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments at this stage are more substantially on the section, though they touch on some of the matters replied to by the Minister in the context of the amendments put forward by Senator Deenihan.  In relation to the framing of the section, I would have to express uneasiness at least, and indeed, criticism of the thrust of this section.  It seems to be a very unusual approach in that one begins under section 5 (1) (a) with specified purposes.  I have already said that I would prefer a balanced range of purposes because, like other Senators who have contributed, although I acknowledge the importance of sports and recreational facilities I equally, without being able to draw any distinctions between them and play one off against the other, acknowledge the importance of the arts, the importance of the national language and culture and the importance of the health of the community.  These are all named specified purposes.  There is no requirement on the Government, as I read section 5 (1) (a), to ensure that money from the national lottery goes to each of these purposes.  There may just about be a requirement, depending on an interpretation of it, that the Government ensure, in any given year, that at least one of these areas receives funds from the national lottery, because it says: &ldquo;the purposes of such one or more of the following&rdquo;. So it may be that the Government have an obligation.  I am not quite sure.  Maybe the Government have an obligation to at least ensure that some money is devoted to one of the named purposes from the National Lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then under (b) the Government have, it seems, <i>carte blance.</i>  They have an open ended possibility of allocating any other purposes &mdash;&ldquo;such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time <Col N="2037" /> to time.&rdquo; It may be, to reverse Senator Deenihan's preferences in the matter, that sport would get less than 10 per cent and that 90 per cent would be allocated to such other purposes.  That is perfectly compatible with the section as it stands. What I do not understand and what the Minister did not make clear, is why he gave assurances?  We are all long enough in this House not to value assurances very much and that is not to take from the Minister's own good faith in the matter. It has nothing to do with his good faith, as he, as a lawyer, knows.  It has to do with the text of the Bill.  That is what we are concerned about.  Governments come and go.  Ministers come and go.  Priorities of Government, even within the same Government come and go.  They are not what concern us.  We are entitled to be concerned with the purposes to which the moneys would be allocated which would be raised by way of this national lottery, which the Minister estimates, when all other costs, expenses and prizes have been paid out in the first year, at approximately £10 million.  That is a fairly sizeable sum.  This House is entitled to know how that is to be allocated, not in accordance with some assurance from the Minister but in accordance with the text of the Bill we are passing through the House.  It is not clear from the text of the section. It is puzzling that it cannot be made clear.</P>
    <P>Still on the section, I would also welcome some clarification from the Minister as to how, in fact, the section will translate into action, if I may put it that way.  Again, it is devised in a particular way.  It says that money paid into the Central Fund shall be applied for the purposes stated either under (a) or (b) which will be identified by the Government. If one looks at section 3, it is clear that when the Government identifies the purposes it does so in terms of an amount for those purposes.  Subsection (3) provides that the amounts required for a purpose determined under the section shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  I am not quite sure how subsection (3) is to be read with subsection (1), but it seems as though in identifying the purpose there will also be <Col N="2038" /> an identification of an amount rather than a percentage of the fund.  It will not be 10 per cent or £10 million; it will be X amount of money, it would appear.  If that is the case, who is to do the followup on it?  If the Government say they are allocating £5 million for sport, who is going to determine from then on the sub-allocation of it?  If it is £5 million for health in the community, who does the sub-allocation?  Is it the Minister for Health, for example, or some other bodies?  If it is, broadly speaking, national culture, who does the determination? How much of that will be for the national language and how much will not?</P>
    <P>These are important questions that are not clarified at all in the section.  There is an almost peculiar terminology of &ldquo;the purposes of such one or more of the following&rdquo;, and then under subsection (3) &ldquo;amounts required for a purpose&rdquo;.  Who is requiring those amounts?  Is it the Government?  If so, who is sub-allocating within the amounts required?  I would welcome clarification on that.</P>

      <P>In my previous contribution I tried to confine myself to the first amendment in the name of Senator Deenihan.  I think I understand now the way we are dealing with the section as a whole.  I want to comment now briefly on the broader section, if I am still in order.</P>
      <P>First, I associate myself very strongly with the two immediately previous speakers, Senator Michael D. Higgins and Senator Mary Robinson.  I agree entirely that what we are doing now is in a way grubbing over resources in a national lottery for vital activities in the community that certainly should be provided for anyway, and should not be dependent on a game of chance.  I am afraid that is the situation with which we are faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pick up a comment from the Minister.  It is envisaged that, if charitable institutions can prove that their actual receipts are reduced by the operation of the national lottery by proving that their receipts are down, they can make a case to central Government for funding.  The Minister wants an open-ended provision <Col N="2039" /> under section 5 (b) to be able to determine the amount on that.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address on this section &mdash; and I hope I am referring accurately to his comment &mdash; the Minister, who does not want to quantify it in terms of percentage, said, that if in one year a worthy project was jeopardised or could be alleged to be jeopardised by the operation of the national lottery, a case could be made to Government and the Government would allocate a slice of the national lottery take to that.  On Second Stage I said I regarded that as a highly dangerous provision.  We are all in favour of goodness and every charity in the country is worthy of our support.  They are all worthy of resources.  However, if we give <i>carte blanche</i> to every charitable institution effectively to apply for funding from the national lottery, there will be precious little left to the arts, or to sport or to the Irish language or the health of the community.  It is a very dangerous provision to put into a piece of legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I take up again the point made by Senator Robinson that there is no detailed copperfastened mechanism for the actual allocation of resources.  It is too haphazard.  There is a general statement on the recipients and it is up to God knows who at that stage to actually decide percentages and within each category who gets the goodies.  Legislation like this should be far tighter, and we expect a far tighter provision.  I have the gravest reservations about section 5 (b).  That is <i>carte blanche</i> for a Government that is lacking in resources, and there will probably not be a Government for the foreseeable future which will have abundant resources.  It will be a temptation to them to have an easy access to resources.  We have seen in other areas where there was not a copperfastened, legal mechanism for the disbursement of resources that the Government subsume the money into their normal activities.  It will run counter to the very purpose of this Bill and to the sentiments expressed in both these Houses on this Bill.  I am deeply concerned that this subsection would remain <Col N="2040" /> unaltered.  The Minister should respond by more than just giving assurances.  He should respond with an amendment of his own to the criticisms we have outlined.</P>

      <P>It might be helpful if I dealt with the mechanics, as it were, of the operation before coming back to the other points raised.  Essentially, it is intended, when the national lottery is operational, that specific allocations to bodies or organisations in the various areas mentioned here in the Bill will be decided on by the Government and made available through the normal Estimates process in separately identifiable subheads. For example, a body in the sports area which wanted to be considered for funding from the lottery would state its case to the responsible Government Department.  In that instance, it would be the Department of Education.  Similarly, bodies in the other areas of national culture, art, or health, are cases for the relevant Department.  All such requests would be evaluated against the estimates of the lottery's proceeds in a particular year.  Then the appropriate provision would be made in the relevant Estimates and Votes concerned.  I thought it might be helpful to outline the mechanics of the situation and what will happen once the lottery is operational.  What is important, to me and probably to this House, is that we are talking about separately identifiable subheads.  There will be some transparency in the situation.  That is as I envisage the manner of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have covered some of the matters raised in the last contributions.  I appreciate &mdash; perhaps it is by way of a counter weight to the earlier concentration on sport &mdash; that the last number of speakers have been throwing their weight more behind the arts.  That is one of the difficulties one has when one is dividing any cake.  The arts area is, of course, included in the provisions of the Bill and I do not think I can go any further at this stage in regard to that.  Clearly, it is the intention that in the area of arts and culture there should be support in the years ahead.  I cannot anticipate what that will be.  The problems we will face when the Bill has <Col N="2041" /> been passed will be the completing of discussions with An Post, the details of the licence, the setting up of the subsidiary, the establishment of the rules of the game, the assessment of the various plans and proposals from An Post and the giving of the necessary sanctions.  It will take a long time to become operational. I did say, in concluding on Second Stage, that I was very anxious to have this lottery operational before the end of the year but, to a certain extent, that will be more in the hands of An Post.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the powers in section 5 (1) (b).  There is certainly no <i>mala fide</i> on the part of the Government and at the same time I have to say there is, in enabling legislation, a need for the kind of flexibility which is given in section 5 (1) (b).  The Government have clearly announced their intentions but they could change in the years ahead.  I will quote an example which might bring home the thinking behind that provision.  When I was going into the other House on Committee Stage I was handed a letter from the National Youth Council of Ireland making a case as to why they should be included as beneficiaries of the lottery.  At that stage, the last day of the debate, it was not possible to make changes but it is possible that the kind of activities the youth council are interested in do not fall within the purposes mentioned in subsection (1) (a). All the same there might be a fairly large consensus that some aspect of youth affairs should be included and if the Government of the day did not have the power to do that, that kind of decision could not be taken.</P>
    <P>There is another safeguard.  I should like to tell those who fear the clawback into the maw of the Exchequer of any surplus from the lottery that, in practical terms, that cannot be done.  The success of the lottery to a large extent will be related to the fact that the people will be aware of the application of the proceeds for sporting purposes, the arts or the Irish language.  People will be able to relate to them but if it transpired that the Government of the day tried to hijack the proceeds there would be a total loss of <Col N="2042" /> confidence in the lottery and, as a result, there would not be a surplus to divide. On that basis I believe the section should stand as it is.  It is not as originally drafted. In response to comments in the other House I put down an amendment to cover the points raised by both sides.  I suggest that this is the best way to frame the section in this enabling legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to come back on this section again but, unfortunately, when the Minister suggested that people might be worried about the proceeds of the lottery going into the maw of the Exchequer, he proceeded to tell us that the funds would go into the maw of the Exchequer.  The Bill suggests that the moneys will be paid into a central fund, and section 8 defines the way that central fund will be administered, but nevertheless, that central fund has no control over the moneys that go in.  The section states that moneys remitted to the central fund under this paragraph shall form part of the central fund.  The section does not state, as the Minister said, that the moneys will be spread over the various Departments responsible for sport, culture, the arts, health and so on.  Anybody looking for funds from the lottery will have to go to the Departments responsible.  Those seeking funds for sport will go to the Department of Education, in the case of health they will go to the Department of Health and in the case of the arts they will go to the Department of the Taoiseach.  How can the Minister state that the funds are not going into the Central Fund and will not become part of the State funding?  Would it not be better to have a separate lottery fund?  How will anybody know what proportion of funding for sport will come out of the national lottery if everybody who is looking for money for sport applies to the Department of Education?  Will the exact amount of money that goes from the national lottery to the Department of Education be paid out for the purposes proposed?  Will a separate division be responsible for the disbursement?  How can anybody say whether money comes from a taxation or other source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> The Minister said he has made changes to this section.  The changes he has made make the section worse.  Subsection (1) (b) is not acceptable in any circumstances to this side of the House.  We oppose it vehemently and will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's strongest defence of this section was to characterise the Bill as an enabling Bill.  I am puzzled by that because it does not seem that it is an enabling Bill at all.  What is it enabling?  It is not enabling the possibility of the establishment of a national lottery.  It is establishing a national lottery. There is nothing enabling about it; we are doing it.  Whatever reason there might be behind referring to it or characterising it as an enabling Bill does not seem to apply here.  In this section we are establishing the purposes of the national lottery.  It should be as precise as we as a House can make it.  I accept that the Minister has amended this section.  In the other House he has been flexible in regard to some of the criticisms that were made.  I accept that he has tried to meet some of the concerns and some of the views expressed which are similar to the views he is hearing in this House.  I have sympathy for that.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I remain unhappy about the way in which paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 5 (1) are set out because this House cannot know what it means.  This House cannot know how the Government will allocate as between the purposes. It may or may not favour the purposes set out in (a) which this House at least has some expressed knowledge of.  Senator Deenihan and others strongly favour sport.  Some of the rest of us have a strong preference for the arts, the national language, culture and so on.  We know at least what is being named.  We just do not know what the purposes are in paragraph (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It suddenly dawned on me, as I listened carefully to the Minister, that, after all, perhaps this section is appropriate to a National Lottery Bill because the purposes of the national lottery are themselves a lottery.  They are a pure matter <Col N="2044" /> of chance.  We cannot and will not know what they are, and perhaps that is part of the whole absurd logic of this.  It is all a matter of lottery or chance.  Nonetheless, even though I accept that I will not get a clear answer to the question I really want answered, the Minister used a phrase a number of times in his reply that I would invite him to clarify a little further.  He said that the fund would be allocated in the Estimates by way of &ldquo;separately identifiable subheads&rdquo;.  What precisely are &ldquo;separately identifiable subheads&rdquo;, so that when we see them we will know them?  Will they be in red ink or will they have beside them &ldquo;NL&rdquo; for national lottery, or &ldquo;Nat. Lot&rdquo;?  Even to know that might take away some of the lottery element in this section, which disserves some of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my use of the terminology &ldquo;enabling legislation&rdquo; I use that because we are not establishing a national lottery.  We are giving power which enables the Minister to grant a licence in certain circumstances.  It is our intention, once these enabling provisions have been put on the statute book, to grant such a licence to An Post.  From the point of view of the proceeds or the division of the surplus, what is important to me and probably to all the Members of this House is that any such division or allocation should be done in an open and visible manner, in the glare of publicity if necessary, and should be capable of discussion and debate.  Essentially there should be full transparency.  What better arrangement could one have than to ensure that that would be the position other than to include the allocations in the Estimates.  I take the administrative point, if I may call it that, raised by Senator Robinson when she questioned how the specific allocations would be made available to the Estimates by way of separately identifiable subheads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator questioned how in effect that is going to be a visible, open, transparent manner of <Col N="2045" /> operating.  I suppose inherent in that would be to say that one can read the Estimates volume and track them down. I take on board the points raised.  In so far as we can in the presentation of the Estimates we will ensure that there will be full transparency and, indeed, even the possibility of co-relation between the various lottery items.  I assure the House that I will discuss with my officials as to how that could best be done.  I am genuinely anxious to ensure that there will be full, open transparency about the affairs of the national lottery.  In relation to the conduct of the lottery there will be annual reports which will have to be laid before the Houses and so on.  That is not entirely the answer to the question of the distribution of the surplus.  I have no doubt, particularly bearing in mind the level of interest that has been displayed in this House and indeed the other House, that pressure will be put on whatever Government is in power to ensure that there will be a full, open conduct of the business of the distribution of the surplus.</P>
      <P>On the question of 5 (1) (b) I do not know if I can bring this very much further. Senator Robinson asked what will happen under this provision.  I have to give an honest answer: I do not know.  I do not anticipate in the short term that there will be any use of that provision except perhaps in the context of a point that arose in the course of the debate.  I can see one possible use that I mentioned earlier.  My other colleagues in the House might think of other possible uses.  I want to wind up by giving a negative and a positive example to prove the need for that provision.  I have repeatedly said that there is no question of absorbing the surplus from the lottery into general Exchequer spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I have also given a positive commitment that, in the event of there being a shortfall in the proceeds of charitable and voluntary bodies holding periodical lotteries as a direct consequence of the holding of the national lottery, compensation will be made.  I say to you, and perhaps I will put it directly to those who have come out strongly <Col N="2046" /> against the provision, how could that compensation be paid, how could that undertaking be honoured if that provision was not there?  It is essential that that enabling provision be there if only to enable me to honour that specific undertaking which I have given to those voluntary and charitable bodies, an undertaking which was not criticised by a single Member of this House.  I will rephrase that by saying that that was an undertaking and commitment that was largely endorsed by the majority of the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>I gave a commitment. I intend to see that any commitment or undertaking I have given is honoured. But I must have the power, if necessary, for other purposes, to honour that commitment in the event that a question of compensation becomes a reality.  I do not think I can carry the point any further.  I believe the power is necessary.  I have assured the House of my good intentions. I have no doubt that if there happened to be any <i>mala fide</i> on the part of this or any other Government, then the matter would become one of major public debate.  I do not think any Government would get away with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section that has evoked quite a lot of discussion and genuine concern from all sides of the House. Some people have priorities in this respect they want to ensure are met.  The Minister is suggesting that section 1 (b) allows a certain flexibility.  Most of us know a lot of other purposes for which the lottery could be used.  Those of us having special priorities would want to ensure that they are identified in section 1 (a), such as sport, culture and so on. Section 8 would appear to meet Senator Lanigan's objections that gains would not go into the overall national Exchequer. Rather they would be lodged in a special fund in the Bank of Ireland which would be appropriately identified, with amounts <Col N="2047" /> being dispersed from that fund into various Departments and separately identified. Any Government that abuses the provisions of section 1 (b) of this Bill will be bringing about the death knell of the success of the national lottery.  Therefore it is in all our interests that the money be dispersed as indicated here and that the discretion given in subsection 1 (b) will not be abused.  Any Government will be on trial with regard to how they disburse these funds.  If in disbursing those funds they do not meet the genuine wishes of the people who subscribe to the lottery then it will be a failure.  That would be a tragedy.  In my remarks on Second Stage I indicated that it was important to dispel any doubts in people's minds about how the funds would be used.  I do not know whether today's discussion on the section will have created more doubts in their minds.  However, it is important to get whatever assurances we can from the Minister.  He has been as forthcoming as possible.  The section as it stands allows a certain amount of discretion to the Government, which can be identified, and ensures that the money cannot be misappropriated under any other subheading. The gains will be published so that everybody can read about them and discuss them, which will determine the success of the national lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up with the Minister his commitment <i>vis-a-vis</i> voluntary and charitable organisations. I mentioned this point already when speaking on Second Stage.  This commitment is very dangerous from the point of view that there is nothing to stop any organisation from claiming that their funds were seriously affected by the lottery in a given year, claiming that the shortfall should be made up from the proceeds of the national lottery.  If we extend this commitment to all organisations running lotteries, be they charitable or voluntary, that could lead to a further erosion of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been making a case here for the arts, culture and sport but I fear that ultimately there will be nothing left for <Col N="2048" /> any of us.  If the Minister gave them a commitment that he would make up a certain percentage of their shortfall then we would know where we stood.  But there is nothing to prevent or deter these people from claiming for any type of shortfall.  Indeed there is nothing to prevent them from not pursuing their fund raising activities with the same vigour, knowing that if they have a shortfall, it will be made up from the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to drag this out all night.  Obviously the Minister is not going to change his mind.  There is a vagueness about subsection (1) (b) that is totally unacceptable.  That subsection should not have been inserted.  The Minister should not have allowed his parliamentary draftsman to insert it.  There is absolutely no way that this House can accept that the Minister will be capable of confining the other purposes to the sporting, cultural and health areas which he wants to have covered by the national lottery.  He will be subjected to extreme pressure by every other Minister in the disbursement of funds.  If they feel there is a shortfall in their allocation for something which seems to be of a beneficial nature to any sector of the community, they will put pressure on the Minister in charge of the central fund of the national lottery to use it for whatever purpose they decide.  It is totally unacceptable to us.  There is absolutely no way we will accept subsection (1) (b).  The dilution of the benefits of the lottery for sport to various other interests is not acceptable. Therefore, under no circumstances will we accept subsection (1) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise one point.  In the Minister's last reply he asserted that the unanimous view of the House was that charitable organisations who suffered a shortfall would be reimbursed from the national lottery fund.  I am not sure whether the Minister listened to my last comment, those on Second Stage or those of Senator Deenihan.  At that time we expressed genuine fears. Once you get into a free-for-all <i>vis-a-vis</i><Col N="2049" /> charitable institutions, you will discover that they are all worthy, all have merit and will carry very strong lobbies.  If they feel there is a possibility of their getting a slice of the cake, what we will have is not a national lottery &mdash; aimed at providing resources for sport, art and culture, the national language and community health &mdash; instead what we will have is a super-charitable lottery into which every worthwhile charitable institution catering for the myriad of worthy causes will all want to dip.  That would run counter to the proposals and <i>raison d'être</i> of this Bill, and to the wishes of these Houses, and constitute the death knell of the positive objective of the supporters of this concept in the first place. I would ask the Minister to address that issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister whether he thinks there is genuine fear that if you give this open-ended invitation to every charitable institution simply to prove that the national lottery will affect their fund raising efforts, they will have a <i>prima facie</i> case for funding from the lottery.  This will open the door for inordinate pressure by worthwhile charitable institutions. They will lobby at a rate which the Minister and the Government will not be able to bear.  This resource will be very finite and it will be dispersed and eroded and the objectives of the national lottery will be lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been searching my papers for the wording of the assurance I gave.  The point arose in strong pleas in regard to existing charitable voluntary bodies at present conducting lotteries. They have expressed concern that they will suffer considerably as a result of the national lottery.  I was a little surprised by the attitude of Senators because of the way that point developed on Second Stage.  Most Senators were sympathetic in regard to voluntary bodies. The same occurred in the other House.  I gave details of the various steps I <Col N="2050" /> intended to take to try to ensure that there would be no diminution in the receipts of such bodies through increasing the prize limits under the 1956 Act, plus the removal of the restriction on publicity.</P>
      <P>I spoke about the various meetings between officials of my Department and the Department of Justice.  There were meetings with various charitable bodies. There were strong representations from the GAA and, arising from that, I made a statement to the effect that in the light of the measures we have taken I did not think there would be any loss in the accounts of such organisations.  I spoke of the Government's sympathy with them and I gave the following assurance:</P>
      <P>Only time will tell how, if at all, the national lottery will affect the situation of these bodies who hold existing periodical lotteries.  However, I have already given an assurance on this point and I am stating clearly that when such bodies can demonstrate satisfactorily that the lottery has adversely affected their receipts the Government is prepared to take steps to make funding available to them from the lottery surplus.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go back on that assurance. I have no intention of agreeing to a proposal that the enabling power in section 5 (b) would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would insert in section 5 (b) his Second Stage assurance, that would be acceptable.  The existing provision in the section could be applied to any shortfall in any organisation's fund and, if there is a shortfall in Exchequer funding of community health projects, the Minister for Health could come in and look for disbursement to make up the shortfall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say that the way in which we have gone through the last six sections is an abuse of this House.  I do not want to make any comment on you, a Chathaoirligh, but that is not a proper way to run the business of this House.  If I have to filibuster in order to get people either to sit down or to participate in the debate, I will do so.  It is not your fault.  I am not criticising you but this is a serious matter with serious implications.  We were racing through at a pace I resented.</P>
      <P>On section 15 I would like to ask the Minister what reason there is to prevent staff of the company being Members of Seanad Éireann.  I am geting quite sick of Seanad Éireann being categorised along with the Assembly of the European Parliament and Dáil Éireann for the simple reason &mdash; which is one that will surprise many people &mdash; that the income on which full time Members of this House have to live is far less than the income which Members of either the European Parliament or Dáil Éireann have to live on. To suggest that there is a parallel between full time membership of this House and full time membership of the other two Parliaments is extremely unfair.  That membership of Seanad Éireann necessitates for a rapidly increasing number of people full time leave of absence from work, while the level of payment is based on the principle that membership of Seanad Éireann should not be a full time occupation according to the Devlin Report, is quite unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a reason given for this provision in the Bill.  I cannot see any strange conflict of interest in somebody here being a member of the staff.  It is one of these &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; phrases that is stuck in.  The advisers who suggest to Ministers that they stick in these phrases are all living on salaries well in excess of what Members of Seanad Éireann have to live on.  The inclusion of Seanad Éireann in every Bill like this, when it is a very different body from either the Dáil or the Assembly of the European <Col N="2053" /> Parliament, is an anomaly that should be addressed once and for all.  As I have a reputation for very often criticising the scale of payment of Members of this House, I am qualified and in a safer position than most people to take exception to the implication of sections like this.  I invite the Minister to justify the inclusion of Seanad Éireann with the Assembly of the European Parliament and Dáil Éireann, the Members of which are substantially better paid than Members of this House.  It is an unfair comparison and one that should be addressed once and for all.</P>

      <P>I have previously raised the automatic inclusion of this clause in regard to every possible State or semi-State body, regardless of whether it makes sense or not to exclude Members of the Oireachtas and in particular Members of Seanad Éireann from being in any way involved in the staff or on the boards of these bodies.  Another one is the National Social Service Board which <Col N="2054" /> I remember in particular talking about. It is particularly the case in regard to Members of Seanad Éireann when the whole idea is supposed to be that Members are to be expert in fields outside the House and to give the benefit of their expertise in these outer fields to the debates in the House.  Therefore, it would be particularly useful to have a Member of Seanad Éireann who would have an expert knowledge of the workings of various semi-State bodies &mdash; this included &mdash; in order to give the benefit of this wisdom to the debates of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>These provisions are automatically included.  I have questioned this before and the answer from various Ministers is that this is a customary clause in all these Bills.  That is not a good enough answer. There is lack of thought and it is stuck in automatically.  I notice that it says in subsections (1) and (2) &ldquo;nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  I would like further clarification as to whether this means it is only the 11 people nominated by the Taoiseach and that those of us who are elected to Seanad Éireann are allowed.  It seems to me that the whole idea of these clauses automatically being put into Bills like this is a thoughtless way of going about things.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this position.</P>

      <P>This section is now worded in the way this House required it to be worded after previous amendments we had put down to a whole range of legislation which precluded people who were nominated to stand for election to the Seanad.  This is specific.  It refers to a person &ldquo;nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  This is the only House to which one can be nominated as a Member.  One can be elected to the other House but one can be nominated here. What worried us in the past was that people could be nominated to stand for election against their will, thereby being excluded from being members of subsidiary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other argument being made by Senators is possibly a valid one &mdash; that people who are Members of this House should not be excluded.  It is as Senator <Col N="2055" /> McGuinness has said, included in all Bills that we are precluded from being our own bosses.  That is the reason for it.  It does not just refer to people who are nominated to stand for election to the Seanad.  It specifically refers to people who are nominated as Members.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion on the level of remuneration of Senators or Members of the other House.  It is a separate issue.

      <P>The received wisdom over the years was that it was not appropriate that those who were either on the staff or the board of the semi-State bodies should be Members of the Houses.  As has been mentioned by Senator Ferris, the old provision related to the standing for membership but now it has changed and is related to membership.  It is rather a broad question as to whether that type of provision in general should not be applicable to semi-State bodies as a whole.  In the light of the need to have very substantial public trust and credibility in the national lottery, I do not think this body is one where a start should be made in changing a precedent that has become so well established over the years.  In the circumstances I would be reluctant to make a change in relation to the national lottery.  Of all the semi-State organisations that is the one where I would be least tempted to make a start.</P>
      <P>I take the point raised by Senator McGuinness perhaps year by year in relation to semi-State bodies we accept the received wisdom of the past and we continue as before.  This is a standard provision.</P>

      <P>When we talk about vested <Col N="2056" /> interests in this House we are talking about vested interests that are blatantly apparent, but it is very difficult to get somebody to serve on any board who has not a vested interest somewhere.  We feel in Seanad Éireann that there is a certain discrimination particularly because of the fact that we cannot get away from the remuneration aspect and the fact that a considerable number of Members of this House if they were full-time would certainly have scope for involvement.</P>

      <P>Section 15 (2) refers to a member of the staff of the company but that person could be a very junior member of staff without any policy function whatsoever.  I was a practising teacher before I became a Member of this House and the rules and regulations that govern education in this country are matters of debate and discussion and enactment in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Therefore, should teachers be debarred from serving because they have some vested interest in the regulations that govern the educational system?  I contend that people who have expertise in the area are suitable to comment on the matter.  There is no logic in what the Minister has said.  If it is not appropriate to this Bill, at least it should be borne in mind for future Bills.</P>

      <P>I wish to confirm there is no question of singling out Seanad Éireann.  It covers the Dáil and the European Assembly as well.  As to the general principle, it is a matter for debate but I reiterate that I do not think that the national lottery company is the company where the debate should open. It seems to me there could be a conflict of interest.  There is the old saying about justice not alone being done but being seen to be done.  I want to ensure that the lottery company and the whole conduct of the lottery will have absolute national public confidence and from that point of view I would be more than hesitant to consider a change in the established procedure in particular in relation to the lottery company.  However, as Senator Howlin suggests, the broad principle <Col N="2057" /> in relation to semi-State companies and particularly as it relates to the junior staff is a matter that should be discussed on another occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">

      <P>The trouble about this is that every time we raise this kind of section on every Bill we get a similar reply to what the Minister has given.  I understand what he has said, although I think it carries some rather strange implications about our politicians that we should not be trusted to be in charge of a national lottery.  I do not know quite what that actually implies but, at the same time, what worries me is that we get the same answer from every Minister that in principle it may be wrong to put this clause in automatically.  I hope that perhaps the Minister may be able to raise it at a higher level, that this kind of clause should not be put in automatically.</P>
      <P>I think there is a difference between Members of Seanad Éireann and members of the other bodies because Members of Seanad Éireann are specifically regarded as being part time.  As far as declarations of interests are concerned, we have plenty of Members of Seanad Éireann who are attached to particular industries or, as in my own case, to a profession or to insurance companies or whatever.  Nobody thinks the worst of us that we contribute to debates on these issues and that we use our own professional or business expertise to contribute to these debates.  Why is it all right to do it as a self-employed person or in private industry but not in the public sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss, first of all, to understand what conflict of interest there could be between being on the staff of the national lottery and being a Member of the European Parliament.  I am afraid there is no way I can stretch my imagination to see how membership of the European Parliament could be affected by or where there could be a conflict of interest.  This is a conventional catch-all phrase that is stuck in automatically by the parliamentary draftsman and which nobody has challenged.  I want <Col N="2058" /> to repeat again that Seanad Éireann is. first of all, a vocational body according to the Constitution and is meant to represent people who have, if I can use the phrase, positive vested interests.  It is meant to represent those vested interests and it is meant to represent them publicly. One could go on for a long time about whether people do represent those interests; but there are people here who claim their right to be here because they represent agriculture, for instance.  They are meant to be here.  Does that mean that because they represent agriculture they should be silent on any legislation to do with agriculture?  Of course, it does not; it means the opposite.  It means that there should be a particularly specialised kind of debate here.  Similarly, on any issue this should be the case and I want to say it again.</P>
      <P>It does not affect me at present but one never knows what may happen in the future.  For instance, I can think in my own area of one sector where the staff are now excluded effectively from Seanad Éireann.  They are the National Institutes for Higher Education because the staff of those bodies must go on secondment if they are to be nominated or elected to membership of Seanad Éireann.  If, for instance, a Taoiseach in the future decided to ask one of the directors of one of the NIHEs to be a Member of Seanad Éireann, which I think could have a lot of positive value, he could not do so because the director would have to go on secondment and reduce his salary by about 50 per cent at least.  It is a ludicrous provision which is stuck in there because people never thought about what it meant or what it implied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a salary here which is about 20 per cent less than the average public service salary.  It is a quite reasonable salary for a part time job and I have said it before but it is not a reasonable salary to expect somebody to meet the expenses that Members have to meet. I am saying it because I think I am probably less liable to get lambasted in the media for saying it than many Members of this House.  Perhaps I can get away with it with less egg on my face than many <Col N="2059" /> Members.  It is a perfectly reasonable salary, as are most of the other aspects of our career for people who are here are on the sort of basis on which Seanad Éireann is intended to operate.  However, it is not a reasonable salary to expect people to live on if they are forced to be seconded from areas of employment.</P>
    <P>The principle is what I am concerned about here.  I would be very grateful if the Minister undertook at least to raise the issue of the principle of including Seanad Éireann in these catch-all provisions. After all, if I am correct he is also junior Minister in the Department of the Public Service where a lot of these things are often, I understand, discussed. It would be worthwhile pursuing it further. I do not think Seanad Éireann needs to be, ought to be or deserves to be included with either Dáil Éireann or the European Assembly.</P>

      <P>In relation to the national lottery, it is absolutely important that its operations are seen to be &mdash; I emphasise those words &mdash; apolitical.  In regard to the suggestion of Senator Ryan, I think perhaps this would be a fit subject for debate in one of the Oireachtas Joint Committees.  I am thinking of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation in particular.  I would encourage Members to put it down for general discussion there.  That would seem to me to be the appropriate forum.</P>

      <P>With regared to section 28 (2) (b), is there not some sort of anomaly &mdash; and this goes back to the issues I raised earlier &mdash; in the concept that persons who are under a legal disability or of unsound mind could purchase <Col N="2060" /> tickets presumably in the national lottery or can people buy tickets for nominees only?  What is the position?  I find it a little bit disturbing that persons of unsound mind are contemplated as people who could be purchasing tickets in the national lottery.  This is open to all sorts of possible tragedies.  I do not know how we could exclude them, but I am not happy that apparently we are prepared to contemplate people of unsound mind, or people suffering from other legal disabilities, purchasing tickets.</P>
      <P>As I said from the beginning, this is just another form of gambling.  It would be as addictive as any other form of gambling. Gambling is now recognised almost universally as something of an addictive disease in the same way as alcoholism.  I think there is something peculiar about us contemplating people of unsound mind getting involved in purchasing tickets.  I will not make a big issue out of this, but it should be on the record that the idea of persons of unsound mind, and people with other legal disabilities, purchasing tickets leaves an unpleasant taste about the operation of something like the national lottery.</P>

      <P>From a practical point of view, the Senator will appreciate that it would not be possible to include a provision preventing the purchase of tickets by somebody whose soundness of mind could be questioned.  If such a ticket happened to win a prize, it would clearly be very wrong that the said purchaser would be unable to benefit, but the question arises of devising a proper system for, say, the minor who got a present or somebody who became of unsound mind after purchasing the ticket &mdash; maybe because they won a prize.  This is a practical point and special arrangements will have to be made in respect of those situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 33, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33. No notice or announcement concerning the National Lottery (other than normal news or other reporting) shall be broadcast on radio or television.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section contains probably the most devastating two lines in the entire Bill. We are, with one swoop in a line and a half, eliminating this lottery from all the wisdom of our community about how to regulate gaming and lotteries.  We are saying this is something new which should be regulated by this Bill and nothing else.</P>
      <P>A number of Gaming and Lotteries Acts were passed between 1956 and 1979 &mdash; although I think the effective Act is still the 1956 Act, which goes through the method of conducting lotteries and many things related to it.  Contained in the 1956 Act is section 22 which, until now was never publicly challenged because most people recognise the wisdom of that section. Section 22 of the 1956 Act states:</P>
      <P>No person shall print, publish in any newspaper or periodical publication, exhibit on any cinema screen or broadcast by radio any notice or announcement concerning a lottery (other than an announcement of the results of a lottery declared by any provision of this Part not to be unlawful or cause or procure any such notice or announcement to be so printed, published, exhibited or broadcast or knowingly circulate or cause or procure to be circulated any newspaper or periodical publication containing any such notice or announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively it said that advertising to encourage the sale of tickets in lotteries was illegal, whether it be in newspapers, periodicals, on the radio or television. Presumably there is some section in the Broadcasting Acts which incorporates television into the definition of radio. That was not put in as some sort of extreme puritanism.  It was put in because <Col N="2062" /> it was recognised that the whole area of lotteries and gaming is part of the area of gambling and that gambling, notwithstanding what we have been hearing here, is not a matter of free choice.  It is potentially as addictive as alcohol or drugs.  There is overwhelming evidence that addiction to gaming can be as destructive of individuals, of society and, in particular, given the quantity if not the quality of talk we have had about the family over the past six weeks, of family life.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier, we currently spend over £200 million a year on on-course and off-course betting.  It is not by any means an insignificant sum.  It represents about one fifth of what we spend as a society on education.  It represents as much as we spend on the Department of Justice.  It represents nearly as much as we spend on the Department of Defence.  It is a large sum spent on gambling.  This is not a minor issue.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago legislators recognised that gambling had potentially serious social consequences, that lotteries were part of ordinary living, particularly the small scale lotteries envisaged in earlier legislation and that they were potentially damaging if they got out of hand.  A very wise provision was inserted prohibiting advertising of such lotteries in newspapers, periodicals or on the radio.  It has worked well.  Until this proposal for this national lottery came in, I had not been aware that most of the voluntary organisations were clamouring for a fundamental change in legislation about advertising lotteries.  They had their own methods of enabling lotteries to be known about and of promoting those lotteries, usually by word of mouth, or door to door.  This avoided a number of things. In particular, it avoided young people and children being introduced to a gambling culture because of radio and television in particular.  Television is a children's medium which is consumed in large quantities by young people under 15 years of age.  Unless the Minister is going to introduce regulations saying that the advertising of the national lottery can <Col N="2063" /> only be carried on after 9 o'clock at night, which I suspect he will not say, children will be fed a diet of advertising of this new form of gambling, and it will not be a particularly innocent form of advertising.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to confirm that the Canadian Federal Government have decided to give up lotteries because of the negative effects of such lotteries. In an article in <i>The Toronto Star</i> of 7 October 1984 the United Church, the Salvation Army and the Baptist Federation of Canada said that millions of Canadians are now gamblers who never were in the past or would be without the aggressive promotion of lotteries by Government.  They went on to say that with subtle deceptive advertising techniques citizens were lured to buy and be a winner when most all of them would be losers, many losing money they could ill afford.</P>
    <P>In our case, this will not be some sort of bland, detached advertisement saying: &ldquo;Buy tickets in the national lottery&rdquo;.  It will be based on the prospect of people winning a large fortune.  The odds of somebody winning a large fortune are about a million to one against but this will not be advertised.  What will be advertised is the possibility of winning a fortune.  To whom will advertising the possibility of winning a fortune mean most, but to those who have nothing. They are the people who see no way out, no escape from their own misery, and the prospect of winning a fortune will appeal most to them.  Those of us who have a reasonably comfortable life style will not risk our income on the prospect of making a fortune because we are reasonably all right the way things are.  We can complain and grumble but our children do not go hungry.  We have reasonable housing and access to many services.  But people who have none of those things can easily be led into believing that this is the way out.</P>
    <P>The Canadian newspaper documents people who have done extraordinary things.  It mentioned the sort of advertising where the woman whose number came up the one week she had not bought <Col N="2064" /> a ticket is identified as what can happen if you do not buy your ticket every week. Appeals to people's sense of being oppressed, isolated or alone, are the traditional standard techniques of television advertising.  Advertising is not some sort of detached profession.  It operates on the level of people's weaknesses, fears and needs.  It is a highly sophisticated business based on the best available analysis of people's psychological needs.  That is the kind of advertising that will be used here. It is one thing to use it in newspaper advertising, which does not have the same person to person impact, but to use it in television advertising, which is recognised to be the most effective and to have the highest impact, is a danger in itself.  The best way to work out the impact of television advertising is to look at the rates they charge.  They are enormous. One would pay up to £10,000 for a slot on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Where do you think the national lottery are going to go looking for their slot? It will not be on a late night television discussion in the Irish language.  It will be on those programmes which have the maximum audience ratings.  They will include programmes like the news and &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, programmes which are not by any means watched exclusively by mature adults, capable of making free decisions who are the only persons entitled to purchase tickets in the national lottery.</P>
    <P>I would be happier to have section 22 of the 1956 Act remain in force, because that was a reasonable and sensible provision. My view about alcohol, cigarette smoking and, for that matter, one soft drug, is that the best way to deal with all these things is to legalise them and prohibit all forms of advertising of them. Gambling fits into that category.  It should not be permitted to be advertised because it has at best a neutral role in society, and probably a destructive role. I find it astonishing that we cannot advertise something sensible, useful and practicable &mdash; such as contraceptives &mdash; on television because of moral scruples, but we can advertise something as potentially <Col N="2065" /> lethal and devastating to many families as the national lottery on television. Because of that, because the wisdom contained in the 1956 Act was based on commonsense, and because of the sort of advertising which is going to be used in a television campaign about this national lottery.  I propose that no notice or announcement concerning the national lottery other than what would be normal news or other reporting shall be broadcast on radio or television.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of Senator Ryan's amendment.  At this late hour of night I will not go over all the things which he has said, but basically I agree with him. I re-emphasise that gambling is very much an addiction.  Some people can gamble a little bit and not be addicted to it, just as some people can drink normally without being addicted to that.  Some people can smoke a few cigarettes without being addicted to tobacco, but we have taken a good deal of care to claw our way back to exercising control over advertisment of other addictive things, such as cigarettes and alcohol.  We have tried to cut down on advertising these, and it seems ridiculous that we should have every available persuasive form of advertising to promote gambling.  I agree with Senator Ryan that it is destructive to family life.  I have known a number of cases where a wife may be desperately trying to hold on to the family home as the last thing that is left that has not been gambled away.  It is all very well to say this will only be a small amount of money and so on, but these things start in a small way and work themselves upwards.  I support the idea of leaving the situation as it was under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, and I support Senator Ryan's amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot support the amendment that Senator Brendan Ryan has put down.  If we are to have a national lottery &mdash; and it is obvious we are &mdash; then there must be some element of advertising and the best way to advertise is on radio and television.  Senator Ryan said <Col N="2066" /> that that was a childrens' medium, and certainly we agree with that.  On that we must make the point that advertising for this lottery must and should be at adult viewing time on television.  I would not expect people responsible for the running of the national lottery to have television advertisments during the middle of programmes like &ldquo;Bosco&rdquo; and childrens' programmes generally, because people under 18 years of age cannot buy tickets. Therefore, that advertising would have to be at the peak adult viewing time.  I accept Senator Ryan's strong commitment and I know he is concerned, but I must say that if we are to have a successful national lottery then there must be an element of advertising of it on radio and television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent Senator Fallon has given the kind of reply which is necessary on this point.  I fail to appreciate the purpose of this amendment. The effect would be to restrict not only advertising but the dissemination of information about the lottery.  Such a restriction would be one-sided and totally discriminatory against RTE.  The lottery will be run on proper business lines and to place a limitation of this kind on it would be totally unrealistic.  Surely we intend the lottery to be successful and not hampered from the outset.  Implicit in this proposal is a suggestion that the lottery will somehow be a danger to the public.  I do not accept this.  We have covered that ground in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, in any event, ample powers in the Bill to enable the Minister to take action by way of directive under section 29, for example, if concern arises about the operation of the lottery.  This would include the subject of excessive or tasteless promotion, which I am sure the good sense of both An Post and RTE will avoid in any event.  On this point I conclude by saying that lotteries, as I mentioned earlier, are being run in over 80 countries, an indication of their success and their acceptability.  It is correct that there have been some changes in policy in Canada, but international comparisons are best obtained by looking at the general rather <Col N="2067" /> than the specific.  We Irish are no better or worse than other people.  We as a people have sufficient maturity to cope with a national lottery in the same way as the people in the west, in the EC, in Australia, China, and North America.  I do not put us in any different category. From that point of view I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I suppose the honest answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I do not understand why we have accepted that we should not advertise spirits on television.  We have a large industry manufacturing gin, whiskey and all other spirits for sale to large numbers of the public.  We decided because of the potential damage that alcohol abuse can do to people to prohibit advertising of that form of alcoholic drink on television.  We decided that that is somehow acceptable.  We discovered then that cigarette smoking was very damaging to people's health, not damaging, incidentally, to families.  People do not beat up their wives because of cigarette smoking.  They damage themselves by it and that presumably produces a follow-on effect; but they do not leave their children with very little because of cigarette smoking.  However, we decided because of the damage it does that we will prohibit the advertising of cigarettes on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a proven threat to many families.  Gambling has destroyed very nearly as many families as alcohol has. We have decided that we will suddenly turn the whole thing on its head and say it is OK to advertise gambling on television.  We have never done it before. We do not allow bookies to advertise on radio or television; we do not allow the tote to advertise on radio or television; and then, all of a sudden, we see a lottery <Col N="2068" /> being run by the State which is going to produce relatively small sums for certain organisations to benefit from, and our whole philosophy about drink, cigarette smoking and other forms of gambling is turned on its head and we say that this is OK.  I am not being illogical.  I am being consistent with the general thrust of public policy.  It is this legislation that is inconsistent with every other area of public policy in these areas.</P>

      <P>Gamblers Anonymous, Canada in the <i>Toronto Star</i> in October 1984 said that it is a destructive force, a dangerous thing when a man who cannot afford to give up $5 is spending $20 to $25 to buy dreams.  It went on to say that you see them standing out in front of lottery shops and that you do not see any Cadillacs pulling up.  Gamblers Anonymous are the equivalent among gamblers of Alcoholics Anonymous.  That is authorative enough for me.  Gambling, particularly national lotteries, are a threat. They represent another form of dangerous addiction.  We are now allowing one form of dangerous addiction to be advertised while, at the same time, quite rightly prohibiting other forms of addiction to be advertised.  Why is this addiction a lesser risk than others?  It is because we feel it is less of a risk.  The evidence from our own and other societies is that gambling damages people, vulnerable people in particular.  It would be one step to prevent that by not allowing this lottery to be advertised on television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 33 is a most extraordinary provision to put into this legislation.  The purpose of this legislation is to provide for a national lottery.  In effect, section 33, and in particular subsection (1) provides that section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act shall not apply to any lottery held pursuant to sections 27 and 28 of the 1956 Act.  The effect of that is that any licensed lottery will in future be able to advertise whereas traditionally there has been a strict regulation of the way in which lotteries could actually advertise.  Bingo would be an example of a lottery.  Members will be aware that in the various crazes for bingo, generally bingo has not been advertised, and if it has, it has been advertised in a way which was trying to overcome the restrictions imposed by the 1956 Act. Such advertisements were worded, for example, &ldquo;special attraction tonight&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;bingo&rdquo; was not used as it was not allowed.  Even these advertisements were held to be against section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister proposes to do which is quite unnecessary &mdash; and this is separate and distinct from what he proposes to do with regard to the national lottery &mdash; is to allow other lotteries advertise where they were not allowed to advertise before.  I do not know what the position is in relation to radio and television.  But leaving aside radio and television, let us take newspapers, for example.  From now on it is not only the <Col N="2070" /> national lottery that will be entitled to advertise in newspapers, but every other lottery which is licensed.  That is a fairly fundamental change, a lot more fundamental than just advertising the national lottery &mdash; and I have great hopes that that will be a disaster.  There are many other lotteries which will be successfully organised and I do not want to have those advertised in newspapers.  It is not good for us or helpful that they should be advertised in newspapers.</P>
    <P>The enthusiasm of An Post will deal with the national lottery.  The most constructive thing the Minister has done to advance my point of view on the lottery is to give control of it to An Post.  In those circumstances I am not very concerned about advertising the national lottery. What I am extremely concerned about is that we propose to change the law in relation to any other lottery in the country. What is the sense of that?  Why are we doing it, and what business has it in this Bill?  If I can put an amendment like this into a Bill like this, even if I did add something to the short title and other related matters, it would be ruled out of order and correctly so by the Cathaoirleach on the basis that it was not relevant. What relevance has it?  What is the necessity for allowing every other lottery in the country to advertise just because we are introducing a national lottery?  It is absolutely crazy.  I do not understand why it is necessary to do so and I do not think the other House or the general public properly appreciate the very fundamental change which it is proposed to make in the law as a result of the introduction of section 33 (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, if I make a rather crude quote from the same article of October 1984 from a lecturer in a third level institution in Canada about this whole issue:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Gambling is like drinking, copulating and driving fast cars.  I will fight for everyone's right to do these things but it is a shabby and distasteful business <Col N="2071" /> when governments cajole us to do more of them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are not quite getting to the stage where the Government are cajoling us to do more of them, but let us not forget that subsection (1) cannot be taken on its own because we will not have the small-scale little lotteries with many maximum prizes of £300 or £500 referred to in the 1956 Act because the Minister will have the right to alter the amounts specified. So we are liable to have not just a national lottery but a huge number of other lotteries offering increased prizes on a scale that none of them had dreamt about a year or two years or five years ago.  All of these will be competing for people's money.  Again the consequence will be that more money will be spent on lotteries, between the national lottery and the private lotteries &mdash; and of course the reason for this section is to redress the grievance of many of the existing runners of lotteries which are a very different kind of lottery from the one that is envisaged here that they would be at an unfair disadvantage.  To reverse it and avoid all sorts of double negatives, they felt the national lottery would have an unfair advantage by being the only one allowed to advertise, and this was put in.  So, in order to redress a grievance against the national lottery we will have all the lotteries advertising and the country will be swamped with advertising of various forms of lotteries which will mean different things because they are referred to in different items of legislation.  But all of this will be an inducement to people to spend more money on something which, when we wear our other hats and pronounce our moralistic conclusions, we would regard as deplorable.  I have heard most people I know tut-tut about the scale.</P>
    <P>When the Minister mentioned the figure of £212 million a year being consumed by off course and on course betting, many of the Members of this House around me were very visibly taken aback at the scale of gambling that goes on in <Col N="2072" /> this country already.  We are now allowing one form of gambling under the national lottery and another yet to be specified quantity of another form of gambling, which is the private lotteries, to be advertised to compete with each other, to compete with all other forms of consumption, and we will swamp the country not in £40 million a year but probably in twice that amount between all the lotteries.  We are doing this without really being prepared to consider the possibility that it might do some serious damage.  Section 33 compounds the damage that section 32 is already going to do.</P>

      <P>It is proper in a democracy that the Government should be responsive to cares and concerns that are expressed to them.  This section is a response to just such cares and concerns as were expressed very strongly to them by a wide variety of bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the announcement of the national lottery while many voluntary organisations did not express outright opposition, they expressed concern.  We invited them to talk to us.  Some of the bodies who came to see us and who expressed concern were the Federation of Voluntary Charitable Organisations which is an umbrella group for ten of the larger charitable lotteries including the Rehabilitation Centre and the CRC, the Union of National Charities League and Enterprises, an umbrella group representing about 90 smaller charities, the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped which is an umbrella group representing 38 charitable organisations, the Gaelic Athletic Association, Muintir na Tíre and other bodies virtually all of whom are doing excellent work.  Among the cares and concerns they expressed was fear that there would be an adverse effect on their funds because of the national lottery and in many instances specific proposals were forthcoming. Two of the specific proposals related to increasing the prize limits prescribed by the 1956 Act and removing the restrictions on advertising.  It is quite proper for us to respond to those concerns and that <Col N="2073" /> is what we are doing in this section.  We are removing the restriction on advertising as requested and we are additionally raising the prize limits as specified in the 1956 Act.</P>
    <P>It was quite proper for us to respond to those concerns and that is what we are doing in this section.  We are removing the restriction on advertising as requested and we are, additionally, raising the prize limits as specified in the 1956 Act.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, the present limit for a lottery under Garda permit is £300.  The proposal is to increase that to £3,000.  The limit for a lottery under licence in the District Court is £500 and it is proposed to increase that to £10,000. What we are doing here is responding to specific suggestions from a very big number of very responsible organisations.</P>

      <P>He named the body in which I am interested and I want to correct an impression he gave.  Among the voluntary organisations for the mentally handicapped of this nation, there is a group with whom I have had 21 years service.  I do not think that they talked to the Minister or to his officials asking to be allowed to advertise.  Their absolute and deep concern was that in this small country of ours there is only a certain amount of money.  Because I am so familiar with this case, I know the type of money that I need in the Clare federation to man the schools and the workshops.  It is in a very small way like the Cork polio group.  I have a concern, as an executive member of that particular voluntary organisation and when I use the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; I mean it absolutely.  There is no payment.  There is only a certain amount of money.  An organised lottery such as envisaged in this Bill before us here this evening will, I have no doubt, <Col N="2074" /> take some of the money that went into organisations such as the one I chair.  I wanted to put that on record because I know how worried that organisation are.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary's remark about whether the lottery would be a success was interesting.  I am not going to delay the House now having regard to the length of time which has been given to this legislation but because of my closeness to that problem and my long service with it, I would ask that the record be corrected. It is our deep concern that we will not receive the money after this legislation is passed that kindly and voluntarily is being given to us now.  We will not have the cashflow.  I speak from absolute experience of dealing with big money and running workshops and schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is most unsatisfactory.  His proposal to increase the maximum prize money from £300 to £3,000 and from £500 to £10,000 represents a dramatic change of policy. To increase twenty fold the amount of prize money which can be made available as a result of an application to the District Court is totally wrong.  First, it is wrong that the Minister should take on to himself the power to change it from time to time.  That was not intended in the original legislation.  He is now taking permanent power to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it is also totally wrong that the whole question of advertising has not been faced up to.  The Minister did not answer my question.  Will they be able to advertise on radio and television and if they are, what will that do to our television? We are going to have the national lottery and we are going to have other organisations whoever they may be, advertising £10,000 prizes?  This is going to have an effect which far outweighs what the Minister envisages and certainly far outweighs what was appreciated during the early stages of the discussion of this legislation.  For the Minister to say that he intends to abolish section 22 and to do it in this kind of backhanded way without looking in a most fundamental way at the gaming and lottery legislation, which is what is required if any adjustment <Col N="2075" /> is made, is quite unacceptable.  I must repeat my question to the Minister: will lotteries, in addition to the national lottery be able to advertise on radio and television?  We know the national lottery will and I am not arguing that point but will other lotteries also be able to advertise on radio and television?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point raised by Senator Honan and the excellent work being done by the body to which she referred.  However, the changes proposed in this section arose out of discussions, between officials of my Department and the Department of Justice and a big number of voluntary organisations, as a response on our part to various suggestions and proposals that developed in these discussions.  The concern of the voluntry bodies as to the possible effects on their own fund raising, in particular funds raised by lottery under existing legislation was shown.  Different points were raised by different bodies. Quite a number of discussions took place with many bodies, but coming from quite a number of them were requests to raise the limits and to remove the restriction on advertising.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific point raised by Senator O'Leary, if we remove the restriction on advertising we do so, full stop.  The question of whether advertising on RTE will be indulged in separately by any charitable lottery is an entirely different matter and one for decision by the promoters of such charitable lotteries. I imagine the vast majority are on such a small, local scale that there will be no such question.  Perhaps some of the bigger ones might feel the expense justified. That will be a decision that will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What we do is establish the legislative position.  As to the practical consequences they will be a matter for the bodies concerned.  Bearing in mind the kind of costs that are involved in advertising on television, I envisage that charitable bodies will want to focus their funds as far as possible on the object of their charity.  I have introduced this section in response to requests from many of these organisations.  This is the proper response on our part.  What will follow will be a matter for the organisers of the charitable lotteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously concerned about the representations and the views conveyed to him by various deserving charitable organisations.  Their problem was that the promoters of the national lottery were to be allowed advertise their huge prize fund.  Their natural response was to insist on similar rights for themselves.  The sensible way given the inherent threat that gambling poses to many of our traditional values &mdash; to use the type of language that is very popular here &mdash; particularly to the value of family life and the capacities of families to live together as a unit, would have been to prohibit the national lottery from advertising and let it sell itself in the way that all other lotteries have sold themselves, that is by word of mouth over the years.  Instead, we will have our television and radio absolutely swamped with gambling advertising.  The national lottery is going to be a big budget organisation with a lot of money at its disposal.  The figure I quoted was from Ontario, but at 3 per cent of income we would be talking of at least £1 million to £1.5 million a year on advertising.  That is big money and it is going to make a big difference.  It represents about 3 per cent or 4 per cent of RTE's current advertising budget and it will be concentrated in certain areas at certain times.  We will have all the voluntary organisations working as groups and if they are going to be talking about <Col N="2077" /> prize funds of £10,000, they will be talking about advertising budgets which enable them to sell the numbers of tickets in their lotteries to pay for that sort of prize fund.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Leary quite rightly said, this will open up a whole area which was restricted under the 1956 Act because people recognised in 1956 the potential damage it could do.  Nothing has happened in Irish society since to suggest that it will not do the same sort of damage that was obviously anticipated by the people who introduced the 1956 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Minister, so that he will be under no misapprehension, that I do not support this section.  It is a retrograde step.  It is shameful to bring in such a section.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself because he does not understand the effect of what he is doing.  He does not appreciate it.  The Minister did not know, until I suggested it to him on Second Stage, whether bingo was covered.  That is the scale of the investigation which has gone into this problem.  It is shameful that so determined are we to run a national lottery that we are going to sweep away the kingpin of the 1956 legislation so as to allow other people feel that they have some prospect of entering into meaningful competition with the national lottery. My primary concern is not to so change the character of the society in which I live.  Relative to the Gaming and Lotteries Act I am quite satisfied with this environment.  I do not want to change it.  I do not want more gambling because I do not think gambling will be to the long term benefit of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind having a national lottery. It does not upset me too much.  However, if the price of having a national lottery is to open up every other lottery here to increased prize money of up to £10,000, a twentyfold increase, and to allow each and every lottery to advertise on local radio, television or in the newspaper, depending on what it can afford, I do not think it is justified.  I do not think the Minister is justified in coming in here with this obnoxious section which he does <Col N="2078" /> not understand.  He has no appreciation of the fundamental change it is going to bring to Irish society.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is in the interests of our people to permit advertising of lotteries.  I am ashamed to be associated with section 33 because it is an obnoxious section.  It is ill-thought out, ill-conceived, not properly researched and has been introduced in response to requests which, to say the very least about those are vague.  I have no doubt that there were problems associated with the introduction of the lottery.  I received no such representations from any organisation to increase the prize money or to allow advertising.  What the Minister is proposing to do is shameful and I do not support it.  I cannot and I will not support it.  I do not see why we should allow such a fundamental change in our legislation.</P>
    <P>I can assure Members that I am not going to go personally to the barricades on this but I appeal to Members on all sides &mdash; there is no point in addressing Fianna Fáil Members only; my remarks are directed at Members on our side &mdash; not to allow this legislation go through. It is not in the long term interests of the people we are here to serve.  I have no doubt that the implications of this section have not been properly teased out and that the Minister or his Department do not understand the significance of what they are proposing.  I accept that I may well be exaggerating the significance of this but we are taking a jump into the unknown which I consider to be quite unjustified.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that once this Bill is enacted in a few days time, advertising will be permitted forthwith in respect of lotteries.  It will not have to wait for the change in the regulations made under subsection (2).  I hope the Minister will accept the responsibility for that because I will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I had not expected such steam and thunder about this section.  I have a letter from the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped which specifically refers <Col N="2079" /> to this section going part of the way to addressing their special problem.  I mention that by way of reiterating that what we are doing is by way of response to representations received from a large variety of very responsible organisations. There are two aspects to this.  First, the amount of the prize money, is £10,000, an increase from £500, the limit 30 years ago.  The figure 30 years ago related approximately to the price of a car.  It was considered that it was appropriate to offer a car as a prize in a lottery.  In real terms the figure of £10,000 is no greater. I understand that if one examined the inflationary position since 1956 the increase would not allow for inflation over the 30 year period.  What is the fuss about this item?  Surely it is unrealistic that private lotteries should not be able to operate with the same real level of prize money as in 1956.</P>
      <P>In relation to the removal of the advertising restriction, a number of organisations asked us to agree to relax the existing ban.  Some of the remarks made by my friend, Senator O'Leary, were perhaps a little bit extreme.  This Bill will not make any major or dramatic change in Irish society.  I do not envisage a huge amount of advertising on radio and television as a consequence.  It will probably be quite minimal.  The decision in this regard, while it was made in response to representations from some of these bodies, was not made in a hasty fashion. The Gaming and Lotteries Act has been under discussion in the Department of Justice for some time.  Many calls have been made in recent years for the updating of this legislation.  Obviously there has been close consultation between my Department and the Department of Justice in the preparation of this provision. It is proper that, after due consideration, there should be a response from the Government to representations from established, recognised and very worthy bodies who have requested this change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to counsel the Minister not to regard the Department of Justice as a source of great wisdom on <Col N="2080" /> the issue of gaming and lotteries.  It was on the advice of the Department of Justice that the Government, less than 12 months ago, proposed to amend the whole area of gaming machine legislation. There was almost agreement between all the parties in Dáil Éireann to introduce and rush through legislation which would have dramatically changed our gaming legislation but for the vocally expressed concern of many groups outside the Houses of the Oireachtas who inculcated some wisdom into all of us about the potential damage from gaming.</P>
      <P>I regret, yet again, that the same vocal lobby did not get itself organised on this issue.  This issue, just like gaming machines will do all sorts of damage. There are more implications for the quality of life in our society in this legislation than ever there were in the blessed Family Planning Bill which we debated for hours and hours and on which we got lecture after lecture on morality and about the threat to young people from something they were perfectly familiar with.  We are about to turn on its head, with these two sections, the whole philosophy of our society on gaming and lottery simply to convenience the national lottery which we are told will contribute about £10 million to various worthy causes.  For the sake of something less than 0.1 of 0.1 of 1 per cent of Government expenditure, we are going to turn the entire philosophy and policy that we have operated as a community entirely on its head.  It is an ill-conceived idea.  It has profound implications for our society.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in what Senator O'Leary said, in his characteristically strong language, that I would not agree with.  This legislation contains implications which the Minister may wish to tell us are not true.  Gambling is a problem on the scale of drink and drugs.  To pretend otherwise is to ignore the issue. That is what we are trying to do.  To face up to the issue raises implications about this Bill which would necessitate its being suspended and the whole issue being reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I accept the comments of <Col N="2081" /> Senator O'Leary and Senator Brendan Ryan.  I do not know where they have been for a long time.  Down in the country draws, raffles and lotteries of all descriptions are being run by everybody and anybody for prizes far in excess of the limits being placed by the Minister in this Bill.  They are being run by political parties and clubs with confined membership to solicit support for various worthy projects.  Quite an amount of money has been collected for projects. No matter what the Gaming and Lotteries Acts said, people found ways around them by allowing them to be confined draws, draws confined to membership, to supporters of members or otherwise.  That is the reality.  I have not seen any evidence of widespread uncurable gambling in rural Ireland although tremendous prizes have been offered by various people.  Churches produce motor cars as prizes when trying to raise funds for buildings.</P>

      <P>Extraordinarily enough, those are the people who preach morality. They use this method to get money to build churches, extend schools and so on.  I respect the views expressed by the two Members on the morality of it.  The reality is that other things are happening. People have found ways of getting around the small prize money that has been allowed by law up to now and have had all sorts of internal draws, lotteries, small gambles, 45 drives, and so on, to eke out funds for voluntary organisations and political parties.  They have been doing so for a number of years.  I do not know if that is a bad or a good thing, but it has been happening and I do not see that this legislation will alter it in any material way.  I have to have regard to the fact that people have made submissions to the Minister and his Department on this section.  They feel under threat if the lottery is to be given <i>carte blanche</i> and the special privilege of having prize funds <Col N="2082" /> which could be decided by An Post and they could advertise on any medium available to them.  Anybody else who wanted to run similar draws for charitable purposes could not do likewise.  We should have one standard for everybody. At least Senator Ryan has been consistent. He has looked for one standard for everybody.  Other people think it is all right for the national lottery but should not be allowed for anything else.  I do not follow that logical argument but I respect the people who use it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 36 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>36.&mdash;(1)  Every five years the Minister shall carry out and publish, or shall cause to have carried out and published, using funds provided under section 5 (2) of this Act, a study of the operation of the National Lottery.  This study shall seek to determine what if any deleterious social consequences have resulted from the operation of the National Lottery.</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding the generality of this section, the study shall endeavour to identify the effect, if any, of the operation of the National Lottery on family incomes.</P>
      <P>(3)  If, having considered the results of such a study under this section, the Minister is satisfied of the serious deleterious social consequences of the National Lottery, he shall terminate any existing licence within two years and no further licence shall be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had quite a long discussion on this Bill.  The Minister and I have not agreed on much of its contents but he has conceded that there is at least some uncertainty about the social consequences. He said there was no conclusive evidence to suggest that national lotteries <Col N="2084" /> had a negative or deleterious effect on families, on lower income group families in particular.  He agreed that the evidence was unclear.  However the Minister did say that in at least one major western country, Canada, at federal level the whole question of lotteries was being reexamined. My understanding is that national lotteries in Canada, at federal level, were being terminated because of opinions being expressed about what they did to the poor, that they were effectively an indirect tax on the poor.</P>
    <P>We are aware that gambling is a problem in our society.  Our present attitude to gambling is similar to our attitude to drink of about 20 years ago, that drink and its associated problems were a kind of a good man's fault, that one might throw one's hands up in horror and outrage if a man was unfaithful to his wife, but if he drank three quarters of the family income every week, that was somehow less of a fault, that that was what people used to describe as a good man's fault.  I should say that I am fond of both gambling and drink.  Therefore I am not speaking from a position of moral superiority.  In fact I am quite fond of most of the vices in life to the extent that I have an opportunity to practise them.  Nevertheless it is a fact that all of these areas do carry the threat of negative social consequences.  It is equally true that it would be wrong to expect the State to fund any research into the extent of these consequences.  I happen to believe that the drink industry should be required to fund considerable research into all areas of alcohol-related social damage.  I happen to believe the cigarette industry should fund research into tobacco-related areas of damage.  The consumers of drink and cigarettes, who pay the tax, are the people who fund these things.  I happen to think they should be financed, as the Minister for Health is proposing to do in the case of cigarette advertising, out of levies on the companies rather than levies on the consumers. Consequently it seems to me a very reasonable proposal to suggest, as I have suggested in this amendment, that we should undertake in this Bill to carry <Col N="2085" /> out a review, on a regular basis, of the possible social damage resulting from a national lottery.  I have proposed that the Minister should initiate a study of the operation of the national lottery every five years, the results of which should be published.  That is the only way to ensure that a reasonably detached decision can be taken on the evidence of such a study. I emphasise in the amendment that this study should be funded out of the proceeds of the national lottery because that is the proper way to fund it.  The last sentence of the first paragraph of the amendment reads:</P>
    <P>This study shall seek to determine what if any deleterious social consequences have resulted from the operation of the National Lottery.</P>
    <P>In order not to be accused of being excessively vague I put in a separate subsection that requires that the study shall endeavour particularly to identify the effect, if any, of the operation of the national lottery on family incomes.  That is the effect about which most of us will be concerned.  Paragraph (3) of the amendment states:</P>
    <P>If, having considered the results of such a study under this section, the Minister is satisfied of the serious deleterious social consequences of the National Lottery...</P>
    <P>That leaves considerable discretion to the Minister.  It is not some sort of catchall destruction of the national lottery.  It leaves the Minister discretion to study the effects of the operation of the national lottery on our society, to study what possible damage it may have done.  If the Minister is then satisfied that the consequences are sufficiently serious he shall terminate any existing licence within two years and no further licence shall be issued.  The Minister currently has the right, under the Bill as it stands, to terminate a licence.  Under present legislation he has no method, objective or otherwise, of determining what damage the lottery may have done.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister can concede that there is no certain evidence, that the <Col N="2086" /> matter is unproven, that we cannot insert some provision to study the consequences here.  It is far too bland.</P>
    <P>We are now aware, after many years of trying to ignore it, of the consequences of alcohol abuse here.  We also ignored drug abuse until it became an epidemic. We ignored the abuse of tobacco for a long time until the evidence was rammed down our throats.  Are we now going to repeat this apparent head-in-the-sand attitude until somebody else documents the destructive effects of something like the national lottery and the multiplicity of lotteries that will be beamed at us from our television screens?  Will we wait until the evidence is overwhelming?  Why can we not ascertain the evidence as part of the operation of the lottery and ascertain the consequences?  So be it if I, Senator O'Leary and others are proven totally wrong.  At least the Minister present will be vindicated in his assertion that the lottery will do no harm.  If he is so confident why can he not agree to this study? It will not cost the State anything.  It should constitute a minimal response to the deep concern of a number of us in this House and of people in other countries about the impact of national lotteries on lower income group families.</P>

      <P>I am not necessarily opposed to the type of study envisaged in this proposal.  However, I do not see the need to incorporate it in a mandatory way in the Bill.  The amendment appears to assume that, to use the Senator's phrase, deleterious social consequences are inevitable.  This has not been the experience of other countries where national lotteries are in operation.  Such evidence as exists points in the direction of there being no deleterious social consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very late to launch into a long speech, so I will not do so.  I want to talk about what is contained in this Bill.  I will observe strictly the Standing Orders of this House and will not talk about anything that I think should be in <Col N="2088" /> it but is not in it.  My only regret is that I did not get the opportunity earlier to study what was involved in this Bill.  What we are doing in this Bill is turning the entirety of our community's collective values about gambling on its head.  We are doing it in the face of evidence that gambling as it stands is a destructive thing.  This Bill is about the State extending its role in gambling even further.  We are going to allow a lottery to be run which can be advertised in a way that no other form of gambling in the history of the State could have been advertised.  We are going to do it on the rationale that, if you must have a national lottery, you must have advertising.  That is like saying that, if we have a national whiskey and gin industry, we must allow it to be advertised. We decided not to.  We have advertising, we have a national lottery and we have an estimated scale of prize funds which will result quite obviously in some people paying out far more than they could reasonably be expected to afford.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of section 33 every other lottery in the country will now have access to all of the legitimate media of communication which will further extend the perception of gambling.  One of the attractions of our society as it stood was that young people did not come into contact with gambling in their own homes. They were usually pushing on towards their teens or adulthood before they came into contact with gambling because they did not meet it in the medium that most young people, particularly children, see most which is television.  We have decided to change that and turn it on its head.  If this would produce enormous benefits for our society, it would be very worthwhile but from the figures which have been presented to us today we are not talking about £50 million or £100 million but about £10 million in the early stages being allocated from this lottery. That is not disputed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make £10 million available we are now turning on its head the entirety of healthy restrictions on gambling incorporated in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  It has been said, and from the evidence I have, this is a tax <Col N="2089" /> on the poor.  It will tackle those whose choices are most limited.  It will affect those whose hopes are most limited.  That is where it will be directed and that is the sort of advertising which we are now going to permit, which has been used in other countries.  It is the fantasies, fears and hopes of people who have no other hope of escape from their own situation which will be most exploited by the advertising. Let us be under no illusion: no amount of ethical committees will prevent that sort of exploitation taking place.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that this Bill would be amended in this House.  It is a great regret to me that because the other House is now in recess there is no realistic prospect of amendments being accepted.  Because reasonable realistic amendments did not appear to be acceptable, this Bill, as it stands, is not just a pleasant little flutter; it is a fundamental transformation of a series of values we have all taken for granted.  As I said on Committee Stage, it is a far more fundamental transformation of values than the Mickey Mouse Family Planning Bill we all agonised for so long over both in this and the other House less than two years ago.  This is a fundamental shift in moral values. It is the participation deliberately and consciously of the State in the extension, organisation, advertising and promotion of gambling through every organ and medium of the State.  If it was simply an attempt to syphon off the surplus of the already well-off in our society, I would say let them at it, but it will have the direct and opposite effect of further depressing the already appallingly low living standards of the poor in our society. Because of that, even at this late hour, I am not prepared to accept that this Bill should be passed.</P>

      <P>After a long debate we have come to the stage where it is time to make up our minds.  That time has come after many deliberations on the problems with which this Bill has confronted us.  I do not accept that the Irish people are as naive or as vulnerable to <Col N="2090" /> the evils of gambling as Senator Ryan suggested or that there will be a massive increase in gambling as a result of this Bill.  There will be certain problems associated with it.  I think it is very bad legislation.  The debate which has taken place on this Bill has shown that it is one of the worst pieces of legislation that has ever come into this House.  I sincerely hope the Minister will never again come into this House with a Bill as vague, as full of innuendo and possibilities, and lacking in thought as to the financial arrangements that will be made, as this Bill.  I hope we never again will have a Bill purporting to do one thing but which allows the Minister every option possible in the administration of the funds.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that a national lottery will help cultural activities such as the Irish language, health, sport and recreation whereas the Bill goes much further than that.  It can be used to fund any area a Minister decides he wants to fund. The Bill is a negligent piece of legislation. The Minister was negligent in the manner in which he introduced the Bill.  The Seanad has been negligent in allowing this Bill to be taken today.  We should never again allow legislation such as this to go through when there is absolutely no way the Minister can accept amendments because the Dáil is in recess.  We should never again allow any Bill to come into this House after the Dáil has gone into recess because we are fooling ourselves and fooling the public.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the Dáil and Seanad, if the Minister accepted an amendment here this evening, it could not be dealt with because the Dáil is in recess.  We should not use this House in such a cynical manner.  If the Seanad is to be relevant, amendments should be accepted by the Minister.  These amendments should go back to the Dáil but, of course, the Dáil will not sit again until 22 October, another national disgrace.  It is nearly as disgraceful as the Bill before us.  It is disgraceful that the Dáil has decided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the National Lottery Bill is applied properly &mdash; and the Bill does not give us an indication that it can be &mdash; maybe it can give extra funds to the sections of our community that badly need these funds. That might take away from them the onus of collecting moneys, as they have to do at present, rather than concentrating on providing the facilities that are needed for sport, recreation, the Irish language and culture.  The Bill is a flawed one.  It has gone through this House after a major contribution from a large number of Members, particularly on section 5. Before the Minister applies the regulations in the Bill he should sit down with the best advisers he can get to decide how section 5 can be organised so that the moneys that are purported to be going into the four or five items in the Bill will not be dissipated throughout the economy. If they are dissipated throughout the total economy the lottery will be of no use to anybody except the advertising companies, the 50 or 60 people who will be employed, An Post, who will be getting a small amount of money in fees, and anybody else who might be able to earn a few bob from selling tickets or whatever as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am extremely disappointed that this Bill, which could have such major implications for Irish society, was brought into this House in the manner in which it was during the busiest week of the year when the Dáil goes into recess.  It was brought in here last week with little opportunity for Senators who had other commitments to make a contribution on Second Stage.  I think it was a record week for meetings of the Oireachtas committees and other such meetings in winding up the Dáil sessions.  I will not make a Second Stage speech here now because the Cathaoirleach will not permit me, but I did not have an opportunity last week, nor did many of my colleagues.  Then we have the situation today, when we ourselves are winding up for the summer recess, of having to put through all Stages of a Bill which has <Col N="2092" /> probably got much less attention than many less serious Bills.</P>
      <P>I know every piece of legislation which we put through the House is important to somebody but I believe &mdash; I hope I am wrong and live long enough to say I am wrong &mdash; that this Bill will have implications across Irish society unrecognised by the general public today.  The implications are probably unrecognised by some politicians who have had a major hand in bringing the Bill forward.  I sincerely hope that we are not opening the floodgates with the provision in the Bill dealing with advertising.  It has been brought home to us that inadequate consideration has been given to this and other sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister earlier tonight made a comparison with the gambling habits of other countries.  I do not believe that such a comparison can be made because the Irish are a race apart.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope that we are not opening the floodgates with this provision regarding advertising, because certainly the section which provides for the advertising of the national lottery is extended to other organisations and associations, charitable organisations <Col N="2093" /> and anyone who has been in the business over the years of running such lotteries. Of course, they are going to avail of that opportunity in so far as the finances will permit them, although maybe not to the same extent as the national lottery will be advertised because I am sure we are going to get it on practically every envelope that we get through our letterbox, as well as through the normal channels or areas of the media such as the papers and the radio.  No doubt the other organisations will be pushed into a situation where they will have to do the best they can to keep up with that kind of barrage. If advertising means anything, of course the finances are going to flow in the direction from which the advertising is coming.</P>
      <P>I do not think a comparison can be made with the Irish people and with other European countries because we have a far greater habit of gambling than most other races, but thank heavens the vast majority of Irish people have been able to keep it under control.  There are those &mdash; Senator Ryan spoke about them in his speech &mdash; who cannot control their gambling and this is the section I would be concerned about.  If our fears are well founded, then I believe we have the wrong title on this Bill, that rather than call it the National Lottery Bill is should be termed the Irish Gaming Bill or the Irish Gambling Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully realise that there were representations over the years for the updating of the legislation concerning the control of lotteries.  Not only Ministers and Government Departments but those of us who have been in the political game for some time would have received those representations as well.  I am not so sure that the representations would have envisaged this kind of updating of the legislation.  I hope that the Minister will take seriously the points made here tonight on Committee Stage and that he will do the best he can with the Bill as it progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that we will not be back here in two, three or four years' time amending this legislation because of the harm it has done to Irish society.  As <Col N="2094" /> I said at the outset, I hope I am proved wrong, I hope that my fears will prove to be unfounded but those are my fears.  By way of a number of sections in this Bill, we are changing the whole of Irish society and the whole Irish scene with regard to gambling, something which has brought misery to many Irish families.</P>
    <P>We should have given far greater consideration to this, rather than rushing through a Bill of this nature.  Suggestions for a national lottery have been floating around for as long as I have been a Member of the Oireachtas and that dates back to 1970.  But despite that long period of years this Bill has been brought before us in this rushed manner.</P>
    <P>I hope that we do not live to regret the action we are taking tonight in passing this Bill.  Unfortunately, our hands are tied.  As well as the rushed nature of the legislation and the proposals before us today, our hands were tied in that we could not amend the Bill in any way.  It would have been tantamount to leaving Second Stage over from last week until after the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I am glad I was given the opportunity to express my fears.  It is the only opportunity I have had to speak on this Bill.  I regret that, and I regret that some of my colleagues have not had the opportunity to speak because of the manner in which it was brought before us.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with other Senators in saying that I deeply regret that the Oireachtas has decided to pass this Bill.  We have recently gone through a public debate in which many people have had a religious objection to something that has been proposed but have argued &mdash; from their point of view argued rightly, I have no doubt &mdash; that it would have a bad effect on general social welfare and the common good.  I can only say with regard to gambling and lotteries generally that I, and those who belong to my religious tradition, have an objection in principle to the promotion of lotteries. We feel that the promotion of lotteries is contrary to general social welfare and to the common good.  Our objection is as well justified and very much better documented <Col N="2095" /> than some of the other objections based on social welfare and the common good that have been put forward in the past few weeks.  Some of the things that Senator Ryan, other Senators and I have said show very clearly the threat to the common good posed by the introduction of a national lottery.  It has been pointed out by the Minister that some 80 other countries have national lotteries but the same might well be said of the subject matter of the recent referendum.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the details of the objections to the Bill which both Senator Ryan and I have raised and it is clear that Senator McMahon has objections to it also, as have various other people.  However, there has been no claim by either of the major parties in this House that Senators should be allowed a conscience clause to object to this because they feel, as Senator McMahon said, that it might open the floodgates to all sorts of undesirable social consequences. Apparently, this is not the sort of thing about which one is allowed to have a conscience clause.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the damage caused by addiction to gambling is causing very serious damage to society. It should be discouraged, not encouraged by the State entering into gambling and by the State promoting its own gambling by advertisement.  This is the State gambling with its own people's resources and lives.  We have a clause in the Bill which suggests this will not apply to anyone under 18 years.  Who is going to control this?  We have heard all sorts of discussions in this House and elsewhere about the difficulty of restricting the serving of alcoholic drink to people under 18 and we stayed in this House until 4 o'clock in the morning discussing the difficulty of controlling the supply of condoms to people who were under 18.  Who is suggesting for one moment that we will be able seriously to control the sale of lottery tickets to people under 18?  The idea that we are protecting people under 18 is not realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan has suggested that the Irish people are not vulnerable to this <Col N="2096" /> kind of thing.  I am rather inclined to agree with Senator McMahon, that we are possibly more vulnerable than many other people in the temptations of gambling. Those Senators who have voiced their objections to the Bill, in particular Senator Lanigan and the Members of his party and Senator McMahon who is exercising a right of conscience, should at this late stage vote against the Bill and try to prevent our country from sinking into a cheap form of raising money, however desirable the cause may be, by introducing this national lottery, a principle of which I deeply disapprove.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to make arising from the debate we have had relative to this legislation.  The first and most important point is that this Bill was introduced into the other House on 13 June 1986 and it was passed by the other House on 2 July 1986.  It is now 8 July 1986 and we propose to pass it. Legislation of such importance and of such potential social consequence should not be rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in that length of time, except in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Secondly, this House should consider carefully the point made by Senator Lanigan: whether it is appropriate for us at all to consider legislation while the other House is not in a position to consider amendments.  It places any Minister in an impossible position.  It makes a total mess of any consideration which we might want to give to legislation in a serious way.  There are those of us in this House who want to improve legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, this Bill was introduced by the Minister for Finance and he is ably represented here by the Minister of State. However, it makes a fundamental change to the Gaming and Lottery Act, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, not that of the Minister for Finance.  It is quite objectionable that such a fundamental change should be introduced under the sponsorship of the Minister for Finance while it is making a fundamental change in an area in which he has no competence, an area which is not under his control, and it is being <Col N="2097" /> tagged on to a Bill which is no concern of his.</P>
    <P>If this House has learned one thing, I hope it has learned from the consideration of this legislation what a charade it is to consider legislation in the absence of the other House; how unreasonable it is to expect, leaving aside the question of emergencies which may arise from time to time, that normal legislation should be passed in such a short space of time.  It does not allow time for proper debate which is a necessary part of the consideration of legislation. Debate not only in this House but outside this House is a necessary part of consideration of legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not without some significance that within the last 12 months and leading up to the end of a session, there was a proposal to change the Gaming and Lotteries Act in a very sudden and different way.  This is the second shortcut which has been taken in this area of legislation, and that is quite unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter very careful consideration I am totally opposed to this Bill and I will be unable to support it on Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senators for the lively interest they have shown in this measure. The Debate has been very interesting.  I have already covered comprehensively the various points raised, so I will confine myself to a few comments.  I respect but do not agree with Senator Ryan's viewpoint. To Senator Lanigan I reiterate that we are speaking about enabling legislation. The Government have already made and announced their decisions in regard to the operation of the lottery and the areas to benefit.  To Senator McMahon I say that I am genuinely sorry the parliamentary timetable did not permit lengthier discussions.  I understand Senator McGuinness's concern.  I wish to point out to Senator O'Leary that section 33 was introduced after full consultation with the Minister for Justice. It covered a lot of ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the national lottery will be <Col N="2098" /> an outstanding success and that the areas which are to benefit under section 5 will in the near future be in receipt of a surplus which will have a considerable impact on the development of sport, recreation, arts and culture and other areas mentioned in that section.</P>

        <i>The Irish Press</i> of Monday, 30 June 1986 contained an item <Col N="2099" /> under the heading &ldquo;Catholic Rule on Teachers Stays&rdquo;.  In the course of this report by Pat Holmes, <i>The Irish Press</i> education correspondent, remarks are attributed to Mr. Oliver Ryan, Chairman of the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, to the effect that a meeting had been sought with his organisation by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation to discuss a guideline to which the INTO had overwhelmingly objected at their annual conference last Easter.  The guidelines that were referred to were: (1) that teachers being appointed should be &ldquo;practicing Catholics&rdquo;, and (2) teachers should be &ldquo;committed to handing on the faith&rdquo;.  Mr. Ryan is quoted as going on to say that he felt that this issue was &ldquo;part and parcel of the fabric of the Catholic school&rdquo; and that this guideline &ldquo;will not be withdrawn under any circumstance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The two events that have taken place since I last raised this matter in Seanad Éireann have, therefore, been the statement by the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association just recently and the annual conference of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  I raised this matter on 11 December 1985 and on 5 June 1986 I raised a related issue regarding the patronage of schools.  A number of issues that I have raised have not been satisfactorily answered and I want to return to them now.</P>
      <P>Let me put the matter very simply. What is at stake is the constitutional right to teach, or to express and extend that right that, once one has met the criteria of professional training, competence and general suitability, one has the right to expect to be appointed to an assistant teachership position in the Irish national school system.  On 11 December 1985 the present Minister's predecessor again and again in her speech reported in the Official Report columns 869 to 876 volume 110, drew a distinction between appointment and qualification.  I quote her from column 872:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of all whole time <Col N="2100" /> appointments in national schools that the teachers must be qualified in accordance with the rules and my Department will not approve appointments for the purposes of the payment of salary unless these rules are observed.  The Senator may, therefore rest assured that my function as Minister in setting down minimum standards, is exercised to the full in respect of the appointment of teachers.</P>
    <P>I accept that.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister was interested in the qualification of teachers.  However, she went on to say:</P>
    <P>The procedure for the appointment of teachers and the means of selecting qualified candidates for appointments to posts in national schools is, of course, an entirely different matter. Following consultations with the patrons, boards of management were established in national schools in 1975, to replace individual managers in the carrying out of the functions vested in local management.  Among these functions is the appointment of teachers.  I would point out to the Senator that parents are on boards of management and parent representatives are members of the Catholic Primary Managers' Association.  There are two parents elected from the school to every board.  There is a parents' association in almost every school.  So there is a very definite and laid out role for parents in these functions.</P>
    <P>What the Minister did not state on 11 December 1985 is that there were two to three times the number of nominees on the board who were representatives of the patron, nor did she point out that one of the nominees of the patron would in fact serve as chairperson of the board or that the parents' selection process having been exhausted, at that stage the patron's nominees would be appointed.  That is the parents' involvement in relation to the running of the schools.  It is not the matter that immediately concerns me, but I repeat my question which I asked <Col N="2101" /> again on 5 June 1986: where is the statutory justification for the patron's power? Where is the statutory justification for the patron's position in the national school system?</P>
    <P>I have gone in search of this in all of the usual places &mdash; for example, in the document known as the <i>Boards of Management of National Schools, Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure.</i>  That document gives a description of functions which the Minister allocates to patrons.  It has no reference number, and pagination is not indicated.  In the first page it states very clearly that the patron is the person or body of persons recognised as such by the Minister for Education.  The patron may manage the school himself or may nominate a suitable person or body of persons to act as managers.  Subject to the approval of the Minister the patron may at any time resume the direct management of the school or may nominate another manager.</P>
    <P>This brings us circuitously to the point that is very much at issue which concerns the right to teach.  I am leaving aside another right at the moment, a right which I thought existed but which I now believe is not effective, the right to be trained as a teacher if you are not a member of a denomination.  In this country it is not possible to train to be a teacher if you are in that position, which makes its own comment on us.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Department of Education's primary branch, the Minister in November 1984 issued an additional document which changed paragraph 23 of the basic document, RR154660, governing the management of national schools.  An additional change was to lay out, as it does in pages 12 to 22, conditions for the appointments of teachers.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, I welcomed this from the then Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey.  It was a genuine attempt to eliminate sexism from the process of interviewing for appointments to posts, but there is a problem.  If all this is just addressed to the question of who is qualified, <Col N="2102" /> what factors influence the appointment of a teacher?  We are now facing conflict which is inevitable both in terms of the organised teaching profession and also of a constitutional kind as to which set of criteria will be implemented.  It will be possible for a teacher, for example, to go through the process of qualification but yet know that although all the qualifications have been met that is not a criterion for appointment.  The Minister may say he will ensure that nobody unqualified will be appointed but what about the 51 rules of the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association which their chairman said are not matters for negotiation.</P>
    <P>What is the teacher to say at the interview if asked if he or she is a practising Catholic or committed to handing on the faith?  Here instantly, I will list an issue which is illegal and unconstitutional. There is a reference in the question of the running of schools to the teaching of religion but there is no reference to the faith.  There are many people who believe that they can teach religion comparatively, teach it with respect as it should be taught, but it is a different question altogether to be asked if you are handing on the faith, and what faith are you speaking of?  How do people know if you are a practising Catholic?  Is it to be measured?  I will not repeat myself.  My views are clear from my remarks of 11 December 1985.  I asked if it was to be in terms of behavioural practice?  Is it to be in terms of religiosity?  If you saw a statue moving would it qualify for 15 years non attendance &mdash; without being too offensive?</P>
    <P>The next question that arises is in relation to what happens when the school numbers decrease and a teacher becomes redundant.  The redundant teacher, as the Minister acknowledged on 11 December 1985, can go onto a panel of qualified people but would have to go before an interview board and answer this question in the affirmative so you could find yourself, practising, lapsing and practising as the numbers went down only to lapse again if the numbers went down in the new school and so on.  It is <Col N="2103" /> an absolute absurdity and it would be absurd if it were not so offensive to a profession.  It also clearly indicates &mdash; I am used to the phrase &mdash; that we do not have State primary education which is what we pay our taxes to sustain.  We pay teachers' salaries, light, heating and so on, but we have accorded to some form of ancient ground landlords in relation to the schools, the right to establish what is and can be seen from all of this as sectarian education and I oppose it.</P>
    <P>People wonder what can be done. There is a concession which I liked when I was looking through this.  I have no great quibble with the two rules quoted by Deputy Hussey when she was Minister. Rule 68 on page 38 of the rules of the national schools under the Department of Education says that of all the parts of school curriculum religious instruction is by far the most important as its subject matter.  God's honour and service include the proper use of all man's faculties.  One could go on.  I need not quibble with this.  But this has been taken a step further and it has now been suggested that in interviews the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association will have nominees who can ask whether you are a practising Catholic and if you are committed to handing on the faith with all the other attendant questions.  People have been asked what form of family planning they practice, what other attitudes they have and so on.  This is very wrong, it has to end and we must grasp the nettle.  If people want denominational education let them have it, but those of us who are paying for a State primary system, for the training of teachers, and who want to see those teachers carry out their duties with professional competence equally have some rights.</P>
    <P>We faced issues like this a very long time ago.  I refer to the case of Miss Dunbar Harrison in Mayo who was appointed by the Local Appointments Commission as a librarian.  When she had opted to work in Mayo she was told that 24 out of the 26 members of the library committee would not have her.  She was a Protestant and a Trinity graduate.  Later <Col N="2104" /> someone said that it would be all right if she was handing out books but that she might recommend a book to somebody and no less a person than Mr. de Valera suggested that Mayo people were entitled to have someone they wanted handing books out to children.  I hoped we had come a long way since 1931.  We are now in 1986 with questions like this being pointed out.  Who are the people who advise boards of management and appointment boards, these vigilantes as I referred to them before?  How will you satisfy them?  Maybe you did not go to Church where they could see you?  Maybe you went in the city in the evening when you should have gone in the morning under their vigilance, but maybe you will do something that is much worse.</P>
    <P>You can sail into the interview and say, that you are practising Catholic, and committed to handing on the faith with all the assurance of cynicism and with all the damage that will cause to the teaching profession.  If we qualify people and if we have criteria for qualifications, we must accept the responsibility of not allowing the criteria of professional competence, ability and overall suitability to be frustrated by any other form of questioning.  I worry about this in circumstances where, for example, there will be vacancies, where teachers will have to apply for them and I am worried about the abuse of it by a kind of a spiritually prurient group of people who may say to someone who is a very spiritual person, who wants to teach science, who wants to teach comparative religion, that they are not practising in the way they mean practising.  We are allowing the law and the administration of education to sink into the gutter when we agree to that.  It is sectarianism straight and simple.</P>
    <P>I have four children attending national schools, one going to one denomination and three going to another and I would like them to be taught by someone who has respect for science and comparative religion.  I would respect that teacher a great deal more than someone who had to be intimidated into answering questions. I conclude by saying to the Minister &mdash; I repeated it to his Minister of State <Col N="2105" />&mdash; where and when did the people for whom the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association claim to speak hand over their rights under Article 42 of the Constitution?  I accept the Supreme Court distinction for the moment between the State providing for education and the State being the educator. Where and when did the parents of this State hand over to the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association their rights to educate their children as they exist in Article 42 of the Constitution? Where did they give that group of people the right to put questions like this into the mouths of interviewers?</P>
    <P>I am not a bit sorry that this is going on so late.  I am only sorry more people cannot listen to it because I think it is an extremely important matter.  It is a matter that will occur again and again.  I feel it is a shocking indictment to know that for the children of this country not only can they not go to pluralist education but that they cannot even get into the classroom where they will not be taught by someone who has had to answer questions like this from an unrepresentative, undemocratic body.  Who are these people, and what secret organisations of a Catholic kind are in their midst?  As we know very well, we have both Opus Dei and the Knights of Columbanus.  I object to these people sitting in judgement on qualified teachers that I and other parents want to teach our children.</P>

      <P>The Senator raised this subject here on 11 December.  My predecessor gave him a comprehensive reply.  She must have been talking to herself because it is quite clear that Senator Higgins has paid absolutely no heed to the fundamental points that she made in <Col N="2106" /> the course of her reply.  At the end of the speech he indicated he acknowledged the distinction in Article 42 which makes it very clear that the State, in our educational scene, provides for primary education, it does not provide primary education.  At the end of Senator Higgins' speech he acknowledged that distinction, but the entire theme of his speech was that the education system in the country is a State system of education.  It is a State-supported system of education, and this is a fundamental distinction of primary importance.  All Senator Higgins' difficulties flow from his inability to recognise that fundamental, obvious and long-standing distinction.  If Senator Higgins would only recognise it, he would then be able to avoid the excessive indignation that he has displayed here &mdash; genuinely felt I am quite sure, but based entirely on a false premise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who drafted the Constitution had to take into account the historical context of our whole system of national schools.  The reality is that the schools are not State-owned schools; they are schools which are aided and assisted by the State, provided they comply with certain criteria and conditions which are laid down on the Rules for National Schools.  The schools are managed at local level and the power of management is vested in the patron, who may manage the schools himself or may appoint a person or board of management to manage the schools on his behalf.  In the case of denominational schools &mdash; and this is not new to the Senator or to anybody in the House &mdash; the patron has with few exceptions in recent years been the ordinary of the diocese in which the schools are established.  Until 1975 the management was exercised on the patrons' behalf by an individual manager. In 1975 there was a change and the boards of management were set up.  Senator Higgins apparently does not like the format of the boards of management.  They probably <Col N="2107" /> do not go far enough in terms of parent representation.  But in 1975, for the first time, there was provision made for expanded boards of management, including elected representatives of the parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rules for National Schools lay down conditions for the payment of salaries to teachers and the operation of schools which are the subject of grant aid.  These rules, with regard to the appointment of teachers, deal with matters such as the professional qualifications and experience required for certain posts and the accompanying procedures may be derived in consultation with representatives of the patrons and the teachers' organisations. They cover such matters as the advertising of posts, composition of selection boards, the necessity to establish criteria for selection and observance of the Employment Equality Act and the relevant sections of the code of procedure of the Employment Equality Agency. While the rules do not lay down religious qualifications as such for teaching appointments in the schools, they recognise the right of management to refuse to accept a particular teacher on grounds of faith and morals.  The concern of school authorities with regard to the religious standing of the teachers and principals they appoint clearly derives from the denominational nature of the schools and from the fact that as well as teaching secular subjects the teachers are also teachers of religion and carry responsibility for the religious and moral development of the pupils under their care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the part of the motion which refers to a recent statement from the School Managers' Associations. I am sure the Senator is referring to the journal of the Catholic Primary Schools Managers' Association.  They set down the criteria, the professional and personal <Col N="2108" /> qualities which might be sought of applicants to ensure, in the view of that association, they they could properly fulfil the duties of their post.  We are talking about denominational national schools.  That is what we are talking about.  That is what we have here.</P>
    <P>On the question of rights &mdash; and the Senator's entire theme has been with regard to the rights of teachers to teach without any inquiry into other criteria, having regard to the fact that they are being recruited to teach largely in denominational schools &mdash; I would not have to remind the Senator that rights do not exist in isolation.  Within the reality of the national school system any concern for the rights of one group has to be considered in the context of the legitimate and, under the Constitution, inalienable rights of other groups.</P>

      <P>I do not know what world the Senators are living in.  We have in this country a system of denominational education.  The vast majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of schools in this country are denominational. That has been the historical position here and that is still the position. The rights of the parents who send their children to those schools include the right to ensure that in those schools the particular faith of the denomination to which they belong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you seriously suggesting it is the parents that want it? Grow up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;should be passed on to their children.  That has been the position. They are the rights that have to take precedence.  Where parents of a particular <Col N="2110" /> denomination send their children to schools of the denomination in question they have a right to expect that the religious and moral formation of their children will be reinforced both by precept and example.  That is the parents' right and that is what we have to consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Teachers also have rights. But in this context their rights are not absolute; their rights have to be subject to the rights of the parents and the pupils. Nobody could disagree with that proposition. It seems to me to be self-evident and valid <i>a priori.</i>  I might also make the point that in our educational system we have a number of different types of schools.  Senator Higgins has been calling in aid the concept of pluralism &mdash; a most complex and complicated concept capable of many applications.  There are many visions of what a pluralist state is and there are many ways in which people can interpret the word pluralism and apply it to whatever they want to apply it to at a particular point in their argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One vision of a pluralist State might be where State and Church functions are totally separated and where State aid for schools excludes both religious instruction and religious formation.  Another vision and equally valid might be one of multi-denominational schools where pupils of all denominations are educated together, with provision for separate religious instructions.  We have such schools here.  Where there is a demand for such schools there is provision for setting them up.  Yet another vision is one where schools organised on denominational lines exist together in respect and harmony and are separated in their educational efforts by a State which is scrupulous to ensure that all the schools <Col N="2111" /> are treated fairly and equally.</P>
    <P>We are the inheritors of a denominational system and I am not talking about any one denomination.  We are the inheritors of a denominational system for numerous denominations which have served this country well and I have no indication from any authoritative source &mdash; I say that without being in any way pejorative towards the Senator &mdash; and especially not from parents, nor from minority religions, that there exists any serious desire to have it radically altered. The system allows for and has assisted the development of multi-denominational schools where it has been established that there is sufficient parental demand to support a viable school.  The rules further ensure that the religious convictions of the parents of pupils <Col N="2112" /> attending all national schools are fully respected with regard to the arrangements to be made for religious instruction.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said to the Senator here tonight, taken in conjunction with what my predecessor said here as recently as 11 December 1985 at greater length and with more technical detail, fully outlines the principles under which the schools are conducted and under which teachers are recruited to posts within these schools.  May I conclude by saying that there is absolutely no demand, and no indication to me that there is the slightest wish on the part of the parents, to have any of the present procedures altered.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.35 a.m. on Wednesday 9 July 1986 until 10.30 a.m.</P>
