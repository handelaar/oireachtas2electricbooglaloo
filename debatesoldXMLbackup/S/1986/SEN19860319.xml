      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in that order.  No. 6 will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. It is proposed to have the usual break for tea from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is there any need to break for tea?  I do not understand the need for a tea break.  Some people suggest the reason is that some Senators want to go to their tea; the Senators who go to their tea would not be here anyway. I suggest that we do not break for tea.  It is only 2.30 p.m. now and if we cannot work until 8 p.m. it is a bad day's work. I do not think it would not be out of order to suggest that we run through from 2.30 p.m. until 8 o'clock.</P>
      <P>Agreed that there be no tea break.</P>

      <P>The position is not quite clear.  Normally we sit from 2.30 to 8.30 p.m.  The position about 2.30 to 10 p.m. is not quite clear.  It has become a little bit more confused now through doing away with the tea break.  We are dealing with Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  From 6.30 to 8 p.m. we will be dealing with the question of the Labour Party Motion or the Private Members' Motion.</P>

      <P>But last week and the week before that, the arrangement was that if the Government business was not finished, it carried on from 8.30 p.m.  Is there any chance that with the tea break gone we would get the Government business done and finish up with the motion?</P>

      <P>That is not what I meant. As the fellow said, do not confuse me with the facts.  I was hoping that we might get agreement that we would wind up; in other words if we are going to work an extra hour I do not see the necessity of carrying on right up to 10 o'clock.  We should try to get the Government business finished rather than have to come back to it after the Private Members' Motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take, or is it proposed to take, No. 20 before the Easter recess?  I was told last year that it was proposed to be taken before the Easter recess last year.  I think we are going to go through another Easter without it being taken.  If it is not going to be taken, is it going to be taken in the lifetime of this Seanad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have ordered is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Private Members' Motion No. 6.  While I am ordering Nos. 4 and 5 they may very well not be reached, but there is a possibility that they will be.  The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Lanigan, suggested that there would be no tea break.  That has been just a facility for Members, especially if there is a long Committee Stage Bill and a small number of Members are dealing with it.  It is a useful facility to give them a break but if it is thought that that is not necessary or desirable today, that is acceptable.  We quite agree.</P>
      <P>For tomorow, we will be ordering Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10 on today's Order Paper. Senator Cassidy asked about the situation of No. 20, the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1985.  I shall inquire about that and I will speak to Senator Cassidy.  On the question of the Order of Business for next week, as I understand it it is proposed to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday.  I have not got the file with me so I am not too sure exactly what is being ordered, but if the House desires I can indicate that when we resume after tea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 tomorrow.  It would <Col N="1432" /> seem to me as if Nos. 8 and 9 are not motions which have any immediate relevance to this House because the Vredeling Directive is not expected to go through the European Parliament.  It is not expected that it will see the light of day eventually anyway, whether it is discussed at the European Parliament later on or not.  Item No. 9 is one which has a certain relevance, but it has no immediacy, whereas there are other reports such as the one on acid rain which is of major import at present and the bilateral aid motion and since we are not taking Government Business, I would suggest that even Nos. 15, 17 and 18 would have more immediate relevance than Nos. 8 and 9 at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views expressed by Senator Lanigan to a certain extent but the organisation of the business involves consultation with the Ministers concerned.  However, I do not agree with his comments on the Vredeling report.  That is a excellent report and involved a lot of work by a very dedicated subcommittee of the joint committee.  It is there for quite a long while.  It is important that the House should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion one way or the other on that.  We have had consultations with the appropriate Department and I think it is there sufficiently long and that we should endeavour to take it.</P>

      <P>In relation to the tea break, could I just remind the House that the Joint Services Committee of which the vice-chairman is a Member of this House, have spent the last three years trying to control costs?  Their planning is based on the fact that most Members will have a specific time to eat there so as to try to curtail overtime and other expenses.  After three years we have brought in a great budget, so it is a consideration. It is taxpayers' money, with all due respect.</P>

      <P>The urgent need to the Minister for Education to sanction proposals for (i) the new school, Scoil Mhiceasmainn, Tralee, Co. Kerry, and (ii) the extension of Coolard National School, Listowel, Co. Kerry.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulation, 1986</P>
    <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 27th February, 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 3 of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may by regulations vary the income ceiling level which, taken in conjunction with the rate of health contributions applicable, determines the maximum amounts of contributions payable in respect of an individual in any particular contribution year.  Subsection 5 of section 9 of the Act of 1979 requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House deal with the income ceiling which, it is proposed, shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1986.  It is not proposed to vary the rate figure which has remained at 1 per cent since 6 April 1979.</P>
      <P>The income ceiling is at present £13,000 and it is proposed to raise this to £14,000 with effect from 6 April 1986. In determining this, I have taken into account, as required by the Act, the latest information available regarding changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling figure was adopted. The effect of the increased ceiling is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £130 to £140.  However, the increase will fall to be paid only by persons whose income exceeds £13,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that raising the ceiling level from £13,000 to £14,000 will result in an increase in the amount of contributions to be collected of approximately £2.1 million in the contribution year 1986-87. Of the estimated additional income, <Col N="1435" /> about £195,000 should arise in the calendar year 1986.  The remainder of the additional yield should be paid over in the first quarter of 1987.</P>
    <P>Regarding the eligibility level generally, I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free hospital consultants' services.  I am not in a position as yet to say what this limit will be.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are now responsible for collecting current health contributions from all classes including the farming sector.  Health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from the farming sector for periods up to 6 April 1984.  The total amount of health contributions owed to health boards at 31 July 1984 was £11.8 million. This amount was reduced to £9 million at 31 December 1985.  I am most anxious that these arrears and indeed arrears due from other self-employed persons should be collected as soon as possible and help to relieve somewhat the very tight budgetary situation in which we are now. In the case of arrears due to health boards, I have advised health boards to make full use of every enforcement procedure available to them in the collection of outstanding amounts.  In fact in recent months health boards have notified a number of defaulters of their intention to take legal action for the recovery of arrears.  Solicitors' letters have issued and some boards have selected cases for proceedings if demands are not met.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that in 1984 I introduced a regulation whereby any person who on admission to a public hospital bed fails to produce evidence of current payment of health contributions is liable for an additional charge of £100.  So far 154 persons have had to meet this charge and I propose to amend this regulation shortly to increase this penalty to £150.  I would stress that persons in arrears are not refused admission to hospital but the collection of the admission charge and arrears in pursued later.</P>
    <P>As an added incentive to health boards to collect amounts outstanding, I made regulations last year, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, which provided <Col N="1436" /> that health boards could retain in full arrears of health contributions collected by them in 1985.</P>
    <P>A total of £1.4 million health contributions arrears was collected by health boards in 1985.  In the normal way these contributions would have been credited to the Exchequer.  I wish to announce that I am extending this arrangement to cover all outstanding health contributions arrears collected by health boards in 1986 and future years.  This decision will be of continued benefit to the health boards' budgets.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1986, in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often wondered why the amounts go up per £1,000.  It was £13,000 last year and it was £12,000 the year before.  I am sure it has something to do with the benefits that accrue.  Perhaps the Minister might explain.  He has indicated to us that the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collecting the current health contributions from all classes including the farming sector.  Up to recently the health boards were responsible for the collection of these amounts.  The health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from the farming sector for the period up to 6 April 1984.  The health boards were very severely criticised for their failure to collect these funds.  The Minister has indicated that this amount has now been reduced to £9 million. Health boards are making every effort possible to get in what money is due to them.  It is important for them to get in as much money as possible.  Now that the Revenue Commissioners have this responsibility, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  Could he inform me how much has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners?  What percentage of bills has been issued by the Revenue Commissioners?  My information is that things are not going well and that the performance of the health boards might be a lot better in the area of collection than that of the Revenue <Col N="1437" /> Commissioners.  What can be said now more than ever in our history is that given the very perilous position of the health boards, in which there are all kinds of cutbacks envisaged for the year ahead, not to mention what we have had over the past year such as closures, staff redundancies and so on, obviously any more money that can be brought into the service and passed on to the health boards would be to the advantage of all.</P>
      <P>In agreeing to this regulation for which the Minister has asked approval I await with great interest the replies to both of my questions.  One wants to know how much has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners since they were given this task, and, secondly, what percentage of bills have been issued by the Revenue Commissioners to get in this money that is so vital to the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister that, when these notices appear on the paper that the limit has gone from £13,000 to £14,000, the benefits that are available to people would be highlighted so that people would know what exactly is available to them and why they might be paying extra money.</P>
      <P>I would like also to mention the money that is owed.  We are building up a myth that becomes a bigger myth each year as to what is owed by different people.  I know, and I know many people in the Seanad know, that bills that are sent out to farmers as a result of income tax assessment and used by the health board bear no relation to reality.  I have seen bills sent out to farmers simply because they have not made returns.  It is estimated what in theory they should be earning.  I have questioned my own health board as to how real their estimates are.  I think there was over £3 million owed by farmers to the South Eastern Health Board over a number of years.  The reality I believe is that maybe only half of that is owed.  We could be fooling ourselves in talking about this money that is owed by people.  It is quoted by trade unionists and by people who object to paying tax; they say you should collect what is owed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> It becomes a bigger problem the more often we put it in print or announce that millions of pounds are owed by certain people.  If it is owed, the money should be collected but if these are estimates then we are only fooling ourselves into thinking that we have money there waiting to come in when in actual fact it is not there at all.  I would worry that we might add to the myth that exists that there is money owed right, left and centre by farmers.  There are farmers who owe money without question but I do not think, from my own experience in dealing with farmers who have got bills, that the money that appears to be owed is actually owed at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft regulations which are before the House propose to raise the income ceiling for health contributions from £13,000 to £14,000 with effect from the beginning of the next contribution year, which is 6 April.  When these regulations are approved the maximum health contribution will increase from £130 to £140.  The increase involved is in excess of 7½ per cent.  It is well above the percentage increase in earnings of most workers since the present income ceiling was fixed this time last year.  As far as the vast majority of farmers are concerned, not alone did their incomes not increase but in many cases they suffered a considerable reduction due mainly to the losses caused by the disastrous weather conditions of 1985.  It is also hard to see how the Minister can justify increasing health contributions when one considers the serious cut-backs in services which have occurred over the past 12 months.  Staffing levels have been reduced and waiting lists are growing longer day by day.  The regrettable fact is that many services such as dental, opthalmic and orthopaedic services have ground to a halt in most health board areas.  However, I suppose that anybody who is in category two for health services and has got to go to hospital gets good value for the amount paid in health contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons there are so many problems with the collection of health <Col N="1439" /> contributions from farmers and other self-employed persons is that many people are not aware of what their entitlements are.  There is also a good deal of confusion about the method of assessment. That confusion is compounded in the case of persons with more than one income, such as part-time farmers.  The fact that they were also liable in the past to other levies, and will continue to be liable for the youth employment levy, has added to the confusion.  A greater effort should be made to inform people of the regulations governing these levies and of the method of assessment.</P>
    <P>In the case of health contributions it is very important to make people aware of what their entitlements are, if they are in this category. If people are convinced that they are getting good value for money they are much more likely to pay up.  I understand that at present asessments for health contributions are being issued by the Revenue Commissioners to farmers and to the self-employed.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's reply to the questions raised by Senator Fallon in relation to the number of bills which have been issued and the amounts that have been collected to date.  I am informed that people who are receiving bills for health contributions at present are being told that they have no option but to pay the amount demanded, even though they are satisfied that the assessments are based on notional income figures which have no relation to actual income figures. It has been pointed out, of course, that any overpayment involved will be credited or refunded to them in due course when actual income figures have been agreed.</P>
    <P>If this is the situation, I believe the system should be changed.  I do not believe this is the way to get co-operation or prompt payment.  People should have the option of paying a portion of the levy on account and the balance when actual income figures are agreed.  As a further incentive to people to pay their health contributions it might be worth looking at a system whereby hospital services <Col N="1440" /> cards or application forms for hospital services cards would be issued automatically to people who have paid the previous year's health contributions. Also, a brochure outlining their entitlements should be issued to them.  At present when people pay their health contributions they are issued with receipts, and nothing else.  If a person wishes to obtain a hospital services card it is necessary to obtain an application form from the health board office, complete it and return it with the required evidence of income.  I accept that there are leaflets available in the health board office which provide a summary of entitlements but most people never see these and have no idea of their entitlements neither are they clear on the method of assessment.</P>
    <P>I also believe that it is true to say that very few people apply for hospital services cards although they are entitled to them.  One of the reasons for this is that they have no idea where to apply to or how to apply.  If they have to go into hospital they are in a state of panic because they have no hospital services card.  They fear they will be faced with huge bills for hospital and consultant services. The majority of people who are entitled to category two services do not realise that they are so entitled.  Consequently, they worry unnecessarily about the possibility of being faced with bills for hospital expenses.  I am sure that every public representative, and every Member of the Seanad, has at some time seen the look of relief on a person's face who has just been told that there is no need to worry because there will be no bill from the hospital or no bill for consultants' fees.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to look for ways and means of providing better information to people who are liable for health contributions on what their entitlements are, what the method of assessment is and what the procedure is for those who wish to obtain a hospital services card.  The second plea I want to make to the Minister is on behalf of people whose medical cards have been withdrawn.  For the past 12 months in the Western Health Board area &mdash; and I am <Col N="1441" /> sure the same applies to other health board areas &mdash; there has been an ongoing intensive review of medical card eligibility. Hundreds of families have had their medical cards withdrawn.  In many cases the medical cards have been withdrawn although the income of the family was only marginally in excess of the guidelines.  The withdrawal of medical cards in such cases is causing great hardship.</P>
    <P>A medical card entitles the holder and his or her dependants to full eligibility for health services; it entitles them to general practitioner services free of charge, to in-patient services in public wards and specialist services in out-patient clinics. It also entitles them to dental, opthalmic and oral services and also free prescribed drugs and medicines.  A medical card also determines eligibility for other benefits, such as free school transport and assistance under the free book scheme, as well as entitling the holder to relief in the case of employees PRSI and exemption from other levies such as the youth employment levy and health contributions. However, when a person's medical card is withdrawn he or she is immediately liable for health contributions as well as being ineligible for all the other reliefs to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a person whose income marginally or significantly exceeds the guidelines, and whose medical card is withdrawn, may finish up considerably worse off than someone whose income is marginally within the guidelines and who has a medical card.  For example, if the relevant guidelines for two individuals &mdash; let us call them &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;&mdash; are £120 a week and &ldquo;A&rdquo; has an income of £130 a week and &ldquo;B&rdquo; has an income of £110 a week, &ldquo;B&rdquo; retains his medical card while &ldquo;A's&rdquo; card is withdrawn.  &ldquo;A&rdquo; is then liable to pay health contributions, youth employment levy, full PRSI, GP's fees, up to £28 per month for prescribed drugs and medicines.  His family are no longer eligible for the free school transport service or assistance under the free books scheme.  The result is that &ldquo;A&rdquo; finishes up considerably worse off than &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister sees the point I am trying to <Col N="1442" /> make, that the withdrawal of a medical card can have traumatic consequences for a family.</P>
    <P>The anomalies which exist are even more obvious when one compares the case of a wage earner with that of a person in receipt of social welfare benefit. In the case of all wage earners the guidelines refer to gross income, but a social welfare payment is a net payment and not liable to any deductions.  Similarly, farmers are assessed on net income rather than on gross income.  Therefore, in my view there is discrimination against the wage earners.  I believe that the wage earner should also be assessed on net income, that is, on the amount per week which he gets into his hand.  Take the case of a wage earner whose medical card is withdrawn because his gross income exceeds the guidelines, while a social welfare recipient retains his medical card because his income is within the guidelines, even though the net value of the wage earner's income after deductions is less than the amount of the social welfare payment which the other person receives. These anomalies should be eliminated. Also, there should be a mechanism built into the system to ensure that the withdrawal of medical cards from persons marginally in excess of the guidelines would not have such serious and far-reaching consequences for the person and the families involved.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we have reached the stage when we should be considering dividing category 1 into subcategories with different degrees of eligibility.  For instance, there could be one subcategory of persons who would have full eligibility for all services and who would be entitled to all the other benefits and exemptions to which I have referred.  Another subcategory could cover persons who would have full eligibility for medical services and, perhaps, be eligible for some other benefits.  Another subcategory could cover persons with full eligibility for medical services but who would not be eligible for any of the other benefits or exemptions.  It might be possible to consider another subcategory where persons <Col N="1443" /> would have full eligibility for medical services but would be liable to health contributions or some charge in respect of those services.  A change, such as I have suggested, might have some administrative difficulties but it certainly would go some way towards overcoming the problems and anomalies to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to an anomaly which exists in the case of persons with category 2 eligibility.  When the Minister fixes the income ceiling for category 2 eligibility persons under the ceiling will be eligible and persons over the ceiling will not be eligible.  In the case of married persons the incomes of both spouses are assessed separately.  Therefore, if the income ceiling is £13,500, as at present, a person with £13,000 income per annum is eligible and a person with £14,000 per annum is not eligible.  However, the person with £13,000 per annum may have a spouse earning £13,000 more.  That does not affect their eligibility.  Therefore, one could have a situation where two families could be living side by side one a single-income family with an income of £14,000 and therefore outside the scope of category 1, while the two-income family would have a combined income of £26,000 and be eligible for category 2 services.  For the purposes of category 2 eligibility 50 per cent of the income should be put against the non-income earning spouse, or an allowance should be provided in respect of the non-income earning spouse and the dependants. Otherwise, the single-income family is being discriminated against, as is the spouse who works in the home.  I would urge the Minister, when fixing the income limit for category 2 eligibility, to consider the points I have raised with a view to eliminating some of the anomalies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the move to vary the health contributions.  I appreciate this decision.  It would be a mistake not to have regard to what has been happening in the total area of health, having regard to the amount of arrears referred to in the Minister's speech.  Nine million pounds is a very substantial amount of money.  If <Col N="1444" /> one adds to that the additional self-employed contributions still outstanding, we are talking about a lot of money.  We are in the position of arguing about the neglected areas and social groups, not just the people who are going to be eligible to pay more.</P>
      <P>The position is that the standard of health differs between classes and between regions.  The prospects of good health are significantly worse for the children of unskilled workers, and of manual workers in particular.  That is the position throughout their lives.  Down through the years there has been a greater mortality rate in infancy in that particular category.  They spend a shorter period of time at school.  There is some social neglect.  When they begin work they have to work longer and they have longer spells of sickness.  People who are manual workers are more likely to be admitted to mental hospitals as they grow old.  In their old age they are more likely to suffer from chronic bronchitis and so on.  Inevitably they die younger than better-off people.  In the areas I have mentioned the situation has been worse, healthwise, for many people from the cradle to the grave.  Therefore, when we talk about £9 million being owed by any category, whether farmers, self-employed or anybody else, we are talking about money that could do a great deal in the health area.  This has a relevance to the increased level of health contributions eligibility.</P>
      <P>If my views are to be either substantiated or contradicted, it will take a working party, not just someone looking at certain aspects, but a working party actually looking at the aspects of society of which I have spoken.  I am confident, having regard to St. Vincent de Paul reports and so on, that I will not be contradicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to say very bluntly that standards in health services are related to class.  The whole question of access to the health services needs remedy.  When I talk about social neglect it must be said that housing may be the cause of some of the problems.  Social security must be <Col N="1445" /> kept to its proper level.  These must operate together with the health services and access to such services.  If one person can get access to a consultant more quickly than another who does not pay, then there is something wrong with the system.  If the money was there to be redistributed some attention could be given to these problems.  It is very hard not to look at it from the point of view of class.  This is not because one wants to be ideological or anything else.  One has to think in terms of change itself.  Within the meaning of the health services, the Minister has been persistent.  He went about changing the system very diligently and has done a great deal to try to effect change.  He has been very tenacious in pursuing his objective.  I hope that at the end of the day by pursuing his objective in this way the social neglect I have spoken about will be made a little bit less acute. It certainly is not going to remedy it, but at least it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In general it would be correct to say that the Minister is going the right way about redressing the balance.  I am not so sure that he will be able to do it in his lifetime.  However, it would be hyprocritical of me if I did not say that, while I admire what the Minister is doing I notice, when I am talking in a pub or somewhere else, that once something is printed in the media it looks terrible, but once it is explained by the Minister on the radio or on television most people accept that many of the things the Minister is doing are not only necessary but are the right things to do.  But I would be less than fair if I did not say that his approach seems to some people to be insensitive and may cause mental anguish. I do not believe the Minister sets out to do that.  That has been the result of recent situations.  On the other hand, if his approach could match his competence and his courage, I dare say that he would go down in history as probably the best Minister in the Department of Health since the foundation of the State.  It is a delicate area.  I do not want to go too deeply into it.  I do not think it is irrelevant to the question of health contributions. We are talking about people having <Col N="1446" /> to pay more money for the health service. We are talking about the social neglect that is caused, from the Minister's own observations, by the arrears.</P>
    <P>We will take now the question of health contributions and speak of specialist care. On the question of class, the people I spoke about at the beginning are going to have less chance of specialist care unless something very radical is done.  Perhaps they will get it eventually, but I do not think they are going to get it before some considerable time has elapsed.  Senator Mullooly mentioned the long waiting lists.  Perhaps some of the savings to be made by some of the means which the Minister mentioned, coupled with the collection of arrears, will bring about some desirable effect.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is possible <i>in toto</i> to examine the question of redistribution in such a way that one class will not eventually still remain a little bit better than the other.  But the balance can be redressed to a great extent.  This is why I admire the Minister's tenacity of going after certain things in certain areas. There is always the danger, in approaching change, that the whole question of redistribution from the poor to the very poor will result rather than redistribution from the better-off to the poor.  This is what can happen if the problem is not tackled properly.  This usually happens. I am trying to explain that the money collected in arrears, and other moneys saved through certain rationalisation programmes, can end up in a situation where the poor actually help the poor, unless the situation is handled properly.  That is the way it has been for a long time.  The redistribution, rather than going from the people who can afford it in the health services, may not take place.  The moneys may go from the poor to the very poor. That is something the Minister should probably have in the back of his mind.  I do not think he has to be reminded too much by me about a situation like that.</P>
    <P>Obviously, sufficient funds to bring about this necessary adjustment in the balance between the classes in the area of health must be there.  Since our economic situation is drastic, I can understand the <Col N="1447" /> Minister's diligence in going after the arrears.  At the same time the question of a balance comes in.  How is it done? Perhaps I am trying to back two horses but I would be rather concerned with the human side of the whole process.  I would be worried about the staff situation.  I know that consultants are good people. Eligibility to their services is a good thing. But, unless there is the provision of more staff where it is needed, either in health centres or hospitals, we will have missed out in the purpose of what the Minister was aiming at.</P>
    <P>The whole question of long waiting lists is something that Senator Mullooly mentioned.  There is still much evidence of that.  The position is that they may have shortened somewhat over the last couple of years.  I have not got the information now but I know a couple of years ago there were very long lists.  I just happened to be in hospital six times myself in one particular year.  That is how I can speak in that way.  The fact of having to wait is not so bad.  The worst thing of all is there are certain conditions such as hip operations which are quite serious.  The pain is severe.  It is not only a question of waiting but it is a question of waiting in pain.  That is the problem.  How does one deal with it?  One has to have some sort of periodic drive to shorten the time of stay in hospital after other operations and in other types of sickness.  For example, the waiting lists are not organised well. They could be planned better than they are at the moment.  One of my operations was to deal with varicose veins in both legs.  All I did while in hospital, was walk around the hospital strengthening my legs.  I could have done that at home or anywhere else.  I am just giving that as an illustration.  Possibly there could be a tightening-up in this area where there are people staying in hospital with complaints that should not necessitate long stays. Other small operations, such as hernia operations, should not take as long in hospital as the more major operations.</P>
    <P>The planning of the intake of patients and the periods in hospital with certain types of problems and operations seem <Col N="1448" /> related to a person's social class.  Having to wait for indefinite periods, either to see consultants or to find a place in the hospital to deal with the problem, seems to be related to a certain class, but they are a certain class in pain.  My experience was that it was not unknown for people to have to wait 18 months.  Then a problem arises after the 18 months when one gets three days' notice to come into hospital. People could jump the waiting lists because they could go through private treatment.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the question of planned intake of patients, this whole question will have to be looked at as well.  For example, there are areas where people cannot be rushed &mdash; for example, plastic surgery and possibly the question of the hip replacement.  There are not enough people available to do those things and they could not be planned in the same way as you could plan the small ones.  But it is a novel idea that they tried in England on one occasion.  For example, we could just deal with the normal things in an emergency situation and then set aside one week for dealing with hernias, for example.  It might be possible to do things like that.  It might be possible also to have a look at the operating theatre wards where more intensive use could be made of the facilities and thus reduce the stay.</P>
    <P>I should like to wind up by saying that I welcome this.  I am keen on this planned admission.  One of the difficulties I see with it, when getting down to the question of notifying people who come in, is that if they are only being given three days' notice there is a great possibility that they have been waiting for 18 months, that they will not be able to drop what they are doing at that particular time or to make the necessary home arrangements. Consequently, what will happen is that there will be a certain percentage who will not turn up to take their bed, or they will opt out of the whole idea if they are not in too much pain and put it off for another day.</P>
    <P>It is something that concerns me.  I should like to see the money that is available, money that is owing, money <Col N="1449" /> that is saved as a result of the activity of the Minister supported by the Government, being put to some sort of use and to try to make the problems, particularly of the families of manual workers, less acute, so that they will not have to wait these very long periods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few observations about these regulations.  The result of increasing the ceiling from £13,000 to £14,000 would mean that more money would be collected from these contributions.  The Minister stated that this would be approximately £2.1 million in the contribution year 1986-87.  This is a considerable amount, I suppose.  I should like to refer, in passing, to the increase of £1,000. Senator Mullooly referred to this.  Over the past few years the increase has been £1,000 each year.  I am quite sure that in making the increase the Minister kept strictly to the regulations.</P>
      <P>Another welcome result of this increase is that those with incomes under £14,000 will qualify for hospital services cards.  Of course, we would all like to see the rate of 1 per cent being reduced.  Since 6 April 1984 the Revenue Commissioners have taken over the responsibility for collection of health contributions from farmers as they were already doing for the PRSI workers and the self-employed.  It is right that it should not be the function of the health boards to do this.  But, nevertheless, the health boards were left with the problem of collecting the arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the farmers, as other Senators have done. The method of calculation used to be the valuation multiplied by a certain figure. This was the situation until the court in Wexford; it was discontinued after that verdict.  The health boards had to go on the income basis.  This was simple enough, I believe, for people whose valuation was over £40, because the figures were available from the Revenue Commissioners. But where the valuation was under £40 the health boards wrote out to farmers for their income, and I believe many of them made a genuine and <Col N="1450" /> reasonable attempt to try to arrive at the right figure.  The bills were sent from the health boards in respect of that.  Some returns, it was suggested, bordered on the crazy and the health boards had to do their own assessment.  Of course, some did not reply.  The result was that the health boards had to estimate the income.  This gave rise to some problems.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board, in the area from which I come, estimates that the balance due from farmers at 31 December last year was £1.4 million.  The longer it goes the more difficult it will be to collect this figure.  In the interim period two bills have already been received from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is fair to say that farmers are willing to pay and co-operate if the collectors call for the outstanding accounts.  This has been proved in the North Eastern Health Board region.  People call to collect the accounts.  They can talk to the farmers instead of sending out pieces of paper, bills which are meaningless.  The farmers were used to the rate collectors and that system of collecting outstanding accounts at the most suitable times and of course the rate collectors called after fairs and markets.  In that system the farmers paid their way.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a decision last year that the money collected would be used by the health boards and kept for their own use.  This was very welcome.  I welcome his announcement today that he will continue this for the present year and for future years.  This has helped in many areas to prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.  In the North Eastern Health Board region for Cavan-Monaghan and Louth £170,000 was collected last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the land tax, when the £10 per adjusted acre comes into operation I believe that no decision has been made on determining the method of liability. As Meath is one of the areas where the land tax will come into operation at an early stage, I should like to know what the situation is in that regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to an anomaly and a situation where the Minister might, after mature consideration, make some <Col N="1451" /> changes which I think are desirable.  This is where third level students are involved. The only students at third level entitled to medical cards are, I believe, students whose parents are entitled to medical cards.  A person out of the same family doing an AnCO course living at home with the equivalent money is entitled to a medical card because that person is assessed on his own as an income apparently and not part of the family.  I think there are many people who genuinely feel that all students over 18 years of age should be entitled to a medical card. There would be very little cost involved on the part of the State.  These people are for the most part healthy.  There could be a situation where a not so well off family might have one, two or three children attending third level education.  That family would be in a very difficult situation. So I would like the Minister to investigate the possibility of changing this anomaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the measures outlined in the Order.  The whole question of charges is always an emotive one.  As long as it is directly linked to ability to pay, I have no objection good, bad or indifferent to charge.  Indeed, I support charges and the principle of people being asked to pay for services &mdash; water services, refuse collection services, etc.  As long as you have a safety net there, such as applies in the case of local authority charges of the right of water, the discretionary right in cases of undue hardship to do so and so long as the system outlined in this order is based on the ability to pay, then I see absolutely nothing wrong with it and in my opinion it is most commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We own apologies, in fact, to nobody for supporting the measure as laid down here when you consider the vast amount that is available under the health service, the vast labyrinth of services available and the high standard of care and service provided throughout the whole realm of the public health service.  I would, however, agree with Senator Browne in relation to the cutting of the stick to beat <Col N="1452" /> ourselves.  That is the usage at times of mythical figures in relation to what is and what is not owed.  There is no question that very often we are given, and we give ourselves, inflated figures in relation to the amount of outstanding debts in the whole area of taxation and in relation to the whole area of service charges and health charges.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a colossal amount yet to be collected.  I do not accept that the figure is always the figure that is thrown out.  Very often, while farmers are somewhat to blame in that there is an initial tendency to throw into the fire the first demand that comes &mdash; and perhaps the second one &mdash; in the hope that it will go away and be forgotten about, nevertheless, people fail to appreciate that by filling them in by pitching their income levels at realistic levels they will be saving themselves a lot of hassle and hardship and a lot of worrying and anxiety that frequently comes to bear on them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is a failure on the part of the authorities to take into consideration a lot of the nitty gritty and the elements that go into making up a farm income, particularly in relation to recognising the number of items that go into the making of a farm income by way of expenses necessarily incurred in the earning of that income.  All of the outlays should be taken into consideration.  I am totally opposed to national assessments on any basis.  I think it is wrong, and it very often gives an inflated and grossly exaggerated income figure in relation to what peoples' actual net incomes are.</P>
    <P>I can see a certain amount of merit in the suggestion of Senator Fitzsimons, that is, the idea that collectors might be more efficient.  On the other hand, I think that there is an aura and an air of the bailiff in relation to somebody knocking on one's door to collect any charges, in that one often associates the arrival of the rate collector with the executive functions that pertain to the rate collector, that is, the eviction process in the event of somebody not being able to pay.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the point made by Senator Browne, that is, that if we could at all times try to bring before people, <Col N="1453" /> and spell out in clear, precise detail, the enormous number of entitlements they have, if they pay this charge, by way of the provision of free hospital care services in public hospitals, etc, I believe we would do an awful lot to alleviate peoples' anxieties and to extract the money that we see here pitched at a reduced figure of £9 million.  I think that every time a bill or a demand goes out to somebody affixed to that should be, spelled out in clear detail, the entitlements to which these people are entitled in the event of their making payment and when they make payment.  I think that if the point made by Senator Mullooly were implemented &mdash; that is, that if there were some form of service card, hospital services card, etc rather than just an acknowledgement or a receipt in the event of payment, would help again to spell out to people the magnitude of the services they are being given and the high quality and standard of services they are gaining if, in fact, they pay the charges levied upon them.</P>
    <P>I would like to take very briefly a point made by Senator Mullooly.  We are talking about efficient running of the health service here.  We have been talking over the years, indeed, we are grey in the face talking about areas where, in fact, economies could be effected.  There is one stark example which was alluded to and touched on by Senator Mullooly. That is the operation of assessment in relation to medical cards.  I appreciate that there has to be assessment.  I have asked, in fact, for a factual assessment. What I am asking for is that the emphasis be put on the word &ldquo;factual&rdquo;.  I have come across numerous cases that operate in the Western Health Board area in particular where somebody is assessed for his entitlement of unemployment assistance. A social welfare officer comes out.  He visits the man <i>in situ.</i>  He sees the situation on the ground.  He arrives at a figure of income, we will say £25, and on the basis of that £25 the man is determined to be entitled to something in the region of £65 unemployment assistance.  That would bring the man's total income, for a man, wife and two children, to £90.  That has <Col N="1454" /> been factually determined, professionally assessed by a social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The following week the man applies for a medical card.  He goes into the local community welfare officer and he is asked to send on some documentation to the local office.  No figure of income arrives back.  What happens, in fact, is that the man is told that on the basis of means you are determined to be ineligible for a medical card.  Yet you have a community welfare officer contradicting social welfare officers' assessments the week before that.  It has been said to me by people on the ground that one, in fact, is making a liar of the other in relation to the method of assessment being used and the final income figure.  I have come across, time and time again, variations as great as £40 and £50 in the assessments carried out one week by a social welfare officer and the other week by a community welfare officer.  Apart altogether from the wastage of resources here, I believe that it leaves people bewildered and sour and angry.  I would ask the Minister to instruct the health boards that, where a social welfare officer determines a person's income having professionally assessed it, having examined all the minutiae that goes into the making up farm income that, in fact, should be the norm.  It should be automatically acceptable and accepted as the basis of somebody's determination of income rather than having the regurgitation of it again and somebody the following week, another officer of the same rank in a different Department, arriving at a vastly different conclusion.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make is that the business of making big money available which is collected and given to the health boards is an excellent idea.  It does provide an element of incentive.  It is something that should be encouraged. It is something I should like to see extended in the area of road tax, for example, that the taxation that comes from motor cars would be applied to the county within which it is collected.  It goes a long way, in my opinion in giving the <Col N="1455" /> health boards the necessary incentive to go about the application of their duties.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has performed his duties as Minister for Health. I believe he is a pragmatic, realistic Minister.  I believe that he has shown the necessary compassion and that very often he is misrepresented.  I believe he is one of the most maligned members of the Cabinet and very often he has been put down as the <i>bête noire</i> of this particular Cabinet.  In my opinion most of the decisions he has taken are not alone defensible but commendable.  When they are done in the interest and welfare of the patient I think the ultimate benefit will eventually percolate and shine through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their understanding and contributions to this debate.  Senator Fallon asked the precise level of current contributions being accumulated under the Revenue Commissioners' system.  I do not have the particular details.  I will endeavour to get them for the Senator because, as the Senator is aware, the health boards at this stage are dealing only with the arrears of contributions.  Of course, there is the transitional arrangement relating to the land tax as such.  I can only give that much information at this point in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the general level of contributions, we should take note that, whereas we have succeeded in collecting some £2.8 million of arrears from the farming community between the middle of 1984 and the end of 1985, that brings the arrears &mdash; admittedly, it is a somewhat national figure &mdash; to around £9 million. Nevertheless, it has gone down from £11.8 million to £9 million now, and I think there is a substantial amount of money available there.  That money goes directly to the health boards.  At local level when the officers of the health boards point out to those who owe the money that the money is being used currently by the health boards from 1985 onwards and for 1986 and 1987 onwards <Col N="1456" /> in terms of any arrears due, people may be more amenable to pay.</P>
    <P>There is still no doubt that, no matter what way one examines it, there are two outstanding factors in relation to health contributions.  The contributions are minimal.  We spent £1,273 million this year.  The totality of all health contributions will amount this year to only £78,500,000.  The contribution is 5 per cent or thereabouts of total income.  The balance of the money comes from the general Exchequer and from general taxation. God be with the days when we all remember in this House arguing about health charges at local level.  These have been abolished.  Everything is now loaded on to the central Exchequer and in time all hell breaks loose <i>vis-a-vis</i> the budgeting by the central Exchequer for all of these services.</P>
    <P>The second general point I would like to make is that health contributions are paid for any insured workers.  The contributions from the other sectors are marginal. They are so small that one should not at times be arguing about them.  I will give the House the simple facts.  In 1983 insured persons paid £62,500,000 in health contributions.  The farming community paid £.7 million.  Other self-employed persons paid £2.6 million.  In 1984 the contributions were £65.8 million from the PAYE sector.  The farming community paid £2.3 million that year because of a change in the arrangements and last year PAYE insured persons paid £73.2 million and, with the transitional arrangements, the farming community went down to £1.6 million and the other self-employed people paid £2.4 million. I took out a rather interesting figure. Since 1971-72, £435 million had been paid by insured persons in health contributions. That is up to the end of 1985; the farming community, £21 million.  That is £435 million versus £21 million and others, that is, self-employed, £18 million. We took in in all of that period, 1971-72 up to the end of 1985, £472 million in health contributions and of the £472 million insured persons paid £435 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> For all practical purposes health contributions are paid by the urban community. I make that broad point.  That is what gives rise to a great deal of understandable reaction from so many people in terms of who is paying for what.</P>
    <P>We are reviewing the limit of £13,500 for category 2 eligibility at present.  It will be increased with effect from 1 June 1986. That will refer to income for the year ended 5 April 1986.  Because it is 5 April 1986 it is not possible at this stage to estimate the figure correctly.  We will have it shortly and we will be making an announcement in the near future.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senators in relation to assessment.  We urgently need uniform methods of assessment, and I take the point in relation to social welfare assessments for factual assessment there and for factual assessment in terms of health eligibility for general medical services. I share that point and I am acutely aware of it in terms of the multiplicity of assessment methods available.  It is something I would hope from the Commission on Social Welfare and from the health side that we will rationalise effectively so that people will not be driven to distraction by a multiplicity of means test methods in force.  These are the two points I want to make in reply to Senators and I commend the regulations to the House.</P>

      <P>The law has a special role to play both as a reflection and an instrument of change.  It acts as a <Col N="1458" /> reflection because the law always lags behind the social change which precedes it and which it embodies.  But it is also an instrument where it serves to promote social objectives and to combat the forces of inertia embedded in traditional work culture and patterns of behaviour.</P>
      <P>If it is to be strong, the principle of equality must be constantly upheld and brought up to date.  This entails constant vigilance as regards the relevance and reasonableness of the range of exceptions permitted to that broad principle.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977, makes specific provisions for the review of protective laws when the concern for protection which originally inspired them is no longer well founded.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Employment Equality Act recognises that certain requirements in four Acts administered by my Department may, in effect, be forcing employers, by law, to discriminate against women in employment.  It, accordingly, empowers the Minister for Labour to repeal or amend any such requirement by affirmative order.  In addition to the proposals which I intend to bring before the Oireachtas shortly to amend the original equal pay and employment equality statutes, I have sought to make use of these powers to affect further changes by order wherever desirable.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that last year I availed of this facility to remove prohibitions on the employment of categories of women workers below ground in a mine and on the employment of women at night in a mine.  I have also made regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, removing the blanket exclusion of most occupational activities in the Garda Síochána and the prison service, and employment in a private household or by a close relative from the protection of the equality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, sets maximum working hours for women industrial workers and restricts their employment on shifts and night work.  These restrictions apply only to women engaged in manual labour in factories; they exclude women cleaners and <Col N="1459" /> women in responsible supervisory or management positions who do not do manual work.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 62,600 women workers engaged in the production industries covered by the legal limits on working hours, and just over 18 per cent of all women workers are affected. Employers, unions and employees are often unaware of these restrictions, their specific limits and to which men and women they apply; this is primarily because the laws are extremely complicated.</P>
    <P>My objective in making this order is to bring to an end the existing legal prohibition on the employment of women in industrial night work and on Sundays. At the present time, women are denied access to employment opportunities where shift work and Sunday work are involved.  Because of this ban women are denied additional opportunities for training and promotion, and lose out on the higher premium attaching to such work.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that this is an unsatisfactory position.  The provisions in the 1936 Act which are proposed for amendment reflect the dominance of the socially conservative ideas about the position of women in the labour force which were later enshrined in the 1937 Constitution.  The Employment Equality Agency was asked to review the prohibition on the employment of women in industrial work at night and on Sundays and found that such a prohibition discriminated against women in relation to opportunities for employment, promotion and earning capacity.</P>
    <P>It is to give women extra employment opportunities that I am submitting this order to the House for approval.</P>
    <P>I feel however that for a period after the legalisation of night work for women we should monitor the situation with two main objectives in mind.  First, to find out to what extent the change is in fact leading to an increase in the number of women being employed and, second, to uncover at an early stage any problems <Col N="1460" /> arising.  With this in mind, I have contacted the Employment Equality Agency with a view to having such a monitoring operation carried out.  I have pleasure in submitting this order to the House for approval.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I wish to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, to the House and wish him every success in his new office.</P>
      <P>There is no problem about welcoming this order on this side of the House.  Any measure that eases the employment role for women must be welcomed.  The issue of shift licences up to this point has been a slow, cumbersome process.  This measure should help to reduce the bureaucratic procedures which have applied in relation to shift licences up to the passage of this order.  Progress on equality issues has been disappointingly slow.  This step, however modest, in streamlining the procedures in relation to women at work must be welcomed.  I am glad to see that the Minister has referred to the intention of updating the equality legislation in bringing the amended versions before the House as soon as possible.  Simultaneously, I would like to register my disappointment that the amending legislation has not been before us up to now. In fact, I would ask the Minister to give us his best estimate of when we can expect the publication of the amended legislation.  I am happy to support the order and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with my colleague, Senator Hillery, in welcoming the Minister of State to the Seanad.  We are very proud of the fact that he is a Mayoman and that he has been given a twin responsibility both in the Department of Labour and the Department of Education.  We have no doubt whatever that he will bring his experience, together with his youth and vigour, to all areas for which he is charged with responsibility.  Like Senator Hillery, I too, would like to welcome this as a modest step towards redressing the imbalances and the prejudices of days gone by <Col N="1461" /> and indeed of constitutional legislation in the past, which, although well intended, managed to discriminate against the rights and the provision of opportunities for females in the workplace.  I would like to anticipate at an early stage the provision of amending legislation with regard to the equality of women in the workplace.  I want to place on record my welcome for this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to welcome the Minister of State and wish him luck during the remainder of his office.  It would be nice to think of him having another term after this one has ended, but that is in the lap of the gods.  It is not impossible.</P>
      <P>One of the most important battles fought by women is equal pay for work of equal value.  The inequality that has always existed between men and women is based on several factors.  If we go back to the sixties we could say that about one in 20 people received little pay, probably in the region of £15 per week.  That was when the going rate was much higher and women did work of equal value to men. I recognise that this is merely a short step in a long journey.  That journey will, of course, have to take into consideration the question of night work, shifts in general, training and promotion, part-time work, maternity leave, day nurseries, the care of children after school hours and the care of children during school holidays.  It is a very wide area and it does not end with the question of equal pay for work of equal value, while it might not be possible to make it run in tandem, one interrelates to the other and one is dependent on the other.  Therefore, it is very important to acknowledge that, while this is a small beginning, it is a very welcome one and we must continue the fight from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times in national wage agreements the differential which existed between men and women who were doing work of equal value has gradually been eroded, but there is still a long way to go. It does not matter how many Acts or orders we bring in, we are merely setting the means to pursue the end.  If we look <Col N="1462" /> up the records we will see quite a lot of cases that had to go through the Employment Equality Agency or to the Labour Court.  It is difficult on occasions to prove that work of equal value is being done. Like the argument of the reduction in working hours, it is very emotive.  At that time, instead of following the principle of looking for a shorter working week for more recreation and in order to help create employment, many people actually had the mentality to look for a shorter working week so that they could work overtime on Saturdays and Sundays.  This is the danger when people get emotive about the question of equal pay.  Sometimes the claim can be made that people are looking for equal pay on the basis that they are working in the same firm and not on the basis of the principle that it is equal pay for work of equal value. Consequently, we get into industrial relations. A little more education in that area is needed.  This can come through the women's councils and women's sections of the various organisations.</P>
    <P>The theme of Women's Year &mdash; equality, development and peace &mdash; is a nice concept.  In fact, it was set up by the United Nations some years ago.  I do not think there is anybody who is not in favour of equality.  But, there are other issues to which we must have commitment &mdash; for example, the question of full employment.  In the pursuit of full employment we cannot discriminate against women because they are married or for any other reason.  There has to be equal opportunity as well as equal pay for work of equal value.  As Senator Hillery has said, there has not been much significant progress in the whole area. Notwithstanding the EC directives, we are relatively new to the idea.  It can take up to one-and-a-half years to sort out one particular problem in an industry, as I experienced some time ago.  The whole issue is more than just equal pay for work of equal value.  There is also the question of equality in the social security system. You cannot have one without the other. I know that it is necessary to bring them in separately.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis what we are talking <Col N="1463" /> about is a charter of rights for women, not only the right to equal pay for work of equal value but the right to work regardless of marital status, the right to return to work after a period of absence and equality in conditions of employment. One can often get the rate of pay but sometimes the conditions do not improve.  That is a problem area.  There must be equal access to job opportunities, promotion and whatever other work is available.  Above all there must be full statutory protection and <i>pro rata</i> benefits for part time workers in the whole question of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
    <P>The discrimination in age limits in the public and private sectors is another area that has to be considered very seriously. Equal access to all levels of education and the elimination of all forms of sexism are part and parcel of a positive programme with regard to equality.  The working environment will also be a necessary consideration.  The question of the re-organisation of working time might eventually arise through some sort of more flexible working arrangement.  In order to give people their rights we have to make some sacrifice in that area.  There is also the question of sexual harassment and the protection of women's health. You could go through a whole field of it It is sufficient to say that we welcome this order being made here today.  It is a long road.  Some progress has been made, however unsatisfactory, but we hope that the making of this order will see an end to many of the difficulties facing us at the moment and particularly an end to any long delay that might be caused by the arguments being made to get equal pay for work of equal value.  I look forward to the spill over into the social security area.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Senators for their words of welcome on my visit to the Seanad.  This is a small but significant measure and is an indication of the Department's willingness to implement, where possible, the appropriate recommendations coming from the <Col N="1464" /> Employment Equality Agency.  The effect of the measure will open up access to three and four shift systems of work for women.  It will enhance their earning capacity and will provide greater work opportunities for further training and promotion outlets for them.</P>
      <P>To comment on what Senator Hillery said, a draft memorandum for Government on the amendment of the legislation is at present being finalised.  It is not open for me to comment on the proposed amendments at this stage but it is hoped to have the Bill introduced in the autumn of this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Harte's contribution, equal pay for work of equal value as distinct from the same work is a fundamental principle of the 1974 Anti-Discrimination Pay Act and most equal pay claims being processed are based on that principle.  In conclusion, I want to thank Senators for their words of welcome in relation to this measure and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 21, after &ldquo;1971&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or any amendment thereto.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not discuss section 1 now because we will be discussing it after the amendment has been dealt with.  I put down this amendment to give the Minister an opportunity to explain to me what appears to be a most extraordinary piece of parliamentary draftsmanship, in that a matter is defined by reference to an external document which is identified as Council Directive No. 71/235/EEC of 21 June 1971.  What is even more extraordinary is that there is a footnote, which is quite unusual in legislation, which seems to indicate where that can be found.  I would ask the Minister to comment, firstly, on why it is necessary to <Col N="1465" /> have a definition for usual forms of handling which relates back to the Council Directive; secondly, why it is necessary to describe it in this fashion with a most extraordinary footnote; and, thirdly, why provision is not being made for a redefinition of the usual form of handling if the Council Directive should change over a period of time.  As I understand it, if my amendment was not accepted, any change in the Council directive of that date would mean there would be a necessity for amending legislation in so far as this Bill is concerned.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</P>

      <P>I understand that in cases such as this, where there is a specific Community instrument referred to, that reference is taken to mean the instrument as it stands in its amended condition.  As such, insertion of the words &ldquo;or any amendment thereto&rdquo; as suggested in the amendment is superfluous. That refers to amendments made or to future amendments to the instrument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not be right. What we have here is an actual Council Directive of a particular date identified in a particular document.  How can that be taken to mean any change in the future in that directive?  It is not the one directive; it is a new directive; it is a change in the directive.  If this matter comes up for consideration in five years' time, anybody reading this will undoubtedly look at the Community document dated 21 June 1971.  They will not look any further because nowhere has there been any reference to any amendment of that document. I cannot see how anybody could come to that conclusion.  I doubt if it has ever been judicially tested.  If it was I do not think it would stand up &mdash; that a reference to a Community document which relates to a specific document passed at a specific time and identified in a specific way is to be taken by some mysterious means to mean not only that <Col N="1466" /> decision of the Council but any amendment to it in the future.  I think the Minister's advice is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are experts in the areas of law and accountancy.  This is their proficiency.  They have advised me that the Bill, as drafted, means that the usual forms of handling for the purpose of the Bill will be the list in EC Directive 71/235 and will embrace automatically any amendment of the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they advised the Minister whether that has ever been judicially tested?  Is it contained in some statutory interpretation?  If it is then I understand it.  I doubt that the interpretation Act has been amended &mdash; but I may be wrong &mdash; to say that any reference in legislation to an EC directive will be taken to mean the most up to date Council directive in that area.  I doubt very much that it has ever been judicially decided.  There are only two ways one can be sure.  One is that a law has been passed by this House and the other House saying that for the future where you refer to a Council directive you mean the most up to date Council directive, or alternatively that it has been judicially decided that that is the correct interpretation.  The parliamentary draftsman has no more status than anybody else.  Obviously he has an opinion and his opinion must be respected.  If we are to accept what the parliamentary draftsman says we would not be here at all.  Time and time again the parliamentary draftsmen have been proven wrong in that they have allowed Ministers to bring in legislation which was subsequently found to be unconstitutional. How many times has that happened in the past ten years?  In my time in this House it happened on two occasions. On both occasions they were warned that <Col N="1467" /> they were treading on the verge of unconstitutional action.  I do not understand how the Minister could come to that conclusion.</P>

But I doubt if they would consistently make a mistake. They are happy with this situation.  They have assured me that EC directive 71/235 will embrace automatically any amendment on that list.  This is something the draftsmen are quite used to handling. Obviously they have checked out the legal status of it and have taken great care with it.  It is not something that is just thrown in on a casual basis.  I am quite happy that this is the interpretation and that no difficulties will arise on it.</P>

      <P>If I could bring it to the Minister's attention so that he can bring it to the attention of the parliamentary drftsman, the footnote which he has mentioned in that section refers to a specific publication of a specific date.  It refers to Official Journal No. L143 of 29 June 1971, page 28.  How can the Minister say that that is going to refer to something else when it changes unless he indicates that it should not be confined to that specific page of that specific journal in that specific year?  I do not understand what the Minister is saying.  It appears to me that the Minister has been wrongly advised.</P>

This is a fairly routine matter.  It is appearing in Bills throughout the EC.  If there were any particular difficulties, such as the Senator speaks of, they would have emerged by this time.  I am satisfied that it is legally tight and that no loophole will arise.  I do not foresee any difficulty because the <Col N="1468" /> directive will, in current publications contain all amendments made to it in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>As regards Community goods incorporating goods from countries or territories not forming part of the customs territory of the Community which have been released for free circulation in the Community, is the Minister aware of the difficulties which the concept of free circulation is bringing about with regard to problems being created by dumping as a result of the operation of the concept of free circulation?  Is the Minister satisfied that this definition will not facilitate the situation whereby goods that come into the Community in a general way will be zoned into one section of the Community and distort the market in that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of this definition follows the format used in Community legislation generally.  The Senator has rightly pointed out that there are different kinds of Community goods. Community goods include goods wholly manufactured and produced in the Community. That is the normal and expected definition.  However under Community customs rules, Community goods also include goods manufactured and produced in third countries provided the goods have been released for free circulation, which means that they have gone through the relevant import formalities and that import charges have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to dumping.  This is an issue which comes up from time to time and can create difficulties for many economies.  I am convinced that there is nothing in this Bill which will in any way further facilitate dumping which might exist at present.  I do not think that the aspect or the difficulty will be enhanced or diminished by this Bill.  If remedial action is required as far as dumping is concerned, that is obviously something <Col N="1469" /> that will have to be approached in another manner.  As far as this Bill is concerned the creation of a free port, governed by this definition of Community goods, will not in any way be detrimental to our general and economic interests.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 27, after &ldquo;amend&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or revoke&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give to the Minister a power which he does not appear to have under section 2.  It is possible that he has it under some other section or statutory authority.  Has the Minister power to disestablish a free port once it has been established?  If not, does he think it is a power he should take? The power being given to the Minister under the Bill appears to be:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by order amend an order....</P>
      <P>The order which he may amend is:</P>
      <P>The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may by order declare that, on and after a specified date, the land enclosed within the limits defined by that order shall be a free port for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>What happens if the Minister wants to, while not repealing the whole legislation, change the free port from one portion of the country to another and wants to deregulate a place completely?  I doubt if that is covered by section 2 (2).  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>

      <P>I do not fully comprehend what Senator O'Leary is saying.  It is a Free Ports Bill.  The word is plural.  Since <Col N="1470" /> all the powers are given to the Minister throughout this Bill or to the different Ministries, and to no other person but those, they are in absolute and total control. In my opinion, it is far too much control.  Discussion on this Bill, in general, has been concerning the Ringaskiddy project but the very first section of the Bill says you can form free ports in more than one place.  If you want to change it from Cork to some other place, all you have to do is create it in the other place and close it in Cork.  All the powers are there.  It is riddled with far too much power, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the fact that if it was thought wise, say, to create a free port in Bantry &mdash; it is one place that comes off the top of my head and I have no particular reason for saying it &mdash; and if after a period of five years you felt there is not much point in having a free port any more in that area, is there a power to deregulate or to end the creation of a free port?  That is the purpose of my amendment, to make the Minister's power in that regard clear, if he has the power; and, if he has not the power, to give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right to say, in reply to what Senator Killilea said at some stage during the debate, that this is enabling legislation for the creation of free ports.  While much of the discussion has been about Ringaskiddy, it is not mentioned at all in the Bill.  It is overall enabling legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point introduced by Senator O'Leary in the amendment is an interesting one, and one which we have had carefully and specifically considered.  The situation here is that we are not talking about the revoking of a licence of an operator within the free port area.  That <Col N="1471" /> is an entirely different matter and that power is there with the Minister.  This is a question of how do you revoke the while thing, and how do you return to normal territory an area that has become a free port.  The situation is that that power does not rest with the Minister. He does not have that power either here or in any other part.</P>
    <P>Power to revoke an order is normal in legislation, but in the case of section 2 the view was taken that it would be wrong for the Minister to have such power as it would effectively give him the right to suspend the operation of a free port entirely?  Once a free port is established, therefore, an Act of the Oireachtas would be required to abolish it.  In view of the huge implications for businesses and the vast investments involved, it is believed appropriate that the power, such as would be given to a Minister if the amendment were accepted, should be reserved to the Oireachtas.  On a point of clarification the power is not there for the Minister.  Once you have a free port set up, it would then require an Act of the Oireachtas to revoke that situation and return the territory to the previous standing it had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that situation.  I do not mind the Oireachtas having that power.  It is a good thing that the Oireachtas has that power.  However, it does lead me on to one further matter.  Suppose, for example, you decided to establish a free port, whether it be in Galway, Ringaskiddy or anywhere else, and you put 500 acres into it, for the sake of argument.  Suppose you discovered after a period of time that you put the wrong 500 acres in, that you wanted to leave out 250 acres and add another 250 acres; there is no doubt that you could add the other 250 acres, but can you remove the first 250 acres?  It is all right to say you can amend it but I do not know if you can amend it to the stage of taking out of a free port area something that is already in there.  I do not believe you may have that power.  The word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; may not <Col N="1472" /> be sufficient for that.  That is the problem I see.  Of course, I understand that any power in that regard should be subject to agreement of the Oireachtas and I am very happy to see that the Minister has come around to the point of view that more things should be put to the Oireachtas. Since the Minister represents the Government, I hope it represents a change of view of the Government in that regard.  I wonder whether if you had and wanted to stay at 500 acres or increase it to 600 acres but during the course of that you wanted to drop 250 acres and add a different 250 acres or 350 acres, does the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; cover that?  I ask the Minister's assurance in that regard.</P>

      <P>I take the point that is made very well by Senator O'Leary on this.  As I explained in answer to some queries which are obviously pertinent to the possible setting up of a free port at Ringaskiddy it is not necessary to have all the land mass used in one block.  You can have it in sections if you wish.  You can by order amend; but that means that you can also, if the particular area is not being used, reduce that area as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If you say you have no power to revoke, you are talking about perhaps five different areas in Ringaskiddy, you want to continue with four of them and drop one, and it is particularly strong where they are separate areas. What you are saying is that the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; means effectively that in respect of that area you can revoke the licence, because that is what you are doing.  It may well be that the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; only means that in that context you can expand it but you can never contract it.  This is the point I am making, and I am making it to be helpful.  I am not making it to be obstructive in any way but to ensure that the Minister and his successor of any party would have the maximum of flexibility in that regard, subject of course to the overriding necessity for the seeking of Oireachtas approval for whatever is deemed appropriate by the Oireachtas to get that approval.</P>

What he has not got is the power to revoke, to get rid of the territory entirely.</P>

Let us hope that this will not be a question of Ringaskiddy, that it will be expansion all the way &mdash; as I am sure it will &mdash; into several different areas and may be out further.

      <P>The only question I would put is regarding the size of the apportionment of land at Ringaskiddy.  I am rather confused after the last about between Senator O'Leary and the Minister, but I must say Senator O'Leary put the case very clearly.  The Minister, in my opinion, was rather confused as to the power he <Col N="1474" /> has which is the power to amend the order and the size of that amendment, as Senator O'Leary rightly said, down to a postage stamp size.  He makes a joke of the whole scene in my opinion.  The only thing I would say is that the figure of land does not seem to be written into any part of the Bill.  What is the size of the acreage of land, for example, which is destined for phase one, or whatever it is called, at Ringaskiddy?  That would be important for me to know.  I am not quite clear about the Minister's explanation and definition of the power to amend and the power of the Oireachtas to amend.  The Minister could amend 99.99 per cent of it and the Oireachtas would only have the power to amend .01 per cent.  The whole thing sounds rather ludicrous.</P>

I would like clarification from the Minister that we are prepared to and do consider the defining of other areas rather than just one area.  In fact we recognise that there is need for a free zone in one area and a free zone in another area within the port itself.  There are no objections to that?</P>

There is one area mentioned in connection with the free port up to 30 acres, but as far as the original comment Senator O'Leary made it is not possible for the Minister to wipe out a free port area entirely.  This would have to be by an Act of the Oireachtas. However, it is possible for him to make an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> In page 3, subsection (1), line 32, after &ldquo;Commerce&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, with the consent of such person or persons who represent companies or Local Authorities participating in the control and management of each Free Port.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put this amendment down because it is not alone my belief but my party's belief that the authoritarian attitude of the whole Bill was far too strong, with all the powers vested in the Ministry and all the powers vested in one Minister subject to certain conditions from other Ministers. We thought &mdash; and it was mentioned by many speakers on all sides &mdash; that this Bill was looked at in a wrong way.  I am afraid that, after listening to what the Minister said a few moments ago concerning the failure of free ports in certain areas in England that we are right.  I remember several Senators making the point that this Bill was too tight and close and that it should have meant what it said, a free port.  The attitude towards it should be free.  We should not have tied ourselves towards the British law on this matter.  A point that I felt at the time, and I still feel very strongly about, was that this free port will fail again because of this attitude of the Government towards the total control of the whole workings and the framework of this free port.</P>
    <P>I tried on Second Stage to bring in the IDA.  We should have brought into the whole field of free ports the local aspect and the entrepreneurship of the locality in which this port would be.  The case was very strongly made, not alone by Members on this side of the House but on the other side also.  This amendment does try to do that because I add on to it, as you can see, an amendment to insert &ldquo;and, with the consent of such persons or persons who represent companies or Local Authorities participating in the control and management of each Free Port&rdquo;.  That about covers every single person that we would want covered in it from the IDA to the local authority, through to certain port and docks boards &mdash; there are companies rather than local <Col N="1476" /> authorities.  I still feel &mdash; and I am going to press it very hard on the Minister &mdash; that before we pass this Act, we correct it and give you an instance of a different type of free port in other parts than we see here in the extreme western part of Europe.</P>
    <P>We have, I can verify it because I checked it since, a very fine performance on the island of Cyprus on the northern side, the Turkish side of the island, where the free port is going from strength to strength.  It is a free port in the sense that it is free.  Private businesses and companies have an opportunity in it.  Rather than this dictatorial attitude that is attached to this Bill, everybody who wishes it well in the community and wants to make an investment in it, including many external companies could do so. Senator Cregan made a very valid point about the Japanese cars.  I felt over the past week that the Minister might have reconsidered this point of view and that the Minister would have said to himself and suggested to the Government that maybe we have gone astray in the intentions of this, that we can correct it and that the Senators are offering an opportunity to so do.  I am, by this amendment, offering the Minister that opportunity.  I would hope that the amendment would be accepted in the sense that it is put forward.  It is not political in any sense. It is a matter of opinion.  It is opinion shared right across this House.</P>
    <P>For that purpose, we should agree to this amendment.  I think it would be accepted in the other House.  It would be better for us to go to the President with a very broadly based Bill where we are implicating all of society who wish to participate in such a project in order to make it a success.  It is imperative when talking about Ringaskiddy, about Cork and the problems created there over the last couple of years that we should not alone help but be seen to be helpful in this field.  We should stretch out the control a little bit more and I plead with the Minister to accept this amendment, because, at the end of the day, the Bill will be far better and free ports will mean free ports in the purest sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Governmental control can still be applied in a certain way, but it should not be, as it were, pounded into this new and fresh idea that is being tried first of all to help Cork.  The eyes of the country will be watching it.  I would plead with the Minister and the members of the Government to accept it so that the best possible Bill will go from this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to speak on the amendment to the section.  I made a very strong argument last week and I will make it again this week.  I see a situation, even within the section, whereby two Ministers are obliged to get involved.  Has the Minister recognised or is he prepared to say that there may be consideration by him of the setting up of a local board to run the free port with his consent and that he may be consulted by the board? The Minister is speaking about it being under the control of management or such person or persons.  What are we saying here?  The harbour board naturally will be involved.  Probably somebody else within the private sector will handle the customs side of it.  Could we see a situation where we may set up a local body to market it, to sell it and to do what they feel is best for a free zone?  As Senator Mark Killilea has said, it is the first and something different.  We had many arguments last week and I do not wish to go over them. I wonder are we being too stringent and too tightly controlled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another situation would be where: &ldquo;you may do this if I consider it&rdquo; or &ldquo;you may not do this because I do not consider it&rdquo;.  You are not going to get it moving as you have too many Ministers involved. Are we prepared to say at this stage that there will be a body or local board set up or is it for the Minister to tell the people who are managing to set up the local board?  In other words, the harbour board may be told by a Minister to set up a local board with other people.  I would not agree with that.  I do not agree with the idea of the harbour board getting total control and saying: &ldquo;we are going to set up something and are going to have a local body here&rdquo;.  The Minister should say it.  The Minister should be saying: <Col N="1478" />&ldquo;yes, I want people involved.  I want to set up something with people who are prepared to market it as a going concern, with people who have an interest and are involved in the area, from the small to the big man.  It must be good for the area.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;free&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;free zone&rdquo; are completely different from what we are already handling.  Naturally you need in my view, a massive marketing sales job to do it properly.  The Minister readily admitted in one of the sections &mdash; might I say in a totally despondent attitude &mdash; that there are already some free ports in other countries like Great Britain which are not getting off the ground.  The question must be asked, why?  I hope we are not taking the same line.  That is all I am worried about.  I get the impression that we are.</P>

I do not want a situation where we are going to have a total of three Ministers saying that you may consider this but I must speak to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Communications.  In fairness, if we are talking about something new, let us be a little more objective and constructive. Is the Minister prepared to say that the people in that area must set up their own board to sell their goods?</P>

      <P>First, in reply to the various depressing statements made by Senator Cregan just now and Senator Killilea on the grounds that there are too many regulations and that we are dampening down rather than trying to stimulate activity for our proposed free ports, I would like to say that this is a new venture.  This is an imaginative idea brought in following the examination by the Cork task force.  One of the major originators of the concept was a Member <Col N="1479" /> of this House, Senator Cregan.  I congratulate him on it.  Having accepted this idea, the Government or any other Government bringing in this is not going to go around trying to circumvent it with niggly regulations that will damage its possibility of prospering.  We want to see it getting off the ground and prospering. Naturally we will try to do everything we possibly can.  It is a fact that this whole idea is governed to a great extent by EC Regulations.  There are limitations already laid down and there is nothing we can do about it.  Talking of the north Cyprus free port, that is outside the EC. It makes its own rules.  Turkey makes its own rules as we heard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Senator Cregan say on Second Stage.  The fact remains that no one working within the free zone in Turkey pays income tax.  That is one of their own particular rules for encouragement there.  On the amendment put down by Senator Killilea, which unfortunately we cannot follow, I see precisely what he has in mind.  He has in mind local involvement.  What this section does is that it gives power to the Minister to designate an area by order.  Senator Killilea's amendment is asking that the Minister should have to have the consent of the people who will be participating.  This is before they have been made participants at all.  It is illogical in that respect. I know what he is after.  I considered if there was any Government amendment that might be introduced but a certain degree of Ministerial control is necessary for the operation and management of the free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make the following point.  Take a simple example of people seeking licences in that area.  Once it has been designated, by order, and once the management of the free port has been designated then it makes commonsense that the free port company would have a role when consideration is being given to applications for licences and for other things.  Take Cork as an example.  If the <Col N="1480" /> Cork Harbour Board get involved, if they involve some of the local authorities, if they involve local commercial interests in a package of that nature, then they are going to have a free port company.  They are going to set it up.  Once the order has been made designating the area and once the management of the free port has been appointed, the type of body will to a great extent depend on the local company.  Of course, the licences have to be given by the Minister because you cannot have a company setting up activities which which would simply divert economic activity already existing from one part of the country to another.  There has to be central control in this respect.</P>
    <P>I would visualise a major role for the free port company.  The Minister was asked in the Dáil on a previous occasion if he saw it playing a role like that of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  He did not think that it would be necessary or appropriate bearing in mind the small initial scale of the operation at Ringaskiddy and the range of State agencies already there catering for the promotion of such an area as this.  We must remember also that we may have free ports in other parts of the country. They need not necessarily be sea ports; they could be airports.  Depending on the viability and economic activity generated by Cork for the financial wealth of the country, jobs in particular, obviously we are going to have a look at other areas. Indeed, there are other areas waiting in the queue.  I am sure Senator Killilea will probably be mentioning before the end of the debate, his own area, the Connacht Regional Airport, as a possibility.  I have heard considerable talk about it in recent times.  Perhaps, Galway and Shannon have made their case already in these debates.</P>
    <P>On this particular matter I do not think it makes sense to dilute the control the Minister has by making it necessary for him to consult or seek the consent of a person or persons designated in the order.  This same amendment was rejected on Committee Stage in the Dáil and the argument advanced then against <Col N="1481" /> the amendment still holds good.  I see precisely what he has in mind.  Once the initial free port has been set up &mdash; take the case of Ringaskiddy &mdash; the free port company will be the mainstay of the activity and be an important factor, giving a key position to the local interests there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what the Minister said.  He can contradict himself at times.  I do not envisage an advisory board.  This country is poisoned with advisory boards.  They have no decision making powers.  They make recommendations, they pray they might be listened to, but that is the end of it. Advisory boards should be debarred.  I say that with honesty.  I have seen so many of them.  I have seen them in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I have seen them in the health boards today.  It is a joke, to say the least of it. You either have the power to do something or you have not.  There is nothing in this Bill which states that this board will have the power to grant licences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Consultative&rdquo; is a very nice word.  I would not be so alarmed about it but for the Department of Finance.  Whether you have a good or bad Minister for Finance, the rule of the masters lies within that Department. Therefore it is not easy to hope that what the Minister says is what you will get at the end of the day, because the Department of Finance is great for decoying.  The people in Cork are crying out for work and looking for entrepreneurship. They have been severely let down in the last two years so far as industry is concerned.  Industry in Cork was the envy of every person who ever drove along the road from Cork city as far as Cobh because there was nothing but work plant after work plant, thousands and thousands of people at work in the finest industries one could see.  It is not the same today.  It is a very sad sight. We want to do something positive about it, but in this Bill we are giving power to <Col N="1482" /> the Minister, who must have the consent of the Minister for Finance and the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Any purchaser would want to have a look at the commodity he is buying, but when he sees the restrictive nature of this, he will be reluctant to buy. In my remarks on Second Stage I said that this was a copycat of what went on in Britain.  I have made further investigations since and it is a copycat of what is going on in Britain, and that is not successful.</P>
      <P>To come in here and tell us that it is EC regulations which tell us what to do is the greatest load of nonsense.  Hamburg is in the European Community, but there are no EC directives to tell them what to do: they will do as they feel and dare anybody stand in their way &mdash; and, rightly so, because they have been a success. I do not think we can hide under so-called directives.  If the directive does not suit us, we should be adjusting it to suit ourselves as a nation.  The aim of political life is to achieve the possible and try to achieve the impossible.  If we keep that in front of us as a guideline we will be doing well.</P>
      <P>I am not saying the Minister should not have the overall power and have people responsible to him.  But I will read section 4 for you:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, grant or refuse to grant to any person a licence authorising the carrying on with a free port of any trade, business or manufacture.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain where he is having consultations on that section of the Bill with anybody other than with the other two Ministers, because it is not there?  There is no point in saying, in regard to the granting of licences, that a consultative body has a say in it.  You and I know it: Ministers will come and Ministers will go, but the Civil Service will go on forever.  I guarantee the Minister that, if he is about to make a decision, it will not be long until the Act is fired at him and his hands will be tied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment in the spirit in which I move it: so that there can be a contribution from local entrepreneurship to provide the marketing expertise so necessary to sell it.  It would be a far better Act, and the people in Cork have the ability to prove it so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, but I would not go as deep as Senator Killilea. However, I understand the points he has made about other free ports and particularly those in the European Community. I have seen one of them, and I do not understand why we should be standing by the rules.  We are in the Community, but there are rules to obey and there are rules to break.  I am not going to bring about a situation in Cork where we are going to stand idly by.  This Bill provides us with a great opportunity.  Are we going to have a situation where somebody somewhere says &ldquo;You cannot do this because of Community rules&rdquo; when within the same Community no rules are binding?  That is why they are getting the work and they make no apologies to anybody.</P>
      <P>In section 3, you are saying that the management and control of free ports can be allocated to a person or persons. If you are giving the control to them, why are you saying that they must then always have the consent of three Ministries?  If there was only one it would not be so bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to you what it says?  It talks about the consent of these people at the time the Minister is making the decision about the control and management, but after that it passes <Col N="1484" /> out of the control: it is not the continuous consent of these two people.  The Senator should read what it says.  It says:</P>
      <P>Each free port established under this Act shall be under the control and management or such person or persons as may be designated by order by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Imagine the situation when this legislation is passed, the Minister will have to decide to whom he is going to give the control of the Galway &mdash; or Ringaskiddy &mdash; free port.  That is the decision he will have to take.  He may decide that he will give the control to a group of individuals or to a company.  The Minister will have to get the consent, in writing, of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When he gets that consent, they have the control and they do not need the consent of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do anything else.</P>

    <P>What Senator Killilea is suggesting is that when the Minister decides to give control to a group &mdash; for example, in Ringaskiddy, he is going to have to decide to give the control and management of the free port to some group &mdash; that he should look for the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the consent of local authorities participating in the control and management of each free port and the consent of other persons who represent companies in the free port.  In other words, what the Senator is suggesting is that you add to the number of people from whom you must receive consent. This section deals with one particular thing; it is handing over control to a group of individuals, that is all that is covered by the section.  The Minister is suggesting that before he makes that decision he must consult with and get the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce.  What Senator Killilea is suggesting is that the Minister must get consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, of <Col N="1485" /> local authorities and of all others who are involved in the management of every freeport, who are not yet picked.  What the amendment is proposing to do is to add an additional group of people &mdash; a group of people who cannot yet be identified &mdash; whose consent is necessary before the decision under the section can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Supposing, for example, that the Minister would have to get the consent of the rivals?  It does not make any sense.  The amendment is only adding to the difficulties, and not helping.</P>
      <P>I understand what Senator Killilea is getting at &mdash; that the local authorities should have some say in the matter.  I accept that.  Unfortunately, the amendment adds to the problem; it does not help the problem.  If I had thought of an amendment I would co-operate with any Senator in putting one down to achieve that objective.  Unfortunately, the time has gone when we can do that, Perhaps it could be done on Report Stage.  The reality of the situation is that at the moment where the Minister wants to designate the control and management to a person or a group of individuals he will have to make up his own mind and he will have to get the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce to that act &mdash; and that is all. There is no more consent necessary after that.  He has to get an initial consent. What the amendment suggests is that, in addition to getting the consent from the two other Ministers, that consent will be necessary from the local authorities and other people participating in the ports in the area.  That is only adding further confusion to this and it does not solve the problem.  This is a genuine problem that is before the House.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary has now <Col N="1486" /> admitted that the Minister is prepared to give control and management to somebody to run the free port.  Is the Minister prepared to consider the idea of setting up a local body to run the free port?  The management of a free port will naturally go to the harbour board.  I presume that they will be the strong contenders.  We already have a harbour board in Cork in which there is local authority participation, but I feel we should be doing better with it.  The harbour board is composed of business people who are involved in the workings of the port &mdash; rightly so, and I have no objections to this.  The facts are that if the management and control are granted to this board, can we feel that we are good enough as a marketing body? It is all very well to say that we will manage it and control it, but will we sell it?  This is the point.  Is the Minister prepared to consider the idea of setting up people to sell it?  For instance, there was an argument in Cork in late 1984, when we were involved in trying to sell Cork in 1985.  We created the Cork 800, which was a very good idea.  We solved our problem.  That is marketing.  That idea sold very well and a lot of work went into it.  Because of Cork 800, we considered the idea of an enterprise board for Cork in 1986 to sell Cork again in the years ahead.  We had a lot of people on the board.  It was a 32-member one with an executive board of 15 or 16 people.  I am not saying that the same thing should happen in regard to the free port, but it must be sold and marketed.</P>

      <P>I have one question to put to the Minister.  Could he define if it is going to be in a person or persons, if what he said in reply to Senator O'Leary is going to be the case?  This is not the way that I interpret it.  If it is going to be that way, will the management of the free port or of any other free port to follow &mdash; this will be the first example and things will be learned from it &mdash; be on a yearly basis, a five yearly basis, or a ten yearly basis? How many persons will be involved in the management?  It is not just good enough now to say that the Minister would only have to get the consent once.</P>

      <P>In that respect, as designated by section 3, the control and management is granted to a person or persons.  This is obviously likely to be a number of interests.  To give an example of what is happening now in Ringaskiddy in Cork, what I would hope is that a consortium of local interests would put a detailed package to my Department seeking to be designated under the section.  The consortium would also propose the land area to be designated and to be declared the free port area under section 2.</P>

That is not to suggest that proposals should not be made by other people which would be considered by the Minister. He would see which is the best package coming forward in the interests of Ringaskiddy free port and in the interest of the local Cork community.  The Minister would examine that particular situation.</P>

      <P>I do not envisage the Industrial Development Authority getting involved.  I shall deal with that in a moment as regards the packaging of it. The chances are that the person or persons designated under the section will have a significant local involvement.  I agree with this and of the absolute necessity and the value of local involvement. This is highly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the further point which Senator Killilea has raised, once a person or persons has been designated by order then that remains the case until it is revoked <Col N="1488" /> by order and they opt out of the situation. There is no time limit as such.  It is only right to say at this stage that, irrespective of what Senator Killilea may say, and perhaps Senator Cregan as well, who brought the Turkish ideas to our attention, the fact remains that, whether we like it or not, we must conform to the EC regulations.  There is no way around this. We have got to conform to them.  It is not our wish, but they exist, and this is the regulation for any free ports being established.  Naturally, there is a considerable similarity between what we have on the ground and what the British have put on the ground for the simple reason that we are both conforming to the existing set of very strict regulations. Naturally, where there is any flexibility, we would be interested in that, where the ingenuity of the Cork people in the Ringaskiddy free port or the people in any other free port around the country in the future can show this.  But we will have to conform to the rules as they exist at the moment in the entire customs free zone of the European Community.  It is important because the Government, through the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, and the Oireachtas, have a responsibility to the EC for the administration of the Community's custom regime and for the effect of VAT concessions on the Exchequer and things of that nature.  Therefore, I think it would be inappropriate that powers reserved to the State in this Bill in those particular respects could be exercised with the consent of non-governmental bodies.  However, I believe that the local operating company will become the absolute key factor in this.  In Cork, as things are emerging, it will have a strong and perhaps total local representation.  Naturally the Minister is anxious to see all possible offers that come forward.  However I know what Senator Killilea is driving at. I think there is an illogicality about the amendment as put down which was so very clearly delineated by Senator O'Leary in his remarks.  This is giving the Minister power to make the order with the consent of the other Ministers.  At this stage no person has been designated <Col N="1489" /> and I do not see how then you could seek the consent of such person or persons who represent companies or local authorities participating in the local operation of each free port.  I have given this a lot of consideration, but I regret it is not possible to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment speaks clearly for itself &mdash; that if a licence is refused to any person such person shall have the right of an appeal to the courts. I do not have to elaborate on that.  That is a reasonable request.  I will not get political about it except to say that not too long ago we saw that favouritism could come into certain appointments and certain applications made for certain things.  We should guard against such acts by any Government.  We are supposed to be living in the era of honesty and integrity, as announced by a certain section of parliamentarians.  I have said here on several occasions that I have grown to hate those two words, because those who speak about honesty and integrity are insinuating that other politicians might not have such a sense of honesty and integrity.  There is an old phrase &mdash; judge not and you shall not be judged.  In this instance, since we are in the era of honesty and integrity, we should at least be seen to be impartial about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have faith in the courts in this land. from the District Court upwards.  If the lower court is not satisfactory, there is an <Col N="1490" /> option within the law to appeal to a higher one.  Every person should be given a fair crack of the whip.  Whatever Senator O'Leary might have said about giving consent only once, this time, in regard to the granting of licences after consultation, it is slightly different.  You can have many consultations about many things, but I would like to see enshrined in all our legislation faith in the fairness of the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration has been given to these two amendments.  Amendment No. 4 deals with the power of the Minister for the granting or deciding on applications for licences.  It is thought best that this must rest with the Minister responsible for the legislation.  It would not be right if control over the type of applicant or business licensed to operate within the free port should rest elsewhere than with a Minister, in view of the implications for the Exchequer, the operations of the Revenue Commissioners for industrial location policy inherent in the licencing function.  There is also the question of relocation of industry rather than the generating of new industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 5, which is on section 7, this is the question of the power of the Minister to revoke a licence at short notice.  Normally the Minister would exercise his powers under this section only after the conviction of a licensee of an offence under section 6 (2) of the Bill.  However, there is always the possibility of a protracted interval between detection and conviction.  As a free port would be an area free from normal customs controls, substantial losses of revenue could occur in the interval. To deal with the relevant points that Senator Killilea has made &mdash; the question of an appeal to the courts is the import of both of his amendments &mdash; ministerial decisions under these sections may be challenged in the High Court as being not in accordance with natural justice or on other similar grounds.  This is the position that obtains generally in law as regards ministerial decisions.  In general, the right of appeal is not a feature of legislation, not usually written into it; it would be <Col N="1491" /> bad law to provide for a right of appeal where such exists in law generally.  Furthermore, if the amendment were accepted it would then tend to undermine <Col N="1492" /> the position in relation to other legislation where a similar provision does not specifically exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 22 and 23, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) a company of which the licensee is an officer is convicted of an offence against the Customs Acts.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 7 is to allow the Minister to revoke a licence if he is satisfied that there has been a breach of condition of the licence, or if the licensee is convicted of an offence under the Customs Act.</P>
      <P>In considering this section, I noticed that many of the activities carried on by people which give rise to offences under the Customs Act may, from time to time, give rise to a situation where the company itself would be guilty of an offence under the Customs Act.  Therefore I propose that we would add to that a subsection with the following effect: that, in addition to the two circumstances in (a) and (b) where the Minister may at his discretion revoke the licence, a third one would be added which would have the effect of ensuring that if a company of which the licensee is an officer &mdash; in other words if the company which the person was a director or a secretary of was convicted of an offence under the Customs Acts &mdash; then the Minister would be in a similar position, not that he would have to revoke the licence but that he could in the circumstances consider the question of revoking the licence at that stage.  It improves the legislation and I am confident that the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that, following the pattern that has been established with customs-free airports, licences would invariably be issued in the name of companies rather than of individuals. In these circumstances the type of situation envisaged by the proposed amendment will not arise in practice.  In any event, it is considered that legal difficulties could ensue if the amendments were to be accepted.  For example, the suggestion that an individual can be penalised in relation to his own separate activities <i>vis-a-vis</i> the free port because a company of which he happens to be an officer is convicted of a customs offence <Col N="1495" /> in relation to its activities along a land frontier might be open to challenge in the courts.  For this reason it is felt that the amendment might go too far.  I believe the amendment is unnecessary in this case.  The section, as laid down, clearly covers all eventualities.  If we proceeded along the lines suggested by Senator O'Leary we might, in fact, be going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowhere in the Bill does it suggest that a licensee must be a limited liability company.  It may well be that the practice might turn out like that.  I am seeking to cater for the situation where the licensee would be an individual or would be some other kind of body &mdash; for example, harbour commissioners &mdash; but that the company or individual involved would be convicted of an offence against the Customs Acts.  That is an offence which might not take place within the free port at all.  He might be convicted of an offence somewhere else.  I do not see any good reason for not accepting the amendment but I am not pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which I have no doubt the Minister is going to accept.  In view of the positive nature he has adopted towards all the remainder of the amendments I have no doubt he will adopt exactly the same attitude towards this amendment.  The purpose of the amendment is to make the offence of carrying on business within the port area without a licence an offence <Col N="1496" /> under the Customs Acts.  The effect of that is that it would in itself become an offence in respect of which the Minister might revoke a licence, if a licence existed, or at least would be a strong indication to the Minister of the person's unwillingness to obey the rules and regulations which are necessary for the official running of these free ports.  There is no new offence being created by my amendment. It is merely ensuring that the offence which is being created by section 9 is for the purpose of this Act considered an offence under the Customs Acts with the corresponding obligations and opportunities which that gives to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The offence provided for in section 9 is <i>prima facie</i> an offence against the Free Ports Bill when enacted. The offence in question is not one against the Customs Acts and so the amendment here would not be appropriate.  Section 17 (2) provides that the Act so far as relating to customs, shall be construed together into the Customs Acts.  In the normal course, however, section 9 would not normally fall to be construed with the Customs Acts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" />&ldquo;(2)  An officer of customs and excise must, before exercising any powers under subsections (3), (4) or (5) of this section, inform the person in control of the vehicle, ship, boat, hovercraft or aircraft of his wish to exercise such power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which I am quite sure the Minister will have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting in view of the constructive attitude he has adopted in regard to all the remaining amendments. I have no doubt he will adopt the same constructive attitude in this regard.  The purpose of this amendment is to fetter in some small way the most extraordinary power which is given under section 11. The power given under section 11 is that any person in that area &ldquo;driving or in control of, a vehicle in motion within 32 kilometres of a free port shall stop the vehicle on being required to do so by an officer of the customs and excise&rdquo;.  In other words, I could be coming out of my house on a Tuesday morning, because I am within 32 kilometres of where the free port will be, and a customs officer can hold his hand up and say &ldquo;You must stop. I want to search your car&rdquo;.  The thing is asinine.  First of all, the 32 kilometres in distance is crazy.  The power is obscene and the manner in which it is drafted is grotesque.  The purpose of my amendment is in some way to ameliorate that problem by introducing a similar subsection. I am still allowing him to stop you under subsection (1):</P>
    <P>The person driving or in control of, a vehicle in motion within 32 kilometres of a free port shall stop the vehicle on being required to do by an officer of customs and excise.</P>
    <P>That would not be affected by my amendment. But what he would have to do then would be covered by my amendment. &ldquo;An officer of customs and excise must, before exercising any powers under subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section, inform the person in control of the vehicle, ship, boat or hovercraft or aircraft of his wish to exercise such power&rdquo;.  He must tell the man what he is about.  He cannot <Col N="1498" /> just say &ldquo;I am from the customs and excise and I want to search your car&rdquo;.  He must say &ldquo;I am from the customs and excise.  You are within 32 kilometres of a free port.  Under section 11 of the Act I have the power to stop you and under the succeeding sections I have the power to search you, and I want you to do that&rdquo;. The only thing my amendment is doing is imposing on him a statutory obligation to explain to the person what he is doing and why he is doing it.  It may well be that he already will have that implicit obligation in any case.  I am not satisfied with that.  All I am saying is that, before giving officers of the customs and excise the power to stop me when I come out my front gate in the morning, if they do stop me they have to tell me why they are stopping me.  If they want to search my vehicle, if they want me to truthfully answer all the questions put to me &mdash; in other words, what age is your wife? &mdash; in relation to the journey or the goods of the vehicle, where did you go to and where are you coming from, I think it is reasonable that before that you would find out that they are talking about the free ports legislation and that you would not be confronted with a situation where an officer of the customs and excise would stop you, that you would be asked questions and put under a statutory obligation to answer them, ignorant of the fact that you were under an obligation because you did not know which section or which Act was obliging you to answer the questions.</P>
    <P>The thing is asinine in the extreme.  All I am trying to do is make it slightly less asinine.  I am trying to ensure that the officer of the customs and excise who is exercising the power is under an obligation to explain it to the person.  An officer of the customs and excise, before exercising any of the powers, must inform the person in control of his wish to exercise such powers.  In other words, he has to say to him &ldquo;I have powers under section 11 (3), (4), (5) of the Free Ports Act to search your vehicle and I want to do that&rdquo;.  At least you know what the man is doing.  He is not just stopping you, telling you get out of your car and to <Col N="1499" /> tell him where you are coming from and where you are going to and did you sleep with your wife last night or did you sleep with someone else's wife, in so far as that is relevant to the operation of free ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  That is all I want, and I am confident that the Minister will see the wisdom of what I am proposing.  I am confident he will accept the amendment.  I am confident that he will go back to the other House and persuade the Members that it is a good amendment made by the Seanad, that it should not be abolished and that as a result of that the Minister will have made a friend for life and the House itself will have shown the importance it attaches to the freedom of the individual because this is what we are talking about under this section &mdash; the freedom of the individual.</P>
      <P>These things must be exercised in a reasonable fashion.  We had day upon day of discussion.  We were talking about the Criminal Justice Act.  It was right and proper that we should have these days of discussion.  We are giving similar powers, even bigger powers to an officer of the customs and excise who is not a member of the Garda Síochána at all.  He is just an ordinary man like you or me dressed up in a little bit of gold braid and we are giving him the power to stop a person within 32 kilometres of the free port and ask him if he was sleeping with his own or someone else's wife last night, if that is a relevant question under the free ports legislation, or any other question he considers relevant.  It can be made relevant with the ingenuity of customs and excise men, for which they are rightly famous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all those reasons I am confident of the support of the Minister in this amendment.  Indeed, if the Minister thinks that my amendment is not strong enough, and if he wants to take the section out altogether, or to amend the section, I will give him every support and help in doing that.  I am not stuck up at all. <Col N="1500" /> I do not mind whether these individual words are used or other words.  Some control on the exercise of these powers should be written into the legislation.  I am sure the Minister will wave his hand grandly now and tell us that that is all catered for under our constitutional rights.  It may well be, but not only should it be catered for under our constitutional rights it should be catered for in black and white.  At the same time as you are giving the person the power, you should indicate to them that they must exercise that power reasonably.  For that reason, I am confident of the Minister's support on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points before I start answering specifically.  The Senator seems to be giving the impression that I take some pleasure in not accepting, or in refusing his thoroughly researched amendments.  Quite the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only one, any amendment.  It does not matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a lot of thought to all of these.  I regretfully had to reject them.  I would have been very pleased if it were possible to incorporate them because I believe in this constructive input during the course of debates in either House.  I also must commend the Senator for having succeeded in introducing a sex element into the Free Ports Bill. It is the only possibility that this piece of legislation will ever get on page 3.  Senator O'Leary has succeeded in doing that now.</P>
      <P>But regarding the specifics, I would like to point out that precisely the same regulation as is in this section operates in the Customs (Free Airport) Act, 1947, which is 40 years on the ground.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Tras Honan will be able to verify that that has caused no undue difficulties in the Clare area and within 20 miles or 32 kilometers of the free airport zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deal with the argument involved, in so far as the present subsection is concerned it would normally &mdash; admittedly, <Col N="1501" /> not written into it &mdash; be the practice of an officer of the customs and excise to tell the person in charge of the vehicle of his intention to carry out a search and examine and take account of the goods in the vehicle.  Of course, the customs officer as such has certain powers vested in him by virtue of his commission and under the various Acts.  But the problem that arises here is that if Senator O'Leary's amendment was accepted the officer would not be in a position to search the vehicle if it were unattended.  This would be most undesirable and would create difficulties.  That is the difficulty that we found about this particular amendment. It is appropriate that the officer should have reasonable powers of search, even while a vehicle is unattended.  Then there is the other difficulty, which anyone who ever listened to or sat through court cases on customs offences along the Border is aware of, of a vehicle being abandoned very quickly once stopped by a customs officer.  If the particular amendment went through and the person in charge had left, then the customs officer would naturally not have the opportunity of stating his intentions about this and searching the vehicle.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Finance to establish a Commission on all aspects of credit, and its availability, such a Commission to address itself <i>inter alia</i> to the problem of money lending, both by unlicensed moneylenders and by those with licences charging over the legal rate; that it further incorporates a review of the provision and curtailment of credit in different circumstances and to different groups by commercial banking systems and that it reviews the long-term requirements in relation to credit of vulnerable groups, individuals, businesses, etc. and that it reviews these matters from the perspective of protecting consumers and that finally it be empowered to review any such matter as it shall deem appropriate for the pursuance of its objects.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure speaking to this motion on behalf of the Labour Party group.  It addresses a number of points. Perhaps I should isolate what I think are the principle points.  It calls on Seanad Éireann and the Minister for Finance to establish a commission on all aspects of credit.  The purpose of this is that the more flagrant abuses of the provision of credit, for example in dramatic fashion by unlicensed moneylenders or by licensed moneylenders charging over the rate, have to be put in the context of credit availability from the former institutions as well as the latter.  The second aspect of it is the adequacy of the legislation and the implementation of legislative protection in the case of both licensed and unlicensed moneylenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect is that it specifically <Col N="1503" /> includes the credit provided by the commercial banking sector in so far as it says that a commission should review the circumstances in which credit is provided and curtailed for different sectors.  What I have in mind &mdash; I will develop this &mdash; is in relation particularly to the farming sector and the small business sector.  I make no apology for suggesting that the price of agricultural land in the years immediately following Irish accession to the European Community was grossly inflated by the availability of credit for the purchase of land and expectations of high output in relation to milk and what was assumed to be related to agricultural profits.  On that occasion the credit available to members of the farming community was little more than an auction being conducted in the offices of the different bank managers.  I am particularly worried about the small business sector who have often been encouraged to borrow but who are asked at the same time to accept a change of philosophy without consultation or without conditions being explained as to why circumstances have now changed.</P>
    <P>The motion also makes reference to the long term requirements of different vulnerable groups, individuals, businesses and so forth.  The history of banking in Ireland has shown that there are people to whom the formal provision of credit is made available.  I worked on one area in relation to the provision of credit in the 19th century.  It was very clear that the activities, for example, of usurious gombeenmen, as they were called then, arose because of the fact that the people to whom they lent money did not qualify by the standards of what was then an extended banking system.  Equally there are particular points in the life cycle of borrowing families in relation to credit.</P>
    <P>The motion makes reference to two other factors.  One is the need for a consumer protection, that is, adequate information and explanation for those borrowing so that they will know what it is they are undertaking.  It finally asks the commission to investigate any other <Col N="1504" /> matter that is appropriate for the pursuance of its objects.  What I have in mind is that it would look, if it felt it was necessary, at the terms and circumstances of hire purchase provision and the credit components of such hire purchase provision, be it by private undertakings or even by the sales section of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I will make a couple of points in relation to the urgency of this.  I should like the movers of the motion to think again about moving an amendment.  I find it difficult to accept the amendment as worded in so far as it notes measures that have been announced.  I welcome these but they do not go far enough.  It seems to exclude consideration of the credit policy of the commercial banks and to concentrate entirely on the operation of licensed and unlicensed moneylenders in the main Act.  The banks have only enjoyed this separation from conventional moneylending since 1971.  The Moneylending Act, 1900, included a specific reference to banks.  In 1971 they were excluded from the main Act.  I want them included.  That is one of the reasons why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The background to this resolution is one of misery.  The social and economic environment which is exploited by unlicensed moneylenders had drawn comment from people who have worked among the poor and vulnerable sections of the community.  The more dramatic cases can be cited by many people.  I am interested in these, but I do not want to base my case on these alone.  The social and economic environment of those who are the prey of unlicensed moneylenders should concern us.  For example, unlicensed and licensed moneylenders charging more than the official rate of 39 per cent have concentrated on specific moments in the life cycle of families at risk.  At any time in Galway city my quest for information suggests that in a new local authority housing estate one may expect up to three different companies to canvass door to door asking people if they want to borrow money for furniture for their new home.  Equally at times of First Communion and Confirmation &mdash; times <Col N="1505" /> that are important symbolically in the lives of people &mdash; one can expect them to call to the door offering credit.  People should know what they are doing but I doubt that this is the case.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of such a commission is to address the adequacy of the legal provision and protection that exist at the moment.  The licensed moneylenders quote any figure over the official rate of 39 per cent.  In some cases the figures given to members of the St. Vincent de Paul have been as high as 77 per cent.  They are used to construing this as a service charge.  In other words, you are paying for the individual to come to your door to extort what is an illegal proportion of interest.  This is a flagrant violation of the law.  I will get a little more earthy about this.  At present charitable and voluntary organisations have great difficulty in eliciting information on specific cases and getting people who are being charged these illegally high rates to come forward. There were seven cases reported to the gardaí in Galway city before July 1985. There have been no prosecutions in these seven cases.</P>
    <P>When I ask people about the operation of the law the impression I get is that it is a vague area.  There is some kind of understanding that it is difficult to establish the additional income beyond the 39 per cent and maybe it is best left alone. The alternative, it is suggested, is that moneylending will be driven underground and everything will get a great deal worse.  That is a bad practice in law and it should be addressed.  I am hoping to make that point as constructively as I can.  I have examined the lending companies. I said they charge over 39 per cent.  One company has described this as &ldquo;service charges&rdquo;.  Another has described it as &ldquo;reasonable fees&rdquo; and another has said that 20 per cent is a reasonable increment to charge for calling to one's door and looking for payment of what is due. That is one aspect of the whole case.</P>
    <P>There is the question of unlicensed and licensed moneylenders.  There is equally the problem in integrating the registration process of the Revenue Commissioners and the question of what is <Col N="1506" /> required by way of licence from the District Court.  It is imprecise and not sufficiently strong.  One of the purposes of this commission would be to look at the law.  Maybe the Legislature is a bit slower than the public in this regard.  The public opprobrium directed against extortionist moneylending is quite considerable. I believe it is not accidential that the New Ireland Assurance Company decided to unload one of its bodies, the Jordan Estates, for that reason. Public opprobrium is somehow attached to the general holding company by the activities of moneylending.  I do not believe people should approach these subjects in fear or ignorance.  I would welcome education on credit within the school system.  It is one of the basic procedures in life that one needs to know about.</P>
    <P>This enables me to turn to the conventional credit policy.  I do not believe the banking system provides adequate information to those to whom it lends.  I doubt very much if the people, for example, who have gone from the status of overdraft customers to term loan customers and who might have been passed on to the finance company associated with one of the commercial banks, always know what exact changes are taking place in relation to the rate of interest that is being charged.  I wonder why it is that, when I go into a small shop and see the price of Mars bars and packets of Beanos displayed under threat of the law, there are not displayed in the banks charts indicating what the true rates of interest are for specific terms of loans in particular circumstances?  This is not met by saying: details of our credit policy are available on request.  This is not just good enough. It is a different principle altogether to the old one of consumer protection in relation to the display of price lists and so on, which was a mitigation of the old principle of <i>caveat emptor.</i></P>
    <P>The most controversial part of the motion is that the supply of money by the commercial banking sector &mdash; even where it is being provided &mdash; has been totally insufficient.  If one wanted to be a private market person looking into the <Col N="1507" /> supply of credit one should look at the manner in which it is being provided.  I have given an instance in the farming sector.  Equally, anybody who has run a business knows very well that there are circumstances in which money will be practically fired at you and there are others at present where you will be asked to reduce overdrafts and to keep within certain limits.  I am not advocating profligacy but I am asking for a logic.  We are in an interesting phase in the history of economics.  I will give an example of it. Capital intensity within industry is increasing. The number of unemployed people is going up and even within nationalised industries in Britain there are fewer employees.  The traditional pattern of savings and investment has changed.  You have to ask yourselves what kind of changes you need in credit policy to handle a new situation in which you are trying to do something about unemployment.</P>
    <P>A dissociation has been established in the history of credit commercial banking in both Britain and Ireland.  It is a dissociation between savings and investment. This is important.  For example, in the history of savings there used to be a pattern in Britain where people saved and invested their money in shares and so on. One of the great changes between 1940 and 1980 is that whereas in 1940 80 per cent of investment was by private shareholders on the basis of their own savings, by 1980 it was only 40 per cent.  What happened was that the great institutional investors had come on the scene and thus the assets of building societies, banks and managed pension funds had risen.  We now have the octopus principle, if you like.  This is where savings are sucked into a central point and investment decisions are made in terms of a philosophy that is usually justified in an ethic such as: &ldquo;We are really looking after our depositors' funds.&rdquo;  I read this in the annual reports of the building societies.  With the greatest will in the world, the investment pattern of the major institutional investors has been in terms of a very conservative investment policy.  It has been in the most <Col N="1508" /> conservative possible areas.  You have to ask, is that the philosophy that will give you the investment which will in turn give the jobs at times when the market is not providing them.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons in relation to the whole question of credit and the gathering in of savings.  One of the important points is that the time limit of the policy of the commercial banking sector has been short.  By European comparisons, it is among the shortest.  In relation to the security that they have looked for, they have been extraordinarily conservative. I meet a number of business people who tell me that not only have they to secure their borrowings with deeds or with particular assets of the company but they are asked to give personal guarantees as well.  The history of many a business that has failed and many a family that has been ruined is one of the initial borrowings.  So much collateral has had to be given that the company has no fall-back position for expansion or investment.  In a totally inhuman way somebody who was once a customer has become a victim.  The silence in this regard that has descended on this island is interesting.  I wrote elsewhere that it was rather like mental illness; it affected most families but most people were afraid to speak about it.  I still hold that opinion.</P>
    <P>The commercial banking sector is not, by market criteria, competing.  In this regard there is an unanswerable case for the development of a giro system through the post offices.  With regard to all those people who are arguing about the business of avoiding deposit taxes and who want to save their money, it would be easy for those who have entitlements to move from one counter within a post office to another counter and deposit their money if they so wished.  One can only look at the ideological reasons why people are opposed to a post office giro system being developed.  Equally, if we wanted to introduce an element of competition into banking services, there are no obstacles being placed in the way of the building societies moving into the provision of full banking services.</P>
    <P>I am more interested in the inadequate <Col N="1509" /> philosophy, strategy, supply and policy of credit that the commercial banking sector has.  I am not terribly interested in old-fashioned pieces of theological arguments saying the market will decide. What is the market?  The fact of the matter is that a credit policy is about investment.  I cannot see the point of going to the polls to an electorate and saying that you are worried about this aspect of the economy or another, you are worried about there being socially productive investment or you are setting up institutional models such as the National Development Corporation while at the same time you are allowing this rather primitive, conservative, weak commercial banking sector to dominate in areas of credit.  To link this second part of my argument with the first: a great deal of the reason why many people are forced into the grip of moneylenders is the unavailability of credit to them by the commercial banking sector.  In relation to the whole question of wives borrowing only with the consent of their husbands, to what extent is that not a contributory factor towards people borrowing from what are even more unaccountable credit sources than the banks themselves?  I suspect that it is a very significant factor.</P>
    <P>We have to ask the question as to what credit philosophy and credit policy the commercial banks work under.  The standard of interaction between them and their customers has radically changed in the last few years.  There are now in different regions and in different cities and towns, credit committees established. Thus managers are no longer answering their customers straightforwardly in terms of their creditworthiness. I have stated by analogy of an octupus that there is need for a sectoral credit policy.  One can speak about the likely credit needs of small businesses, the likely forms of credit that can be provided for different kinds of small businesses and so forth.  I will give a practical example of this and people need a lot of practical examples, as I have noticed in recent years, when they are trying to make sense of economics.  If a person is starting his own business, does not own a house and <Col N="1510" /> does not have the personal guarantees, does this mean that he should be denied credit?  It does, of course, in the Irish system because one can only borrow on terms of fixed assets.  One will get no credit whatsoever for ideas.  As more and more people in the retail sector are telling me, neither can one get any credit in relation to turnover.  What we are speaking about, therefore, is an island full of people many of whom have ideas, who want to invest and who have a conservative credit policy that precludes lending on anything other than on 19th century credit principles.  This matter should be addressed.  I do not want to anticipate the precise manner in which this should be done.  It is far beyond time that the whole basic Central Bank Act, 1942, which governs the relationship of the Central Bank and the commercial banks was looked at to try to direct savings towards investment in socially purposeful ways. We can assist in this rather than demanding it, in so far as we can do it by the structure of taxes and allowances.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is an interesting one.  There are some surveys which suggest that both in Britain and Ireland many people who save would like to see their savings invested in their own particular region and in activities that would be socially purposeful and so forth.  As it is at present they are sucked into the central vacuum cleaner which not only invests conservatively but often speculatively.  The Minister would probably be able to give figures, I have not got them at present but the enormous rise in the purchase of fine art in recent years is little else than naked speculation.  The credit policy by the major banks has been towards assisting such speculative activity rather than towards assisting genuine productive activity.</P>
    <P>The other parts of this resolution simply ask for consumer protection.  I have said sufficient on that.  We are entitled to clear guidelines as to what our obligations are, and so forth.  I want to make one or two points on the philosophy behind what I am saying.  It is a simple <Col N="1511" /> belief that, to our cost, we have dissociated savings and investment in a certain way, and unless we think about how we manage the supply and flow of credit we are going to be significantly handicapped in developing a response towards problems like employment and productivity. The changes that are taking place are ones that are challenging the conservative and orthodox views of economic and financial services.  The traditional markets of the conservative financial institutions have been to invest very conservatively in very secure investment.  I mentioned gilts, commodities, fine art, farmland, commercial and industrial property.  It is not an accident and I did not invent it to see where most of the banking services are located.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the correction, Senator, as I am sure you know them as well.  I hope that in supporting this resolution you will assist them in their plight.  The other point I want to make is in relation to the whole question of where savings go.  We have to try to overcome our antipathy to the State in this regard.  There is, somehow or another, a view circulating that if you interfere in any way with what are effectively private, unaccountable decisions by the commercial banks you are involved in some way ruining the economy.  I want to make the point that it is not the State sector which went running for <Col N="1512" /> Government protection when the financial institutions were placed under what was perceived to be a threat in the last couple of years.  If a State company did that, in many cases they would have encountered the opprobrium of the public.  It is very interesting to speak about the different levels of credit available to different people and groups. I assert that more credit has been more easily and more often available to people who speculate within the economy than to many people who could have been productive in their work and created employment.  That is the nub of the argument.</P>
      <P>I am simply saying on the whole question of a commission, that when you look at the most miserable people exploited by moneylenders, you need to examine the whole issue of the structure of credit. Where is the financial accountability within these large institutions?  It might be said there is a fundamental accountability to their depositors.  Where is the discussion by depositors on what is investment policy?  I will go much further than that.  I remember reading the debate at the time of the establishment of building societies.  The assumption was that their primary purpose would be to make provision for the building of houses.  Anybody looking at the operation of building societies in Britain as well as in Ireland can see clearly that their major preoccupations and concerns in recent years have been about the management of their funds, about competing for savings in different circumstances of competition and the management of funds so deposited rather than being about the original purpose of providing houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am speaking about is, if you like, the building of social dimension into a credit policy.  It is the idea that you might take stock of your human population and regard the economic fiscal policy as a set of instruments.  As one of those instruments, you look at credit policy. The argument which I sometimes read comes from such documents as the Central Bank of Ireland statement on monetary policy, March 1986.  I respect the people who prepared this report but it is <Col N="1513" /> not a fundamental, unanswerable paradigm for the management of the State finances or for the provision of credit in the short term or, as the report stresses, from 1986 on.  On page 4 it states:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank does not intend to issue a formal guideline for bank lending to the private sector for 1986. Credit guidelines have been in use since the late-1970s, a time when bank lending to the private sector was growing at well in excess of 30 per cent per annum, resulting in a rising level of banks' indebtedness to the Central Bank and pressure on the external reserves.</P>
    <P>My point is that there are criteria by which you should judge your credit policy other than the ratio of the commercial banks to the Central Bank in terms of deposits and the pressure on external reserves.  One of those criteria is the ability of the credit policy to contribute either to the reversal of unemployment trends or the production of an incapacity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will agree with this motion.  Its proposals are simple and modest.  It is calling for a commission and I would like in one minute to answer the question of those who say that a commission may take a great deal of time and may be a very heavy way of setting about this.  We have for so long neglected the whole issue of credit in this provision in our society that I would be willing to wait to have these issues unemotively and carefully examined with all the different contrasting models of relationship between savings and investment.  Equally, what is urgent &mdash; perhaps the Minister will indicate this &mdash; is how the law can be changed to deal with the specific short term effects of licensed and unlicensed money lenders.  I have already said that the law is vague.  It is inoperable and insufficient.  Equally, in relation to the question of consumer protection, that too can be met.  A commission which would set the specific short term problems &mdash; these emotively charged situations &mdash; in a broader context would be the best way to handle this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I will conclude on the point about the family who are in the grip of a particular moneylender.  When you actually investigate the family circumstances you will find that they are vulnerable people who are also at risk from the credit policy of other lending institutions.  They may feel that they may not get the money elsewhere other than from the person who is offering it to them.  Equally when you look at it in terms of what are their fears, it is quite wrong to imagine that everybody in society stands in the same relationship to the sanctions that are being threatened by the credit offering institutions.  The families most at risk from the moneylender are the ones who will most likely have their light cut off if they owe an ESB bill.  When you look through the eyes of families you see that what you have is a comprehensive dependency and vulnerability.  The way to go about that is to look at how credit affects our lives and how it affects different sectors of the economy.  Ask the question: what would be an appropriate credit policy to enable us to tackle one of the greatest scourges of our time, a society with a high unemployment rate?  I ask the House to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that our motion is very far-reaching and, therefore, it is not possible at this point to accept the amendment put down by the Fine Gael Senators.  I say it is far-reaching in that when we are dealing with moneylending, for example, we cannot go on the basis of some television programmes we have seen and leave it at that as many of us will remember television programmes before which were not quite on the ball.  We do not want to be in a position where we condemn moneylenders out of hand even though we condemn the principle of it.  We do not want to condemn people out of hand or attribute to them deeds that they may not be guilty of or put it to them that it is as extensive as it might be until we know what the full facts are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do know that illegal moneylending represents a very serious social problem and it is at serious proportions in urban <Col N="1515" /> areas.  We know that there are many unlicensed moneylenders but do not know how many.  We know that moneylenders try to hide their identity and that they keep their operations very secret.  Allegations have been made of threats of violence and exposure against people who cannot live up to their commitments.  It has also been suggested that violence has, in fact, been inflicted.  We are not saying that in our motion.  We want somebody to investigate this in a thorough and detailed way.  There is an argument that the Garda may be lax in the sense that everybody else knows about it and yet there are no prosecutions made.</P>
    <P>It is quite a serious situation.  But to say that it is widespread and pervasive needs a substantial amount of backing. At this point I do not think we have that backing.  We know that a serious problem exists which needs serious investigation. I do not think that the question of a commission is going to take as long as people might imagine.  There are commissions which are set up for the specific purpose of stalling, but if a commission is given the proper terms of reference it can report fairly quickly, impartially and in depth.  That is the reason we do not want to go down the road of laying accusations, but we do think that it requires thorough investigation.  Another point about the amendment which makes it difficult for us to assent to it, is that it seems a piecemeal way of dealing with the whole question of banking, credit and moneylenders etc.  So, it is not satisfactory to us as an amendment.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in any area where one must borrow money there is a very serious problem for the people concerned.  By and large the borrower, if borrowing from a moneylender, has no protection whatever.  The basis on which money is borrowed in some cases, it is alleged &mdash; and I use the word selectively &mdash; is that if you get £1 off somebody you will pay five shillings a week until the £1 is paid back.  You are paying five shillings off the loan and five shillings interest. Obviously, if there is that sort of abuse it is very serious and we will have to go <Col N="1516" /> after it.  The people affected by this are very often seriously involved in trouble because of having to rely on social welfare payments.  When you talk to some of them about getting into such trouble and ask if they did anything about supplementary welfare allowances, you find that the criteria for obtaining supplementary welfare allowances are so vague and so difficult that very often people get into a mess over the whole thing and do not realise what their rights are.  Very often they cannot obtain the supplementary allowances in adequate time.</P>
    <P>There is an abundance of evidence on moneylenders in existence.  There is an abundance of arguments that the credit facilities of banking institutions are not readily available and that the kind of collateral needed cannot always be met by the type of person we are concerned about and want to protect.  Naturally, it is of very serious concern to us.  It is not today or yesterday that we started to talk about the question of moneylending. Labours' &ldquo;Constructive Programme for an Organised Nation&rdquo;, published in 1941, talked about moneylending.  The position is that this was our attitude to banking, currency and credit and, while the Minister may raise his eyes when I read it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I said you will when I read it.  You will probably say many changes have taken place.  I would suggest that many changes need to take place.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever it is proposed to improve the social and economic conditions of the people, the cry is raised at once: &ldquo;Where will the money come from?&rdquo; But every country in the world, including our own, obtains all the money it requires for war-like purposes, military equipment, mimic warfare, aerial development.  If money were called for to construct a greyhound track or a cinema, it would be forthcoming immediately; if a foreign loan were issued in Ireland at the moment of our greatest misery, banks and insurance <Col N="1517" /> companies would vie with each other in offering subscriptions.</P>
    <P>We know well that people with vast capital are citizens of the world and they would do a deal with the devil if the price was right.  We have got some of our people into deals with China and elsewhere.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that improvement in our social services and the raising of the standard of life are not retarded or prevented merely because we lack money but to a considerable extent because of the disinclination of those who own the money to make it available for these purposes.</P>
    <P>Banking, Currency and Credit in this country are virtually the monopoly of a few professional bankers working in collaboration with the Bank of England; they may in their absolute discretion, provide or refuse to provide financial accommodation for any purpose whatever, they determine the conditions on which credit facilities will be afforded, the period for which credit will be available and the rate of interest which will be charged for it.  These powers should not reside in a small body of persons, many of them out of sympathy with Irish aspirations, who are not responsible for their actions to any authority within the State.</P>
    <P>I will accept any point of view which says that there has been a very substantial move forward in the light of working class people opening investment accounts and being able to borrow and so on, but the fact remains that it is relative to the new situation we are in.  They are still at the bottom of the heap and the banking and credit system in Ireland is not releasing money in sufficient amounts to help create employment and so on.  It is an evil thing if the control of banking and credit is tied up wrong.  It is a banking system that ties the hands and feet of people.  Where credit is denied to small businesses because of the lack of proper collateral it inevitably leads to further unemployment.  It is a contributory factor to unemployment.  Consequently, we are <Col N="1518" /> talking about linking it in with the fact that people inevitably have to turn to moneylenders instead of being able to turn to the normal banking and credit facilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins mentioned the question of post offices and State banks.  I do not know in what context he mentioned them but I can see nothing wrong in the State setting up their own bank to go into competition with the banks and bringing in terms that would facilitate people who are in serious difficulties.  While much has been done by the credit unions it is also quite clear that much more could be done, even to the extent of saying that if this commission comes out with a report and we find that we have made our claim correctly, and if we are right or even half right about the credit and banking facilities, then we must do something about that.</P>
    <P>We must, on the one hand, tackle the banking and credit system and, on the other hand, try to make facilities available to a greater extent through the credit unions even if it meant the State coming to their rescue through putting a certain amount of money behind them to take many people out of trouble.  I do not mean the &ldquo;grush&rdquo; money.  I mean to assist people to get loans at very low rates.  I know that the State plays a part in credit unions.  The whole question of doing a little more about it would take it away from the area of trying to cope with people, particularly young married people, who are frustrated and disillusioned as a result of the whole money lending system.  It would also get us away from the concept of very important firms tying themselves in with money lending. That allegation was made on a recent television programme.  It is not to the credit of big business people to enter into deals or into taking shares in circumstances where it is evident that there is money lending going on.  While 39 per cent is the legal rate the rates they are charging are exorbitant.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago one would go to these loan societies, which were legal, and it was not uncommon to find yourself down in the sheriff's office when <Col N="1519" /> you could not meet your commitments. There was no way you could go in and make an excuse like you could to the credit unions and say &ldquo;I can afford to pay five shillings a week, will you take it?&rdquo; You could not do that with the banks as they would not wear it.  On the other hand, there were moneylenders in the Jewish community who the minute you went in to them and said you had not got the money they would be &mdash; I do not want to say Christian &mdash; charitable.  The minute you said &ldquo;Look, here is this woman, she is in the height of trouble. I have got to help her.  She can offer two shillings a week,&rdquo; he would dive on the two bob and that would be it.  That facility does not exist anywhere else. There is no compassion with people who go around knocking on doors collecting debts.  We are talking about money lending. These are the allegations.  Nobody knows if the person so doing has developed into another area.  For example, they could be giving coal out by the week in addition to lending and have people in more trouble.  They could be giving shoe dockets or anything &mdash; it is all available to them.  I have no doubt that it extends far beyond money lending in many cases. That is why people are in all sorts of trouble.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the measures taken and proposed by the Government to improve the protection provided to the public in connection with the provision of credit and borrowing and calls on the Government to ensure the speedy implementation of these and other measures to improve the situation of vulnerable groups, with particular regard to the operation of licensed and unlicensed moneylenders.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Senator Michael D. Higgins <Col N="1520" /> will be glad to know that I am not happy with his motion nor am I happy with my amendment, because I do not think either of them exactly tackle the problem which needs to be tackled.  I would like to spend a few minutes identifying a number of the areas where I consider there are problems. I would like to explain why I consider Senator Michael D. Higgins' motion casts its net too wide in an attempt to deal with all these problems together, problems which, in my opinion, are different. As a result of that he proposes the establishment of a commission which, if it was ever established along those lines, would not report for years and which would be asked to consider things on so many different levels that I do not feel there is any rational way detailed terms of reference incorporating this could be drawn up for inclusion in the brief to that commission.'</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I acknowledge the point he made in the course of proposing his motion that perhaps our amendment is drawn too narrow and sees the thing too narrowly.  That is something we can consider during the course of the debate this week and in whatever other week the matter is dealt with.  With regard to our banking institutions, our credit institutions and our moneylenders, there are three different kinds of problems to which I would like to refer briefly.  First of all there is a function for an investigation as to the part which credit plays in the economy of the country.  That is a macro-economic job.  It is the kind of point developed by Senator Michael D. Higgins when he spoke about the damage which was done to the country as a result of the overheating of the economy in extending credit to the agricultural community for the purchase of land in an unreasonable fashion.  There is a sense in which it would be useful to look at the provision of credit on that scale, the provision of credit to people at local level to start businesses and the provision of credit to people who have good ideas but no substantial asset backing with which to guarantee the borrowings necessary to commence production.  The way in which these problems can be tackled on the <Col N="1521" /> macro scale is deserving of investigation. However, that is fundamentally different from the other two problems I see in the credit area.  I would not like that problem to be confused with the other problems.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to what you might call unlicensed money lending and the dirty end of credit.  This is a problem almost for the Minister for Justice rather than for the Minister for Finance.  Without doubt unlicensed moneylenders are operating in the country. What has been indicated very strongly rather than proved conclusively by the two programmes put out on RTE, which were excellent, is that licensed moneylenders are abusing their position by charging fictitious service charges. This problem has to be tackled at that level.  A relatively straightforward amendment of the current legislation would aid and assist the Garda Síochána in the prosecution of these matters.  It is also important that we recognise that the priority which is given to the prosecution of offences of this type appears to be low. We are entitled to expect that, as a result of the publicity which would be associated with changing the law with regard to licensed moneylenders, it would be reiterated to the forces of law and order that it is the expectation of the Oireachtas that the law as it is now or the law as it is amended in the future would be applied so as to provide the protection which was originally intended.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years a situation is growing up where many of the very respectable banking institutions in the country have got involved in activities which, to say the least of it, leave them open to an investigation of this type.  I have personal knowledge of this.  Unfortunately, I cannot say what the individual case is, because it be a breach of confidence, but I will tell the executives of the firm involved.  I have personal knowledge of an abuse by Bank of Ireland Finance in this regard, the methods by which they chase people for money and the way in which they put the screws on people who fail to deliver.  It is not good enough to do your work on a respectable basis through your employees.  If you employ outside <Col N="1522" />&ldquo;consultants&rdquo; to do work on your behalf, they are acting on your behalf and they must also maintain the proper decorum and apply only such pressures as are reasonable.  It is not reasonable to phone people in the middle of the night or early in the morning.  It is not reasonable to stop people as they drive about their business on a subterfuge or trick.  This has happened.</P>
    <P>That is a separate and distinct problem. I would put that in the category of licensed and unlicensed moneylenders. People have abused their position in collecting money lawfully due to them.  I am not saying that people should not repay money they owe.  The pressure to repay must be reasonable.  We have seen the publicity afforded to licensed moneylenders. It goes beyond that.  I have one specific example in mind.  I would be pleased to give details to the officials of that organisation, should they wish to contact me.  That is a second, separate and distinct problem, quite separate from the macroeconomic problem of to whom credit should be made available and how it should be made available to generate more activity in the economy.</P>
    <P>The third problem &mdash; one which is particularly close to my heart &mdash; is the investigation of the role of the banking institution in other areas of economic activity.  Is it wise that banks should get involved in insurance?  Is it wise that banks should get involved in travel companies? Is it wise that banks should become involved in foreign subsidiaries? What implications do these adventures have for the stability of the banking system in the future?  We may draw a conclusion from the ICI debacle.  With regard to our banks and our major banking institutions they are underwritten by the State in all but name, because the economic difficulties which would be created by a failure of one of our banks means that no Government could allow it to happen.  With that guarantee comes responsibilities.  Among the responsibilities which should attach to the banking institutions in those circumstances is the responsibility not to engage in any activity which places the bank's shareholders' <Col N="1523" /> funds, its depositors' funds or the Government's funds, or the taxpayers' funds at risk.  Therefore, investment in overseas subsidiaries, where such subsidiaries are outside the control of the Irish Government and outside the control of the Central Bank, is not necessarily in the interest of the Irish economy or the taxpayer.  That is a third area where I see a need for specific investigation and a redefinition of the role of banking.</P>
    <P>Members will understand why I am so disappointed, first of all, having thought about my own amendment and it being so narrow.  On the other hand, it is not practical or fair or very advantageous to incorporate in the one investigation the moneylenders, licensed or unlicensed, and the macroeconomic argument with regard to credit.  They are different investigations. They have different functions. One is the policeman's function.  The other is the creative economists function. For that reason, while I express myself individually in support of each of the sentiments contained in Senator Higgins's motion, I am unable, at this stage, subject to what is said in the debate, to accept that the remedy proposed by Senator Higgins, that is, the establishment of a commission to investigate all these matters, has the urgency which is demanded by the unlicensed moneylender/availability of credit at an individual level.  I do not think that will deal with that matter with the urgency which it deserves.  It will not be in a position to deal with the other very important matters of the general economic function of credit on the one hand and the role of the banks in the economic life of the country in general outside the banking area.  It cannot deal with all those matters simultaneously.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate it reminds me of the story of the person who was looking for the one-handed economist and when asked why he wanted a one-handed economist, he replied that he was fed-up listening to economists saying &ldquo;on the one hand and on the other&rdquo;.  I suppose the impetus for the debate came about because of a television programme which may or may not be accurate, or truthful, which may be misdirected and which may have been well documented; I am not too sure. There is no doubt in my mind but that there is a need for an addressing of the community towards moneylending in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of us who deal with people who have problems of living from week to week have seen the difficulties they can fall into by getting involved with moneylenders legal and illegal.  It is not much use to me to listen to Senator O'Leary talking about the macroeconomic situation when we are talking about the poor person who has not got a penny in his pocket and then suddenly a saviour comes along and offers him £20, asks for a rate of interest which seems not to be too high, at least it will pay for the groceries this week even if that £20 would have to be paid for ten times over.  Every week we come across people in the lower echelons of society who are involved with moneylenders.  The problems created by moneylenders are passed on to politicians and social workers and community welfare officers who have to deal with the <Col N="1525" /> immediacy of the problem.  Often people come to us in our clinics who cannot pay their ESB bills this month, who cannot pay for their groceries, who cannot pay anything.  The reason they cannot pay is they have had to pay the man who knocked on the door looking for the interest on money that was borrowed many months previously, possibly to pay for the ESB bill that was overdue at the time.</P>
    <P>The ESB, I must say have been dealing with people on a sympathetic basis in recent months.  They realise that people can get into trouble.  They have been dealing on a sympathetic basis with people who have large families so that they can provide heat and light at least in the house.  The community welfare officers around the country are spending 90 per cent of their time dealing with problems associated with illegal money lending or, indeed, with money lending which is legal but which is excessive as to its interest.  When one thinks of a legal rate of 39 per cent one can understand the problems that are created.  The smart boys in the business say the interest rate is 39 per cent but, of course, one has to pay a service charge.  One has to pay a certain amount of money to get the loan. In many cases this 39 per cent becomes 78 per cent and, as we have heard in many cases, it has gone up to 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>People are not told how much they will have to pay back on each £1 borrowed. Interest rates are not something that people who go through primary school or who go half-way through secondary school are very <i>au fait</i> with.  Interest rates, indeed, are not something that people who have gone through secondary school or who have gone through an arts course in college are <i>au fait</i> with.  Many people who have gone to universities and are studying for a master's degree would not have a clue what the real interest rate being charged by the banks at present is. People should be told how much they will have to pay back per £1 borrowed, over how many months, so that they will know exactly how they will have to pay back. Forget about the rate of interest.  The <Col N="1526" /> rate of interest does not matter in actual fact.  It is the amount of money that a person has to pay back.  If we are talking in economic terms the rate of interest is important but, to the ordinary man and woman in the street, if they borrow £1 and have to pay back £2, £3, £4 or £6 over so many months, that is all that matters.  The Government will have to recognise that in large figures in the windows of every lending institution the interest rate is not the major thing that is being advertised.  It is the number of pounds per months that has to be paid back per £1 borrowed.  That is essential.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary mentioned the fact that banks should not be involved in the risk business.  Does he expect everybody in the economy to be involved in risk other than the banks?  Every customer of the bank, if he is any good, is involved in a risk every morning that he goes into business.  Does he want the banking community to stay out of the risk business? If they are going to stay out of the risk business their interest rates and their charges should be much less than they are.  If they have no risk they should have a very much lower interest rate and they should have very much smaller charges. If there is risk in being involved in banking, then let there be high interest rates and let there be high charges.  If Senator O'Leary had his way, they should have no risk, but their customers should have all the risk.  That, to me, is crazy.</P>

      <P>Bad debt provision, even in the banking system, is the same as in every other situation in economic life in this country.  They can write off their bad debts against their profits.  At the end of the year their bad debts are written off against profits and they get a tax break on their bad debt provision.  Their bad debt provision is a book figure which is balanced by the very fact that they are allowed by the Revenue Commissioners to offset that against their profits on a 100 <Col N="1527" /> per cent basis.  Can any Senator provide me with the name of a bank who have not made a profit?</P>

      <P>One bank have made a loss.  I would suggest that, therefore, this bad debt provision is a figure which is offset by the taxation system.  I cannot understand why there should be an amendment to this motion, because nothing will happen about it anyway.  The commission will not be set up, but it does give us an opportunity to discuss the relationship between the lending institutions and the borrowers.  For that reason it is a very useful exercise.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary said that the problems as between the moneylenders who are illegal and the moneylenders who are legal, whether they are banks or otherwise, are not different.  Of course they are different.  There is a different scale involved.  Generally speaking, the people who get involved with illegal moneylenders are people of very limited means, who become involved because they have not got the means to feed themselves for the next week, or they have not got a bed, or they want to buy a pair of sheets. They find that the only way they can get them is to get into the hands of these moneylenders.  What is frightening is to see the connection between these moneylenders who are illegal and banking and insurance businesses who are in the higher echelons of our economic society.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see banking nationalised. I have absolutely no wish in the wide earthly world to see banking nationalised because I would expect that it would mean a structuring of lending that would be rigid and would be without a human aspect.  For that reason I would sincerely hope that, for the foreseeable future, we can see a banking situation in Ireland which is free and which allows the borrower a certain amount of freedom within the risk taking that banking should involve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would sincerely hope that bankers <Col N="1528" /> would not be constrained, as has been said previously in the debate, on their lending, as they are now.  In the past the local bank manager was the person who analysed and assessed.  Ninety per cent of the assets of banks in this country have been built up by the dedication of local bank managers and the local information that they have, not by the macroeconomics that has been spoken of by Senator O'Leary.  Because of the change in the banking system, where the computer at head office basically dictates the borrowing ability of a customer without going into the background of the customer and without going into the historical banking relationship between the customer and the bank, a bad day's work has been done.  We have the situation now where there is not a bank manager in the country who, if there is a loan of over £5,000, does not have to go at least to his regional manager.  When it goes over a certain other figure, the regional manager has to get on to the head office.  In the past the local manager made decisions.  These decisions built up the assets of the banks in Ireland to an enormous degree.</P>
    <P>I am not saying we should turn our backs on the present economic situation in terms of the machines that are available.  We should still make sure that the banks do not lose the humanity they showed in the past when protecting consumers. There are industries in this country which suffer because of bad banking. I am not saying there is bad banking on behalf of the bank, but there are bad bankers and there are bad customers. Consumers have often fallen between the bad bankers and the bad consumer of credit.  There is a need for the Government to look at the banking system as a whole.  I am not so sure whether the Central Bank is the proper analyser of what is good or bad for banking.  The Central Bank is an instrument of Government. The Central Bank is not an instrument of business, of consumers or of banking.  The Minister said that he would have a new Central Bank Bill coming through.  I am not sure of the relevance of the Central Bank Bill to the debate which is going on here.  All the Central <Col N="1529" /> Bank can do is regulate the overall demand for credit and analyse the overall limit to which credit can be given.  Therefore, I am not sure, in the context of these motions, what relevance the Central Bank has.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that today we have a note from the Irish Bankers Federation announcing the establishment of a new banking information unit, the Irish Banks' Information Service.  It says:</P>
    <P>Banking occupies a pivotal role in the economy as the conduit through which savings are channelled to industry, agriculture and other productive and exporting sectors.</P>
    <P>That that role is often misunderstood is damaging not only to the banks but also to the economy at large.  We confidently expect that the work of the IBIS, in providing factual objective information about banking, will make a positive contribution to an increased understanding of the banking industry.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we got that note today.  It is interesting also to note that there is a note at the end of it for editors:</P>
    <P>The Irish Bankers' Federation was established in 1973 when Ireland joined the EC, primarily to represent Irish banking interests abroad.</P>
    <P>It did not say it was to protect the interests of the investor or of the borrower abroad.  It said it was to protect the interests of the bankers abroad.  Banking should be more open.  The rates of repayment should be very well set out.  If anybody enters an arrangement with a bank, whether it is on a credit or a debit basis, he should be told, very straightforwardly, in simple language, how much he will have to pay back or how much interest he will get if he lodges daily to a deposit account.  He should be told if he will get more interest if he lodges monthly, or whether he will get more interest if he asks for his credit balance every day.  He should be told whether he will get more credit if he asks for his interest to be added every day or if it is added, as the banks normally do, at the end of every six months period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> This motion gave us the opportunity to talk about banking, particularly about illegal banking, and about high interest rates being charged and high service charges being charged by illegal bankers. I am not sure where the debate will get us.  I do not think either the proposition or the amendment will get us any place. If the Minister is going to use the Central Bank as the regulating system, the debate will have been of no use except to have a chat in a nice little club about the problems of the banking system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us calls upon the Minister for Finance to establish a commission on all aspects of credit and its availability.  It only asks for a commission.  I cannot understand what Senator O'Leary was speaking about in his amendment.  When he spoke he agreed with everything Senator M. Higgins had already said and he agreed totally with what is in this motion because it does nothing for the motion.  The motion stands or falls as it is.</P>
      <P>I would refer to the various aspects that Senator Lanigan noted.  The Senator was frightened and worried that in the future the banks in Ireland could be nationalised.  The situation as we see it, is that a nationalsied bank would be very good for the country.  There is no reason why the Post Office cannot take on the banks and outdo them.  Why should the situation arise where we have civil servants, members of the Garda Síochána and members of the Army queueing up outside commercial banks to have their Government cheques cashed?  It is a ridiculous situation.  Why should we have a situation also where commercial banks handle all of the county council money? Why should that not be handled by the banks instituted by the State &mdash; for example, by the Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various aspects of moneylenders, both licensed and unlicensed &mdash; I would rather go into the banking organisation later.  When we look at the moneylenders Act of 1933 &mdash; we are now in 1986 &mdash; we have a crazy situation where one can get a licence for £100.  That is a ridiculous situation to be in in 1986.  One can <Col N="1531" /> form a limited company, give in a subscription of £100 and have a licence.  One has then a licence to go from door to door collecting money from innocent people. What happens when all of this money is collected?  What happens when the company gets into difficulty?  What happens the peoples' money then?  There is absolutely no control over it?  We are talking about a limited liability company set up by an individual and his wife.  They pay £100 and they start off a moneylending service.  They canvass from door to door. We all know what happens then.  We have people borrowing and the types of fees, rates and interest they are charged are outlandish.  We see here that the rate of interest should be 39 per cent, according to the Act.  The Act is being flouted left, right and centre.  Nobody seems to bother about it.  Senator O'Leary said it should be a matter for the Minister for Justice.  If it is a matter for the Minister for Justice, what is he doing about it?  In every new housing estate we have these people going around from house to house canvassing people.  A very good system &mdash; I like it myself &mdash; is where you actually put away some money to pay for the major bills.  But when you put away some money to pay for a bill of £100, and it cost £150 to pay for that bill of £100 then it is ridiculous and excessive.  The Act prohibits the employment of canvassers. But, in effect, that is what is happening every day in the city of Dublin, in the country, in every town and in every housing estate.  It is the poor who suffer.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the community welfare officers.  That is all one has to do &mdash; talk to the community welfare officers.  Senator Higgins talked about St. Vincent de Paul and the social worker.  Go and ask them what is actually happening to the poor of this country and how these moneylenders are getting rich out of the misery of the poor.  They are worse than the drug pushers.  They charge rates of up to 200 per cent interest.  We have seen it on television.  We know it happens.  We have to do something about that straight away.</P>

    <P>In ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí ar fad a bhí ag an scoil i gcaitheamh na mblianta seo, lean sé air ag fás.  Tá na páistí a tháinig an chéad lá imithe as an scoil, ach ní féidir le scoil ar bith maireachtáil go deo gan foirgneamh buan oiriúnach.  Tá sé in am an conradh tógála a shíniú leis an tógálaí atá roghnaithe.  Tá na tairiscintí tógála faoi bhráid Bhord na nOibreacha Poiblí <Col N="1533" /> agus an Roinn Oideachais le ceithre mhí anuas.

Ní ceart go n-iarrfaí ar aon pháistí ná múinteoirí a leithéid a dhéanamh toisc a ndílseacht don Ghaeilge.  Is cóir an dílseacht seo a chúiteamh leo gan mhoill agus an conraitheóir tógála a scaoileadh chun oibre.  Níl ceist anois ach an conradh a shíniú leis an tógálaí roghnaithe.</P>

    <P>I should like to refer to Coolard National School.  Coolard National School, Listowel, County Kerry, was built in 1886.  It comprised three classrooms, a storeroom and an outside toilet.  It remained as it was built until 1982 without any extensive renovations or repairs over the previous 94 years. In 1982 Tullamore National School was closed and amalgamated with Coolard National School.  The existing store room was converted into a classroom to facilitate the extra numbers.  The Department of Education sanctioned a grant of over £2,000 towards this extension.  This was the only form of aid that this school got in its history.  There are 95 pupils currently on the school roll with a staff of four teachers.  The classrooms are very congested and rat-infested.  The teachers are forced to lay poison for the rats with the result that there are decaying remains under the floor boards producing a hideous smell and this, no doubt, is a health hazard.  I should like the Minister to take note of this.</P>
    <P>In 1958 the building was condemned by the Department of Health.  As a result <Col N="1534" /> of this, the Department of Education were reluctant to sanction any repairs or extensions since.  As a result of local commitment and a willingness among the local people to hold their school, the school was maintained and kept in some form of repair by funds collected from the local community.  The reason why an extension has been sanctioned is because of the reluctance of the people to surrender their school and move into a bigger school.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension comprises three classrooms, a general purpose room, and ancillary facilities including a teachers' room and indoor toilet facilities. The Minister for Education visited this school in 1984 and made a commitment to the principal and staff that she would honour their centenary year 1986 with the sanction of the extension.  They have lived and hoped since that that commitment will be honoured this year.  The school has produced very fine scholars over 100 years and has been of tremendous service to the local community.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister could give me a commitment that this extension will be advertised for tender in the near future.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús labharfaidh mé faoi Scoil Mhic Easmainn faoin a labhair an Seanadóir Deenihan.  Séard atá ann faoi láthair ná seachtar múinteoir agus an príomhoide i mBaile Úna. Bhíodar in áiteanna thart faoi cheantair Bhaile Trá Lí le cúpla bliain anuas. Tugann an Roinn Oideachais tacaíocht dóibh chun an cíos a íoc faoi láthair. Osclaíodh an scoil i 1978 agus ag an am sin ní raibh ach 23 daltaí ach ón am sin anuas go dtí an lá atá inniu ann agus ag an gceathrú is deireanaí atá ann bhí 197 daltaí sa scoil.  I 1970 tógadh suíomh ar cheithre acra in áit ar a dtugtar Shanakill in iar-thuaisceart an bhaile mhóir.  Tá cúrsaí pleanála ar siúl faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the site was chosen in 1970 the Office of Public Works &mdash; that section which has since been subsumed into the Department of Education &mdash; has been engaged on the architectural planning of <Col N="1535" /> a new permanent school building.  The Office of Public Works were authorised last September to invite tenders for the project.  The examination of the tenders has now been completed and the question of placing a contract is under consideration. The outcome will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Coolard project to which I will refer to in a moment, the Scoil Mhic Easmainn project is one of a large number awaiting forward movement at the present time, and in the case of Scoil Mhic Easmainn specifically the placing of a contract will be dealt with in that general context.  I am particularly aware of the needs of this school.  Apart from the very valuable contribution which it makes towards the reinstating of the national language in our schools, and, indeed, its importance generally in our lives, I understand it has occupied a variety of temporary premises over the last seven and a half years.  This is naturally not conducive to business being conducted in an orderly fashion or to the education process being followed through in a proper and fitting manner, both for the parents, teachers and pupils. I hope to be in a position in the near future to make a positive announcement regarding the prospects of placing this contract for permanent accommodation for Scoil Mhic Easmainn.  I hope to make that announcement in the near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to Coolard national school, the position is that the present primary school building at Coolard has three classrooms.  The staffing of the school consists of a principal teacher and three assistant teachers.  The average enrolment at the school for the quarter ended 31 December 1985 was just marginally in excess of 95 pupils.  The school building is just over 100 years old, having been built in 1886.  This is indicative of the number of schools that now require replacing and it therefore indicates pressure on the Department in dealing with the various stages that must be dealt with before new buildings can actually be provided. Coolard was one of four schools proposed in the seventies for relocation <Col N="1536" /> in a central building, but that particular proposal came to nothing as the local people were not in favour of participating in a central school building.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Coolard school absorbed the nearby Tullamore national school. Under the usual amalgamation arrangements, the Coolard school retains four teachers, although the average enrolments warrant only three teachers in the long term.  So there is some small benefit to the existing pupil-teacher ratio, though the condition of the building itself is not suitable.</P>
    <P>The origins of the present proposals for the extension of the Coolard school can be traced back to a deputation in 1983 which visited my Department and which sought financial aid for the improvement of conditions at the school. The options under discussion at that time were either the provision of a new school building to replace the existing one, or a major remodelling of the existing building and its extension.  The latter approach was eventually agreed between the schools authorities and my Department, resulting in the employment by the school of an architect to submit specific proposals and costings.  The brief was that the existing building should be remodelled and extended so as to provide overall three classrooms and a general purposes area, together with the usual and necessary ancillary accommodation.  That planning process has now reached the stage where an acceptable set of plans has been produced.  Agreement has been reached on the matter of a local contribution and the title to the site has been declared as being satisfactory.</P>
    <P>My Department, therefore, at present has under consideration the question of authorising the invitation of tenders for the Coolard project.  I want to explain that this project is one of a large number, the release of which to tender must be ordered in such a fashion that the capital funds provided to my Department in any particular financial year for national school building will be adequate to sustain regular grant payments as soon as construction work has begun.  Obviously, work that has already commenced has <Col N="1537" /> priority in funding and, accordingly, projects at the tender invitation stage take their place in the order of priorities and in accordance with the capital likely to be made available when work is actually scheduled to start.  The planning of tendering and the contract placement sequences has been taking place in this context and is now practically complete.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the plea for the release of the Coolard project to tender, as raised by Senator Deenihan.  The poor condition of the existing facilities at Coolard has been more than adequately documented and has been accepted by the <Col N="1538" /> Department and I am certainly not unmoved by the desire of the local people associated with the project that they should be in a position to mark the school's centenary year by commencing their major scheme of remodelling and extension.  I hope, therefore, to be in a position in the reasonably near future to convey to the school authorities a decision as to when they may proceed with the invitation of tenders.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 March 1986.</P>
