      <P>I have notice from Senator Helena McAuliffe-Ennis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture to examine the feasibility of the setting up of a pilot scheme in County Longford, to conduct farm research into the sources and causes of Bovine T.B.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and also to take the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill which will be passed by the Dáil in the course of the day.  No. 1 is the Order for the Second Stage of a Bill introduced to the Seanad.  No. 2 is the Exchange Control (Continuence) Bill which it is necessary to pass before the end of the year in order to continue exchange control.  No. 3 is the Courts (No. 3) Bill which must be passed also today in order to deal with <Col N="1500" /> the position in regard to summonses.  The Appropriation Bill must be passed in order to allow money to issue from 1 January onwards.  I understand that the Dáil will be taking the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and my recommendation is that we interrupt business at 3 p.m. in this House in order to take that legislation so that the Seanad will have an opportunity of examining the legislation before the Dáil has actually adjourned.</P>
      <P>I would like on this last sitting day to make a few remarks about the sittings of the House during the past year.  Senators will note in the upper left hand corner of today's Order Paper the number 78.  This is an indication that this House has sat in 1986 on 78 days, the largest number of sitting days ever in a calendar year by the Seanad and indeed it is 15 more days than the previous highest figure.  Towards the end of the year, the work of the Seanad has been such that, on my reckoning, since the Summer Recess the Dáil sat for 28 days and the Seanad sat for 28 days.  I do not know if this reflects a determination on the part of the Seanad to sit more often than the Dáil in 1987.  The nature of the Seanad work has shown an acceleration in 1986 of a tendency that was there for a few years previously.</P>
      <P>In the past, in a year there might or there might not be one Bill introduced in the Seanad and passed through the Seanad to the Dáil, sometimes none.  In 1986, eight Bills were introduced in the Seanad and dealt with by the Seanad before being dealt with in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of motions, looking back to the year 1980 there were 18 motions debated by the Seanad.  In the year 1986 there were 64 motions debated by the Seanad.  I want to say something further than that; it is not only a question of statistics and numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Senators who have taken part in that work for the manner in which they have done so.  We have had in the past year some notable debates on legislation of great importance.  I can think of the debates on the Clinical Trials Bill, the Status of Children Bill at Committee <Col N="1501" /> Stage, the National Monuments Bill and on many other Bills.  The Seanad had debated these matters with a thoroughness that does indeed demand commendation and it is a comfort to us that whatever the outside world may think of us, we ourselves in Seanad Éireann can feel that we have done a good year's work and that we have fulfilled our constitutional role in a manner that is beyond criticism.  I would like to thank the Senators for all they have contributed.  I would like to thank the members of the Seanad staff for all they have contributed to this work and also the staff of the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas and those members of the Press and Telefís Éireann who have reported our proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Senator W. Ryan Senator W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Senator W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the Leader of the House in saying how pleased we all are in this House with our achievements this year, that we have had 78 sitting days, which is an all-time record.  But I think that the credit for that must really go to Senator Dooge himself because it was he who pushed the Government to give us legislation first. We would occasionally get Bills taken first here in this House heretofore but that only happened now and again.  Quite a number of Bills were brought in here during the year, passed here and have not even been discussed yet in Dáil Éireann.  I wonder if a lot of our work is in vain. Should there be a General Election in the near future, I wonder what happens those Bills.  I would be sorry if, after all the work we have put into them here, we had to start all over again.</P>
      <P>I would also like to congratulate the Members of the Seanad for their contributions to debates and for their attendance during the year and also the staff of the House for their work on our behalf. I am not sure if the Press are present here today, but if they are, I would like to thank them for the little they did for this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with the Leader of the House first, in extending thanks to the Cathaoirleach for having <Col N="1502" /> chaired the proceedings and to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and all the members of the staff of the House.  Senator Dooge omitted to mention that in addition to having a record number of sitting, we also had some very extended sittings late into the night and there was always cooperation from Members on the Opposition and Government sides of the House and from the staff in particular when they manned the Seanad into the small hours of the morning at times when we were faced with legislation that needed to be taken.  For my part, it was a pleasure to co-operate with the Leader with whom I have worked very closely. He has always been very helpful to me as his deputy and with members of the Opposition.  I would like to thank Senators Willie Ryan and Mick Lanigan and also the Independent group and Senator Catherine McGuinness, all of whom I found co-operative in enabling us to get through whatever business was required by the Government and to facilitate Private Members as well.</P>
      <P>I hope that, as Senator Ryan has said, the Dáil will continue long enough to deal with some of the important legislation which we have initiated here and which has not yet been taken up by the other House.  It would be a pity if anything should happen to frustrate some of the legislation that we have dealt with extensively.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Group, I want to wish everybody in the House, Members and staff and yourself, a Chathaoirligh and your staff, a very happy Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this little piece of self-indulgence is an annual event or not but I am quite happy to join in it and to say that on behalf of the Independent Group it has been a particularly busy session and it has been an unusually active session simply because we have got more Bills initiated in this House.  As an Independent, I think that it is very frustrating that many of those things which one wants to discuss are not discussed.  I have been personally irritated by it on several occasions.  We <Col N="1503" /> should &mdash; and I know it is unanimous among the Independents &mdash; pay tribute to Senator Dooge for the way that this House has been conducted during the year.  I hope that we will meet again and that we will be able to continue this process next year, but I presume that this particular tribute to the House is due to the fact that there is a danger that the life of this Seanad is coming to an end.  I think that Senator Dooge is more responsible than anybody else for the enormous work and the great contribution that the Seanad has made to the life of the State during the last year because I do not remember any Seanad having brought forward as many Bills as this or having discussed as many Private Members' motions as often as this before.  I think it has been an extremely good year for the Seanad as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in this discussion but I think we should not lose sight of the fact that we are still finishing this session with 37 Items on the clár which indeed is very high.  That includes 13 reports of the work of our joint committees.  While we have been able to report on the issues and debate the reports to a great extent during the year &mdash; the Leader of the House said there were 64 reports debated &mdash; I think it is important that those, especially those from the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, should have an airing in the Oireachtas and I think that the role that the Senators played in that regard has been an important one and it is extremely important from the public point of view that that should continue.</P>
      <P>I would like, perhaps in the New Year, if the CPP would consider some way in which to expedite some of the work that is piling up on our Order Paper.  It is important that we look at some of the procedures we have in an effort to get through more of the information we get especially from the secondary legislation committee and from the other joint committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I am replying on the assumption that the Order of Business is <Col N="1504" /> agreed to since in fact nobody but myself adverted to it.  There is only one thing I would like to say: Senator Ross did make a suggestion that perhaps this was the end of the life of this Seanad.  I would not advise any Senator to make any plans for January, either inside or outside the country.  We still have legislation initiated in this House and it is my intention to urge the Seanad that, during the month of January, the Seanad should clear all Bills which have been introduced to the Seanad so that at least our responsibility will have been discharged.  That can be done and I have a programme worked out so that this House, while it will not be able, as Senator McDonald has indicated, to complete its examination of all reports of joint committees, at the very least should be able to discharge from the Order Paper of the Seanad all Bills that have been introduced into the Seanad.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extend the operation of the Exchange Control Act, 1954, for a further four years from 1 January 1987.  The 1954 Act contains the legislative framework within which exchange controls are implemented.  It was originally given a life of four years in the hope that exchange controls could eventually be dispensed with.  This has not so far been <Col N="1505" /> found possible and the legislation has, therefore, been renewed at four-yearly intervals.  I am asking the House to renew it for a further period, since to fail to do so would in effect mean the complete dismantling of our exchange control system at the end of this year.  For reasons which I will indicate, this cannot be contemplated at present.</P>
      <P>The general approach in the legislation is to prohibit a wide range of payments and other financial transactions, but to allow discretionary power to the Minister for Finance so that permissions for such transactions can be given by statutory instrument or administrative decision.  In practice, general permissions have been given covering a wide range of transactions. Payments relating to trade, commercial and other current transactions are merely supervised so as to ensure that unauthorised capital transfers do not take place in the guise of current payments. Delegated authority has been given to the banks to approve most of these current transactions for their customers.  General permissions have also been given for a wide range of capital transactions.  For example, inflows of capital from abroad for direct investment or portfolio investment are fully permitted.  Outward direct investment and investments in real estate by Irish residents within the European Community are also fully permitted.</P>
      <P>The main restrictions remaining are on the holding of foreign currency in bank accounts or short term financial instruments and on net additional purchases of foreign currency securities.  Even here, however, life assurance companies and pension funds are allowed to make substantial transfers abroad for additional purchases of foreign currency securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been, and will continue to be, the policy of the Central Bank and of my Department to keep the operation of the exchange controls under close review. There can be conflicting views on what approach we should take, that is whether we should seek to strengthen the controls of reduce capital outflows or relax them to create a more liberal investment climate. There has been a general move in the industrial countries in recent years <Col N="1506" /> away from the use of controls and towards the use of market-related instruments, such as interest rates, to influence monetary developments.  A recent example of this is the changes introduced by France, which have brought them from being far more restrictive in many areas than Ireland to being somewhat more libreal.  The general trend within the European Community is towards greater liberalisation of capital movements. The European Commission, in line with this trend, has proposed moving in stages towards complete freedom of capital movements within the Community by 1992.</P>
    <P>In the light of these developments, I have been undertaking a comprehensive review of our exchange controls to see to what extent further relaxations may be desirable and feasible at this stage.  This review of the system is currently nearing completion and I hope to present its findings to the Government shortly.  I should emphasise that, since the Act provides only an overall framework, its renewal will not inhibit us from making changes. The discretionary powers given in the legislation enable changes to be made in the detailed operation of the controls as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of why it is necessary to renew the Act, why we cannot simply abolish exchange controls completely.  The controls are intended to help maintain our official external reserves at an adequate level and increase the capital available within the State. Exchange controls are particularly important at times of exchange rate uncertainty such as we have been experiencing of late.  While no one would claim that exchange controls can prevent all outflows, they do make a significant contribution to reducing disruptive currency flows.  Exchange controls provide no long term substitute for appropriate domestic policies, but they can help make the pace of adjustment manageable.  Such breathing space must be used effectively.  To allow unlimited exports of capital, particularly short term capital, would only add to the level and volatility of pressure on the reserves.  Also, while we still have a <Col N="1507" /> balance of payments deficit and a deficit on the public finances, there is a need to keep as much capital as possible at home to help finance these deficits and minimise domestic interest rates.</P>
    <P>Ireland is by no means alone in feeling the need for exchange controls.  Most countries in the world have them.  Even within the EC, where the aim is to fully liberalise capital movements by 1992, the majority of our partners still implement controls of one type or another &mdash; some of which are more restrictive than those that we operate.</P>
    <P>The Community recognises that the lifting of all restrictions on capital movements will require parallel action on other fronts, such as greater convergence of the Community economies and harmonisation of rules for the supervision of financial systems and the protection of users.  It will be a gradual process and a difficult one for many member states. Nobody expects us to dismantle all our existing controls in one fell swoop.</P>
    <P>The level of outflows of funds over the past year, as reflected in the balance of payments residual, has, of course, been a cause of serious concern.  It is likely that most of these outflows can be attributed to temporary leading and lagging of foreign trade payments which have a very significant effect on the level of external reserves in as open an economy as Ireland's. While the underlying reason for the outflows &mdash; the weakness of sterling and the US dollar &mdash; has been outside our control, the Government have taken decisive action to remove the grounds for further speculation and to ensure that these funds return to the economy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it clear that there will be no further downward adjustment of the IR£ within the EMS. This assurance should indicate to speculators that they cannot hope to make gains by keeping funds abroad in anticipation of an adjustment of the Irish currency. The Government have also indicated their intention to take firm action to improve the public finances and have set firm targets for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> The clarification of the Government's position in these key areas should serve to improve the prospects for economic growth and remove any uncertainty that may have existed, thereby bringing about an improvement in market sentiment and accelerating the reflow of funds from abroad.  There are signs of a turn-around in the flows at this stage.</P>
    <P>The outflows that have occurred reflect the inherent limitations of exchange controls in the case of a small open economy such as in Ireland, which is heavily dependent on foreign trade.  The scope for leading and lagging which the level of this foreign trade gives is substantial and exchange controls could not stop leading and lagging without imposing unacceptable restrictions on normal commercial transactions.  The exchange controls do, however, ensure that the situation is not aggravated by outflows of short term capital on a speculative basis.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the original hope that exchange control would be only a temporary necessity has not yet been fulfilled. It is, therefore, now necessary to renew the legislation for a further period and I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not welcome the Bill but I understand why it has been introduced. I should like to declare an interest in this in that in my daily life I am one of those people who is meant to police the exchange controls in this country and to see that they are enforced.  Life would be a lot easier for me if they were not in existence.  It should be noted that the four-year term is quite a long one.  The very strict exchange controls under which we now operate were introduced when we entered the European Monetary System, as a temporary measure.  We are coming now close to these having been in force for ten years.  While I acknowledge that these controls are absolutely essential, I think one should look at why they are in existence.  They are in existence, unfortunately, because they are a confession of a weak currency and a weak economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's statement that <Col N="1509" /> there will be no further devaluation of the IR£ within the EMS: I would not expect the Minister to say anything else. I believe that this particular instrument for strengthening the IR£ and the Irish currency is no substitute for a strong, domestic financial policy.  What has happened since we entered the EMS and broke with sterling is that the imposition of exchange controls, which are contrary to the spirit of the European Community, has led to a large build-up of money in this country.  As a result, a sort of dam of money is building up, which if controls were lifted undoubtedly would flow out of the country because it is an artificial build-up.  This is not just a reflection on the confidence of those investors with large sums, millions and millions of pounds, which they have kept in the country.  This build-up of money is so artificial and because it cannot go anywhere else it will naturally, if the controls are lifted, disappear from the country because many investment funds have become extremely lopsided in that their money is invested in this country and nowhere else because it cannot go anywhere else.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the existence of these exchange controls is that a huge amount of money finds its way into Government funds.  In some ways it is very convenient for this Government, the next Government or for any Government to have locked hundreds of millions of pounds into this country which can only go into one source which is to lend money to the Government.  It would be inconceivable for the Government to lift exchange controls to allow this money to leave the country because this money would go out and the Government would not have access to it or would not be able to borrow it.  There is a certain amount of self interest in it.  I would have liked to have heard from the Minister what the consequences of lifting exchange controls will be and what plans the Government have for the complete lifting of exchange controls by 1992 and how the Government intend to operate them.  It appears to me that these restrictions, while they <Col N="1510" /> are necessary, are also permanent in that there does not seem to be any planning at all for lifting them gradually or suddenly. A sudden lifting of them would certainly be impossible because it would cause an awful jolt to the whole structure of the economy.</P>
    <P>I have not heard in the Minister's speech how these exchange controls are policed.  While I think they are probably fairly rigidly and nationally enforced without difficulty, I do not recall any prosecutions taking place under these exchange control rules in the past ten years.  It would seem to me, and this is important, that these rules, while they are on the whole enforced, are being broken, that the large black hole in the economy is certainly in some respect as a result of the breach of exchange controls. There may be one case, but I am not sure whether it comes under this Bill or not, of a very particular nature which does not involve capital transactions moving backwards and forwards.  Why have there not been any prosecutions?  Are the Government saying that these rules are not being broken, or are the Government saying they do not need policing, or that they are not going to be policed?  It is important if a Bill of this nature is introduced, it should be made to stick.  I am afraid it is not being made to stick.  It is being introduced and then being ignored.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister how he intends to cope and how the Government intend to cope with this enormous build up of money which is artificially in this country, which is in Government stocks, when exchange controls are gradually lifted.  Does he plan to allow individuals to invest £5,000 per annum, £10,000 per annum, or £500 per annum abroad so that the exchange controls can be lifted very slowly?  Do the Government have a staggered plan for pension funds investing abroad or do the Government have no plans whatsoever for the future of the exchange control and just hope to stagger from four years to four and then be confronted suddenly by a free market in capital in 1992?</P>
    <P>I support this Bill in the short term because I feel it is absolutely necessary. <Col N="1511" /> I am afraid it shows a lack of confidence by the Government in the economy of the country and in the currency when they feel we need this sort of protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I want to say a few words about this Bill. It is coming on the last day before we take a break for Christmas.  I think in many ways there is a certain old fashioned charm to the Minister's speech.  I do not think I have seen &ldquo;market sentiment&rdquo; mentioned for decades in the kind of newspapers that I read.  Perhaps it is more a comment on the newspapers I read than on my familiarity with modern economics. The idea of a four year renewal of an instrument that was passed in 1954 is in itself very indicative.  It tells you &mdash; although it is not elaborated and I do not think it was necessary in the Minister's speech &mdash; something of the circumstances in which the Bill was initially introduced in 1954.  It tells you even more about what has happened in the 32 years since. Essentially exchange controls have their most effective usage in an economy that is neither planned nor fully free market. That was reflected in the original debates in 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Senator Ross speak, as he did very seriously, I was struck by the independence that is at the centre of his speech of the flows of funds from any concept of investment or of the social implications of investment.  Senator Ross, of course, would argue that these are considerations which might not necessarily arise as being valid, that it is rather the flow of the funds themselves that are central in an instrument of this kind.  I do not accept the morality of that. For example, I note the reference to France in the Minister's speech.  The Minister made a curious speech which I suppose people like me need to have explained to us.  I find it very interesting to note that France had a more restrictive view than we had in many respects but now has moved to a more liberal attitude in some respects.  If I were commenting on the relationship of exchange controls to the recent history of French Administrations and French politics I would <Col N="1512" /> have something much more dramatic to say.  The centrality of exchange controls to the debate in French financial institutions has a great deal to do with the character of the political Administration which was replaced by the socialist Administration and in return by the decline in the popularity of the socialist Administration itself.  Exchange controls assumed a centrality in that discussion which very clearly reflected the political circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is another rather pathetic giveaway in some respects in speeches, not attributable to this Minister, in describing instruments like this that refer to the open economy.  I welcome a discussion of the open economy in some respects because it helps draw attention to those factors over which one has control and those factors over which one has less control, but it certainly does not absolve one from joining in international debate on, for example, assaulting the essential immorality of the United States attitude towards interest rates.  As I said, it is a cultural feature in this country that financial matters which are matters of debate in international institutions are quickly reduced to the weather.  We have an obsession about weather in social sciences. People speak about the moral climate of crime and people speak about the climate of investment and it has a certain charm of its own.  However it is far less than explicit.  Perhaps this is not the appropriate place to have it, but I would welcome an opening up and an elaboration of the precise implications of openness.</P>
    <P>Just to make the central point I mentioned, exchange controls are necessary in an economy that is neither planned nor has the full conditions of the market place.  When I listen to speeches and when I hear people who represent a certain kind of view such as the previous speaker speaking what they are speaking about really is the discipline of the market place and to what extent the discipline of the market place should be interfered with.  I would begin at the other end of the spectrum.  I confess my disappointment that since I came to this House in 1973 I <Col N="1513" /> have not heard an adequate or thorough debate on the different roles and purposes of the Central Bank.  Some of the basic instruments which govern the thinking of the Central Bank are almost as old as this temporary instrument.  It reminds me of people putting a bush in a gap.  We have a Bill that has been renewed every four years since 1954.  Did somebody think that the people who want to make money, not from investment or from any productive usage, but from sheer speculation, were to have a moral conversion between 1954 and 1986?  I suspect that those of us who are a little more hard-headed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There we have it again.  I suppose human nature is a deeper concept than the weather when it comes to economies.  Those of us who are hardheaded in politics realise quite clearly that people who want to make fast money in a totally unproductive and in what many regard, as I do &mdash; you will notice I have used the term a great deal this morning &mdash; in an almost immoral way rather like immoral earnings, these people are not going to change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum there are those who accept that we live with such people and have to oppose them politically, enter into dialogue with them and so forth.  They want a planned economy and see a perfectly legitimate role for the credit and financial institutions within the concept of planning to different degrees.  Indeed, there is a very instructive example here in the French example.  One could argue about whether they have moved from being more rigid in some respects to being more liberal in some other respects, as mentioned in the Minister's speech.  In relation to the manner in which different administrations, not only the socialist administration in France have looked at their currency and its exchange as an instrument <Col N="1514" /> of achieving certain domestic policies, we could learn a great deal from that.</P>
    <P>We have tended to suffer from a great deal of orthodoxy both in our view of the international world financially and on our Central Bank.  I do not want to wander off this particular point, but Irish financial policy is one of the most atrociously conservative in the western world.  Even if you go to the speculative criteria which people speak about, it has none of the advantages but it has inherited all of the mustiness, tardiness and conservatism of the British model upon which it is, of course, primarily based.</P>
    <P>I listened to the idea of the movement of exchange control and the argument about how do you know when a person is going off to invest in a bungalow in Spain or is the money in the suitcase for some other purposes.  These are the kind of realities we deal with.  What does it tell you about the people who move money in this country?  This is a nation suffused with piousity and religiosity but it has hardly any commitment at all to the idea of there being an obligation to use money, to invest and to plan.  We should realise this.  The fact that the Government have had to renew this legislation every four years since 1954 has meant that you have a continual stream of people who want to move funds out of the country or to speculate.  This became highly respectable in the seventies, to such an extent that some of the most senior people in the economic world as opposed to the investment world expressed great concern at what was happening in Ireland, that not only had the ethos of speculation replaced an ethos of investment and a national commitment but that the people involved were enjoying the status of heroes.  There was an idea that if they could make such money in the short term from activities from one could see either the employment or productive reasons or basis for them, that somehow or other in time it might be good for the country itself.  One could envisage an image of people standing in front of a slot machine with the entire nation piled up behind them.  This panoply <Col N="1515" /> of exchange controls in a marketplace that has no social commitment and has no moral discipline, other than, as I said, the free play of market of market forces, is very akin to the rules of the gambling casino.  They have rules rather like these in the movement of chips from one gambling casino in Las Vegas to another.  That is where the comparison is, rather than anything within any serious political economy.</P>
    <P>I find it a matter of some amusement to note the deep commitment and nationalism of the banking institutions and the credit institutions in achieving controls.  There was an old phrase about whether when you were poaching it was the fear of being caught and having your head blown off or whether it was that you wanted to respect the game themselves that you should desist from stealing game.  When I think about the credit institutions, the banks and so on, I wonder whether it is not their conservatism that has prevented them from moving on to the more sophisticated rackets which many credit institutions now practice. Frankly, in regard to client commitment as it might be called &mdash; another grand phrase which is an old-fashioned one in banking &mdash; when it is put to them as to whether they should lose a customer or facilitate the movement of funds, I wonder if in 100 per cent of cases they just say: &ldquo;I am sorry but the Government have very strict regulations in this regard and, of course, the attitude of this bank is to facilitate the Government in every way possible&rdquo;.  You will excuse me if I have just a slight reservation as to whether it applies in just 100 per cent of the cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to what is happening in relation to the Community &mdash; a point well made by Senator Ross &mdash; I wonder have we any idea of what is happening in this regard.  We are doing something very interesting in many ways.  We had a very vigorous debate here on the Single European Act, a very tiny proportion of which was on the instrument of the single market and an even more minuscule amount was spent on the implications for <Col N="1516" /> the services sector.  Individual Senators spoke but it certainly did not occupy a central place in the Minister's presentation. Here we are on the one hand talking about the implications of a single market by 1992 and its impact on the services sector and spending very little time on it.  Then, as we finish the week we are back to the fact that we are amending the 1954 Act every four years to put up exchange controls which are themselves a reflection of what is necessary in an economy.  I take the point implicit in the Minister's speech that you cannot move from one state or condition to another one without making temporary adjustments and introducing temporary protections.</P>
    <P>If you reflect on the two discussions taken together, or rather the absence of discussion in some respects, we have spent very little time in understanding what will happen when all exchange controls are gone and when the conditions of the market place are implemented.  I am not one of those who think there are automatic advantages for any other reasons &mdash; weather, culture, human nature or whatever, that we might like to adduce in the Irish case to change the classical laws of commercial investment and of financial investment and that there would not be an outflow of funds and a loss of services with, in turn, the knock-on social effects that I mention.  Therefore, we may be witnessing a period prior to the harshest climate of all.  We have abandoned the other strong option of the planned economy, the subjugation of financial and credit criteria and investment to the achievements and attainments of the plan, some kind of directive planning within which you would have a financial and fiscal strategy, but I wonder if people are anticipating what the consequences are either in human or social terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay very long on this Bill.  I am not too sure what relevance it has because it would appear that over the past number of months there has been an outflow of funds, much of which has been illegal.  If we are going to have <Col N="1517" /> restrictions they should be adhered to and if we are not going to have restrictions there is not much point in bringing in a Bill of this nature.  It would appear that this black hole which has been emerging in the economy has not been curbed.  There is an inherent immorality in the Bill, as Senator Michael Higgins said, because it is permissible to bring funds in but it is not permissable to send funds out.  The immorality is that it is all right for other people to send money to us.  Whether that money comes from legal or illegal means does not seem to matter to us but if somebody wants to send it out it becomes illegal.  Therefore, there is an inherent immorality in the objectives of this Exchange Control Bill.  If we are going to have any controls they should be rigorously adhered to.  If there is not going to be the guarding of the outflow of funds we might as well forget about the Bill.  Would the Minister, in his reply, give, in plain English, a translation of the second last paragraph of his statement? It may make sense to somebody who is an economist, it may make sense to somebody who is in exchange control, but for anyone who is not an economist it reads as gobbledegook.  Perhaps he would translate into plain English what this &ldquo;leading and lagging&rdquo; means in terms of the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Michael D. Higgins has summed up the concept of one or two ways in which you develop your economy, either you develop it in a planned way in which investors will look at it and invest their money here in projects or you allow a control system to operate, which, as Senator Lanigan said, has almost been ineffective.  One of the problems about the Exchange Control Act is that it is known generally to banking people, professional people and monied people, but the private individual is almost unaware of it.  I am talking about people who have relatives abroad.  There are times when they send money in the post as gifts.  We had an instance late last year or early this year when people were sending money as gifts, without having got permission to do so.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1518" /> most of the money was lost or stolen in the post and because they did not have permission under the Exchange Control Act, as far as the Post Office was concerned it was not responsible.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister's Department for having initiated a system where retrospective exchange control permission was given, which meant that the people who legitimately sent small amounts as presents out of the country were covered under the Post Office Act, which insures sums of money being transmitted through the post.  The ordinary individual in the street is unaware of these controls, and thinks it is possible to send sums of money out of the country without permission.  The people who are aware of these controls obviously know how to send money out of the country illegally. There are large movements of money out of this country for one reason or another. The Minister has mentioned it and we have mentioned it here in many debates such as the debate on whether the DIRT tax was responsible for the movement of capital.</P>
      <P>I do not believe for one moment that it is responsible because, above all things, capital earns further capital and it is appropriate that people should pay a fair share of income tax on unearned income. No country in the world allows you to have money invested, earning money, tax free.  One example of our application of this is in the area of the bloodstock breeding industry, where the revenue earned by stallions is tax free.  The Labour Party have suggested that this should continue because you can easily move horse flesh from one country to another, but by giving an incentive to keep them here the amount of employment that is generated is extremely high and the earning capacity for the country is improved by having that incentive.  In the area of capital it is different because it is easy enough to move capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the banking institutions in this country facilitate the movement of capital and are also known to certify English addresses very easily, so that capital can be moved in and out of the country to other addresses, and <Col N="1519" /> indeed for income tax purposes as well. I am concerned that there appears to have been an outflow of money from our economy.  This goes back to people with capital playing the capitalist game.  They move money where it will make more money.  They are not interested in creating jobs.  They are only interested in making further capital, which is almost immoral, there is no commitment whatever to the country in which they earn the money and they are prepared to move it around the world to make quick profits. They have no regard for the national economy as such.</P>
    <P>The black hole has been mentioned. The black hole, as I understand it, refers to profits being moved out of the country by multinationals who have companies here but who have parent companies abroad.  It is obvious that if some multinational from any other country sets up a factory here the shareholders of that, who are based in the home country, would feel they were entitled to their profits, irrespective of where they were earned.  We are unable to control profits moved in that way and they are probably not subject to the Exchange Control Act at all.  There has been much debate about it.  It is obvious that it you stop them moving their profits out of the country they will refuse to invest in the country.</P>
    <P>We are in a catch-22 situation.  We know that the Government have initiated a stimulus for these people and have provided that there would be a further incentive for them if, instead of repatriating their profits out of the country, they reinvested them here in more productive employment.  If we could add that in and reassure people that we are not a locked-in economy &mdash; whether we like it or not we are an open economy &mdash; it would be a stimulant to people to invest more money in this country.  I would hope that the concept we are now talking about, worker participation and the possibility of workers taking shares in their own companies, will take place.  There is the whole philosophy of equity capital. Instead of people just investing money in bonds and gilt edged investments to make <Col N="1520" /> secure money, if we showed a little bit of the entrepreneurial spirit and invested money in companies and businesses we probably could create many more jobs, rather than playing the stock market or the money market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that if people make profits they should pay a fair share of tax on it, like the PAYE worker.  Nobody should be tax free in this country.  That is the problem.  Too many people want to be tax free and the chosen few are left to carry the whole burden of running the State and the essential services everybody seems to demand, whether they are paying into them or not. There is a lot of sense in the argument of Senator Michael D. Higgins, in talking about planning the economy to a greater extent than we have in the past.  If we have failed to plan this would be an indictment of all of us because we would like to continue to have a free, open economy. We would like some commitment from the people who invest here and who have factories here, and from people who make profits here &mdash; to keep as much money as possible within the country. That would have a spin-off effect for all of us and would create much more jobs. I agree that we cannot change this overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>it is important to realise that other countries within the Community also have a control system.  It would be very foolish of us if other countries operated a control system and we were to drop our barriers.  We would then have an outflow of all this money which, as Senator Ross says, is artifically held here.  It would suddenly disappear overnight and the social implications of that would be quite severe and would have tremendous implications for the Government.  Generally speaking, we would hope that when Britain enters the EMS this problem regarding the strength of sterling <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Irish punt will be solved.  It has tended to keep interest rates higher.  Mrs. Thatcher has been intransigent in this <Col N="1521" /> area of financial arrangements in her own country.  In spite of all the expert advice available to her, from her Treasury Department and otherwise, it is obvious that she will not enter the EMS until after the next British general election and that puts the solution of our problems a little further down the road.  It is debatable whether we should have ever entered the EMS without Britain because of the changes that have taken place in the two currencies.  I support the concept of what we are doing today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting debate.  As I said in my opening remarks, the Government expect to have a complete review of the whole exchange control situation to hand very shortly.  It may be appropriate once that review is to hand that there should be a fuller and more extensive debate in this House.  Perhaps I will pick up some of the points raised in the course of the debate.  Senator Ferris referred to the liberal attitude of the Department of Finance in helping those who had lost money sent abroad through the post.  I approve of a Department being helpful to people who were caught in that situation. It is proper to put on record that, it is very foolish indeed to send bank notes through the post, either within Ireland or abroad.  For those who want to send a present to a nephew in the UK there is no problem whatever about getting the necessary permission, in fact it is available automatically by securing the draft at the bank or post office.  That is the route which I would encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from Senator Ferris's remarks, it is also important to reiterate Government policy in regard to repatriation of profits.  I know that from time to time people have raised their eyebrows at substantial sums being made in Ireland by foreign-owned firms and at the profits being repatriated.  Let us be absolutely clear about this in case any streak of envy or jealousy might cloud our thinking.  It is part of our policy to encourage industrialists to invest in Ireland.  As part of that policy we have to be quite clear and <Col N="1522" /> specific that if they make profits here they are entitled to repatriate them.  It is correct that we have provided some avenues to encourage reinvestment here and that is a proper thing to do.  Let us be very clear that that is as far as it goes and there is no restriction on those who invest in manufacturing enterprises in Ireland in repatriating their profits if that is their wish.  Otherwise our industrial policy in encouraging external investment would have no proper basis.</P>
    <P>Regarding a number of points raised by Senators, it is proper that exchange controls alone, while they can protect reserves and hence the exchange rate of the IR£, it is not claimed in any way that they can do that themselves.  What happens is that the controls provide a measure of support for those reserves but they must be backed by appropriate economic and monetary policies.  Most countries operate exchange controls of one form or another.  In many ways that indicates a general acceptance of the view that controls, within their limitations, have a useful role in helping to maintain stability of exchange rates.  There is, however, a tendency now to move towards greater reliance on general monetary and economic policies and less reliance on exchange controls.  I support that movement and I hope in the years ahead we will be able to move as part of that tide within the EC and possibly outside it also.</P>
    <P>At the same time I am a realist.  We cannot, even if we aspire towards a dismantling of exchange controls, ignore the realities.  There is no point whatever in following that route particularly in an abrupt and disruptive manner unless we are prepared to accompany such movement with the appropriate monetary and economic policies.  I believe that in the years ahead we will see liberalisation within the EC.  The Treaty of Rome requires member states to abolish progressively over a transitional period restrictions on the movement of capital belonging to residents of member states to the extent necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Community. There are already four directives within <Col N="1523" /> the EC on exchange control and implementation of the Treaty obligations. As has been mentioned in our debate further effort has been made with our target date of 1992.  I hope we will be able to make further progress in that period.</P>
    <P>A number of references were made to outflows of moneys.  It is proper to say that the unexplained outflows of recent times do not necessarily reflect the ineffectiveness of exchange control.  A most informed advice and opinion suggests that the main channel through which the outflows took place is likely to be in the leading and lagging of trade payments.  I am not an economist but I will do the best I can to give an explanation as requested by Senator Lanigan. My understanding is that leading and lagging very simply means that you pay early for your imports and that on the other hand there is a delay in the repatriation of payment for exports.  That happens with monetary speculation.  Senator Lanigan, as a businessman, will understand what the effect could be if there is an alteration in trade credit patterns.</P>
    <P>There is scope for this within the existing exchange controls.  We have to bear in mind that our total merchandise trade is running at some £350 million per week, that is if you combine exports and imports.  Very stiff controls could be introduced but it would not be possible to prevent leading and lagging by stricter exchange controls without placing very serious restrictions on legitimate trade. That has to be borne in mind.  There was also reference to the possibility of breaches of exchange control and the possibility of some breaches of exchange control cannot be ruled out.  The Central Bank, who have primary responsibility for administring the controls, have advised that none of the evidence available to them positively suggests a long term capital outflow in the sense of a flow into long term external assets.  Of course the bank have been and are continuing to monitor the situation very closely indeed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, it would be useful, given the time, to have a full <Col N="1524" /> debate in this House on this whole area, because, as Senator Higgins said, in one sense it has very serious and wide ranging implications.  As of now, we are faced with merely renewing for a further period of four years the legislative framework that exists.  The fact that we are so doing does not prevent the Minister or the Government of the day, during that period, from introducing or going along with any other liberalisation measures.  I thank the Senators for their contributions to this Bill and I look forward to being in a position to join in a broader debate on another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the situation which arises following on the Supreme Court judgment of 12 December 1986 about the legality of the way in which District Court summonses are at present issued.  There seems to be a widespread misconception as to the purpose of the Bill.  It seems to be believed that it has to do with legalising computerisation in District Court offices. That is not so.  What the Bill seeks to do as its primary purpose is to legalise the issue of summonses by District Court clerks and the method by which they do so is secondary, if not irrelevant.  I will explain that when I come to deal with the different court judgments which form the background to this particular case. The background to the problem is as follows. On 20 March last the High Court gave its judgment in the case of <i>Clarke v Roche</i> on the issue of the validity of a <Col N="1525" /> summons issued to a Mr. Peter Senezio. The High Court identified three distinct steps required under the relevant statute &mdash; section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  These steps were:</P>
      <P>(1)  the making of a complaint to a person authorised to receive it.</P>
      <P>(2)  the receipt of such complaint by such person.</P>
      <P>(3)  the institution of proceedings on foot of a complaint which had been received.</P>
      <P>The court accepted that under the Statute and Rules of Court a complaint could be received by a District Court clerk and that a summons could be issued by the clerk on the basis of that complaint.  The court added, however, that unless it could be shown that the District Court clerk himself personally considered a complaint any summons which might be issued on foot of it would be invalid. In the computerised system for issuing summones this was not in fact being done. Computerisation of the issue of summonses in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court area commenced in 1982.  The volume of summonses issued by computer quickly grew to some 500,000 by 1985.  It is understandable that when dealing with summonses in this way personal attention was just not practicable and the inevitable effect of the High Court judgment was to invalidate the existing procedures.  Two steps were immediately taken, firstly, arrangements were made to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court and, secondly, the procedures for the issue of summones by computer were changed to the extent that the District Court clerk would consider each complaint before a summons was issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court gave its decision on the appeal in its judgment of 12 December 1986.  It upheld the decision of the High Court that service of a summons under the old procedures was not valid. The judgment, however, did much more than that.  As I have already indicated, the issue now no longer has anything to do with computerisation and it seems to me that there is still a serious public misconception <Col N="1526" /> that it has.  The issue is not what procedures a District Court clerk can, or cannot, adopt in serving summonses but whether a clerk can issue a summons at all.  The judgment raises a question about the validity of the issue of summonses even under the new procedures introduced after the High Court judgment of March 1986.  The Supreme Court said it was &ldquo;satisfied that on the terms of section 10 of the 1851 Act it is an inescapable conclusion that the issue of a summons upon the making of a complaint was a judicial act as distinct from an administrative one.&rdquo;  This interpretation meant that there was a serious question as to whether any District Court clerk could issue a summons legally at all within the provisions of the 1851 Act.</P>
    <P>However, the judgment went on to say that &ldquo;the difficulties arising from the desirability to avail, if at all possible, of modern and technical equipment and procedures in order to facilitate the issuing of District Court summonses may not be as great, from a legal point of view, as might originally appear&rdquo; and that there was &ldquo;much to be said for the point of view that with regard to summary summonses issued in criminal cases by members of the Garda Síochána, at least, it is no longer necessary nor appropriate for a justice of the District Court or any other person to reach a judicial determination as to whether the summons should be issued&rdquo;.  The court then said that consideration should be given to replacing sections 10 and 11 of the 1851 Act with statutory provisions more suitable to the modern District Court which could include the procedure for the issuing of summonses, in criminal cases at least, as being an administrative procedure only.</P>
    <P>As it happens the legal aspect of computerisation had already been under examination and my Department had for some time been working on proposals which would adapt procedures to bring them more into line with modern conditions. This examination is not, however, at a stage where it is possible to put forward final proposals in the form of a Bill for the approval of the Government. <Col N="1527" /> In the meantime, the Supreme Court decision presents an immediate problem which must be resolved if the course of justice is not to be frustrated. The Bill before the House is an urgent but minimum response to that problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that proceedings in the District Court in respect of an offence may be commenced by the issuing, as a matter of administrative procedure, of a document, to be referred to as a summons, by the appropriate office of the District Court.  This provision follows the line suggested in the judgment of the Supreme Court.  This summons will be sought not by way of &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; but by way of an application in the ordinary sense of the word.  Perhaps I should point out that, contrary to what has been suggested in another place the words &ldquo;as a matter of administrative procedure&rdquo; in the Bill are a quite deliberate repeat of those used in the judgment and are intended to re-echo the view expressed by the Supreme Court that the statutory provisions of the 1851 Act which, it held, make the issue of a summons a judicial matter can be replaced by other statutory provisions making it an administrative function without any fear of constitutional challenge.  The Bill goes on to indicate the form a summons will take and how it will be processed in the District Court Office.  It also identifies those who may apply for the issue of a summons.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious difficulty in regard to summonses which have already been issued but upon which there has not yet been a judicial determination.  It is important that the offences involved in them should be dealt with by the courts.  The Bill proposes, therefore, that the complaints which gave rise to the issue of these summonses since the date of the High Court judgment in March last will be treated as applications for the issue of summonses and in this way enable them to be dealt with under the general provisions of the Bill.  On the passing of the Bill the intention would be to reissue summonses in those outstanding cases.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should refer here to fears <Col N="1528" /> which have been expressed as to the dangers inherent in trying to bring to justice persons who might appear to have escaped jeopardy.  It has already been recognised that there is no question here of retrospective legislation in the constitutional sense in that nothing is being made a criminal offence which was not one at the passing of the Act.  Moreover, and I do not think that this was fully appreciated, the Bill does not seek to validate old summonses which may have been issued out of date, that is, where the complaint was made outside the relevant limitation period.  It is a strictly limited provision applying only to summonses which would &mdash; apart from the defect in the law which this Bill seeks to remedy &mdash; have otherwise been perfectly legal.  It will, I must add, operate for a strictly limited period.</P>
    <P>The mechanism which is being adopted in subsection (7) (b) of section 1 of the Bill is to enable &mdash; within the period up to 20 March next &mdash; new summonses to be issued by the District Court offices in cases where previously issued summonses are now regarded as invalid but which were otherwise properly issued.  When read with subsection (7) (a) this will mean that once the old summons was issued within the appropriate period of limitation the new summons will derive its validity as regards time from that fact. While this will naturally give rise to some administrative inconvenience, it is, I am assured, technically feasible.  The Supreme Court judgment also cast doubts on the competence of a peace commissioner to issue a valid summons for the same reasons as in the case of District Court clerks.  The Bill proposes that summonses already issued in the name of peace commissioners and which have not yet been judicially determined will also be dealt with by the issue of new summonses under the provisions of the Bill.  Suitable administrative arrangements are being made for the issue of these summonses in the District Court offices.  The number of summonses likely to be affected is up to 150,000 in Dublin and 100,000 in the provinces.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill proposes to preserve <Col N="1529" /> the provision of existing legislation for use in non-routine cases.  This means that, in appropriate cases, for example, charge sheet cases and cases where private individuals wish to take out summonses, the provisions in the 1851 Act may continue to be used.  Where they are, it is the intention that the summonses will be issued by District Justices only.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the way in which the Seanad has at the end of a most busy schedule agreed to take the Bill.  The House is being asked to deal at short notice with intricate matters which are important in the area of criminal justice.  That is not a matter of my choosing.  I should like to repeat what I have said elsewhere about the timing of the Bill.  It is unrealistic to expect that as a product of our efforts to bring court procedures into the 20th century I &mdash; or indeed any other Minister for Justice &mdash; could reasonably have foreseen that the role of the court clerks would be found to be invalid.  After all, an Act of the Oireachtas of 1926 purported to authorise functions to be given to the clerks by way of rules of court and the 1948 rules of the District Court purported specifically to give them the very functions in question but we have to deal with the situation as we find it now.  The purpose of the Bill is to do that as quickly as possible and I commend it to the House.</P>

I am not entirely confident that the procedure which is being adopted will not run into further trouble but it is an effort to deal with the problem and I hope, as an interim measure, it will manage to stop the gap and enable the courts to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation obviously was first seen after the High Court decision and I think something more could have been done in the interval than, in fact, has been done. However, the position is that the Bill is before us, the courts must go on and on the last day of the session this is one of <Col N="1530" /> the two crisis Bills we have to deal with. All I can say is that we must accept it.  I am not confident it will do what it is hoped it will do but I suppose the Minister and all of us can only hope for the best.</P>

      <P>This is a very technical Bill dealing with a very technical matter. Indeed, the more one reads the Bill and as one listens to the Minister speak it becomes more difficult to comprehend what this Bill is attempting to do.  I share the concern expressed by Senator Eoin Ryan as to whether this Bill will in fact achieve its objective.  I make that point because it seems that the purpose of this Bill is to deal with a problem that has arisen in District Court offices where summonses are issued in a particular form but the Bill does not address itself to cases where summonses are issued by District Justices and by peace commissioners.</P>
      <P>Following the Supreme Court decision in this matter when it came to the in escapable conclusion that the issue of a summons upon the making of the complaint was a judicial act as distinct from an administrative one, I presume that decision was to the effect that it applied in relation to the issue of all summonses whether by a District Justice, by peace commissioner or by the District Court clerk.  For that reason I wonder why the Bill apparently is limited in subsection (1) to the issue of summonses by District Court clerks.  It would appear to me, and I stand corrected if the case is otherwise, leaving aside subsection (8) of this Bill, that the issue of a summons by a District Court clerk or under the superintendence of the District Court clerk is an administrative act, while the issue of a summons by a peace commissioner, or by a District Justice is a judicial act.  If that is the case, then I think very serious difficulties can arise in relation to the more common practice adopted in rural Ireland of the issue of most summonses by District Court clerks.  Certainly by peace commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice in relation to the issue of summonses by peace commissioners is not one whereby they personally consider <Col N="1531" /> the complaint which is made to them.  It is a pity that the Minister did not provide in this Bill that the issue of all summonses should be deemed to be an administrative rather than a judicial function.  Perhaps the best example of that is where a member of the Garda is faced with a charge in respect of which a summons has to be issued.  The District Court rules provide that such a summons must be issued by a district justice.  A summons in respect of a member of the Garda or the complaint on which a summons is grounded, cannot be made before a peace commissioner or before a District Court clerk, it must be made before a district justice.  It would appear under those circumstances a district justice is not exercising a judicial function in the issuing of a summons on a complaint.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that the Bill should provide that the issue of all summonses would be deemed to be an administrative act.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to those thoughts that strike me in relation to this Bill.  Other than that, I accept that this Bill was brought about by the decision of the Supreme Court in the <i>Clarke v. Roche</i> case.  As legislators, we have had to respond to what has developed.  For that reason I welcome this Bill but my welcome is guarded.</P>

      <P>I will take first the points made by Senator Ryan.  Of course I will be dealing with those matters in the course of my speech. This is a measure that was taken to deal with a particular situation.  A further Courts Bill is in preparation but the preparation of that Bill will take some time yet.  It is a Bill in the context of which the wider issues raised by both Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Durcan are being addressed.  As they have both pointed out, those wider issues are perhaps a good deal more complex in themselves than the issues that are dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Durcan have some worries about whether or not the Bill will achieve its objective. The House will understand that <Col N="1532" /> in approaching legislation of this kind I would share those worries and in so far as we have been able to foresee the course of events following the enactment of this piece of legislation, I have confidence that it will bring about the result it sets out to achieve.  It is not true to say, of course, that we have not addressed the question of summonses issued by peace commissioners.  This matter was adverted to by the Supreme Court in its judgment. A reading of the Bill will indicate that summonses cannot now be issued by peace commissioners.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan said and I think this was at the centre of his remarks &mdash; that it was a pity not to provide that the issue of all summonses in all cases would be an administrative act.  That is a point certainly worth considering, but it is one which I do not think should be dealt with at the speed with which we have to deal with the matter that is in this Bill.  Initially that would more properly be considered in the context of the wider courts Bill to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the annual Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, both non-capital and capital, including Supplementary Estimates that were necessary during the year.  This year's Bill follows the usual format.  It appropriates, to the various services set out in its schedule, the sum of £6,566 million comprising the Estimates totalling £6,425 million as set out in the revised post-budget Book <Col N="1533" /> of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates of £141 million, which were approved by the Dáil during this year. The Bill also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts amounting to £537 million as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides the statutory basis for calculation of the &ldquo;four-fifths&rdquo; issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of next year's services during the period before the Dáil has an opportunity to consider and pass the various individual Votes.</P>
      <P>The year 1986 has seen a real improvement in the economic fortunes of this country but it has not been sufficient to make a significant contribution to overcoming the problems of unemployment or the public finances.</P>
      <P>Internationally, events this year have been dominated by the fall in oil prices. For Ireland, which must meet up to half its energy needs from abroad, this development has been of major importance. Already we have seen tangible benefits in terms of lower inflation and an improvement in our trade balance. However, it is important that we realise that the full benefits of events this year have not yet been felt; the spin-off effects of the oil price fall on growth and demand in the industrialised world are only now beginning to make an impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background of an improving international climate, we can point to solid progress in key areas of the economy this year.  The rate of inflation has fallen again, for the fifth year in succession, and has averaged less than 4 per cent, the lowest rate for almost 20 years. The inflation rate was over 23 per cent at the end of 1981, only five years ago.  Our current inflation rate compares well with an average rate of 3.1 per cent for the EC.  However, the EC average includes rates of 3.5 and 2.1 per cent for the UK and France respectively.  The Federal Republic of Germany actually registered a slight decline while the comparative US rate was 1.8 per cent.  While the decline in the rate of inflation and the narrowing <Col N="1534" /> of the divergence with the rates for the main trading partners is welcome, the figures nevertheless suggest that further improvement in our relative performance is essential in the interests of competitiveness. This can only come about if we are sensible and ensure that wage trends take full account of the lower trend of inflation.</P>
    <P>There has also been further progress in relation to the trade balance and the balance of payments deficit.  In the current year there has been a large increase in our trade surplus and the balance of payments deficit is expected to narrow again, to about half the level of last year. I need not remind Senators that the balance of payments is the key indicator for a small, open economy like ours and that the reduction in the external deficit to a sustainable level in recent years has been a major economic success.</P>
    <P>Last year saw an increase in the volume of personal consumption for the first time in several years.  This year there should be a further expansion in personal consumption, reflecting the increase in disposable income, due mainly to the rapid fall in inflation and the major tax reliefs provided in the 1986 budget.  While the retail sales figures, the main indicator of consumption, were rather disappointing earlier this year, the most recent data indicates that the underlying trend of domestic consumption is now definitely upward.</P>
    <P>The trend in unemployment continued to moderate in 1986 for the third year in succession.  Average unemployment for 1986 is likely to be somewhat lower than had been expected at the beginning of the year.  The Government have, within the constraints imposed by the public finances, made considerable efforts to stimulate employment through the house improvement grants scheme and other measures particularly in the area of special employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Overall, while we still face real and worrying problems in the economy &mdash; the high level of unemployment and the serious state of the public finances remain sources of major concern, we have made progress in certain key areas and prospects <Col N="1535" /> for the coming year are better now than they have been for some time.  The international forecasting agencies have indicated that international growth and demand will be stronger next year in the industrialised countries as the full benefits of the oil price fall come through.</P>
    <P>The Government's declared intention is to keep the 1987 Exchequer borrowing requirement within this year's original targeted level.  We are confident that if this course is followed, it will help interest rates to decline from their present exceptionally high level.  This will, in turn, boost confidence in the economy and stimulate investment.  This is the only real way to achieve durable growth in output and to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>Provided there is the right response to the measures proposed by the Government, 1987 should be another year of quite favourable economic progress. Hopefully, the events in 1986 which adversely affected the economy, such as the poor summer weather and the sharp decline in the number of American tourists coming to Europe, will not happen again in 1987.  There are good prospects therefore, that there will be a much broader based improvement in activity in 1987 compared with this year.  Furthermore, we also stand to gain from the more buoyant international conditions which are now emerging.  If exchange rates and crude oil prices remain relatively stable over the next year or so, there is likely to be a period of low inflation both domestically and internationally which should ease the way for the degree of pay moderation so necessary for competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As Senators will know, there has been some slippage in the targets which the Government set for the public finances this year.  The latest available expenditure and taxation returns point to an overrun on the current budget deficit of about £170 million and to an increase of the order of £180 million in the Exchequer's borrowing requirement.  It should be noted that this year's overruns are the first of any significance in the past four years.  The excess of up to £100 million in <Col N="1536" /> non-capital supply services expenditure is to a significant extent attributable to a combination of circumstances which could not have been anticipated.  Extra expenditure on agriculture has been necessitated because of bad weather conditions and increased costs of intervention owing to the devaluation of the Irish pound.  Other expenditure factors contributing to the overrun have been the teachers' pay settlement earlier in the year which involved a net additional sum of £13 million and the recent Government decisions on the social welfare Christmas bonus and the equal treatment provisions which have increased expenditure by £20 million.  While the overruns are due, to a significant extent, to factors of a non-recurring nature, they highlight the need for even tighter control of public expenditure in future years.  The balance of the overruns have resulted from shortfalls in tax and non-tax revenue.</P>
    <P>As far as the 1987 budget is concerned, the Government have already announced their decisions in the crucial area of borrowing. These provide for upper limits of 7.4 per cent and 11.8 per cent of GNP on the current deficit and of the Exchequer borrowing requirement respectively.  In settling these targets, the Government's concern was to find the right balance between reducing dependence on borrowing and avoiding excessive disruption. A continued high borrowing policy will undermine our political and economic independence.  It makes Government policy dependent on international interest movements, international banking opinion and other external factors.  Accordingly, a reduction in Exchequer borrowing is a key priority.</P>
    <P>The Government are at present finalising the details of the 1987 Estimates within the framework of the budgetary decisions already announced.</P>
    <P>There is widespread frustration with our tax system.  The general consensus is that tax levels are too high and that the distribution of the burden, for a variety of reasons, is unequal.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remark on the increase in the tax burden over the past decade. <Col N="1537" /> As a proportion of GNP, taxes have risen from 24 per cent in 1975 to more than 36 per cent now.  The adverse impact of this high taxation on the economy is unfortunately all too evident.  It acts as a dis-incentive to hard work, to initiative and investment.  It encourages the spread of the black economy.  It distorts trade and encourages smuggling.  However, substantial tax reductions are not feasible in the short term since they could only be achieved through further borrowing. That is not an acceptable option, because borrowing is no more than deferred taxation. Today we are paying the tax that was deferred last year and for the past ten years.  The higher taxes we pay today are in consequence not available to support spending programmes.  Instead, an increasing burden of interest on past debt is pre-empting much of our revenue.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, with substantial growth in the economy, with more people at work and with a healthier budgetary position, there should be room to bring taxation down to more acceptable levels. However, to reach this position, we must first curtail public spending to a level our economy can reasonably support.  Only through the control of expenditure can our excessive borrowing and burden of debt servicing be ameliorated and the conditions for stimulating sustained economic growth be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In its recent report entitled <i>&ldquo;A strategy for development 1986-1990</i>&rdquo;, the National Economic and Social Council said that &ldquo;the stabilisation of the debt-GNP ratio must now be a minimum objective of fiscal policy&rdquo;.  It emphasised that &ldquo;any adverse consequences of stabilising the debt burden must be set against some of the more positive effects&rdquo;.  It went on to say that &ldquo;it is neither feasible or desirable to effect the required degree of adjustment...... through the medium of higher taxation&rdquo;. The Council also recognised that &ldquo;correction of the chronic imbalances in the public finances will require a considerable degree of sacrifice from society&rdquo;. However, it pointed to the positive effects of adjustment, saying that these would &ldquo;derive primarily from an easing <Col N="1538" /> of interest rate pressures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are lessons in all of this.  The policy of following a path of high expenditure, part paid for by high taxation but also based on heavy borrowing, has failed.  High taxation has impeded growth.  It has also evoked an understandably adverse public reaction.  We must change our approach &mdash; continuation of that kind of policy can lead only to further and greater difficulties.</P>
    <P>If we are to create the growth that is needed to expand employment and to sustain a reasonable level of public services, we must first create the conditions for that growth.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Appropriation Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his officials for presenting this document to us &mdash; in fact, I think he should submit it to the Booker prize committee.  He should submit it in the fairytale category and it might have a good chance of winning some sort of a prize.  Speaking realistically about the economy, this Bill before us and the Minister's speech is far removed from what is perceived and what is actually happening in the Irish economy today.  The Minister does not have to go very far from this House to see the large numbers of unemployed. The Minister may suggest there is an underlying trend of a growth in employment but this is not being perceived outside.  The 235,700 people who were registered as being unemployed last week, which probably has gone up to 245,000 this week, would not agree with the scenario as presented here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that excessive borrowing has played a major part in the problems which have been created for the Irish people.  It appears to me and to many other people that the Government do not realise the situation is not improving. There is an over-simplification in the Minister's speech regarding future prospects. When one looks at the problems which are going to be faced and which are being faced by the agricultural sector as a result of decisions made in Europe <Col N="1539" />&mdash; even in the past week &mdash; one will see there will be further problems in that area.  However, they are not referred to by the Minister, and he is presenting the appropriation account here to us at the end of this session of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As has been suggested, there will be short term gains in agriculture for those who get out of milk production but this 28p per gallon over the next seven years is purely and simply a short term gain. After the seven years there is very little chance that these smaller farmers, particularly when they get out of milk, will have the opportunity to work in agriculture. There is little opportunity of changing to beef because that is not an option and neither are root crops or cereals.  There is also the fact that it would appear from Government policy that they will close the Tuam factory.  The Tuam sugar factory gave small farmers in the west an opportunity to have a cash crop at a time when they needed cash.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the international drop in the price of oil and resultant significant advantages to the Irish economy.  Unfortunately, whatever advantages are associated with the drop in oil prices, have not been passed on to the general public.  The tax take from oil is much higher than it should be.  This is reflected in the fact that many thousands of people have been put out of work in the motor trade over the past few years. This is due to direct Government intervention, in the sense that the take by the Revenue Commissioners from oil has increased.  Another significant point that has been raised in the Minister's speech, is that the tax take in terms of GNP, has gone from 24 per cent in 1975 to 36 per cent which is an amazing increase in a short number of years.  This increase, in tax take by the Government, is reflected in the fact that shoppers are no longer able to buy Irish goods.</P>
    <P>It would appear that an increasing number of people are going across the Border, to England and outside the country for their purchases.  It is disgraceful to think that each day there are thousands of people crossing our Border and with <Col N="1540" /> no attempt by the Revenue Commissioners to check the goods that are purchased in the North.  There does not seem to be a willingness by Government to tackle this major problem.  I have absolutely no wish to suggest that Northerners should not shop in the South and that the Southern Irish should not shop in the North.  It is essential if we are going to have coming together off the communities in both parts of the Island, that we should have the to-ing and fro-ing of a cultural nature and in an economic sense.  Nevertheless, if we have a tax regime in the South which is so high, which precludes people from buying essentials in the white goods area, in the motor accessory and in the motor vehicle area, in the area of electrical goods of all kinds and in certain foodstuffs, and particularly in the area of detergent powders and so forth, there should be further checks on traffic on the main roads in and out of the North.</P>
    <P>The motor trade has been decimated over the past number of years because of the increasing intervention by Government in the raising of taxes and the taking of taxes from this particular section.  The motor trade, which was very highly motivated, which provided excellent training and jobs for young people and provided many jobs will disappear unless there is some help given to it.  The agricultural industry is facing increasing problems in every area.  These problems, are due to the fact that the CAP system is coming under increasing pressure.  It would seem that food production will not be subsidised and the marketplace is going to dictate what farmers will get for their products.  This may not be a good thing for the Irish farmer.  If we could do away with the intervention mountains there would be a better perception of fairness in the system.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that the only people who are making exceptionally good money from the intervention system are the people who are running the intervention cold stores.  It is disgraceful that food is left in these intervention stores until it becomes unfit for human consumption. Suggestions have been made <Col N="1541" /> that this food should be sent to areas in southern Africa experiencing hunger. Unfortunately, if there is a total dumping of free food into that particular area, while it might solve some of the problems of hunger in the area but it could, equally, wipe out an indigenous farming population in that area who depend when they get rain on the sale of surplus farm products for the only small amount of cash they are able to gather.</P>
    <P>The spin-off which the Minister mentions in terms of the fall in oil prices has not been felt by the consumer.  There have been small reductions in the cost of petrol.  When one looks at the price of a litre of petrol as against the price of a litre of petrol ten years ago one would see that the reduction is not significant because of the higher tax take.  It is suggested there is going to be a reduction in ESB prices over the next weeks.  This must be welcomed.  Any reduction in ESB charges will have a certain effect on the Irish industrial scene and, again, might turn some companies which are marginally unprofitable at present into profit.</P>
    <P>The difficulties facing Irish business because of high taxation are to be seen every day in the growth of unemployment. Anybody who reads the newspapers each day will see that there is an increasing number of companies going to the wall.  The number of liquidations and receiverships is not decreasing but is increasing at an alarming rate.  If one reads the Dublin gazette or any trade magazine one will see that they are getting bigger and bigger as judgments are made against an increasing number of companies.  An increasing number of companies are being put into liquidation. Unfortunately it is not voluntary liquidation where companies are just closing down; there are companies closing down voluntarily because they find that they cannot get a return from their investment in business.</P>
    <P>The situation in the motor trade and farming is disastrous.  Another indicator one could look at is the situation in the beer trade where public houses are closing <Col N="1542" /> down.  In the past in times of economic decline public houses seemed to do well because people went to public houses because they felt they could forget their troubles.  They do not have the money to go there now and public houses are closing down throughout the country as are businesses which traditionally close down when the cold economic winds blew through the business scene.</P>
    <P>The fact that the inflation rate has come down is not for something the Minister should praise himself.  The inflation rate came down in Ireland because of international trends.</P>

      <P>The fact that inflation has come down to 3 per cent has meant that interest rates are at 15 per cent to 17 per cent depending on whether you are a &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;, a &ldquo;AA&rdquo; or whatever.  You can pay between 13.75 per cent and 20 per cent for money and with inflation down to 3 per cent the real interest rates being borne by businesses have gone up by approximately 10 per cent in the past year.</P>

      <P>Even though there might seem to the Minister to be a benefit in having a very low inflation rate, the only real benefit that would accrue from a very low inflation rate would come about if interest rates come down.  Only when interest rates come down will the benefits be felt in Irish industry.  When inflation was at 23 per cent bank interest rates were at approximately 15 per cent so there was a benefit to the customer in having a high inflation rate.  It may not have been of any great benefit to the Government at the time.  Nevertheless it is a fact that the inflation rate has come down but it has not come down because of the influence of the Minister or the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bank interest rates are too high and very few businesses can afford to stay in <Col N="1543" /> business with the high interest rates that are being charged as a direct result of Government intervention.  I hope that within the next few months there will be a lowering of interest rates.  The prospects do not seem to be good for that because there is no mention of it in the Minister's speech.  If the Minister thought interest rates would be lowered he should have said so.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the trade balance, the balance of payments deficit and the large increase in our trade surpluses.  The balance of payments deficit is expected to narrow again to about half the level of last year. Unfortunately the benefits in terms of trade balance are not accruing to a large extent within the Irish economy.  A number of funds are being generated in Ireland which are being expatriated by international companies.  Even though much money is being made by these companies it is being expatriated &mdash; the black <Col N="1544" /> hole as it is being called.  I am not suggesting we should stop foreign firms from coming in to Ireland.  The investment of foreign firms is and has been of enormous benefit to this economy.  There are about 8,000 foreign companies in the country and a large proportion of these are from countries within the EC.  Over the next few months the new Government will have to address themselves to the question of the completion of the internal market and try to ensure that in the completion of the internal market trade barriers will be broken down within the EC. Unless trade barriers are broken down we are not going to get any benefits from the European Community.  We are suffering because of the fact that the internal market has not been completed.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department suggest that there will be large reductions in revenue to the Commissioners if there is harmonisation or rationalisation of taxation regimes throughout the European Community.  I do not think we should have problems all along the way.  There has to be some sort of rationalisation and harmonisation of the taxation system throughout Europe and equally there should be no inhibitions on cross-border and trans-border traffic of goods manufactured within Europe.  The difficulties we are experiencing in terms of trade are not being experienced by our major trading competitors such as Japan or America.  If one leaves Boston with a load of goods one crosses State barriers but there is no inhibition in regard to border controls.  There are no paper work controls and they have the same taxation regime within the States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Japan is one of the best trading nations in the world and they do not have the same problems as we have.  We, in Europe, should look at Japan more carefully. Even though we are looking for an opening up of trade throughout the world, nevertheless the barriers put up by Japan against imports should be looked at.  We should not allow so many Japanese goods to come in if we are not prepared to hammer at them that they must allow the same openness in terms of Irish exports into Japan.  In terms of <Col N="1545" /> world trade we see Ireland as part of a declining Europe.  As a trading bloc the SEATO countries, which would have been considered to be almost Third World countries five or six years ago, are getting stronger and stronger.  The Government and the Departments involved in trading should look at this carefully to find out why this is happening.</P>
    <P>A projection was made by the Government at the beginning of the year that taxation would be buoyant towards the end of the year as a result of certain benefits they were bringing in because of their taxation changes at the beginning of the year.  They said there would be an increase in personal consumption and, as a result, the Government &ldquo;take&rdquo; in the indirect taxation system would increase. The Minister mentioned that there is an increase in personal consumption for the first time in several years.  He or his advisers have not spoken to the traders.  I guarantee that when he goes into Grafton Street, O'Connell Street, High Street in Kilkenny, or Ross Street in Waterford he wil find that there is not a trader in Ireland who would suggest that there is an increase in the volume of personal consumption. The Minister may have figures for the past two or three weeks which would change my impression of this but the statistics we get do not add up to what is mentioned in his speech.</P>

      <P>The most recent data in the case indicate that: &ldquo;The underlying trend of domestic consumption is now definitely upward&rdquo;.  Underlying trends are no use &mdash; it is the volume of trading being done that is important.  Ministers suggest that the &ldquo;underlying trend&rdquo; in unemployment is downwards even when the numbers are going up.  When I see more people going through shops and business premises, only then will I accept that the situation is as the Minister suggests. The Minister says: &ldquo;The trend in unemployment continued to moderate in 1986 for the third year in succession&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is no point in the Minister trying to fool us in terms of trends in unemployment.  The facts are that there are an increasing number of young people unemployed.  There are quite a number of young people in short term employment schemes throughout the country which are not of great benefit to them except that it gives a temporary measure of work to them.  There has to be a rationalisation in these training schemes.  We have to show that these training schemes are going places and are not just stop-gap measures as were brought in in the days of the Famine when stone walls were built all over the country just because they looked well on the estates of the landlords who probably did not live on the estate.  There is an element of stone wall building in many of the training schemes.  If we are to bring a number of State training agencies together I hope one of the things that will be looked at is the long term benefit of training schemes.  I saw about 25 people working on a Dodder bank scheme this morning.  Perhaps that will be of benefit to the community around the Dodder bank but what I saw was four people shoving tree fellings into the middle of the river.  Undoubtedly these would go further down the Dodder and block some place else.  I suggest that the recipient of any benefit that might result from that exercise would be the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn whose name was in big print over where these people were working.  I presume that was not because the Minister comes from the constituency but whether that will be of benefit to him in the next election is open to question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the prospects for 1987 I would wish I could stand up here and say that in terms of business that there would be an increase of confidence within the business community.  That confidence is not there at present.  I am not going to suggest that we should preach despondency at all times but we have to have a response from the Government that will give the business community the opportunity <Col N="1547" /> to reinvest.  There is not enough money left in businesses to reinvest.  The result of this lack of reinvestment in businesses can be seen by the number of businesses which are closing down and the huge increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are going to be benefits in the future because we have a very young and better educated population.  I read the statistic the other day that between 1982 and the end of 1984 650,000 fewer people were living in Germany and that between 1984 and 1986 there will be a further one million fewer.  Obviously the population trends are going downwards in that country. I am not a preacher of emigration, but there will be opportunities for our young population in such places.  The biggest problem the Germans will face in the near future, the problem we are facing now, is that as the population grows older the State will have to provide more services for elderly people and there will not be enough people paying tax to support them.  When, as in our case there are too few workers, a higher percentage of tax must be taken from them.  The Government must change the trends in unemployment and leave enough money in business to sustain future growth in that area.  If there is to be a future growth obviously there will be an increasing employment rate.</P>
    <P>The biggest understatement made by the Minister was in relation to public finances.  He said that there has been some slippage in the targets the Government set this year.  He also said that the excess of up to £100 million in non-capital supply service expenditure is to a significant extent attributable to a combination of circumstances which could not have been anticipated.  The dogs in the street could have anticipated that this £100 million non-capital supply service expenditure would come about.  The Government did not foresee what was going to happen throughout the year and they should have.  We accept that extra expenditure on agriculture as being necessitated by bad weather and the increased cost of intervention owing to the devaluation of the Irish pound.  The <Col N="1548" /> Government devalued the pound at a time when oil prices and interest rates were coming down.  They made a major blunder in that decision which was taken over a weekend.  The effects of that devaluation were not to the benefit of the economy, as has been accepted here.  It has cost the economy.  There is no point in bringing in other expenditure factors which contributed to the overrun.  It is obvious that in any year there will be an overrun in terms of negotiations which go on about pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>From reading the Bill I see that over £9 million was paid in overtime to 1,600 prison officers.  This is disgraceful at a time when we have such a huge unemployment problem.  I am sure the Prison Officers' Association would prefer to have more people working within the prison system.  In that way we would have a more efficient prison system and the officers would be working hours which are compatible with a reasonable lifestyle rather than what is happening at present where they are being paid excessive amounts of overtime, working excessive hours and the conditions are not up to what they should be.</P>
    <P>The constraints being put on people in the public service are not to the benefit of the country in general because there is an arbitrary reduction in the public service.  There are areas of collection of revenue which are being neglected. There is absolutely no doubt but that there is a need for extra people in the Revenue Commissioners.  I am no great lover of the Revenue Commissioners, having problems with them which are of my own making.  I would prefer to see more people employed and that an actual amount of tax could be suggested as being owed rather than having the present situation where there is complete misapprehension as to what tax is owed and what has been assessed.</P>
    <P>In the area of customs and excise there is a need for the employment of extra people.  These people would not be a burden on the State because the State is losing a considerable amount of revenue because of lack of officers.  It is disgraceful coming up to Christmas that <Col N="1549" /> because of a dispute in the postal system, there was no control on parcels coming in to Ireland.  It has been suggested that quite an amount of drugs and arms were brought in.  These suggestions may or may not be true, but the fact that there were no negotiations to solve that problem has meant an outrun of revenue.</P>
    <P>There is widespread frustration with the tax system.  This State is more socialist now than many States who would declare themselves to be socialist.  If there was a reasonable return on investment in industry there would be nobody in Ireland who would not be willing to pay a reasonable amount of tax on their profits but we have a tax regime, between direct and indirect taxes, which is a disincentive.  Even those who declare themselves to be socialist would like to see people get a reasonable return so that you could have some benefits to spread throughout the economy as a result.</P>
    <P>Coming at the end of the year this debate on the Appropriation Bill is obviously important.  Unfortunately, because of time constraints the debate will finish before Members will have had an adequate amount of time to go through it.  However, I am glad the debate will continue after Christmas and, on the runin to a general election, speakers will have an opportunity to say a few words about what should and should not be the policy of future Fianna Fáil Governments after 19 February.</P>
    <P>I agree that the stabilisation of the debt-GNP ratio must now be a minimum objective of fiscal policy.  We have to have a stabilisation of the debt burden within this country, and we have to have a reduction but the present Government have increased the percentage of debt borne by every single member of the community in Ireland.  The Minister is welcome to his view about the economy but I am afraid his viewpoint as expressed here is not the viewpoint of anybody outside the walls of this Chamber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a socialist Member of the House the confidence of my colleague about the return to Government of his party fails to impress me.  He has some <Col N="1550" /> grounds for his belief, according to the polls etc.  I wish them well in the democratic process but I would not rush into the situation as quickly as my colleague because the public are questioning many things nowadays which in the past they took for granted.  The previous Government &mdash; now in Opposition &mdash; are not entirely blameless for some of the problems we have inherited in Ireland, and which we are now trying to come to grips with as a result of previous policies including massive borrowings to finance existing debts and other non-productive purposes.  This Government, who have been trying to come to grips with this problem, have been castigated for trying to be responsible in their approach to the problem of the economy.  In spite of their past deeds in the areas of economic participation it amazes me that there still seems to be this inbuilt support in the Irish electorate for the idea that a continuation of this kind of policy in the future is somehow the answer to all our ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking at a television programme last night which suggested that promises are now being made which could be costed at about £800 million. Nobody seems to have any idea of where this kind of money can be found.  If the public are still unaware of the consequences of those kind of promises going into an election this country will never come out of its economic crisis.  I hope the electorate will be much more definitive in their questioning of how we can continue to survive as a nation and try to pay our way.  The total amount of £6.5 billion in the Appropriation Bill is pretty staggering: the Houses of the Oireachtas, £12 million; the Central Statistics Office, £13 million; the Office of Public Works, £106 million; the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, £86 million.  Senator Lanigan advocated increasing expenditure in the revenue area, putting more people into tax offices.  There have been calls from people who feel that our tax collection system does not have the best record in the world.  I do not know if that goes back to what is perceived to be the amount of money owed to us arising from assessments <Col N="1551" /> made and not contested or the actual genuine amount of money that is due.  There is a feeling in the minds of working people that somehow the private sector, the farmer, the self-employed and the business man are paying no tax or can get away for years without paying it.  If the Revenue Commissioners need additional staff and facilities to come to grips with that problem we would all agree with the concept that we should have a proper system to collect from people who legitimately owe money to the State.</P>
    <P>The areas of highest expenditure include social welfare at £1.552 billion and health at £1.153 billion.  These are staggeringly high figures.  The problem with figures like that is that in a tight budget situation they seem to be the areas economists and media writers always turn their attention to &mdash; if we were to solve the evils in our economy these high spending areas should be approached and attacked.  That is a dangerous philosophy to have, because the people in those two areas of high spending are the people who are most in need.  They are dependent upon the social welfare system and the health system.  They are two of the major spending areas and they are two of the major areas to which the lower paid or the underprivileged turn in their time of need.  It is popular nowadays to talk about effecting economies in these areas, but it is highly dangerous.  We could do untold harm to the poorest sections of the community if, for the sake of balancing the books, we were, to introduce some sort of curtailment in these areas.  The economic consequences of doing that would be extremely serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech indicated improvements that have taken place in our economy.  One has to keep repeating this because people do not believe it.  The public do not believe it simply because the expectation rate of everybody is continuing to increase away beyond our capacity to meet it.  They are more willing to believe that we are in a crisis rather than that anything constructive has been <Col N="1552" /> done or is being done by the Government. I hope, whenever the next election comes that there will be a forum in which people can be properly informed in this whole area of how we are going to attack problems of our economy.</P>
    <P>Inflation is continuing to fall and is at its lowest for many, many years.  As the Minister said, when it was increasing the Government was blamed for it but when it is continuing to fall the Opposition suggest we should not take any credit for it.  It has fallen and it is at a level which we all welcome.  Our industrial exports have continued to rise.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure is a major problem and must be brought under control but not necessarily curtailed in the sensitive areas which I mentioned.  The rate of unemployment has dropped but the total numbers are continuing to rise.  As Senator Lanigan said, irrespective of the trend being improved, the numbers are continuing to rise.  The Senator would know because in their last Government, in their last year in office unemployment increased by 40,000.  The annual average increase at present is about 3,000, which is a dramatic improvement.  Unfortunately, we just keep adding to our total unemployed workforce young people who will have to turn either to emigration or become dependent on social welfare unless something specific is done in this area.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to Senator M. Higgin's contribution this morning about a planned economy.  Unless we plan how jobs are to be created and how an economy is to be developed to create jobs, then we will have missed the economic tide.  This country is too important to all of us to allow that to happen.  We hope that whoever captains the ship in 1987 will realise that it is very easy for the ship to run aground so that it becomes waterlogged.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan condemned some of the social employment schemes that have been inaugurated particularly over the past 12 months.  I do not share his views in this regard nor will anybody who is associated with local authorities or local <Col N="1553" /> communities which have availed themselves of these schemes to employ people in very important work in the community, environmentally and otherwise. This scheme has brought between 11,000 and 15,000 off the dole and into employment. It has made a major social contribution in the areas in which it applies and psychologically it has been very important for those who participated.</P>
    <P>The improvement during the year from £70 to £85 for a social employee and his dependant was a further incentive for people with families to come off the unemployment register.  The amount of work that has been done by local authorities &mdash; not just building stone walls as Senator Lanigan has said &mdash; in many very important environmental projects, has been dramatic.  Anybody dealing with the trade unions, county managers or anybody at local authority level will tell you that it was one of the most important employment schemes ever initiated by any Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, should be congratulated for the way he designed the scheme.  As a result of that he was chosen recently to chair an international conference of Ministers of Labour in the area of economic development. I am pleased that the scheme has been revamped and that local authorities have been given the all-clear to go ahead with further projects.  With the removal of the rating system and the financial consequences for local authorities we were precluded from employing people directly because we did not have the finance available.  We were greatly limited by the restrictions on our capabilities to strike a rate.</P>
    <P>Members of my party have been criticised for being Members of this Government. This criticism has come from everybody, including trade unions.  I said in this House recently that it may take ten years for the workers and the poorer sections in our community to realise the input that the four Labour Cabinet Ministers had in this difficult period: it was a difficult period, a period when it would have been much easier to be in Opposition and to call with abandon for all sorts of spending sprees without having <Col N="1554" /> the responsibility of having either to cost them or provide the finances for them.</P>
    <P>In that difficult period we have managed with our colleagues in the Fine Gael Party to develop a whole range of economic activities and maintenance of social welfare to a degree that had not been surpassed in the Community.  We all admit that the introduction recently of equality legislation in social welfare created problems and in spite of the easing of those problems by temporary measures by the Government there are still problems in that area.  I am not satisfied that the legislation or the directive initiating the legislation is in any way creating equalities.  I have discovered that while the legislation and directive from Europe insisted that people would be treated as equal &mdash; men and women, married or otherwise, in the areas of social welfare &mdash; in introducing the legislation it was still provided that instead of treating two married adult claimants as equals in their own right to social welfare benefit at the end of the day, if by so doing their incomes totalled more than that of a married couple, they would get only the married couples' allowances.</P>
    <P>That is not equality.  A married woman in her own right should be able to claim if she has stamps and get paid in her own right.  A decision can be made which of them can claim for the children or you can divide the number of dependants. I honestly believe a woman should be treated in her own right as an adult and the fact ignored that she is a dependent adult.  There is the concept that if you put the two of them together at the end of the day they cannot be paid more than a married couple.  In the area of social welfare the equality concept has not been properly addressed at all.  That will have to be looked at again.  We can still do so and live within the directive from the Community.</P>
    <P>Other areas where the Government have managed to bring about major changes include the implementation of the legislation setting up the National Development Corporation.  We have also had a radical reassessment of the health services.  The Minister for Health has <Col N="1555" /> come in for more criticism in his time than any other Minister &mdash; unfairly, because the Minister has applied his efforts in an economic area which involves so many of the poorer sections of the community but which also gives a very important service to so many people that any rationalisation of that programme is obviously going to be misrepresented. He has achieved much.  He has tried to cut out wastefulness that happened in the past in the health services. This has always been referred to as a cutback.  In my area, in spite of saving about £15 million over a period of four-and-a-half years the health services continue to be delivered very efficiently.  We managed to have economies in areas of wastefulness.  That is how our Parliamentary Party would want to see the public enterprise developing.  In spite of our minority position in Government, we have made a major impact on public decisions of tremendous importance particularly during periods of recession and hardship.</P>
    <P>In the area of the Department of the Environment there has been a major development programme, the biggest road building programme in the history of the State.  The level of investment in roads for the years 1985 to 1987 will be greater as a percentage of GNP, as a percentage of the total capital expenditure programme than at any time over the past quarter of a century.  It has risen steadily from 3 per cent of total capital expenditure in 1980 to 7 per cent in 1985 and 8.5 per cent in 1986.  There are major roadworks all over the country as anybody travelling our roads will have seen. There are roadworks going on in my constituency and throughout the country. The road projects itemised in the future planning programme which will be completed by 1987 will include a whole range of other major road by-passes that are being discussed and processed with local authorities.</P>
    <P>We have tried to keep a balance between the national primary network and the network in urban areas and in the less important roadways.  A proper <Col N="1556" /> road and rail network are important infrastructural developments in any country that aspires to be industrial.  The record of this Government in the area of infrastructural development has been second to none.  I am very proud of that. Improvements have been made through road block-grant assistance to local authorities in many areas in which specific allocations were made which could be applied for the first time to local authority roads, particularly since the change in the rating system.</P>
    <P>In the area of local authority housing, the Government have made a most significant contribution to curtailing many of the waiting lists.  We have complaints from some local authorities that they have houses to which they are unable to assign tenants.  It is a pity if that is the case but in my local authority area the Minister has approved of going to tender to renovate the low-cost houses that were built under another jurisdiction and which have created major problems for us because of maintenance and the fact that very few people wanted to take up occupancy.  We found them suddenly becoming the cause of social problems. They were becoming ghettoes; normal families were not prepared to accept them and were prepared to go on waiting lists for better houses.</P>
    <P>This Government have now put in a scheme of high subsidy assistance to local authorities to enable them to bring these houses up to the proper standard.  I hope when that happens that most of the local authorities in the country will not have the kind of waiting lists I remember in the days when we were in Opposition and when we called for emergency housing programmes because we had so many families waiting for houses living in caravans and wrecked motorcars.  We have gone from that.  This Government have built over 7,000 local authority houses per annum over a number of years.  The standard of local authority houses is higher than has ever been achieved before.  It has not been achieved by some of the private sector housing or co-operative housing in the same areas on land provided by local authorities.  There has <Col N="1557" /> been a dynamic input by the Government into the development of houses for people who need them.</P>
    <P>The private housing sector has also been assisted by increases in new house grants.  New house grants have gone up from £1,000 to £2,000 and people can now get a house grant for a second house. For the first time ever, people can improve their situation by building a second new house.  When the scheme was initiated if you had a house in England you would be barred from a new house grant in this country.  That has been liberalised recently by the Minister for the Environment and it is possible to get normal grant incentives.  The £5,000 grant for local authority tenants transferring to private houses, whether new or secondhand, has been a tremendous boost and has given people an incentive to improve their housing.  That has ensured a steady flow of secondhand local authority houses has become available for renting.  Many people have criticised that but I see nothing wrong with helping people to help themselves, if by so doing they make available to the local authority a house in good repair.  It has to be in good repair under the scheme.  That is progress.</P>
    <P>I have listened to criticism from the Opposition of this Government's activity in the construction industry.  I heard their spokesman last night throwing in this as if it was going to be the panacea for all our ills.  I do not know whether the private sector building private houses needs Government assistance to do that.  I agree the construction industry has contracted because the private sector demand has diminished.  I do not know if that is the responsibility of Government.  Some people who do not believe in socialism would say that it is not but they are the people who feel that it should.  I am anxious that we get our minds straight on what we are doing.  Are we providing incentives for people who cannot build houses, or are we providing incentives for those who can, and want money handed direct to the construction industry?</P>
    <P>This Government have carried out more public construction than any <Col N="1558" /> Government in the past.  They have built hospitals, health centres, local authority houses and roads, all in the construction industry area.  They have used public money, European money and other moneys to develop a public building programme, and still we hear talk that the construction industry needs further assistance.  I am prepared to listen to any argument but our policies have been generous with the building industry.  If something else needs to be done that would generate employment, let us talk about it.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, industry in Ireland has accepted assistance from this Government, through the tariffs that were imposed in the thirties to protect and make easier the expansion of industry, through credit provided by the ICC and the rapid expansion of grant aid to industry by the IDA in the sixties, seventies and eighties and the wide range of subsidised, specialist services that are provided by all the State agencies. Despite this, we have arguments from the industrial sector for a free private enterprise ethos allowing individual enterprises to flourish without Government interference.  There is scarcely a firm or industry in this country that has not over the years benefited in some way from the IDA, CTT and AnCO grants and other grants and specialised services like the IIRS and other Government agencies.  Most of the industries appear to want the freedom to accept Government funding with no strings attached and the freedom not to pay any tax.  That sums it up.  We have been a most generous State in trying to influence industrial development here from abroad and we have been successful.  The IDA have been criticised for their expenditure in this connection but if we look at what they have been trying to do, they have been successful; they have managed to coax people to come to this country to set up industry here and taxpayers' money has been used to do that.</P>
    <P>We are an open economy and I applaud that.  Senator Lanigan referred to us as a socialist economy.  We are certainly liberal <Col N="1559" /> with the private sector, and have been, and I am not at all satisfied with the response of the private sector in the job creation area.  Everybody seems to feel that it is the Government's responsibility. Everybody also agrees that it is the Government's responsibility to create a climate which will be an incentive to industry to set up here.</P>
    <P>I have itemised some of the areas in which we have tried to assist industry to come to this country.  The great paradox is that those who have argued loudest against the NDC have been those who have happily accepted that the IDA, Industrial Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta and all of these should provide funding for the industry.  We want to establish the concept of a corporation that could link the two together, the State and the private sectors.  They had ideological problems in that process.  They like the transfer of funds from the State to themselves and say: &ldquo;Thank you very much&rdquo; and leave it at that but they do not like to have responsibility to say how they spent the money.  The National Development Corporation are the ideal kind of vehicle and I hope they will prove so in the future.  Recently they have gone into some enterprises which possibly without them we would have lost.  I am thinking of our national film industry. Were it not for the intervention of the NDC it is possible that the kind of people who are now involved in it would never otherwise have been involved.  There is this kind of schizophrenic attitude among capitalists or people who follow the capitalist system to feel that it is all right to hand money to the private sector not to set up any formal structures under which anybody would have to reveal how the money was being spent, or how efficiently.  This is what Senator Michael D. Higgins is talking about &mdash; planning what we are doing in a proper way.  There has been an investment from the public and private sectors in this practical idea and generally, once people overcome the ideological hang-ups they had about it, they will see that it will make a major <Col N="1560" /> contribution to industrial development in the coming years.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk recently from many people including some Ministers who are fond of talking about privatisation. They talk about the possibility of efficient State enterprises being disposed of to the private sector.  They do not see anything wrong with it: the money that would be got from that would help our balance of payments and all this kind of philosophy.  I am always worried about the fact that the enterprises they want to sell off to the private sector seem to be the efficient ones.  The Government have put public money into trying to make the public sector efficient.  Why should we dispose of it if it is going to be efficient and would be of benefit to the Government and the coffers of the Government in the future?  We have dealt with legislation here and I hope will make for efficiency in CIE and other similar bodies but I would also like to feel that having developed an infrastructure in forestry and a planting programme it would benefit the people as a whole.  If banks can see a future in going into forestry, well, let them do so in virgin land that is suitable. Why should they expect the State to hand over or to buy from the State forests in which we have invested public money?</P>
    <P>It is easy for An Bord Telecom and An Post now to be efficient.  Everybody talks about how marvellous they are since they were taken away from the Department: the reality is that we had put the whole thing together for them and invested public funds to make them efficient, millions of pounds, in infrastructure, new cable lines etc. &mdash; hundreds of millions &mdash; and then we handed them over.  If they do well in the first year afterwards they are marvellous: it just goes to show how bad the Government are and how they handle Departments.  This kind of attitude begins to come into the public mind whereas we made the operation and then handed it over.  Unfortunately, some of these are in a sort of semi-State situation still but it is intended that they should run on a commercial basis and there is nothing wrong with that.  I do not think <Col N="1561" /> it could be said that we ever supported lame duck situations, even in the public sector.  We have always been anxious for efficiency and I think that the more efficiency we can get from the public sector the better, because we could enter into a new era of public sector bashing. It has been going on.  At public meetings or any function that one goes to address as a public representative, the first to be the scapegoat of any criticism is the Civil Service or the &ldquo;faceless bureaucrats&rdquo; in Dublin or in Europe or wherever else it is.  It is a popular thing now if you cannot put a face on somebody to criticise them. If you sit into a bus, train or plane, somebody behind you will be critical of public servants, civil servants, Oireachtas Members or the Ministers.  This is quite a dangerous thing.  Unless we stress the importance of what we are trying to do within the democratic process the whole fabric of what we are trying to put together and hold together in this country could be in danger.  Deputy Kelly said yesterday in the other House that we could be entering into an era when the whole system we are trying to defend here, the democratic system, could be wiped away and you could have a dictatorship very easily.  If we do not convince the people that we are constructive in what we are trying to do in the economy then I think they might lose faith in what we are doing and maybe take things into their own hands.  That can happen very easily.</P>
    <P>As a small party in Government we were faced during the last four years on many occasions with very hard decisions and they were made, not for political gains because you would not want to be an economist to realise that some of these decisions would have electoral consequences, but with the interests of the country at heart.  They were not made easily or without some rancour and some argument within the parliamentary structure we have, and indeed within the executive structure we have.  However, these decisions we felt had to be made at the time and I suppose it is inevitable that further decisions will have to be made in <Col N="1562" /> the future.  We will only have to wait and see.  The party are big enough to realise that changes are coming and will have to be made.  If we can live with that, fair enough, and if we cannot everybody knows what the consequences will be.</P>
    <P>Tax reform has been frustratingly slow. Many people see no reason why the whole tax system could not be changed overnight.  We realise that it is not as easy as that for two reasons.  Everyone is, in theory in favour of tax reform and greater equity.  Each one of us individually think that this should mean that other people should pay more tax than we do.  This is an understandable attitude and it leads to a lot of debate in public fora, at trade union meetings, labour council meetings or any other meeting.  Everybody talks about tax equity and they understand it to mean that other people should pay more and they should pay less.  I listened to a prominent trade unionist recently saying that the most important thing is not just to be talking about lesser taxes but to spread the tax burden more fairly and evenly throughout the spectrum of the economy, self-employed, farmers, industrialists, PAYE workers, everybody. If everybody paid a fair share of tax the tax load would be automatically lighter on everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that without taxation we will not have money to deal with an Appropriation Bill.  This prompts one to talk about the possibility of spreading the tax load so that when we are dealing with the Appropriation Bill in the future we will try to ensure that everybody has contributed to the fund. <Col N="1563" /> However, I look to the future for a greater tax equity and not necessarily a reduction in taxes as a whole because if everybody paid their fair share more services could be given.</P>
      <P>Comments have been made about the energy crisis and energy prices and the way they have affected our economy.  I share many of the sentiments of Senator Lanigan in this regard.  There have been reductions in energy prices.  Unfortunately this reduction in energy prices does not seem to have percolated down into the economy to the extent I would wish.  It is only beginning to show its effect in the area of ESB charges.  The cost of energy has collapsed and this should have had a major impact on the cost of everything but somehow it does not seem to have had the spin off effects we hoped for.  I know the Tánaiste is continually reviewing this whole area of energy and energy costs and I hope sincerely that the country will benefit from what has happened in the area of oil prices.  I know that when the opposite happened in the seventies when prices escalated, everything was affected immediately.  The price of everything escalated the day after but that did not happen automatically in the case of the reduction in prices.  I hope this new Restrictive Practices Committee that has been initiated by the Government following the abolition of the prices commission will look strictly and severely at this whole area of malpractice which allowed for increased profits and did not pass on to the consumer the benefit of reducing oil prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With those comments, Acting Chairman, may I welcome you into the Chair. I have not seen you in the Chair for a long time.  It is good to see you there but it is more reassuring to have you here closer to me.  I support the Appropriation Bill and it is appropriate that we should pass it into law to make Government spending in the year 1986 legal.  It gives us an opportunity to have a fairly wide ranging debate on many areas.  I could talk about agriculture.  I could deal with many areas for which I have responsibility within the party.  I do not suppose <Col N="1564" /> anybody needs to be reminded of the difficulties in agriculture particularly with the change in the Common Agricultural Policy and what will inevitably happen in the future in that area of over-production. The Government have responded in two critical years for agriculture and appropriately so.  We will have to organise ourselves much more efficiently in agriculture if we are to survive in the Community because the Community will no longer support an intervention system in products which are over supplied.  We must try to improve our technology in agricultural production and improve the quality of breeds and the quality of the food that we produce.</P>
    <P>We have a reputation within the Community of having the cleanest food available in the whole of Europe and that is our way forward, not just being dependent on intervention as being the saviour of the agricultural industry.  Intervention should be at the minimum price available for products which could not be sold otherwise.  We are capable and our farmers are geared and capable of producing a much higher quality product which will sell directly into the European market and outside of it, and they can do that by getting assistance from Europe to improve their breeds and to adopt techniques which would help to improve our produce.  In that way there is a future for Irish agriculture.  There is no future in being dependent on either a quota system or on an intervention system which is obviously going to be under tremendous pressure and makes it very difficult for farmers to plan in the future.  I hope we will plan not to produce more but to produce a better quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill without giving a long monologue about one's political philosophy.  Some weeks ago the Seanad had a certain amount of difficulty in having an immediate debate on the crisis in the public finances and very naturally the Government were not over eager to debate the crisis which occured at a particular time when interest rates rose very sharply.  Eventually the Seanad did <Col N="1565" /> debate the public finances and by that time the crisis was over and interest rates had settled temporarily at a higher level. It would be wrong for us to believe when debating the Appropriation Bill that the crisis is over, because if you live in a permanent state of crisis you dilute the situation and the meaning the word.  We are very close as an economy and in our public spending, in our taxation and in our management of the economy, to being in that permanent state of crisis. We are getting very, very used to it. At some stage, unless dramatic action is taken, that crisis is going to take us over. I do not say it is going to happen this month, or next month, or in a year's time necessarily, but we are moving very close to a doomsday situation in which we will not be able to control ourselves.</P>
      <P>One of the indications of this is that this Government who undoubtedly in terms of the public finances have the best of intentions and who have great integrity in trying to put their intention into effect have failed to meet their own targets and have consistently failed to do so.  They have failed to meet their own spending targets and revenue targets.  If this were to continue the situation would be unsustainable. We have huge political pressures on the unemployment front. Unemployment is a political battering ram which all parties use when they are in Opposition with which to hit each other. Unemployment is a miserable, unhappy state.  But unemployment should be recognised by political parties on all sides as being here to stay.  The unemployment problem, as far as any realistic politician or economist knows, is a permanent and world-wide problem and it is wrong, although it is tempting for whichever party are in Opposition to make promises and wild policies about increasing employment or as happened not all that long ago about actually creating full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply not going to happen, I do not for one moment question the intentions and the honesty of the Labour Party in their championing of the unemployment <Col N="1566" /> problem and in their disillusionment and their disappointment at not be able to improve it.  Those people who are traditionally identified with the cause of the unemployed, in Government, despite their intentions, have been unable to improve that problem.  Now they would say that had they not been there it would have been worse.  I simply do not know whether that is true.  I do not doubt for one moment that that is what they feel.</P>
    <P>We do need some sort of realistic recognition that we are a very small country, that unemployment is a world-wide problem and that it is partially out of our control.  From doing that and from looking at the unemployment problem and acknowledging that it is probably here to stay we should, instead of just tackling the problem of how much dole we give, be looking at what we do in the longer term with this large pool of unemployed.  We should be looking at the problem of whether we are going to create occupations and things for people to do with their leisure time because it is going to be there.  We should ask whether they should be doing public work, whether they should actually be employed by the State for the same money that they are getting on the dole and making a contribution to society.  We do not seem to have thought beyond what sort of benefits we should give them. Everybody would like to give them greater benefits but economically that is not feasible.</P>
    <P>That problem is not realistically acknowledged although there is political temptation in opposition always to say: &ldquo;We want the unemployed's votes so we are going to promise them that we will get them jobs.&rdquo;  It is a very difficult temptation to resist and no doubt any other political party, apart from the present Opposition, would do exactly the same thing.  But it is a false and dishonest promise and they know that because jobs cannot be created just at the drop of a hat.  That is why I think we should recognise it and look at it and not be irresponsible about it.  We should not even make promises which will raise false <Col N="1567" /> hopes.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a couple of things about what Senator Ferris said about privatisation. It is an ideological argument of course.  It is one about which we would obviously disagree.  I think there is a strong argument for privatisation.  I do not see the great benefits of retaining profitable State companies in the hands of the State.  Senator Ferris said the only companies that are mentioned are the ones which are profitable.  That is quite simple.  You would not be able to sell one that was not making any money.  It would be quite impossible.  Of course they are the only ones and I do not see anything wrong with that.  You do not have to sell a State company if you do not get the right price.  Surely the State can at some stage say, &ldquo;All right, we have a State company going.  It is worth X and we might get a premium on it.  Using ordinary commercial criteria then we can sell it to the private sector&rdquo;.  In that sense, the State is only acting under normal, commercial criteria in selling off one of its assets.  I do not think there is anything sacrosanct about the State's assets.  I do not see why the State should just hold on to them for the sake of holding on to them and especially in the situation we are in at the moment where the public finances are in such an appalling state.</P>
    <P>Surely the whole point of having assets in the end is that you can liquidate them when you need them, that you can actually raise money when you need money. At no time have we needed money more than we do at the moment and we do have some State companies which are profitable.  I do not think they would be very attractive but that is a matter of public relations more than anything else. I believe that ideologically it is absurd to say: &ldquo;No, we must hold it for the sake of holding it.&rdquo;  If the State can get a good price I do not see why it should not sell off its assets, especially when it needs that money for all sorts of different purposes.</P>
    <P>Related to that is the issue of the National Development Corporation which this Government set up.  That was an ideological decision undoubtedly.  It <Col N="1568" /> may have great merits.  The National Development Corporation has just branched out into some new projects and I would be happy &mdash; although I am not terribly well disposed towards the National Development Corporation &mdash; to judge it over a long period of time.  I think that would be fair.  I am not well disposed to it for lots of reasons, one of which is that this type of corporation has not worked terribly well in other countries. The real problem with the National Development Corporation is that it is working under different rules from those it is competing with.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation is working under the priority of giving employment, while at the same time working under commercial criteria. Its competitors would be working under purely and simply commercial criteria. When the Minister for Finance introduced this Bill &mdash; I do not know whether it was in the Dáil or the Seanad that he said this &mdash; he said that quite simply one of the reasons for setting it up was that the National Corporation would be using what he called patient money.  I do not think that there is a place for patient money.  What patient money means is that you are not demanding the same response from that money as you would if you were imposing normal commercial criteria on that money.  That money becomes lazy money and becomes money to give employment.  As a result the business is not run properly.</P>
    <P>That is the problem, I think, with the NDC.  Whereas the people involved have the best of intentions, and those who set it up have the best of intentions, in the end you are not exacting the same demands on it, because it is State run and because it is patient and because it is employment orientated rather than commercial orientated, as you are in a normal private situation.  I think there is a great danger of it becoming a rather floundering organisation in time without any enormous thrust behind it.  But let us be reasonable about this.  Let us, having criticised it &mdash; those of us who voted against the idea because we did not like it &mdash; now sit back and see how it works. <Col N="1569" /> I am quite prepared to do that over a period of two or three years, while having principled reservations about it.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas in which the Government could have made progress and have not.  I have not been able to understand why in this dearth of public funds, in this appalling hunger and need we have for funds the black economy has not been more strongly tackled.  It is no secret, without being specific, that the black economy is rampant in this country, that there is an enormous black economy out there.  I do not know what the size is, but it is something which we all come across day in and day out.  There are places where taxation is just being avoided. Taxation being a levy on the transfer of money there are huge openings for the Government to raise money without causing hardship.  I do not know the size of the black economy and I do not know how much could be raised by dealing with that problem.  I do not think anybody knows but I do know it is sizeable.  It is strange that it has not been properly tackled.  The regular easy way out is so often taken by just direct taxation and indirect taxation.  I commend the Government for their declared intention of making capital cuts of £300 million in the forthcoming budget.  That is absolutely essential.  I commend the Government for their efforts in the past because it has been an uneasy Coalition between people of different ideologies.</P>
    <P>It might be appropriate here to say that it is most disappointing and it is untenable and irresponsible for the Opposition to be continually criticising what the Government do, without producing any concrete programmes themselves.  Last night I heard again that extraordinary statement of self-financing coming from a spokesman for the Opposition.  I do not understand what self-financing means. The spokesman was saying on television that they were going to pump so much money into the construction industry which would be self-financing.  I am sorry nobody asked him what it meant because as far as I see it means that you can keep putting money in and it costs you nothing.</P>
    <P>The logical conclusion of that is that <Col N="1570" /> you create full employment overnight because all you do is you put enough money in to give enough people who are unemployed jobs and it is self-financing, so it costs you nothing.  That is a nonsense and they know it is nonsense.  It is highly irresponsible of the Opposition to say this.  It is highly irresponsible of them to make promises about the construction industry which, if they intend to keep, will be an absolute disaster because there is not the need for the construction industry to build all these offices or houses or whatever they intend doing.  I do not understand.  They are not more specific than saying they are just going to pump the money in and then they are going to let it go.  There is just not the demand for that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>There has been on the Government stock market some panic reaction in the past six months to certain things that are happening.  There has been panic reaction in anticipation of devaluation of the Irish pound.  There has been panic reaction on interest rates.  There have been situations where people do not want to hold Government stock at all because they have no confidence in the Government's ability to control the economy. They feel that things are completely out of control.  However, it should be said that one of the reasons people have not waited to hold Government stock is because they see an Opposition in waiting who are less responsible than the Government. That ought to be said because I see it day in and day out.  The one thing they fear more than the present, uneasy Coalition, who have their hands tied behind their backs, preventing them from doing the things which they would like to see done with the public finances, is a Fianna Fáil Party or an Opposition party coming in keeping the promises which they are making.  That would be catastrophic for the public finances.</P>
    <P>People come to different conclusions but the latest figures with regard to promises are between £700 and £1,000 million. If those promises were kept there would be a far greater crisis in the public finances than there is now and I do not know what the consequences would be. <Col N="1571" /> It would be irresponsible of one to paint the wrong type of scenario.  Bad and all as things have been, difficult as they have been, and failing as this Government have in many areas, it would be far worse if the sort of spectre of what we see from the Opposition is anything like the reality.  The signal and the truth of that lies in the fact that people are putting their money where their mouth is.</P>
    <P>The Government might still give an example to the people in terms of financial rectitude and stringency by looking at the image of politicians which is low in the country, by examining why it is low and possibly by doing something about it.  One of the reasons has been the sort of hiccups we have had in the past six or seven years outside the finances of this House, in a different type of area.  Where I think the image of politicians is particularly vulnerable is the whole business of State pensions and pay.  I do not think that politicians are paid too much &mdash; far from it.  The public think politicians are paid too much and the public think that politicians have too many perks.  I think there is a problem with pensions.  I think it would do some good, even if it is a public relations exercise, for the Government not just to change the position regarding State cars but to make tangible moves to reduce the pensions of politicians who are sitting in this House.  We had a motion on this earlier in the year. It is right to say that we are out of line with the rest of Europe on that.  While it would not save a great deal of money, it would give politicians some sort of credibility and more authority in taking particularly unpleasant surgical measures with the economy under which everybody would suffer.</P>
    <P>I have personal disappointments about where money has been spent in the last year.  I congratulate the Government for their efforts on divorce.  They showed an honour of intention if a tactical mistake of which I would certainly have been a culprit as well.  I congratulate the Government on bringing in a Bill on extradition.  That shows a certain amount of courage.  The only trouble is that it has <Col N="1572" /> taken a very long time to come.  It is a pity that the extradition Bill is almost certainly a result of negotiations and outside pressure rather than purely and simply a measure which would be taken on its own merits.  I am personally disappointed that the Government have been unable and are now unlikely to bring in a Bill to abolish hanging.  I find it very difficult to understand why they have not done that.  It is a simple measure but I think a very important measure.  First of all, it would be a solid achievement and, secondly, it is vital that that be taken off the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>Senator McDonald does not believe that there is any situation in which hanging would take place in this country. Therefore, it should be abolished.  It is an absurdity to have a law in operation where every time someone is sentenced to death, we have to go through this absurdity of the matter going to the Cabinet and to the President to have the sentenced commuted.  I do not believe for one moment that this country or the politicians in this country are so civilised that hanging would not be introduced in a time of emergency.  It is unreal and naive for one to say that.  Because it has not been used, it does not mean that it will not be used.  That is why I think it should be taken off the Statute Book, so no one would have the option of ever using it. That option is still there.  I think it is a great pity and it is false and it is wrong to say: &ldquo;Ah well, it is never used.  It will always be commuted&rdquo;.  That is just nonsense.  It is bad law.  It also shows contempt for the law.  The Senator may wink at me as much as he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other things for <Col N="1573" /> which the Government should be commended. One is the Bill dealing with the status of children and another is the Clinical Trials Bill.

I would like to see the economy brought back to an even keel in the next budget.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief in speaking on the Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill, 1986.  It is a record high sum of £6,566 million all of which has to be collected either from the public or borrowed on behalf of the public.  I listened with interest to the speeches made here this morning.  We have developed a great tendency in Ireland at all levels to be very critical and to look at and concentrate on the parts of the administration or the portions of the economy that we find personally distasteful for one reason or another.  I cannot say that I am any different from the majority of people in that respect.  It would be an exercise worth tackling if we were to endeavour to look, in a more positive way, at the achievements of the Government and the progress that has been made in some areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue. Senator Ross, in the course of a very interesting speech, deplored the fact that there has been some slippage in the targets which the Government set for the public finances this year.  The latest available expenditure and taxation returns, as the Minister told us this morning, point to an overrun on the current budget deficit of about £170 million, an increase in the order of £180 million in the Exchequer borrowing.  This year's overruns are significant.  The excess of up to £100 million in non-capital supply services expenditure is, to a great extent, attributable to a combination of circumstances <Col N="1574" /> which could not have been anticipated.  Extra expenditure in agriculture was necessary because of the bad weather conditions and the increased cost of intervention owing to the devaluation of the Irish pound.  Other expenditure factors contributing to the overrun have been the teachers' pay settlement earlier this year which involved the net additional sum of £13 million, the recent Government decision on the social welfare Christmas bonus and the equal treatment provisions which increased expenditure by £20 million.  When on the long overdue legislation on equality treatment between men and women was going through both Houses I do not recall even one voice speaking against that provision.</P>
      <P>In addition the Government had to find moneys this year for Bord Gáis, for B&amp;I and Irish Shipping which were not provided for in the budget.  The increase in the tax burden during the past ten years or so, as a proportion of the gross national product, has risen from 34 per cent in 1975 to 36 per cent now.  The adverse impact of high taxation on the economy is quite clear to everybody.  I welcome the assurance given earlier this year by the Government of their intention to reduce tax.  Everybody accepts that high rates of taxation are a disincentive to hard work.  They do not encourage initiative and certainly they frighten off investment. High taxation trends encourage, to a great extent, the spread of the black economy.  In fairness the Government reduced the higher rate of taxation from 60 per cent to 58 per cent in the last budget.  They also removed the special 1 per cent levy and this benefited every taxpayer in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of following a path of high expenditure paid for by high taxation which is also based on the heavy borrowings of the past, has quite clearly failed.  High taxation has impeded growth.  It also evoked an adverse public reaction and the continuation of that kind of policy can lead only to further and greater difficulties.  If we are to create the growth that is needed to help expand employment and sustain a reasonable level of public services, we must first <Col N="1575" /> create the conditions for that growth.  I suppose the greatest problem facing this country, and indeed the European Community as a whole, is the trend in unemployment.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister state in his Second Stage speech today that the trend in unemployment continued to moderate this year for the third year in a row.  He told us that the figure for this year is likely to be somewhat lower than had been expected at the beginning of the year.  I believe the Government, within the constraints everybody recognises, imposed by the public finances, have made a significant effort to stimulate employment through the house improvement schemes, through the greatly enhanced new house grant scheme and other measures particularly in the area of special employment schemes.  The Government have introduced five or six schemes such as Teamwork and the work experience programme which were of an experimental nature all of which have contributed very significantly and favourably. Thousands of people got a new break and moved into the private sector with the aid of the grants that went with some of those schemes.</P>
    <P>Very often a voluntary committee succeed with the aid of SES or Teamwork in creating temporary employment and in improving the environment to a great degree.  After the six or the 12 months for which they signed up ends, they create an almighty fuss.  Some people seem to think that if you get on a temporary employment scheme, or a work experience programme, it is like getting an old age pension and you have it until you snuff it.  That is purely political propaganda and it is unbecoming of the excellent voluntary organisations who devote their effort and time to improving their own environment and living standards in their localities.  It is a pity people have become so dependent on the State and that excellent schemes are decried by virtue of the duration of the schemes. Nobody seems to connect the cost of these schemes either with taxation in general or with public expenditure.  This <Col N="1576" /> Appropriation Bill calls for expenditure of £6,566 million, of which roughly £106 million has been spent by the Office of Public Works, £263 million for the Garda Síochána, £70 million for the prisons, which I will come back to later, £1,800 million for education, £261 million for agriculture, £36 million on forestry, £171 million on labour, which accounts for some of those social employment schemes, £245 million for Industry and Commerce which goes towards the IDA and the job opportunity policies, £117 million on communications, £260 million on defence, £1,552 million on social welfare on £1,200 million on health.  If you take the three largest spending Departments, Education at £1,800 million, Social Welfare on £1,552 million and Health on £1,200 million, that is a total of £4,552 million.  That only leaves £2,000 million out of the £6,566 million in the Appropriation Bill for the other 48 Departments of State.  That is where the entire public miss the idea as people are just concerned with their own particular household budget.</P>
    <P>People too readily forget that every penny collected by the State through budgetary arrangements and through taxation goes on the public services which are very comprehensive.  During the past year each time we have heard public officials, whether working for a local authority, health board or indeed any other State agency, hiding behind or proffering the excuse, that owing to Government cutbacks it is not possible either to give a service or to carry out some programme.  I would accuse such officials either of making a political statement or declaring their own impotence as far as their administrative capabilities are concerned. That is something we must tackle.</P>
    <P>We must be able to live within our means.  According to OECD figures, we are the 25th wealthiest country in the world.  We know that we are not the 25th biggest, but expressed as a percentage of the GNP, our expenditure on health, on education and on social welfare is higher than any of the 24 countries who the <Col N="1577" /> OECD say are wealthier than this country. The public are entitled at least to give the Government and previous Governments some credit for the fact that the policies here reflect our Christian traditions and values.  I would not say that we spend too much money on social welfare, but we should be aware of the cost of the excellent services we provide. I attend health board meetings in my own area.  This week there was a proposal that the fuel scheme should be doubled.  It makes a nice heading on the local newspaper. That very fact tends to upset people and raise their expectations.</P>
    <P>While we still face the real and worrying problems in the economy, the high level of unemployment and the serious state of the public finances must remain a major source of concern.  It is good to see that progress has been made in some areas and prospects for the coming year, as the Minister told us earlier this morning, are better than for some years past. The Government's declared intention is to keep the 1987 Exchequer borrowing requirement within this year's original targeted level.  I am confident that if this course is followed, it will help to lower interest rates and this in turn will boost confidence in the economy and stimulate investment.  This is the only way to achieve durable growth in output and to help create employment.  Provided there is some sort of realistic response to the measures proposed by the Government, next year should be a year of favourable economic progress.  One would hope that this country will not have to provide for, and contend with, the same unfortunate weather which caused such havoc and reduced agricultural incomes to such an extent and also the external factors which tended to keep thousands of American tourists from coming here.</P>
    <P>Having regard to difficulties, I feel obliged to compliment the Government on the continuing drop in the rate of inflation.  Nobody is interested in inflation any more for the simple reason that, as a result of Government policies and perhaps to some extent to the international situation, inflation is not a problem here any more.  The Minister told us the rate <Col N="1578" /> of inflation this year would be 4 per cent compared with 23 per cent when the Government took office.  That is something of which we must be conscious. Similarly, the balance of payments figures and the balance of trade are in an excellent state again as a result of the Government policies.  If we are being critical of the Government, the one thing that we as politicians cannot criticise them for is the fact that, without regard to the popularity of their decisions, at least they tackled the problems in what they perceived to be the correct way. That is a difficult thing to do in a democracy such as ours.  The Government are entitled to take credit for that; whether they get it is another matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly one or two headings in the Appropriation Bill for the coming year.  In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General I see that to date we have spent some £225 million on the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  When you look at the benefits of that to the agricultural community you find that the compensation for reactors, which is still absolutely inadequate, was only £7.4 million.  Fees to veterinary surgeons were £10.4 million and the cost of the Department's people either in providing the vaccines or the administration of the scheme was £4.4 million.  Similarly, too, the brucellosis eradication scheme which has been much more successful than the tuberculosis one has cost £106 million to date.  In 1985 the compensation for reactors was £2 million, the fees for the veterinary surgeons was £1.5 million and the cost to the Department in personnel and vaccines was £1.5 million.  We should go into that scheme in more detail at an early opportunity because there has been less money provided for the hardship clauses in the year gone by.  When you mix a breakdown in cattle disease with the adverse weather and the sharp reduction in agricultural incomes, at a time when the profit margins have been still further squeezed, I believe a fresh look should be taken at the amount of compensation.</P>
    <P>I want very briefly to mention the Vote for prisons.  A sum of £13.5 million is <Col N="1579" /> provided for buildings and equipment. The standards in the prison service and the progress is reasonable to a great extent.  The only area where I would ask for greater expenditure is in the education service, in educational equipment, educational aids and materials.  That figure for the year in question is only £165 million.  I would like to see a programme for prisoners, especially for first offenders.  I accept that we must have education in the three `Rs' and a high percentage of the prisoners are illiterate. The Government and the Department of Justice should seriously consider introducing a system of lectures to prisoners &mdash; a soft indoctrination programme &mdash; to put the message across as to why they should conform as ordinary citizens of this State, and the benefits of accepting the rule of law as everybody else does.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the very considerable amount the Government are spending on education and the high percentage of the total taxation which goes on education.  I also mentioned the cost of the health services.  I am very glad to have this opportunity of saying to the Government that it is appropriate, when we come to sum up the Appropriations Bill at the close of each year, that they have made significant improvements in many areas. They have succeeded, throughout a difficult period, in improving the public services that are so widely availed of.  In the entire Republic 49 per cent of the people are registered on the general medical services register, which means they have medical cards.  If you look at the means test it is hard to accept that every second person one sees has an income of less than about £90 per week.  The State provision is very generous.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I compliment the Government, especially our Minister for Foreign Affairs for his sustained efforts and his excellent progress on the Anglo-Irish Agreement and Anglo-Irish cooperation. The improvement is significant and in the coming years it will be reflected, not just in the country as a whole, but in the Appropriation Bill because we can expect a reduction in the <Col N="1580" /> demand for policing on the Border.  I compliment also the Minister of State who plays such a significant role in increasing the amount of money the Government have provided &mdash; that is £23 million or £24 million on international co-operation and aid to the Third World. That is a very significant amount of money for a small State such as ours to provide in hard cash.  We are well on the way to meeting the target laid down by the United Nations.  The fact that that figure has been enhanced throughout a difficult financial period for the Government reflects the input and the dedication of Deputy O'Keeffe when he was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs for the past three or four years.  I compliment him on that and, coming up to Christmas, it is good to know that while the Irish people have always demonstrated their generosity and Christianity in a very practical way the State, on our behalf, does it in a magnificent way in supporting the international Third World organisations to such a generous extent.  I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, the compliments of the season and every success next year.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to be political in this debate but I am provoked to some degree by Senator Lanigan.  He damned with faint praise those inherited problems which were resolved by the present administration. He derided the progress made in improving the situation in others.  He ranged wide over the various issues.  His speech was long on problems and difficulties but very short on solutions.  It has to be said that the Opposition are inconsistent and contradictory in their statements on those rare occasions when they are permitted to venture an opinion on future policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have a degree of consistency in only one area.  They want to spend more. Have they learned anything at all from 1977?  Do they want to repeat, to an even greater degree, the disastrous consequences of the policies outlined in that infamous manifesto?  I am not against spending <i>per se</i> but quite clearly, where <Col N="1581" /> further borrowing is the resort for payment then major critical questions arise. Do Fianna Fáil really believe that the answer to our problem is to borrow an additional sum of almost £1,000 million to fund the promises they have already made in recent times?  Talk of self-financing is rubbish.  That party once christened themselves, &ldquo;the party of reality&rdquo;. At least one could expect in this debate that we would deal with facts and not fiction from a party who christened themselves with that name.  It is very clear that the solutions today proposed by the Opposition, to all the problems, involve borrowing.</P>
    <P>The solutions proposed by the Leader of the Opposition involved borrowing on all fronts.  I notice that even in issuing the recent book of speeches he had to borrow the title &ldquo;Spirit of the Nation&rdquo;.  He reached back a long way to find this particular title.  He reached back to the year 1843 when an important book of writings from <i>The Nation</i> newspaper was published by James Duffy.</P>

      <P>It is our duty to point out to the people the possible disasters and unfortunate consequences that could ensue, in the confident knowledge that common sense will prevail when it comes to the appropriate time, as I have no doubt it will.  Senator Lanigan also referred to the sluggish performance of the economy.  There was a strong impetus to growth projected this year largely from the dramatic fall in fuel oil prices which amounted to over 50 per cent in Irish pound terms on average in 1986. However, the effects of this price fall have taken much longer to filter through than expected.  This has been the case internationally and accounted for the slackness in international trade growth in the early part of the year.  Combined with the more sluggish than expected external environment the domestic economy was affected by the exceptionally poor summer weather for a second successive year which had, as everybody knows, an adverse effect on agriculture and tourism in particular.  Despite these setbacks GNP will show further growth in 1986 and the main impetus will come from domestic demand; real disposable incomes have increased significantly giving a boost to personal consumption. Recently published retail sales figures showed improved buoyancy consumer spending compared with the beginning of the year.  This is a point that was raised by Senator Lanigan.  The figures are there to show that this has occured.  I am confident that that trend will be further evidenced in the figures to be published in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in opening this debate, progress has been made in many areas.  I refer to the question of inflation.  Figures again speak for themselves; we are down from a figure of over 20 per cent to less than 4 per cent this year.  We have not <Col N="1583" /> had a figure like that for over 20 years. Again, on the trade side, we achieved a trade surplus last year for the first time since the war.  That surplus will, I have no doubt, increase substantially this year. In the first ten months the surplus was over £540 million which is more than double the surplus in the corresponding period of 1985.  This improved trade balance is contributing to a stronger current account.  The House should note these very important and significant improvements that have taken place.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Lanigan and Senator Ferris referred to the question of unemployment. I agree that the employment situation remains disappointing. However, it is important when discussing this issue to relate it to the facts and the facts are that the trend has continued to moderate in 1986 for the third year in succession.  The facts also showed that in the last year of the previous administration there was an enormous increase in unemployment.  A discussion on this issue has to relate to the facts.  Much as I would like to see an immediate and dramatic improvement in the situation, the reality has to be faced.  Our approach to the problem is geared towards achieving a sustained reduction in unemployment. We have within the constraints imposed by the public finances made considerable efforts to stimulate employment through the house improvement scheme and the other schemes.  These all had their effect in achieving the results we have achieved.  I spoke earlier about the outlook for 1987 and I believe that the outlook is promising.  Many of the factors which inhibited growth in the economy in 1986 are unlikely to recur. We had two bad summer seasons from the point of view of weather and while I cannot make any confident predictions in that regard, on the law of averages there is a reasonable chance that things will improve next summer.  Let us not underestimate the importance of that to our farmers and to tourism.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, assuming that crude oil prices remain at approximately their present level and that there is general <Col N="1584" /> stability in international exchange rates external demand should expand strongly and this will benefit Irish exports.  Let it be said that the extent to which we gain from this expansion will be determined by our competitiveness.  The Government have clearly stated that pay moderation is essential if we are to remain competitive and provide more jobs.  The opportunites exist given the prospects of continued low inflation rates for low pay settlements, which will still afford improvements in living standards.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also commented in relation to exchange rate policy and interest rates.  I do not think there can be any doubt on any side of this House that exchange rate stability is needed to create a suitable environment for trade investment. Everybody will agree to that. However, the volatility of currencies outside the EMS exchange rate mechanism, particularly sterling and the US dollar, complicate the task of exchange rate policy.  Large movement in these currencies can result in excessive changes in the overall trade-rated value of the Irish pound and if these movements take place over a very short period the adverse effects can be immediate while the benefits can take some time to appear.</P>
    <P>It was in the context of such a change that the initiative was taken quite exceptionally and for the first time in seven years of the EMS to seek a realignment of the pound in early August.  That realignment does not mean we have any target rate for the Irish pound against sterling or against the US dollar.  Our exchange rate policy is directed towards fulfilling the obligations of EMS membership and securing stability in the overall value of the Irish pound.  It was designed to achieve stability in trading relations &mdash; a large and increasing share of our trade is with EMS member countries. Exports to our EC partners other than the UK now exceed those going to the UK.  That has been a dramatic change in recent years.  The August re-alignment has improved the competitive position of Irish industry particularly in relation to continental European countries.  This should provide new opportunities for <Col N="1585" /> Irish business to concentrate even more on these markets.</P>
    <P>The Government are now determined to maintain the current EMS parities of the Irish pound and have made it clear that there will be no downward adjustment of the Irish pound.  This assurance should show speculators that they cannot hope to make gains from an adjustment of the Irish currency.  There are already signs of a start to the reversal of the outflow from funds which took place over the past year.</P>
    <P>The other aspect under the terms of this heading that is of relevance is the question of interest rates.  The underlying level of domestic interest rates is far too high and this has to be clearly understood. It is too high due mainly to high Government borrowing requirements. Let there be no doubt about that.  That has to be repeated over and over again in the context of a situation where policies are introduced and promises made which have at the end of the day a price tag which involves further borrowing.  Let there be no doubt that any increased borrowing inevitably has a direct consequence of increasing interest rates.  That message has to be clearly understood by everybody.</P>
    <P>The most recent increase in interest rates in Ireland and the difficult conditions that prevailed in the domestic money and securities market earlier this year can be traced fairly directly to the problem of exchange rate volatility internationally. That size of our international trade is such that there is considerable scope for adverse leading and lagging of trade payments in the light of the exchange rate movement with resultant upward pressure on interest rates.  This is an aspect we discussed on the Bill we had earlier today and something which it is unnecessary to go into detail about at this stage.  The conditions in the domestic market have improved greatly since the middle of October.  As speculative positions are further unwound, there should be a considerable increase in bank liquidity. This will allow the more favourable underlying interest rates climate to reemerge <Col N="1586" /> in 1987.  Already inter-bank interest rates have eased significantly and gilt yields have fallen from 14 per cent to about 12.75 per cent at present.  For the sake of growth and employment in the economy we must all redouble our efforts to get interest rates down to more reasonable levels.  That includes making it clear to the markets that there will not be huge extra additional demands for borrowings in the years ahead.  If there is one message that has to be repeated time and time again that is the one.</P>
    <P>The Government accept that there is an onus on them to help create the right conditions for lower interest rates.  We have indicated that we will discharge this responsibility.  Any failure on our part to continue the efforts to cut back on borrowing would have to be paid for in higher domestic interest rates and higher Exchequer debt servicing costs.  I would be very interested to learn the position of others who might suggest they have an interest in being involved in the administration of this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan and Senator Ferris spoke on the need for more investment. The Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute forecast a rise in investment next year.  This expectation is confirmed by other independent forecasting institutions.  It is clear that the adjustment policies pursued by the Government have contributed to this recovery.  These involve cost efficiency measures including pay moderations as well as fiscal and public expenditure measures aimed at stimulating investment leading to sustained employment. That aspect of pay moderation is very important.  It is relevant to note the facts and the figures.  The fact that over a period of four years the total pay increases combined were at a level less than the increases in the public sector allowed in one year, the year 1980.  That is something that has to be borne in mind by anybody taking a serious interest in how this economy should be developed in the years ahead.  In addition the Government's industrial strategy as set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy and the initiatives already taken <Col N="1587" /> are contributing to the recovery to which I have referred.  The Government have devoted considerable resources to the promotion of efficiency and innovation in the economy.  Industrial and tourism policies have been reorientated.  Measures have been introduced such as the enterprise allowance scheme to bring unemployed people back to work, venture capital is being provided through tax incentives and the newly established National Development Corporation. Education and training are vital to employment and there have been significant increases in the resources allocated to these areas in recent years.</P>
    <P>Within the public capital programme expenditure has been reallocated to concentrate on investment which leads to sustained, additional employment.  The success of the business expansion scheme has been dramatic.  In less than two years since its inception this scheme has produced investments of £9.3 million in 84 different companies.  I am confident that it will produce a figure of at least £15 million in the coming year.</P>
    <P>While it is important to concentrate in this economic debate on the facts and statistics, these figures are not simply statistics.  They reflect flesh and blood, realities.  They reflect real productive projects and real jobs.  Among the more notable features of the scheme's operation are the variety of projects involved ranging from mariculture to film making, from engineering to the production of orthopaedic appliances.  On the range of projects, in terms of size, investments have averaged £110,000 but have ranged from as low as £1,000 to as high as £1 million.  The scheme which aims at providing necessary investment and which is far more flexible even when conventional funding is involved, looks set to provide worthwhile levels of extra secure sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>Progress in the profit sharing area has also been encouraging where 19 schemes have been approved to date.  These cover over 17,000 employees which is equivalent to every single person in a substantial Irish town having the opportunity <Col N="1588" /> to own part of his or her own company. A further 11 schemes are at various stages of processing.  While improved tax treatment of share options was introduced only this year the results of these changes are already apparent.  Nine share option schemes have been approved to date. These involve over 700 employees.  No fewer than 24 schemes are currently under consideration.  Although the scheme of tax relief for investment, research and development does not come into force until the New Year, inquiries are already being received about the scheme.  A strong R and D capability is essential to development of a sound industrial base.  The response is therefore most heartening.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke about the disincentive effect of high rates of taxation. I take this point on board quite unequivocally.  The adverse impact of high taxation on the economy is self-evident. I dealt with this in my opening remarks and referred to the effects from the point of view of disincentive to work, the spread of the black economy, and the distortion of trade.  In tackling this problem there is no room for pious hopes or airy-fairy promises.  We have to be realistic.  It would be unrealistic to expect that substantial tax deductions are possible in the short term.  That needs to be said.  Otherwise we are codding the people.  If we were to achieve that, how would it be achieved?  It could only be achieved through further borrowing and we have already had our discussions on that point.  I hope we convinced those who might be tempted along that route that that is the road to disaster for this country.</P>
    <P>If we eliminate that option as being a reasonable one bearing in mind that, in any event, borrowing is no more than deferred taxation, do we simply say that it cannot be done?  I do not believe that is the answer either.  If we look at the record of borrowing to reduce tax, today we are paying the tax that was deferred last year, the year before, ten years ago. That is very simple.  The consequence of that is, of course, that the higher taxes we pay today are not available to support <Col N="1589" /> spending programmes and instead an increasing burden of interest on past debt is pre-empting much of our revenue.  It is relevant to note that our PAYE receipts are now only just about sufficient to meet overall debt service costs.</P>
    <P>There is hope for the future.  In the longer term, with substantial growth in the economy with more people at work and with a healthier budget position there will, of course, be room to bring taxation down to more accaptable levels.  At first this presupposes that we curtail public spending and that we maintain it at a level our economy can reasonably support. Only through the reduction of the overhang of debt and the future tax levels it implies will economic activity be stimulated. In the shorter term the emphasis in tax policy must instead be on spreading the existing burden in a more equitable, economical and efficient way.  We must build on the significant improvements which have been made in recent years. They provide the springboard for future tax reform.</P>
    <P>To be effective, reform has to be based on the following elements: a greater emphasis on effective and efficient tax collection procedures; the improvement of incentive to work and risk taking; a further easing of the burden on the PAYE sector; and a significant simplification of our overly complex tax structure. If we are to create the growth needed to expand employment and to sustain a reasonable level of public services, we must first create conditions for that growth.  There are those who assert that tackling the problems in the public finances and cutting unemployment cannot be done simultaneously.  Cutting the budget deficit, they argue, is tantamount to adding to the dole queues.  I reject this argument.  First, we no longer have the luxury of choice in the matter of effecting a remedy in the public finances. The situation is not static, it will deteriorate rapidly, even explosively, unless it is tackled soon.  That is very clear.  Secondly, other countries have faced problems like ours and have dealt successfully with them without raising unemployment. <Col N="1590" /> The converse is true.  In recent years several countries have achieved simultaneous success in reducing budget deficits and unemployment and, indeed, this pattern is quickly becoming the norm in the European Community.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, for example, the general Government position has improved from a deficit of 9.3 per cent of GDP in 1982 to a surplus of 2.8 per cent this year according to Commission estimates. Unemployment has declined to 7.7 per cent from a peak of 10.1 per cent in 1983. In Germany, the federal deficit has been scaled down successively to just under 1 per cent this year while unemployment has also declined to 8.1 per cent and employment is currently growing at an annual rate of 1 per cent.  Reducing the budget deficit is a primary requirement to build confidence.</P>
    <P>There is much justifiable discussion about the need to restore confidence in the future.  Without confidence people will not be prepared to invest.  Some people seem to assume that confidence can be created by speeches and an attempt to change the mood.  Confidence in the durable sense can only be created by decisions.  Confidence will be restored once people see that problems causing concern are on their way to being solved. The biggest damper on confidence and investment in this country at present is the level of Government borrowing. Government borrowing is a promise of future taxation.  If people know the Government are not paying their way and asking future taxpayers to pay through borrowing they will not want to invest. The worst disincentive to investment is the sword of &ldquo;Damocles&rdquo; of future extra taxation caused by the need to service borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced at short notice because it is felt necessary to clarify the position in relation to the definition of income in computing tax liability.  In recent days a succession of claims has been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that health contributions, the youth employment levy and the income levy are deductible in computing income for the purposes of determining tax liability.  This is not the case and never has been the case and, to put the issue beyond any doubt, it is considered desirable to introduce legislation at this point.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in perspective, if the claims being made were allowed in respect of all taxpayers, the potential revenue loss to the Exchequer could be of the order of £360 million.  This, of course, is out of the question.  As I mentioned earlier, a large number of claims were submitted in recent days.  Given this volume of activity and the general uncertainty that has arisen, it was considered appropriate on this occasion to remove any doubts about the legal position at this point.  I do not know why the matter should have gathered such momentum in such a short period.  There were rumours apparently that legislation was being prepared. There was presumably a widespread and mistaken belief that somehow claims made in advance of legislation might be allowable.  There is no basis whatever for this.  Much of the activity that has been engaged in was fruitless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technical background to the Bill is as follows.  Section 110 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides that duties or other sums payable or chargeable by virtue of any statute on income which is assessed to tax under Schedule E shall be deductible for income tax purposes.  The effect of this was to allow up to 1973 the deduction for income tax purposes of contributions made under certain statutory pension schemes.  The law relating to pension schemes was comprehensively revised in the Finance Act, 1972, and by virtue of section 17 of that Act the contributions under all statutory schemes <Col N="1593" /> are deductible for income for tax purposes. There is no need to place any further continued reliance on the words in the 1967 Act which this Bill will remove.  Pensions are already protected by the provisions of section 17 of the 1972 Act.  The present legislation, therefore, does not in any way affect the deductibility of pension contributions for tax purposes.  I want to emphasise this.</P>
    <P>The Income Tax Act, 1967, provision became redundant following the introduction of the 1972 legislation.  The claims to which I have referred attempt to use this redundant 1976 provision to support a case for allowing against income tax, the health contributions and other levies introduced subsequently such as the youth employment levy and the income tax levy.  This was, of course, never the intention of the framework of the 1967 Act.  What this Bill is simply doing is confirming this by removing the relevant and redundant provision of the Income Tax Act, 1967, lest there be any confusion or unduly favoured activity in this area.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the health contribution and the levies, the clear and unequivocal understanding has been that these charges fall directly on income. They have been so applied in all instances and taxation policy has been framed on this basis.  I am satisfied that all sides of the House are in entire agreement about this and share my view that, in the event of doubt about such a critical issue, it is totally appropriate to confirm the position in legislation.  This legislation will remove any doubt or confusion that has arisen.</P>
    <P>I should mention, of course, that the income levy has been terminated with effect from 5 April 1986.  The claims being submitted, however, attempt to open the issue of deductibility for income tax purposes for a number of years past. Potentially several hundred thousand taxpayers are involved.  The health contribution and the levies have made a big contribution to the State revenues since their introduction.  The health contribution was introduced under the Health Contributions Act, 1979, the <Col N="1594" /> youth employment levy is yielding revenue since 1982 and the income levy has operated in the period 1983 to April 1986. Over these periods the total revenue yield from these sources was up to £950 million.  Were deductibility to be allowed, it is clear that the revenue loss would be of such an order as to require fundamental changes in taxation policy.  At the end of the day the average taxpayer would be no better off and in the meantime considerable confusion would have been generated.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would like to advert to before concluding my introductory statement.  Senators will perhaps ask: is it fair that we should have a levy on gross income when the average taxpayer, certainly the PAYE taxpeyer, never actually receives the gross income, he just receives the net income and yet he is levied on the gross figure?  It is open to argument that we should not and we would have a simpler tax system if we did not have that.  If you had a provision in law for the future which allowed deductibility of levies &mdash; and it would be simplier still if you did not have levies &mdash; if you raised the same amount of money, you would have to have the levies at a higher rate.  If you had no levies to raise the same amount of money you would have to have income tax at a much higher rate than it is at present.  The same differences are there, it is six of one and half dozen of another.  If I were talking about an ideal world I would have to say I would prefer a system in which there were no levies and such money as you would have to raise was raised by one single simple tax on income, but we have to take the situation as we find it and deal with it as we find it.  These levies have been introduced since 1979 on the basis that they were on gross income.  Everybody paying them at the time understood that they were levies on gross income.  They may not have liked having to pay and they may have objected to it, but they understood that legal position.  All this is doing is clarifying and underlining what was the common understanding of the legal position.</P>
    <P>That, of course, brings up another <Col N="1595" /> point which Senators might want to raise in the debate &mdash; the idea that by doing this at this stage, even though people did not think they had this claim and by making it quite clear that they did not at this stage, we were somehow or other introducing retrospective legislation in a sense that could be objected to as being parliamentary practice.  I have set Senators minds at rest on that point. There is no question of this being open to such an objection and I will explain why.  The criticism of restrospective legislation in this area is grounded on the principle that tax legislation should not be introduced which would do either of two things &mdash; impose a tax charge on a taxpayer for a previous year, being a charge of which the taxpayer was unaware at that time or secondly, deny a taxpayer relief for an earlier year, being a relief to which the taxpayer thought he had full entitlement at that time.  As has been clearly established, nobody thought that any such deductibility existed at that time so we are not taking from anybody anything they thought they were entitled to, at the time when they were ordering their tax affairs.  That being the case, there can be no objection on grounds of retrospectiveness so far as this legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another point that might be raised is with regard to the general question &mdash; and it is not directly relevant to this Bill &mdash; of avoidance of taxation and evasion of taxation.  I would like to underline here in the Seanad as I have done in the other House my view and the view of the Government in regard to tax evasion.  We regard it as unacceptable that there is still a substantial amount of tax evasion and considerable amounts of arrears of tax owing and collectible but not being collected. I announced last week a series of measures that are being considered to deal with this problem and I also set out a number of measures that are already in effect which over time will serve to catch up on tax evasion.  For example, there is now a penalty representing a percentage of the ultimately determined tax liability <Col N="1596" /> which can be levied on taxpayers who are late putting in their return.</P>
    <P>One of the big reasons for the buildup of arrears of tax is that people do not put in returns.  In order to get the returns from them, the Revenue issue inflated assessments designed to frighten them into tax compliance.  These assessments are then used by people who want to make a case if the tax system is not working as a basis for saying that this money is actually due which, as we all know, is not due at all except a very small proportion when the accounts are actually put in.  The use of large estimated assessments as a means of getting people to make returns is not a good principle.</P>
    <P>My anxiety is to move our tax system over to a system of self-assessment where people are obliged to make their own returns at their own peril if they do not, and that there is not the same need for the Revenue to come along and issue estimated assessments which give a completely misleading picture of the amount of tax actually outstanding.  That would serve two purposes.</P>
    <P>First, by replacing the obligation on the taxpayer to put in the return, it would relieve many Revenue staff from the routine drudgery, of going through everybody's return and pursuing every individual taxpayer which diverts skilled people away from concentrating on the real areas of abuse.  Secondly, it would get away from the problem of those estimated assessments which give this totally misleading picture of the amount of taxes outstanding and cause great envy and misunderstanding between, in particular, the self-employed section of the community and the rest of the community where there is a belief that there is much more tax outstanding than there really is.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there is no abuse among self-employed people, but it is entirely wrong to categorise an entire group of people as being participants in tax abuse.  What we need to do to protect the legitimate tax-paying self-employed trader from unfair competition from those who are not paying their tax and also to protect the PAYE sector from unfair treatment <i>vis-á-vis</i> others who are <Col N="1597" /> avoiding their tax, is to stamp out tax evasion in the interests of fair play for everybody wherever it arises.  That is the objective of the Government.</P>
    <P>Clearly we could not allow any doubt as to the position in regard to these income levies to which I am now referring because it is in respect of money that has already been collected and spent.  The money has been spent in the areas of the health services and youth employment service and, in the case of the income levy, generally on all sorts of services provided by the State.  The money has been spent and if suddenly that money had to be paid back we would find ourselves in an impossible situation so far as the finances of the country are concerned. That is why all sides in the other House were prepared to agree this legislation in order that the revenue of the State and the services which everybody enjoys and needs in our community and which depend on the revenue of the State could be protected.  That is the very reasonable purpose of this legislation.  I hope this explanation will commend itself and the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister that we on this side of the House will support this Bill.  In recent times we have had decisions taken in court where legislation has been challenged.  It is a warning to both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that legislation which goes through the Houses is watertight.  We cannot afford to let legislation go through on a fire brigade <i>ad hoc</i> type basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bills have gone through this House on which there were 50 and 60 amendments but the legislation was put through and teased out properly.  It goes to show again the importance of the Seanad where time is spent but never wasted in teasing out these Bills.  Yet, there are politicians, Members of one House or the other at present, stating that if they return to power they would abolish the Seanad. When we see the necessity for a Bill like this being introduced where there is so much money involved, it begs one to wonder why these people are talking the <Col N="1598" /> way they are.  When I first read about the matter in the papers and the effect it could have on the country, I asked myself who is running the country?  Is it the courts, or is it the Government?  We should ensure that legislation is properly drafted and effective enough to stand on its own feet.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the taxation system in general.  I have spoken on this on numerous occasions.  We have an archaic type of tax system.  It is a very demanding type of system and people are afraid of letters they receive from the Revenue Commissioners.  The demands are unfair.  People have thrown these letters in the fire and then they are in real trouble.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the commercial sector who are carrying the can for taxes in this country.  I am one of the people in business who would be affected by the youth employment and other levies.  The commercial sector in addition to having to pay income tax are responsible for PAYE, PRSI, commercial rates, water rates, refuse charges and insurance.  In addition they are under pressure from the banks.  The commercial sector is overlevied and overburdened.  They have to operate on the basis of leaving over some payments in any month in order to pay others.  In business, new standards are demanded by local authorities, by fire officers and the health boards and these must be met so we have a very heavily burdened commercial sector.  Despite this they have met their commitments and met them well.  Some day somebody will challenge the constitutionality of the commercial sector on the matter of paying rates.  In my own county, there are 1,000 people paying commercial rates and they are carrying the can for the whole county.  As well as paying the commercial rates, they have other levies and demands to meet.</P>
    <P>I support this measure.  It is a warning to both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that legislation does not go through on an <i>ad hoc</i> fire brigade type of basis.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that. It is the best news I have heard today.  I will be looking forward to that.</P>
      <P>I share the sentiments of Senator Lynch when he talks about this as a warning to all of us.  At times, we complain in this House when we have legislation almost foisted on us &mdash; not this Bill because we realise the reason for it.  It is appropriate that legislation would be properly teased out.  Our record will show that legislation which was initiated here has stood the test of the other House and indeed any constitutional change that has emanated afterwards.  Obviously, the removal of this section should have taken place in the Income Tax Act, 1972 having been left in in the Income Tax Act, 1967 which was there for the specific purpose of dealing with other deductions, superannuation, pension funds and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 12 months ago I had a feeling that there was a problem in this area.  The problem arose with the response of the farming organisations to health levies and youth employment levies.  They have argued for a long time on the issue of what type of income they should pay these levies on.  When I was chairman of a health board and a local health committee, I brought in the IFA and the ICMSA representatives to discuss the £1.5 million they owed to the South Eastern Health Board at the time on the basis that we were having difficulties trying to keep the health services going and to ask what was the legitimate reason for the non-payment of these levies.  They argued that the levy was being placed on gross income after deduction of certain allowable expenses.  I kept on reminding them that PAYE workers pay these levies <Col N="1600" /> on their gross incomes, not on the income left after the payment of tax.  As a result of the dialogue, out of the £1.5 million that was due, we collected about £600,000.  We then got a commitment from the Minister for Health that any further moneys due on the health levies section could be retained in each health board area to maintain the level of health services.  That stimulated a further responsibility by people in that section. They were the first to realise that these levies were in some way incorrectly stated in the Act.  It was difficult to explain to them that they were levies on income and not levies on income after tax.  The argument being made in court, I understand, is that people are looking for the payment of these levies to be refunded to them on the basis that they could charge these expenses against expenses towards income tax.  It is obvious that the legislation needed to be tightened up.  It is obvious that the money has been taken and spent and that, despite his promise to be generous to us in the new year he does not have this kind of money to give back.  As a result of that we are faced with the dilemma of having to pass this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very sad that the Minister has come to this decision at this stage, and that it took a massive number of claims to bring in such legislation at this moment.  I would have throught that when this legislation was being passed in the first place, the levies would have been on net incomes.  What has happened shows, in effect, the great burden of responsibility on the PAYE earner because any move has a massive effect on the Exchequer.  We are talking about something like £360 million.  This debate will be moved elsewhere but it shows the amount of money that is collected from PAYE earners and the massive burden <Col N="1601" /> of taxation that is on them.  The money has been spent.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris referred to the self-employed. The amount of money that is collected in these levies from the self-employed, is very small.  I do not think it is anything like the proportions Senator Ferris mentioned.  I have never got a reminder about a health levy and I am self-employed.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about tax collection and the amount of tax owing.  We all agree that there are massive amounts of taxes owing but the method of collection under which I as a practising accountant operate and the method under which the Department operate are two different things.  There is no human face in the Minister's Department.  They lay down the law and that is the way it is to be.  Many companies have been forced into liquidation because of the hard nosed measure the Minister's Department operate under.  You go to the Revenue Commissioners if, for instance, because of pressure of business, you owe them some money.  You try to make an agreement or deal with them and instead of trying to be reasonable, they are absolutely merciless.  They have forced many companies out of business.  That is some of the contribution the Minister's Department have made to the unemployment.  I know of small companies who have been forced into liquidation because of such stupidity.  A schoolboy of eight years of age would know that money cannot be got from someone who has none.  Instead of agreeing on the payment of a lesser amount so that one might continue to operate and keep people in employment, the commissioners adopt a hard nose, crazy situation.  In this way they put the company out of business and never collect any money from it.  He also talks about the assessments.</P>

      <P>The Revenue very often finds itself in competition with the banks in regard to the collection of money.  In the case of the Revenue, it is collecting money that belongs to the people.  The Revenue should not allow <Col N="1602" /> itself to be in the position that the banks get paid but the tax does not get paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not.  The reality of the situation is that they do not.  Probably the ideal situation would be that they do, but they do not.  Any dealings I have had with them have ended up very badly. I know four people who are on assistance which means that they are destitute and I have bills for them on assessment for about £200,000.  There is no way the Revenue will write it off.  They have put these people on appeal and they expect them to come to appeals.  You tell them that they cannot afford to go to the appeals because they are actually destitute and you ask the Revenue to please write the bill off but they will not.  Once the bill gets into the system it just cannot get out of it.  When the Minister refers to the amount of money that is owed by the self-employed he takes account of assessments which is absolutely ludicrous.  I agree with the self-assessment basis.  That is a very good method of doing the job and relieving the Revenue inspectors and staff to actually review the evasion that is there, and there is massive evasion there.  I am sorry it is necessary for this Bill to come in.  I would like to ask the Minister how many claims he had and what prompted this?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>There must have been numerous claims.  They are probably starting to flow in because every PAYE worker I know is asking me about it. They reckon that the Minister owes them about £1,000 each.  The money was actually spent on the other side in the case of the water charges and we saw what <Col N="1603" /> happened in the High Court with the water charges.  We saw what happened with the farmers as far as the rates were concerned.  The rates were deemed to be unconstitutional.  The fact is that that money has been collected.  Probably the courts would agree with the Minister but, what will happen in the future is another debate.</P>
      <P>We should be stronger in these areas. We should not have to rush in legislation to stop a situation developing because accountants have seen that there is a loophole in the law and they can use that loophole and see what they can do for the PAYE workers.  I ask the Minister to be more vigilant and more open in the actual collection.  I said in a previous Seanad debate that he should speak to accountants because they are the people who understand the business climate and the business community and understand what is really happening.  There are people who owe massive amounts of money.  I know many people who owe in the region of £100,000 and £200,000 and when you add the interest on to it that becomes £300,000.  There is no possibility that you could collect that.  If you had a business approach and a practical approach to it you could get £50,000 and you could ensure that they would pay their taxes in future and you would ensure that you would have a viable operation. I think the Minister should do that.  He said before the competitors would raise objections to that.</P>

They did not get into difficulties <Col N="1604" /> because they wanted to get into difficulties, because they put money away; they got into difficulties because of the economic climate.  Now they want to get out of those difficulties, and the only way they can do so is to have a proper relationship with the Revenue Commissioners. They cannot have a proper relationship with the Revenue Commissioners because when you go in you are given the law and you are quoted the text verbatim. There is no possibility that they could actually pay.  I think the Revenue should accept a reasonable amount of money and accept that these people would pay from then on.  I think that would be a very good contribution to the economy and also a contribution to the workers in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many mistakes the Minister for Finance has made since he has held this portfolio but I do not think he merits the punishment of surrounding him with a group of accountants for a long time.  I have never heard of anything quite as bad as that. That drew me to my feet.  I have little more to say, but I think I should say a few things.  Basically, this is a matter of interpretation and it is quite obvious that the original Bill was meant to be on gross incomes.  The Government's miscalculation may have been bad in the past, but with a sum of £350 million they would not have gone wrong.  I do not understand how the courts could interpret it in this way because it was quite obvious what was the Government's intention.  What it should indicate to us is that there is a case for a thorough review of the tax system.  The fact of the matter is that we have had thorough reviews of the tax systems but they appear to have been ignored.  We are continually going to come across problems like this if we insist on a rather cumbersome 1 per cent levy which people do not understand, which is difficult to collect and a lot of people do not pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation. They appear to have been a <Col N="1605" /> complete waste of time in that we have not implemented many of them.  We have not accepted the basic philosophy behind them and we are still in the same system of taxation as we have always been.  The 1 per cent levy raises the problem of the black economy.  The Minister might give us some indication of how large the black economy is, not how much legal tax has not been paid, but how much illegal tax is not being collected.  I have no estimate of it but I am sure that there is enormous scope in a time of fiscal rectitude for tackling the black economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make a totally irrelevant plea &mdash; before I am ruled out of order &mdash; to the Minister not to tax pension funds in the forthcoming budget. Am I out of order in asking the Minister not to tax the pension funds in the forthcoming budget?</P>

      <P>And I was just about to reply to him: I was just going to tell him.  I thank the Seanad for its good humoured debate of this measure.  Although this is a very serious measure, the debate although in itself appropriate and serious, was also of a kind that put me in good humour for Christmas.</P>
      <P>Senator Lynch and Senator Conway referred to court cases in this context. For the sake of clarity, I should point out that there is no court case in this instance and we are not dealing with a matter that is before the courts.  We are dealing with claims that are being made at a very initial stage, of people sending in letters about it.  To avoid everybody getting involved in the expense of bringing it to court we are making the law clear beyond doubt in advance.  That will be helpful to some people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the remarks made by Senator Conway about Revenue taking a pragmatic view of arrears from businesses who are in trouble with their tax.  I would like to make two or three points on this although it is probably as much out of order as Senator Ross's astutely-phrased <Col N="1606" /> question.  First, the Committee of Public Accounts is constantly berating the Revenue Commissioners for failing to collect tax that is due under law. Sometimes the very same politicians in another guise come looking for consideration in particular cases.  But in the abstract it has been the constant theme of both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts that just as money should only be spent in accordance with law, money which is due under law should be collected in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in the case of value-added tax and PRSI, if an employer is getting into arrears on those, he is not in fact getting into arrears in respect of his own tax.  He is not paying up tax that he collected on behalf of the Revenue from somebody: it was never his money; it was the money of the consumer who paid it to him in order that it be paid to the Revenue in the case of VAT, and money belonging to the employees which he deducted at source in order to give the employees certain rights which the employees expect him to pass on.  In that case you are not talking about giving him consideration in regard to his own tax position.  You are simply saying that he should not use money that does not belong to him as a means of financing his business.  If he needs finance for his business he should go to his bank manager and not use value-added tax or PRSI as a source of finance for the business.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a preparedness on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to be reasonable in regard to taxes actually owed by the company or the individual on his own account if he genuinely cannot pay, although the danger in doing that is, of course, to encourage people to build up arrears.  If you do not collect interest on arrears you are in a situation that in real terms people pay less by not paying on time.  The interest is only there in order to keep the actual value of the tax up to date.  So there must be interest on arrears.  Nobody likes to be in a position of having to collect money in these circumstances.  I can assure Senators that the Revenue, although they have to <Col N="1607" /> administer the law and do so scrupulously, have a human face and try to understand the problems of the taxpayer. Very often the Revenue, in giving advice to somebody to put their tax affairs in order, can frequently save that business, by getting them to put their finances in order while there is still time, rather than allowing debts to pile up to a point where they become irretrievable.  Prompt action by the Revenue Commissioners can sometimes benefit the long-term standing of a business rather than be to its detriment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made reference to the Commission on Taxation and to the fundamental reform of the system.  The Government have drawn on the recommendations of the Commission and will continue as will all Governments in the forthcoming Dáil to draw on the excellent reports of that body.  It is important to recognise that tax reform in the abstract is something that is easy to get a cheer for, but the specific recommendations of the Commission on Taxation, when looked at individually, are not something that everybody would wish to embrace, either politically or perhaps even from the point of view of their being actually good for the country.</P>
    <P>Let me give you an example.  A major cut in mortgage interest relief is one of the recommendations.  Do we actually want that?  The taxation of lump sums paid to people on retirement is another recommendation of the Commission on Taxation.  Do we want that?  Do we want to tax benefits-in-kind to the extent that if people have a right to park their car in front of their place of employment, they should be paying income tax for that privilege?  That is another recommendation for tax reform by the Commission on Taxation.  Do we want that? Do we want a single rate of tax to the extent that there would be such a high rate that many low income taxpayers would be paying substantially more than they are paying at present?  Those are just a few morsels chosen from the menu of the Commission on Taxation.  Those who talk in general terms about &ldquo;the need for <Col N="1608" /> tax reform and action on the Commission on Taxation Report&rdquo; would do well to preface their remarks by telling those to whom they are speaking which specific recommendation of the Commission on Taxation they are talking about.  It is very important that any debate on tax reform and on the economy in general &mdash; a debate which is going to rage furiously over the next six months &mdash; be conducted on the basis of specifics.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on the question raised by Senator Ross which was ruled out of order.  The Government said in their statement issued by the Cabinet on 16 October that there would be no overall increase in the burden of taxation.  That is the important point which Senator Ross and other Senators will no doubt reflect upon over Christmas.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to subsection 2º of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad Éireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Courts (No. 3) Bill, 1986, on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.</P>
      <P>This is the early signature Motion in connection with the Courts Bill which was passed earlier today.  Senators are, of course, aware that this is an emergency measure and accordingly it is desirable that it should come into effect as soon as possible.  The proper constitutional requirements for the early signature Motion have been complied with.</P>

      <P>This relates to the Bill we have just been discussing, the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  It is a Bill whose nature indicates that it should be brought into immediate operation and accordingly the Government have acted and asked the Seanad to concur in an early signature.</P>
