      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to order for today Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in that order.  No. 1 is the continuation of the Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill.  No. 2 is the Report Stage of the Air Pollution Bill.  No. 3 is a Private Members' Motion of a special type, which we do discuss from time to time in the House.  It concerns the question of the convictions in England in a number of cases in which serious doubts have arisen in regard to the judicial process and it is proposed to follow our normal practice in such a case that there should be a spokesman from each group.  The proposal is that each spokesman should be allowed 15 minutes, and no other speakers would be allowed.  Following that, we have the Limerick Gas Order, which is No. 4. Copies of this Gas Order are available in the Seanad Office for those who are interested.  No. 5 is the Extradition Bill which has passed in the Dáil.  There has been an unavoidable delay in the circulation of the text of the Bill to Members.  It is not in their boxes this morning, but I can assure them that a text will be in their boxes before that item is reached.  If time is available, which is unlikely, we will take the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I see no reason for us to sit beyond our normal finishing time of 8 p.m. tonight. In view of the pressure of work, partly on Senators especially Senators who have been active in discussion, but also on the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas I think we should take a break from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and again from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. this evening.</P>

      <P>I refer to item No. 24, the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill, 1986.  I wonder has the Leader of the House found any reason why, on this most important matter, recognised by all parties in the House as being extremely important, the Minister for Social Welfare did not contribute.  Was it an error or a mistake?  Secondly, both the Leader and the Deputy Leader expressed cautious goodwill about making some further time available to facilitate the Minister in delivering what I am sure is quite a substantial script.  Obviously we cannot do it this side of Christmas.  Acting on the perhaps optimistic assumption that we are going to reassemble in January, could you give me some indication of whether that cautious undertaking could be implemented in January?  I still find it a matter of considerable regret that the Minister for Social Welfare was not sufficiently interested in social welfare recipients to speak on a matter like this.</P>

      <P>I am interested to know what the present position is in relation to the Status of Children Bill and the Adoption Bill, in other words, the social legislation on which we are working in this House, and the likelihood of their being completed in terms of this House's consideration before Christmas?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House what is the situation regarding the Appropriation Bill?  We have a sitting day tomorrow.  I am wondering will we have time to have at least some contributions on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of the Private Members' Bill on <Col N="1365" /> social welfare, Senator Brendan Ryan has asked me in the event of this House resuming after Christmas would time be found to discuss it.  I can assure the Senator that it is my firm intention that this House should resume after Christmas and anything that happens in another place will not interfere with that. I have a draft programme for January and I will take a look at the draft programme which contains a good deal of very important Government business.  For example, it is my wish &mdash; and I am sure it is the wish of the House &mdash; that the very important Status of Children Bill in which the Minister has gone a long way to meeting views expressed in this House to the extent that the number of amendments intended to be brought in is now approaching 90 &mdash; should be discussed.  This Bill will be transformed.  It is my intention that that legislation should go through in January.</P>
      <P>I understand that there have been discussions in regard to the discharge from the Dáil of the Adoption Bill and its introduction into the Seanad.  I had hoped a few weeks ago that that might be done. There was not complete agreement among the parties in Dáil Éireann, but I understand that another attempt is now being made.  I will discuss with the Minister for Social Welfare the question of making time available, even though strictly speaking on 14 January and 21 January Private Members' Time belongs to Fianna Fáil.  I will try to make a special arrangement in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of business tomorrow, the Dáil will pass three Bills today, all of which must be law before the end of the year.  One of these is an Exchange Control Bill.  If it is not passed before the end of the year it would mean that there would be no exchange control from 1 January onwards.  There are those who think that might not make much difference to what occurs, but it will be necessary for this House to pass the Exchange Control Bill tommorrow.  A Bill is also being introduced and will be passed with dispatch in the Dáil today&mdash; which is the Courts Bill &mdash; in order to <Col N="1366" /> remedy the defects in regard to the issuing of summonses.  The Dáil will &mdash; at my repeated urging &mdash; pass the Appropriation Bill today, rather than tomorrow. We will receive the Appropriation Bill today.</P>
    <P>I will have to propose to the House at the beginning of business tomorrow that there are three Bills which must pass all Stages tommorrow.  It is a matter for the House to decide how much time it wants to take with them and how it wants to allocate the time between those three Bills, all of which must be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 15, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A Historic Monuments Advisory Committee shall meet at regular intervals and not less than four times each year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 59, which we passed yesterday evening, I have grave doubts that simply by adding provisions like this to the Act we will protect our heritage in this way.  We have dealt with that, and I will take it up again on Report Stage.  Two very important amendments which I submitted are properly ruled out of order but it indicates the way we are inhibited in this House with <Col N="1367" /> regard to improvements of a Bill.  I was trying to deal with the situation as regards compensation and ownership.  These problems have not been confronted in the Bill.  I want to make that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Historic Monuments Advisory Committee, I have been chairman of the local advisory committee in my own town.  I have also been elected to the country advisory committee.  I am secretary of the parliamentary all-party heritage group.  The chairman is Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  I am very sorry to learn he is ill and I wish him well.  I know all the Members of the House will join with me in wishing him a speedy recovery. The big problem I find is that initially there is great enthusiasm and then for want of meetings this enthusiasm wanes.</P>
    <P>The Meath County Council Advisory Committee was appointed after the last local government election.  I am casting no aspersions on the officials.  No meetings have been held since then.  Only one meeting was held by the all-party heritage group.  This does not help.  If there was some statutory obligation to meet at regular intervals, whether quarterly or yearly, it would be a great improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement that the advisory committee should meet several times a year is an extremely advisable one.  I am not too sure about the question of meeting at regular intervals because we might run into a problem of definition of regularity and it would not give flexibility. There might be times of the year at which it would be suitable for the advisory committee to meet in successive months.  There are times of the year, for example, in preparation for the summer excavation period, when the advice of this committee would, like the advice of its predecessors, be taken by the Commissioners of Public Works before they issue their grants for summer excavations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might well be found that the workload on the advisory committee might not occur regularly throughout the year.  I would not agree with the question of regular intervals.  In regard to the question <Col N="1368" /> of ensuring that the committee do meet more than once I certainly support this. I want to say quite frankly that the record of the committee which this replaces was not good.  The record of the Commissioners of Public Works in summoning the National Monuments Advisory Council left a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected and sit down, but I let the criticism stand on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with this amendment.  I understand that some advisory committees are not very active, while in some counties they do not exist at all.  It would be somewhat contradictory, however, to provide that a local authority may or may not establish a local advisory committee and then make it obligatory on the committees that are established to meet at certain intervals.  I feel, too, that simply obliging committees to meet would not necessarily mean that they would be more committed to the conservation of our monuments.  As upholders of local democracy and as members for many years of local authorities, we have all complained about being turned into rubber stamps by central government.  I am sure the Senators are only too familiar with that argument.  It is up to interested councillors to press for the establishment of local advisory committees and then, when established, to ensure that they play an active part in the conservation of our heritage generally.  It is really in the interests of true local democracy to leave that with the councillors.  The secretary and chairman of this committee play a particularly important role.  If we treat local democracy seriously we should trust <Col N="1369" /> it on this matter.  I do not blame the Senators for being somewhat doubtful at this point given the history of these local advisory committees to date, but I am not sure that we should take on board centrally any failings of local government. We should first try to make local government be true local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was perfectly right.  We were making the same case for the National Monuments Advisory Council &mdash; exactly the same case. When the Minister says that it should be left possibly to the discretion of the chairman and the vice chairman in regard to calling meetings, the problem is that with regard to the council in Meath &mdash; and I am not casting reflections in any way &mdash; they have not met.  There is no chairman and there is not vice chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you not request a meeting?  I think any councillor is free to press such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the obvious question &mdash;&ldquo;Why did you not request a meeting?&rdquo; Time passes, and I think myself that it is a pity that there is no obligation. I would be satisfied with Senator Dooge's suggestion that they should be obliged to meet annually.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rightly said that the appointment of an advisory committee is at the discretion of a local authority.  Subsection (1) of section 22 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, provides that a local authority may establish an advisory committee, which in that Act is referred to as a local advisory committee, to perform the functions mentioned in section 22 and that every committee shall be styled and known by the name of the functional area of the local authority by whom it is established, followed by the words <Col N="1370" />&ldquo;national monuments advisory committee.&rdquo; I think it is a mistake that the local authority should have that discretion. It should be mandatory to form a local advisory committee.  If we are to be serious about this particular legislation, the Minister should consider an amendment to make it mandatory on local authorities to appoint local advisory committees in every instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>My reasoning in relation to the last amendment &mdash; and my difficulty in accepting it &mdash; would stand in relation to this.  I agree with the Senator. Every local authority should have such an advisory committee.  I would hope they would have.  If we are to treat local government and local democracy seriously we cannot dictate to every local authority what they must do on every issue.  The discretion must be there.  It is an indictment of the area, and perhaps of councillors' interest to some extent, if they do not have such an advisory committee. I would hope that they would all take a greater interest, particularly from now on, and establish such committees. I pull back at the point of dictating centrally that they must do so.  The councillors themselves must take a role in this and make the decision for themselves. There is nothing stopping any local authority now having such an advisory committee. They have had those powers for some time.  Regrettably, all too few have set up these committees and of those that have been set up, even fewer have functioned as we would like them to function. Because there have been failings in the system and because, perhaps, Local Government has not been as effective as it should be in relation to their own patch in this question, I hesitate to dictate any further to them from central government. Quite frankly with my local authority hat on for a moment, the feeling among county councillors and local councillors generally is that we have had too much of that, that we are effectively just rubber stamps now.  We are adding to that argument. This is an area, in particular, which would be very easy to overcome if there <Col N="1371" /> was any interest at all from local councillors. Even one councillor is enough to be a catalyst in relation to setting up such a committee.</P>
      <P>We will circularise all local authorities pointing out the advisability and desirability of setting up these committees and suggesting that they do so.  I will be doing that early in the New Year.  I pull back at making it mandatory, if we are true believers in local government and local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to over-labour the point.  I do not see why the Minister should hesitate to dictate to local authorities.  I would not have reservations about that.  After all, this is what the Act is about &mdash; to establish a certain enthusiasm and here is one opportunity. The fact that the advisory committees may not have been as successful in the past as they could have been and as they should have been means that something should be done.  I am sure this is a reflection on those counties where committees have not been active.  I am not sure whether it is sufficient to say that one member could change that situation. If the Minister agreed to this suggestion of meeting annually and to some kind of report and to injecting some kind of enthusiasm into the advisory committees it would change the whole situation.  This is what is needed.  It is not compulsion through penalties or fines.  It is to bring the people together and let them understand. It is to convince the people that there is something worthwhile here.  The Historic Monuments Advisory Committees could be very powerful tools if worked properly.  We are not availing of this opportunity when we are finalising this legislation.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 62:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 15, to insert the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;Section 23 of the Principal <Col N="1372" /> Act is hereby amended by the substitution of `4' for `fourteen' in subsection (1) and the said subsection, as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P>(1) Every person who finds any archaeological object shall, within 4 days after he has found such object, make a report of such finding to a member of the Garda Síochána on duty in the district in which such object was so found or the Director of the National Museum and shall when making such report state his own name and address, the nature or character of the said object and the time and place at which the circumstances in which is was found by him, and shall also, and whether he has or has not made such report as aforesaid, and irrespective of the person to whom he has made such report (if any) give to any member of the Garda Síochána or to the said Director on request any information within his knowledge in relation to such object or the finding thereof and shall permit any member of the Garda Síochána or the said Director to inspect, examine or photograph such object.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with a situation where a person finds an archaeological object and it sets out the procedure the finder must follow.  It states that he must inform either a member of the Garda Síochána or the Director of the National Museum.  The section then goes on to state:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and shall permit any member of the Garda Síochána or the said Director to inspect, examine or photograph such object&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the director of the National Museum wishes to inspect, examine or photograph such an object, it would appear from the section that he must do so personally.  It is not open to him to nominate somebody to do so for him because it would appear that the individual who finds the object <Col N="1373" /> is not obliged to allow any nominee of the director but only the director himself to do so.  It would be a little unreasonable to expect that the director would have personally to inspect, examine or photograph any object which he wished to inspect, examine or photograph and that he could not nominate somebody to do so on his behalf or that there would be no obligation on the finder of the object to allow a nominee of the director to do so on his behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the same view as Senator Mullooly.  In examining a work of art, or in taking photographs of a discovery of this kind, we are in a very specialised area.  Very expensive and specialised equipment and lighting would have to be used.  There is a problem from the point of view of a proper examination or proper photographs.  I would be happy if the Minister would confirm that the director would be empowered to engage specialists to do this work for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 68 have been grouped together. Breaches of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1986, have up to now been regarded as offences to be dealt with in the District Courts.  However, I think that the time has come for us to take a more serious view of damage to our heritage. As I said during Second Stage debate on this Bill, the level of fines and penalties is in the end the test of our seriousness. A number of people have said to me that the fines proposed in the Bill, while considerably greater than the derisory figures that apply at present, are still far too low and, on reflection, I agree with <Col N="1375" /> them.  Therefore, I am proposing that provision be made for certain breaches of the National Monuments Acts to be indictable offences with maximum penalties of £50,000, or 12 months imprisonment, or both.</P>
      <P>The offences to which these will apply are as follows.  The first category is demolition, removal, disfiguring, defacing, altering or in any manner injuring or interfering with a national monument in the ownership or guardianship of the commissioners or of a local authority, or subject of a preservation order.  The second category includes the exporting or attempting to export an archaeological object without a licence, or defacing, destroying or injuring an archaeological object.  Thirdly, digging or excavating for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects or for any archaeological purpose without a licence. Fourthly, the use of a detection device in contravention of section 2 of this Bill. Fifthly, contravention of subsections (3), (4) and (5) of section 3 of this Bill, namely the interference with a historic wreck or acting in breach of a licence under that section.  Sixthly, carrying out work at or in relation to a monuments or an archaeological area which is entered in the Register of Historic Monuments within two months of having given notice to the commissioners, except in a case of urgent necessity and with the consent of the commissioners.</P>
      <P>I should stress that the figure of £50,000 is a maximum and I would expect that a fine of this order would be imposed in only the most exceptional circumstances. However, we must have deterrents which will prove to be effective in dissuading both our own people and foreigners from pillaging our heritage for monetary gain.</P>

      <P>I am not too sure that I would feel like cheering with Senator Dooge.  I do not want to give the impression that I am throwing cold water on this because it is an important Bill and it is a serious attempt to deal with the situation.  The Minister could claim that, no matter what suggestion she would make, it would be criticised.  From the point of view of recent problems, if we are talking of a penalty of £50,000 against a hoard valued at £5½ million plus, it is quite reasonable.  Some people would say that perhaps it is not sufficient.  I am not too sure that having fairly heavy penalties will of itself solve any great problem.  I referred before to the litter problem which we have in this country.  Increasing the penalties is not improving the litter problem.  The problem is an inherent carelessness, some lack in the people as a whole compared to any other country in the world.  No matter what fines or penalties are imposed I do not think that in itself without education and some social commitment is going to solve that problem.  Therefore, I believe that the penalties must be realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems a case could be made to double the penalty to £100,000.  I realise they are not mandatory and that there are limits. In having that kind of limit, it must be anchored to some kind of reality.  I <Col N="1377" /> appreciate that heavy penalties must be provided for in the Act.  I am not discounting the figure of £50,000 or condemning it but, thinking out loud, I wonder will that solve many problems? When we compare this with the original section 16 which provided for maximum penalty of £1,000 and section 19 where the maximum period for imprisonment was six months and where there was no provision for trial on indictment, we see we are considering a major change.  It must have been motivated by events in the past.</P>
    <P>I know it is a very emotive issue and when such an emotive issue is getting the headlines I am not so sure that it is a good time to decide on penalties of that kind. Since I am not familiar with the legal area, I am at a loss to understand how in a particular situation a decision is made with regard to summary trial or trial at a higher level.  In my view this is determined by the value of the works in question, for example a chalice.  I feel that £1,000 would be the limit for a summary trial and anything over £1,000 could not be tried on summary.  How is an evaluation made of whatever art works are in question?</P>
    <P>For example, when I leave in my film for processing there is an undertaking by the company that in the event of damage to the film they will give a film in exchange but that has not bearing to the actual value of the film and there could be some very valuable photographs on that film.  On the radio this morning I heard where somebody was trying to insure a 1923 Morris Minor car and the value for insurance purposes was £200 whereas the value that the assessor would put on it would be £200,000.  Is there a problem determining the value?  Who determines it?  Would it be like the film, would it be simply the material that would be valued? There are many questions to be answered.  At the end of the day we must ask ourselves whether this legislation, including heavy penalties, will be an improvement?  The answer to that is very firmly in the affirmative.  It will, of course, because the penalties at present at £25 <Col N="1378" /> are totally out-of-date.  From that point of view I welcome it.</P>
    <P>If somebody committed a minor indiscretion with regard to a very valuable object, how many people could afford to pay a fine of £10,000 or £20,000 or £50,000?  There is power under the law to impose such fines but I do not think people will be able to pay those penalties.</P>

      <P>It took me a long time to realise that Senator Fitzsimons is supporting the amendment, I thought initially he was against it.  I welcome his support with the reservations he made.  I will deal about the point of the small man being lobbed into the Circuit Court and being fined £50,000.  The commissioners, with the advice of the DPP, will decide on the particular procedure to be followed in each indiscretion.  The circumstances of each case, not just in terms of monetary value, will be taken into account in relation to that decision.  It is a maximum fine and it can be anything from £5,000 to £50,000 that can be imposed depending on the circumstances of the individual, the deliberation and various other factors involved.  We have only to remind ourselves of a recent case: there was outcry in the debate on the Adjournment in the Dáil and also in the Seanad in relation to Kilcullen and a particular desecration that happened down there.  Under the 1930 Act the maximum level of fines which could possibly be imposed even in a major case of desecration like that is £50.  We are not talking about an individual local person who commits some indiscretion, however, deliberate or otherwise.  We are talking also of multinational interests, of a major companies and people who flagrantly disregard the law.  I think £50,000 in those type of examples is not too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons was pressing an amendment last night that we should take the advice of the Historic Monuments Council.  He was suggesting it should be mandatory on the commissioners, he will be pleased to know that the advice of the Historic Monuments Council in this case is that £50,000 should be the maximum fine.  We are being consistent on that. <Col N="1379" /> Even though I did not accept his amendment on making their advice mandatory, we will do so in most cases.  There would have to be extremely good reason for not accepting their advice.  We have accepted their advice in relation to this, too, and it concurs with my sentiments and with the views expressed by various Senators during the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I also accept the point made by the Senator that fines in themselves will not resolve the appalling problem of desecration, the lack of interest and vandalising of our national heritage.  It will not, but it will indicate how seriously we treat such behaviour and such indiscretions. I hope it will influence public opinion and show the seriousness we attribute to these acts.  I accepts that before we talk about punitive measures we have to do everything to influence and educate the public generally about our national heritage, we have an enormous job to do there and a long way to go.</P>
    <P>As a second line, I feel very serious fines are a major deterrent.  They point out to the public that we no longer accept what has gone on and that we consider it a major offence against our country, against our people, against our heritage for this to continue and that we intend to treat it with a seriousness that it is due.  I was tempted to suggest that the Morris Minor car referred to by the Senator will shortly be declared a historic wreck but perhaps that is for another Chamber.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much Senator Dooge's kind comments on this amendment and I accept everything he says.  I know indeed that many organisations in academia will be very pleased in relation to this.  Again it really indicates and underlines the seriousness of our intent in relation to resolving the difficulties in this area.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister totally.  If we are talking of multinational companies or somebody who is trying to become wealthy in this way, of course £50,000 is not excessive but a case could be made that it should be far more.  That will not apply in very many cases.  It is unfortunate that there could <Col N="1380" /> be no kind of division, that that would be an exceptional case.  This kind of broad power given to a judge means that he will have to come to a decision and take many factors into consideration.  It seems reasonable to assume, that, if there will be many cases and I hope there will not, the fines could not be anything of that order.  They must be penalties that people are able to pay.</P>

      <P>We are coming to the question of registration and the Land Registry Office and we all know that in the past there have been long delays in the Land Registry.  I am sure this will impose further work on the staff in the Land Registry.  Many people in the past have been inconvenienced through these delays.  I am trying to ensure that registration of these burdens would not result in long delays which will hold up the sale or leasing of property.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Fitzsimons on this amendment.  There is a danger that if the Bill is not amended there will be delays in the Land Registry resulting from the procedures which will have to be gone through there.  As Senator Fitzsimons said, in the Land Registry at the present there are undue delays which are causing people considerable inconvenience.  Indeed, in some <Col N="1382" /> cases people are being caused considerable financial loss.  I am aware of a number of cases in the Land Registry, where because of delays there, people who have been approved for loans both from building societies and local authorities have had to remain on bridging finance for very long periods and have had to pay very high interest on that bridging finance.  If the dealings in the Land Registry had been more expeditious, these people would have been saved a considerable amount of money.  I support Senator Fitzsimons's amendment because, without such a provision written into the Bill, there is the danger that the procedures which are provided for in the Bill may lead to very long delays in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>Entries in the Register of Historic Monuments, preservation orders, guardianship orders and guardianship deeds will be registered in the Land Registry and will, therefore, appear automatically in land certificates or in certified copies of Land Registry folios. They will not, therefore, be a cause of delay in transactions in land title.  There may be isolated cases where a preservation order is awaiting registration in the Land Registry when a request for a certified copy of the relevant folio is made and some minor delay may ensue.  This will be a matter for the Land Registry to deal with it as quickly as they can.  While I sympathise with what the amendment is trying to achieve, it is not something that can be legislated for.</P>

      <P>During Committee Stage discussion on section 14, Senator Fitzsimons wondered whether individual apartments in an <Col N="1385" /> apartment block came within the definition of private dwelling and a consequential requirement to give 48 hours notice before entry by an authorised person.  This had always been the intention but having considered Senator Fitzsimon's point more fully, I feel that the definition of private dwelling in section 7 could be amended to clarify the position. The amendment now makes it clear that only that part of an apartment block which houses a fireplace of more than 45kW is excluded from the definition of private dwelling.  In effect we will be excluding only boiler houses serving a number of dwellings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 27, to delete &ldquo;other than in a case of urgency&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;without the permission of the occupier and unless a serious contravention of this Act is suspected&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with section 14 which deals with the powers of authorised persons. Personal dwellings should be sacrosanct and this amendment goes part of the way I want but not all the way. Section 14 (2) says:</P>
      <P>An authorised person shall not, other than in a case of urgency, enter into a private dwelling unless he has given to the occupier of the dwelling not less than 48 hours notice in writing of his intended entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently even in a situation where an occupier might not object and might agree to entry the authorised person would be precluded from entering a particular dwelling.  Under section 14(2) an authorised person may not enter into a private dwelling except in a case of urgent necessity and unless he has given the occupier of the dwelling &ldquo;not less than 48 hours notice in writing of his intended <Col N="1386" /> entry&rdquo;.  I am sure there would be situations where an occupier might not object and that condition would apply.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand, in relation to a private dwelling, how there would be a case of urgent necessity.  We are not dealing with a situation where there is a large furnace, or where there could be serious pollution.  It is unrealistic to have incorporated in the legislation that an authorised person can, without submitting to the judgment of any board or any individuals, come to a conclusion that the case is one of urgency.  I am sure if an authorised person wanted to enter a private house he could come to a conclusion that it was a case of urgent necessity and that authorised person would not have to answer to anyone even if it turned out that it was not a case of urgency.  I would prefer to see the situation where the power was not given under this Bill.  As the Minister said, there is power under the Health Acts and there is certain power under the planning laws.  The rights of the individual are being eroded all the time.  The Minister made the case that in certain situations domestic dwellings are a problem but the latest report of An Foras Forbartha would seem to dispel that situation.  For example, in the city more people have moved to the suburbs and, therefore, we do not have the concentrated problems we had.  In the light of all that, I would like the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to second the amendment and support my colleague. The main objection we had to this Bill was with regard to the privacy of dwellings. When we raised this on Committee Stage the reply was a bit distorted in that the Minister thought we were talking about backyards, out-offices and premises adjoining private dwellings.  That is not the case.  People do not live in out-offices, gardens, sheds or on land adjacent to their house.  What we meant was the private dwelling.  The thrust of our deliberations on Committee Stage was that the occupants of the inhabited part of the premises would have their own privacy without having harassment from <Col N="1387" /> officials calling to observe an air pollution emission in their kitchen.  The Minister has not given much information to date. The Minister has very fixed ideas and our duty is to tease out and help the legislation and put forward our comments. I ask the Minister to observe them in the light that we are trying to help to make this Bill more effective.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill.  The Minister's technical background means she has a head start on most of us in that regard. Nevertheless, we have done some research on this.  The two objections we have are with regard to the private dwelling in which people live.  They are entitled to have their privacy and that should not be eroded by officials not alone under this measure but under other Acts as well.  All we are referring to is the immediate portions that are inhabited rather than out-offices.  The Minister and others cited cases where rubber is being burned in the backyards of some premises in Dublin, on the Naas Road and various other locations.  That is not what we are talking about.  We are talking about the preservation of the private dwelling.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It is the protection of the inhabitants of the private dwelling we are worried about.  We do not want unnecessary harassment by officials having access to that privacy.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment in the light of the way we presented it.</P>

      <P>I can see what my colleagues are trying to say in this amendment. From reading the section they propose to amend, &ldquo;other than in a case of urgency&rdquo;.  There is obviously no doubt that nobody will enter into private property unless it is a case of urgency.  The section specifically allows for a case of urgency.  There obviously will be cases of urgency at some stage in which people in private property might be contravening the Act.  This amendment would also require the permission of the occupier. This would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  Somebody is contravening the Bill when it has been enacted.  It is a case <Col N="1388" /> of urgency and recognised officers want to go in and do the work they are authorised to do under the legislation.  If that is the case they would still need the permission of the occupier if the amendment was accepted.  The amendment is trying to protect private property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but the private property must also have reference to the common good and at all times be subject to the common good.  Where a private dwelling is contravening an Act in the interests of the common good somebody should be able to have an emergency power, and this is talking about fairly strong power, but only in cases of urgency.  It should not be abused and if it were abused ordinary common law would then come into place.  If somebody could prove that it was not a case of urgency and somebody entered their private property when it was not a matter of urgency, he or she would have a constitutional right and a common law right any way.  Either we are trying to come to grips with air pollution and the possible causes of it or we are not.  There is a balance there.  So long as it is confined to cases of urgency I do not see anything wrong with the section.  The words &ldquo;without the permission of the occupier&rdquo; would weaken it.  If somebody is breaking the law in private property, somebody must have the power, even in the common good interest, to have access in the case of urgency.  I look forward to the Minister's reply on this.</P>

I was asking a question and giving an interpretation on what would happen if the amendment was accepted.  I ask Senator O'Toole to withdraw that unfair remark.

      <P>We have already devoted much time to this issue on Committee Stage.  Without holding out much hope for a change of mind, I undertook to examine the matter again before Report State, hence the discussion here this morning.  Neither this further reflection nor the arguments of Senators on this amendment have persuaded me that we can afford to modify substantially the provisions for access to private dwellings as originally drafted.  Perhaps the following considerations will help to put things more into perspective.</P>
      <P>All entry into premises under section 14 is limited to purposes connected with this Bill.  In the case of private dwellings this represents a very considerable limitation on the power of entry.  The only definite obligation which the Bill places on private dwellings is under section 24(2).  This forbids an emission from any premises, including a domestic one, in such a manner as to cause a nuisance. General powers of entry to premises in relation to nuisance without any notice already exist under section 118 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  The provisions of this Bill are actually less onerous or will certainly leave people no worse off.</P>
      <P>However, with the permission of the Chair I would like to propose an additional amendment which we will call 2a.  I hope this perhaps will allay some fears, particularly the aspect mentioned by Senator Fitzsimons that there is a mandatory 48 hours before anyone can enter if it is not a case of urgency which might not often be necessary because there could be the question of consent of the owner to come in immediately and resolve the thing instantly without protracting the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has actually agreed to allow amendment No. 2a as an additional amendment, in exceptional circumstances, because there are no other Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1391" />
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That section will then read:</P>
      <P>An authorised person shall not, other than with the consent of the occupier or in the case of urgency, enter into a private dwelling unless he has given to the occupier of the dwelling not less than 48 hours notice in writing of his intended entry.</P>
      <P>That certainly suits the difficulty Senator Fitzsimons brought up and it suits exactly what Senator Ferris was saying.  It does not dilute the power when it is absolutely necessary for the protection of the common good in relation to places of nuisance.</P>
      <P>The other obligations which could arise for private dwellings under the Bill are only potential ones at this stage, but they could, of course, be activated.  Section 25 allows the Minister to make regulations prohibiting or restricting the emission of black smoke.  Whether these would apply to houses would be for decision in the context of any regulations.  Even if regulations were to apply to houses it is not clear that entry to a private dwelling would be justified or necessary in order to enforce the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, special control area orders may be made under Part 4 of the Bill and may specify requirements in relation to dwellings.  I have argued already that the force of these requirements would be greatly weakened without substantive powers of inspection.  It would be essential to the success of any special control area order that all householders are seen to comply with it.  Any system which, through ineffectiveness, encouraged periodic non-compliance with an order would be unfair to conscientious householders and would soon degenerate into widespread non-compliance.  I might also add that on my recent visit to the UK, at the invitation of the British Government, I discussed this area in detail with the relevant officials there, as to how their special control area orders worked; any difficulties in initial implementation, criteria for implementation and various other points we have discussed here <Col N="1392" /> during the debate.  I am satisfied with this as it now stands.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris over reacted because we appreciate his contributions. I found him very supportive and we would not want to offend him in any way.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 2a since the Minister will not yield any ground whatever in the way we want the section, we have to accept that this goes some of the way towards meeting the case we are making.  I originally came from a rural area.  In that rural area visitors called in; they never knocked on the door, they just walked in.  This legislation gives the authorised person the power to walk in at any time without knocking on the door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the legislation does.  If an authorised person decides that the case is very urgent he can walk right into a house at any time without giving any notice.  As the Minister said, if the situation is such that there is a suspected health hazard, there is power there already under the Health Acts to go into that dwelling.  Why have it incorporated in this legislation, particularly when there could be no case of urgency with regard to a private dwelling. The permission of the occupier is important and it is important if a serious contravention is suspected.  There is no compulsion under this legislation on an authorised officer to prove his case with regard to the serious contravention.  It might very well turn out that there was no contravention at all.  In effect, the situation could be that if an authorised officer wanted to gain access to a particular house he could walk right in without knocking on the door.  That is what we are opposed to.  It is obvious, having regard to the representations we made on Committee Stage, that the Minister is not going to yield any ground in that regard.  From that point of view we must be satisfied with the Minister's further <Col N="1393" /> amendment.  It goes some of the way towards satisfying us.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 11, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall, with the aid of an urban air pollution dispersion model,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We made this case on Committee Stage. The Minister, as Senator O'Toole said, has had special training and must realise that we have a very special case to make. Anything done under this legislation should be as a result of scientific evidence and research.  I read an interesting article in <i>The Meath Weekender</i> of Saturday, 20 December 1986, under the heading &ldquo;Lab Plan to Curb Pollution&rdquo;, which stated that a special laboratory to help curb pollution in Meath is under discussion and that the idea which could cost up to £100,000 to implement was raised at a preliminary Estimates meeting of Meath County Council this week.  The article is not as informative as I would wish with regard to the exact type of laboratory.  The case I am making is that we have a local authority which realises that research is most important and they are prepared to provide a sum of £100,000 to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this legislation, with regard to the special control areas in particular, there is no doubt in my mind that any decisions arrived at should have a very sound scientific basis.  The Minister questioned on Committee Stage what exactly we meant by a `scientific' <Col N="1394" /> approach.  In this amendment we have spelled out exactly what we mean &mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;an urban air pollution dispersion model&rdquo;.  My understanding of this type of equipment is that there would be instruments located in different places in a locality to cover an area and the information registered on those instruments would be fed back to a central computer.  This spells out for the Minister exactly the situation we would want.  We also know that a number of local authorities are empowered to come together if they wish to do so.  The Minister has the power to make an order that they should come together which would reduce the costs.  The costs are not all that considerable, and even if they are considerable that would be no justification for refusing to accept this amendment.  We are dealing with very important legislation which in many ways will cost many people large amounts of money.  The Minister would have to agree that any decisions made by county managers or by any local authority would have to be based on scientific evidence with a proper datum line rather than on decisions by local authorities which, without this scientific basis, could vary from place to place.  As I stated on Committee Stage, one county manager could be very strict on dealing with pollution of the environment while another manager might not be so strict.  We should have a proper basis and a proper datum line to which to refer.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the two amendments in the name of Senator Fitzsimons.  As I said on the other amendment, we differed with the Minister in regard to monitoring and research.  In the Minister's view there was a close relationship between monitoring and scientific research, so close that he felt there was no difference between modern monitoring and scientific monitoring and scientific research.  That is where we are still clashing.  If there is no difference between scientific monitoring and scientific research, as the Minister admitted on Committee Stage, why is it that the Minister does not want to accept <Col N="1395" /> our position that scientific research should be mandatory on local authorities before zoning these special areas?  That is all we are asking for.  These two amendments are relevant to that point.</P>
      <P>We accept the Minister's professional knowledge in this regard, in that she has admitted that there is nothing between scientific monitoring and scientific research.  It is so narrow I cannot see why the Minister is not accepting our position since we asked specifically, since this Bill was introduced, that scientific research be mandatory.  That is all we are asking for and that is what those two amendments are about.  I do not know if the Minister has changed her mind since Committee Stage.  We welcome the Minister's other amendment here this morning. It has helped in some way.  We now hope for another amendment which will resolve that little difference between this side of the House and the Minister's views in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been susceptible to the carrot and stick principle and it is not going to work now.  These two amendments before us deal specifically with air dispersion models.  The Senator had been allowed some latitude in a Committee Stage speech on Report Stage but that is not for me to decide.  I am going to stick to what the two amendments are about, which is air dispersion models and I am not going back over Second Stage or Committee Stage discussions.  I would like to say, in passing, that monitoring forms part of scientific research.  I did not say the two were equal.  We discussed this at length before.  Monitoring is a form of research.  Monitoring in itself is empirical. It is only by monitoring that you could feed air dispersion models.  They are two separate processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding amendments Nos. 3 and 6 the air pollution models are a well tried instrument in air quality management. Models are constructed to stimulate the effect on air quality of various emission patterns or volumes.  In this way they can help to identify cost effective control <Col N="1396" /> strategies.  Dublin Corporation recently commissioned the World Spring Laboratory to develop a limited dispersion model for smoke and SO in the Dublin area.  This has now been completed.  An Foras Forbartha are also developing a fuller dispersion model, with financial assistance which I am pleased to acknowledge from Coal Information Services.  I have no doubt, therefore, that air pollution dispersion models will be developed, where appropriate, by local authorities for air quality management purposes.  I emphasise &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo;. However, they are only one instrument of research among many.  I do not believe that the Bill should require all local authorities to have such models.</P>
    <P>The actual text of the amendment would have the further odd effect of requiring all local authorities, urban and rural, to develop urban dispersion models.  Amendment No. 3 appears to confine local authorities research to dispersion models and this would not be appropriate.  It would be too restrictive in all cases.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 would require local authorities to carry out monitoring with the aid of a dispersion model.  Monitoring and modelling are different activities. Monitoring is factual data gathering, while modelling involves the formulation of a hypothesis or prediction for the future on the basis of the facts already gathered.  It would not be coherent to require monitoring to be intermixed with modelling.  Having stated my observation of these amendments, I am satisfied that local authorities will use air quality models where appropriate in their circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a form of research.  The point we are making is that this can be a very incomplete and very insufficient type of research.  We are talking of a circumstance where a local authority will have to carry out such <Col N="1397" /> monitoring of the air quality and the nature, extent and effects of emissions as the local authority may consider necessary for the performance of their function under this Bill or as they may be directed by the Minister to carry out.  At present when finances are scarce, the extent of the monitoring would not be very extensive. Having regard to the special control areas and the other aspects which involve heavy expenses on individuals and firms, it is wrong not to have this basic research.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to an air dispersion model even in rural areas.  It is obvious we are only concerned really with urban areas because this is where the great problem would arise.</P>
      <P>My understanding of an air pollution dispersion model is that instruments could be located at various sites over areas.  The information about the various pollutants &mdash; sulphur dioxide, smoke, lead, carbon monoxide and so on &mdash; would be fed into the central computer and a good picture would be projected as regards air pollution.  We never made the case that it would be necessary to have a complete survey in one place but in stragegic situations over an area, to have instruments which would give registrations with regard to pollutants.  This information would be fed into a computer and then a picture would emerge that would be based on scientific facts.  That is the kind of monitoring we are looking for.  Section 54 (3) states:</P>
      <P>A local authority may require the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, from which there is an emission to carry out such monitoring of the nature, extent and effect of the emission and of the air quality as the local authority consider necessary and to keep and to supply to the local authority such records of the monitoring as the local authority may consider necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a comparison between monitoring in both situations.  It seems that the monitoring envisaged in subsection (1) might be referred to in subsection (3) which clearly would be insufficient and would not be scientific.  If <Col N="1398" /> somebody keeps a record of the amount of fuel burned in a fire, and the temperature and various aspects, that could be regarded as monitoring.  I hope the Minister is not saying that on the basis of something as casual and unscientific as that an area control order could be made. We feel strongly that the Minister should accept this amendment or if she is not prepared to accept it, that there be some variation of it which would give the scientific basis we are looking for.  We would not be satisfied with anything less than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to acknowledge that research is wider than monitoring. Monitoring is a form of research. It is data collection.  The Bill gives weight to our view in that area in that we have two separate sections.  Section 18 deals with research and section 54 with monitoring. We are not saying they are the same thing.  The Bill has two separate sections dealing with these two issues.  I would like to put that on the record. I cannot accept what the Senator said particularly with regard to these two sections.  I do not think we could have any compulsion in relation to air pollution dispersion models.  There would be many local authorities where monitoring would be totally unnecessary.  One can think of the western seaboard so I think a blanket compulsion for all local authorities to fall in line with what has been suggested is unnecessary and unnecessarily expensive in relation to the local government situation. Monitoring will indicate if there are any problems and monitoring would be carried out in an area of particularly high urban density where there are likely to be problems or where the Department of the Environment's view is that problems could occur.  It is only a first line of action.  We can monitor without having special air dispersion models.  We can monitor for smoke, SO 2, lead, nitrous oxides, and so on.  Monitoring can indicate if we are reaching the level of exceedences in relation to any of these and where we think there is a danger, or the monitoring indicates a danger, we can then move to the position of air pollution <Col N="1399" /> dispersion models if that is deemed necessary. To have a compulsion on all local authorities is quite unnecessary at this point particularly in view of the fact that as we all discuss this and that another section relates to special control area orders, it is the position in Dublin that concerns us and that is what we will be looking at and monitoring very carefully in the immediate future.  We are a long way from having the same type of problem in any other of our major urban areas.  When there is likely to be an occurrence <Col N="1400" /> or exceedences monitoring will occur and then we will move to the models if they are deemed necessary.  I reiterate that it is totally unnecessary to insist on these provisions in relation to all local authorities.</P>

They have been particularly helpful in facilitating representatives of the group in making arrangements to meet the British Home Secretary, British politicians of all parties, the Maguire family and some of <Col N="1403" /> those who remain in prison, during two visits to London earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his official have been extremely active in pursuing the cases concerned since the first major television programme on the subject was broadcast in October 1985.  In my view they have raised the cases in the appropriate quarters in Britain persistently and skilfully since that date.  The fact that these convictions, all 17 of them have been seriously questioned only since the television broadcast is an indictment of all of us and cannot be blamed on the Minister any more than on any else, and that includes Members of this House and myself.  The fact that Seanad Éireann will pass this motion will indicate to the British Government the strongly-held view of the democratic parties in Ireland that a serious miscarriage of justice has taken place in the three cases referred to in the motion.</P>
    <P>The British Government will also know that the passage of this motion can in no way be seen as supportive of the bomb incidents in 1974 in Birmingham, Guildford and Woolwich.  Everyone in this House utterly condemns those horrific, mindless bombings and all of the bombings which took place in Britain between mid-1974 and mid-1975 at the instigation of the IRA.  The understandable desire of the British authorities to convict those responsible for those bombings has, <i>inter alia</i>, led to the conviction of 17 innocent people.  These people, including the relatives of the late Guiseppi Conlon who died in prison in 1981, should have even at this stage the right to establish their innocence.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the details of the cases in the short time available. These are already well known.  In substance, the British authorities, in reacting to the large-scale IRA terrorism against innocent citizens in 1974, took shortcuts with the due process of law.  Confessions were beaten out of some of those convicted. Defective forensic tests were used as a basis for conviction in these and in others of the cases concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe that everyone who has studied <Col N="1404" /> the cases in Britain and in Ireland now believes that the 17 people concerned should not have been convicted.  That is a different matter, however, to saying that they will be given an opportunity to establish their innocence.  We are asking the British authorities to open a can of worms, in the words of one Member of the Westminster Parliament, and it will not be easy for them to do so.  It will not be easy either for the British Government or the British Judiciary to admit miscarriages of justice on this scale and at such great cost to the lives of those convicted.</P>
    <P>Because I was aware of this dilemma facing the British authorities, when I met the Home Secretary in London on 16 October last with Deputy Andrews and Deputy Durkan, I specifically asked him whether he, as Home Secretary, would be prepared to send the cases to the Court of Appeal if he was personally convinced this was the just thing to do in the light of his examination of the new evidence and the arguments put to him.  He said at that meeting that the criteria he would use in deciding whether to refer the cases to the Court of Appeal would be whether there was new evidence and whether that evidence was significant.  If these criteria were met, the Home Secretary said he would be prepared to refer the cases back.  We took the Home Secretary at his word on that occasion and we have had no reason to doubt what he said in the period since then.  We must hope that our trust in this regard has not been misplaced.</P>
    <P>I believe the case for referral back for all three cases is overwhelming.  That belief is shared by this Parliament, the European Parliament and, in the Maguire case, by 288 Members of the Westminster Parliament.  In relation to that early day motion, which is on the agenda in the Westminster Parliament, I think it is appropriate to say that Lord Fitt has played a major and significant role in that because he was personally friendly with Guiseppi Conlon in particular and that motion in the Westminster Parliament, I would add, is in the name of parliamentarians of all persuasions.  This <Col N="1405" /> belief in the innocence of the 17 people concerned is shared also by those independent commentators in Britain who have looked into the cases, and by the British legal representatives of those convicted. The Birmingham Six case in particular has been under review now in the Home Office for a considerable time. I accept that the publication of Chris Mullen's book and the recent statement by the former British police officer, Mr. Clarke, have justifiably caused further delays in the Home Secretary's progress towards arriving at a decision, but the fact is that in this case alone six innocent men have served 12 years in jail.  There should be no further delay in reaching a decision in their case.  I welcome indications in today's newspapers that the Home Secretary will make a decision on this case over Christmas.  I trust that newspaper report is accurate because I think there cannot be any justification for any further delay.</P>
    <P>Throughout this campaign on the part of the all-party group in the Oireachtas, and also I think I can say on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs throughout the period in which he has been active in pursuing these cases, we have never sought to make this an international issue &mdash;that is, an issue between two countries. We have been very careful indeed to say that we believe this is a matter to do with the administration of British justice and that the esteem in which British justice is held in the world can only be damaged by a failure to offer redress to these people.  We have pursued the issue on that basis and we made no attempt to turn it into an Irish-British issue.  I think we have been right in that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it would be difficult to see how an Irish Government in December of next year could give effect to extradition procedures if these three cases are not satisfactorily dealt with by then.  The delaying mechanism &mdash; and I do not want to get into the area of the Extradition Bill at all &mdash; which the Government have instituted and put into that Bill is of significance not just in relation to matters such as the Diplock courts but is of significance in relation to <Col N="1406" /> these three cases only.  I hope and I trust the two matters may not need to be intertwined at all in the future and that the British Home Secretary will take action at an early date to give the 17 people concerned an opportunity to establish their innocence in law.  That is what they want; they do not want a pardon or anything else.  They want to be able to establish their innocence in a court of law and-I hope the Home Secretary will use his powers under the 1968 Court of Appeal Act to give them that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining with Senator Flor O'Mahony in seconding this motion, first of all, I would like to acknowledge the fact that he has said that under no circumstances do any of the proposers, seconders or supporters of the motion, condone any of the acts which were perpetrated against innocent people in Great Britain.  The acts which were perpetrated were of a horrific nature and because of that fact there seemed to be an inordinate effort made by the authorities in England to bring somebody before the courts and, unfortunately, in bringing these people before the courts, there was a miscarriage of justice on an enormous scale.  I would like to compliment Senator Flor O'Mahony, Deputy David Andrews, Deputy Niall Durkan, and in Europe Deputy Niall Andrews, for the amount of work they have put in their attempts to get matters of justice again brought before the English courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been in the past a suggestion that the English courts were courts of first jurisdiction, that these were the courts that established law right throughout the civilised world.  Unfortunately, in the cases before us it has been without doubt established that they did not go through the proper procedures and that in the case of the people who were as a result of improper procedures brought before the court and convicted, the British Court system has fallen down.  I fear that Lord Denning, in a justification for not allowing an appeal in the Birmingham Six case, put the case for the British Government, in the sense that he said &mdash; I am paraphrasing what he said I hope correctly&mdash;<Col N="1407" /> if there is a case for an appeal in this instance, the whole of the British judicial system falls down.  If the British police, the prison officers and the judge involved made a mistake in this case, the whole system of justice in Britain has fallen down.  I fear that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>I have not seen anywhere such a disregard for evidence as there has been in the case particularly of the Birmingham Six, but also in the case of the Guildford Four and the Maguire case.  The convictions involved have shown basic flaws of justice.  There was no evidence at all in law which could have convicted the Birmingham Six.  The British Government have attempted at all times to justify the convictions but they have not been able to produce evidence which would stand up in a court of justice here. I suggest that were it not for the total abhorrence of the people of Britain of what happened in Birmingham there was no way these people could ever have been convicted.</P>
    <P>The Channel Four programmes suggested this.  What is beyond reasonable doubt is that these people should not have been convicted.  We would ask Sir Geoffrey Howe who has a good record in international affairs and in attempting to have violations of civil rights adjusted in countries such as South Africa, and also Timothy Routin, his Junior Minister in the Foreign Office, to bring forward the miscarriage of justice that has been perpetrated on each individual involved in all the cases mentioned in the motion. The British people have not begun to realise that there has been a major miscarriage of justice even though they are still abhorred by the violence that was perpetrated on innocent people in the incidents in Birmingham and Guildford.</P>
    <P>Sir Geoffrey Howe spoke of the need in the European Community to recognise the virtues of justice, democracy and honesty.  In these instances there was no semblance of justice, democracy or honesty. The veracity of the confessions has to be queried.  Senator O'Mahony mentioned the confessions that were taken from the Birmingham Six particularly. <Col N="1408" /> It has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that these confessions were taken from these people as a result of continuing harassment in a physical sense. The forensic evidence would show that these people were beaten up consistently in police custody.  Not alone that but they were beaten up again when they were brought to the jail where the prison officers have acknowledged beating them up.  A most amazing situation arose where not alone was there forensic evidence but there was pictoral evidence of the prisoners being beaten.  When certain prison officers were brought before the courts in Britain they were exonerated from all blame.  The evidence was there. The prisoners had been beaten up in two places.  They were beaten up in the Brimingham police barracks and they were beaten up in the prison as well.</P>
    <P>British justice would suggest that if you beat a confession out of somebody that confession should not stand up.  All we ask is that in honesty and in justice the statements made by people who were physically abused consistently for a long time should be overruled and the cases reopened.  I agree with the suggestions made by Senator O'Mahony that these people are not looking for a Queen's pardon; they are not looking for a declaration of innocence.  They are looking for a re-trial and in that re-trial they can prove their innocence.  It is now being suggested by the British Foreign Office that possibly at Christmas a Queen's pardon might be given to these people and there are indications that this might happen.  The people involved in these cases do not want a Queen's pardon; they want their innocence proved by the courts and not by the Queen.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of Kilkenny Corporation unanimous decision was made that the motion we have here should be pursued at the highest level.  I know the Minister has been pursuing this.  All we can do here today is to ensure that we give a little more strength to what the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister has been doing in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine <Col N="1409" /> Gael Party it gives me great pleasure to support this motion which is proposed by Senator Flor O'Mahony and seconded by Senator Lanigan.  We are not talking merely about an injustice perpetrated against the 17 defendants who have been affected by the decisions in these three cases: we are talking about an injustice which is being perpetrated against the civilisation that all of us hold dear. We live in the western world and one thing that is vital to our civilisation is the rule of common law and its proper enforcement.  In this country we have the same system of administration of justice as exists in the adjoining island.  That circumstances have arisen in relation to the making of decisions in these three cases which bring that system of justice into disrepute reflects not merely on the British legal system but I submit on the legal systems in this and all other common law jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>We have to look at this in the light of the way the law is administered in civil law jurisdictions on the Continent and indeed in the light of the way law is maladministered in certain jurisdictions about which we frequently express concern in this House.  I speak about South Africa and various South American countries, about Iran and the Philippines. If we have any right in the common law jurisdictions to express concern about what is happening in other places I think it is only right that we in this Chamber and this House express serious concern about what has happened in these three cases.</P>
      <P>It may be no harm to reflect very briefly on the three cases.  In relation to the Birmingham Six that is a case which deals with perhaps the biggest mass murder in British history.  On 22 November 1974 bombs exploded in two Birmingham pubs killing 21 people and injuring 160.  That marked the climax of an IRA campaign of terror and that was perhaps relevant in relation to the ultimate adjudication of the matters which came before a British court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the adjudication on the issues in question it may be no harm to refer to an article by Chris Mullin in <Col N="1410" /><i>The New Statesman</i> on 1 November 1985 when he said:</P>
    <P>The case against the six men consisted of four confessions; positive forensic tests that showed that Hill, Power and possibly Walker had recently handled explosives; and a good deal of circumstantial evidence.  They had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and they knew a lot of the wrong people.</P>
    <P>To convict on that basis is unsatisfactory. That is certainly a case in respect of which a review is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>More frightening is the case of the Guildford Four which also occurred in 1974 when four young people, three of them Irish, were convicted of bombings carried out in Guilford and Woolwich. Those convictions were obtained on the basis of confessions extracted while those defendants were in police custody although all of the confessions were later retracted in the course of the hearing. Subsequently an IRA active service unit arrested for another matter admitted to the offences in question and were able to give very detailed evidence which indicated that in all probability they were involved.  The subsequent television documentary which we saw earlier this year certainly casts many doubts on that whole matter and raises without &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; the need for a review of the case.</P>
    <P>Perhaps most tragic is the Maguire case, which was highlighted in an RTE documentary earlier this year.  That was the case which affected seven defendants, one of whom has since died.  In this case the convictions were recorded not on the basis of confessions.  All the defendants protested their innocence at all times. The basis for the convictions in this case was scientific evidence.  The basis upon which it was obtained was subsequently put in doubt by the person who established the test which was used.  It is only right that we in this House should give support to the calls made by Members of the House of Commons and of the House of Lords, by members of the Churches and other various interested groups, that all three cases deserve to be reviewed <Col N="1411" /> because of the very unsatisfactory nature in which the judgments were actually obtained.</P>
    <P>There are other cases of people who have been dealt with under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain, and who have been detained for amazing lengths of time, who have been tried on the basis of evidence which did not convict them and, indeed which on a summary glance initially could not have indicated that they would be subsequently implicated.  Yet these people have been detained for amazing periods of time in British prisons.  I refer to one such person who comes from my own constituency&mdash; that is the case of Joseph Calvey, who was detained for 17 months, three of those months as a special category &ldquo;A&rdquo; prisoner.  During that time he was not even allowed to attend Mass while in a British prison.  He was subsequently acquitted with other persons involved. He was acquitted, not on the basis of any legal technicalities, but on the basis that there was simply no case against him.  All of these matters are damaging to justice. All of these things are damaging to the public perception of justice.  All of these things are damaging to the rule of law.</P>
    <P>The British Government have certain options available to them.  They have the option that they do nothing and hope that this situation will pass away.  To allow that line of argument to be pursued will do nothing other than damage the administration of justice in Britain and, indeed, damage the relationship existing between these two countries.  The other option available to the British Government is an open ended option which allows these matters to be reviewed, whether by the court of appeal or otherwise.  I do not want to be too specific as to the manner of review which can be adopted by the British Government.  I believe that if the British Government take steps to ensure that these cases are reviewed, they will be doing a lot of good for the regard which the common law and the administration of justice in Britain have in the world at large.  It is only right, therefore, that we in this House should express our <Col N="1412" /> misgivings about the basis upon which the convictions were recorded in these cases and express the hope that the British Government will take steps to ensure that they are reviewed and thereby restore British justice, and the regard which it has had up to now in the world, to its former state.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with Senator O'Mahony in paying tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our embassy staff in London for the interest which they have taken in these matters and particularly their developing interest in the last 12 months.  My understanding was, certainly at the end of 1985, that the Department of Foreign Affairs merely interested themselves in consular matters for Irish citizens detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  It would appear now that the interest of the Department goes beyond that.  I would like to see the interests of the Department going beyond that.</P>
    <P>There were many other issues which have been highlighted by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and issues which have been highlighted by other interested bodies which affect prisoners, issues such as the basis upon which bail is granted, issues such as the length of time which may pass as between the moment of initial detention and ultimate trial.  These are things which should be within the scope of the Department of Foreign Affairs and with which the Department should concern themselves, even though they are matters which are internal to the administration of justice in another jurisdiction.  They are matters which, if they do not operate on a satisfactory basis, can have detrimental effects so far as Irish and other persons detained under this legislation are concerned. I am pleased to be associated with this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Group, I should like also to give full and unequivocal support to this motion before the House.  I would like to congratulate those who have been conducting this campaign in a very temperate and civilised way.  I also give full support <Col N="1413" /> to give the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government for the approach which they have taken towards this campaign. This issue is an extraordinarily delicate one and a very difficult one to approach. It is not easy for one to champion the cause of Irish people in Britain without causing great hostility and acrimony between the two Governments.  The approach which has been taken here today, an all-party approach, and the approach which has been taken by pioneers of this cause in the past should be applauded.  I would also like to pay tribute to those who initially took up this cause because it has been a long time coming.  I was as guilty as anybody else of not paying very much attention to the cause in particular of the Birmingham issue until I was confronted with these rather uncomfortable facts which made one face up to the fact that there is a great and enormous element of doubt in this case, which justifies a review of it.</P>
      <P>The two particular issues on which the Birmingham Six were convicted were the issue of forensic evidence and the issue of the confessions.  There is no doubt now that both those two pillars of convictions are discredited.  There is no doubt &mdash; and nobody disputes this &mdash; that those confessions were exacted under appalling and violent conditions.  There is no doubt that the forensic evidence now has been cast with doubt.  We should understand the reason all these cases have arisen. There is an enormous temptation, when atrocities such as the Birmingham bombings occur, first of all to seize the most primary suspects or to find suspects and, secondly, to rush the judgment and conviction. While this is very easy to criticise, it is a very natural reaction on the part of any police force in the world and the public.  So horrific were the crimes committed in these cases that there is a need on the part of the forces of law and order to satisfy a feeling among the population of the necessity to get convictions as soon as possible.  While that is a fault, it is something we should understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say here that, while these three cases give enormous cause for concern, they should not be treated, and <Col N="1414" /> have not been treated, as a political weapon for attacking the whole system of British justice.  These are special cases. They are political cases in a sense.  They are most unpleasant cases, but they should not be used as a stick with which to beat British justice.  I do not think they have been so used.  I repeat again that the whole issue has been treated extremely responsibly by those who have been conducting this campaign, especially in the Seanad and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>While it will be very difficult for the British Government to admit that a mistake has been made in all three cases, or in one case, because it is an admission that there is something very wrong with the whole system of justice in Britain.  It might be helpful if we were to acknowledge that circumstances have changed in the last 12 years and that the conviction of the Birmingham Six at the time seemed far more reasonable then than it does now and that evidence has come to light since which justifies their release.  At the time there was not such an outcry against the decision because the conviction seemed more reasonable.  It is worth pointing out that this review for which we are calling does not just have all-party support here.  It has all-party support in Great Britain.  This issue is causing a great deal of concern over there.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems with a crime of this sort is that it tends to provoke anti-Irish feeling in Great Britain &mdash; in Birmingham, in Guildford, in London &mdash; when it happens.  It is a very natural feeling on the part of the population there. As a result it is easier for them to reach convictions.  For this one has to blame the campaign of the Provisional IRA. The result of placing bombs in Birmingham or anywhere else is that people in Great Britain believe it is done in your name and in my name and in the name of the people of Ireland, which it is not. They tend, as a result, to feel a great backlash against any Irish people in Birmingham, London or wherever the crime is committed.  It is a natural feeling, but it is wrong.  It is a feeling which we must fight against and which they must fight against.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Finally, I do not in any way feel that it is right that this should be linked to extradition.  I am an absolutely unapologetic supporter of extradition.  I do not find that inconsistent in any way with being able to support a review of the cases of the Birmingham bombers, the Guildford bombers and Annie Maguire. At the time of the Birmingham bombers' case, which is the only one I know about in detail, the conviction was reasonable at that time.  Now there is obviously a case for a retrial and their innocence is very likely.  I do not believe that this should be linked to extradition.</P>
    <P>I would like to sum up by saying once again that the moderate, temperate and extremely diplomatic way in which this has been treated is something of which all those involved should be extremely proud.  I congratulate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>The horrific bombings of 1974 in Britain outraged public opinion in Britain and, indeed, in Ireland.  Of course, it resulted in a wave of anti-Irish emotion in Britain, to which Senator Ross has just referred.  It caused great distress to hundreds of thousands of emigrants and their families in Britain.  It also had the effect of bringing about the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was rushed through the British Parliament by the then Home Secretary, Mr. Roy Jenkins, and which has also caused great distress to many innocent people travelling between here and Britain since then.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ross has said, the particular effects of these atrocities were forseen by those who perpetrated the atrocities.  Indeed, they have said so in the case of one of the more recent atrocities when they tried to blow up members of the British Cabinet.  They recognised that there would be severe repression of Irish people as a result. What they did not add is that they hoped there would be severe repression, because the grievances which would follow would certainly enhance their chances of recruiting more people to their campaign of terror.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the bombings in Britain <Col N="1416" /> there was a public clamour and severe pressure on the police force for results in their investigation of these atrocities.  It is against that background of public revulsion and outrage that the convictions of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family were obtained. New evidence has come to light which indicates to all reasonable people that a monumental miscarriage of justice has occurred and that the emotional reaction, however understandable and however natural, of the British public led to the wrongful imprisonment of innocent Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, understandable that ordinary British people should react emotionally in face of the type of murderous activity which was perpetrated at that time.  That does not mean, nor should it be countenanced in any circumstances, that those who are charged with carrying out and protecting the rule of law should themselves be guilty of breaking the law.  The new evidence which has emerged in the course of the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme of October 1985, indicated quite clearly that contrary to what was claimed by 20 police officers at the time of the trial, those convicted were subjected to severe beatings and to brutality by the police.  In other words, the confessions of guilt were forced out of those prisoners by policemen who were themselves breaking the law, clearly taking the view that the end justifies the means and the end in this case was to obtain convictions at whatever cost.</P>
    <P>The cost, regrettably, to innocent people &mdash; which now seems clearly to be the case &mdash; has been to date, 12 years in jail for the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, and also a number of years in jail for the Maguire family.  The blow to British prestige and to British pride in their own system of justice is, of course, also quite devastating.</P>
    <P>The second and the crucial new factor to emerge since the trial has been the total discrediting of the forensic evidence. When one considers that the convictions rested solely on the basis of confessions obtained by brutality and on <Col N="1417" /> forensic evidence which has now been totally discredited, it is difficult to understand why the British Home Secretary has not yet moved as a matter of urgency since the first &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme was seen a year ago.  He has not moved as a matter of urgency at this stage to have the cases re-opened.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the Crown Prosecutor, Sir Michael Havers, stated in 1975, at the time of the Guildford Four trail:</P>
    <P>Accusations of the most appalling kind have been made against the police during this trial...</P>
    <P>He went on to state:</P>
    <P>If the allegations are true there has been a most appalling perversion of justice.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly it is the embarrassment, and indeed the shame, which would be brought on the Establishment by the now likely findings of a court of appeal or a retrial, that such an appalling perversion of justice has indeed taken place, which has probably caused the Home Secretary to hesitate, despite the growing pressure from a wide spectrum of responsible opinion to have these cases reopened.</P>
    <P>In his excellent work <i>Trial and Error</i> Robert Kee examines the convictions of the 11 people after the Guildford bombings. I quote from the end of his book:</P>
    <P>It is time to recall the ancient precept <i>fiat justitia et ruant coeli</i>&mdash; let justice be done though the heavens fall.</P>
    <P>That quote is very apt because, regardless of the consequences for those responsible for such a miscarriage of justice, even at this late stage, those who have been the innocent victims are entitled to justice. No consideration of consequences, however embarrassing or however shameful, must be allowed to stand in the way of that justice.</P>
    <P>Grave concern has been expressed by all parties in this House today and by many people in this country and in Britain, particularly in the last year, about the likely miscarriage of justice in these convictions.  There is also widespread concern on the part of British <Col N="1418" /> parliamentarians.  It is not confined to Ireland.  It is not confined to one party in Britain, as has already been stated here. Concern has been expressed by scientists, including the man who devised the forensic test which was used to convict these people.  That scientist admits that the testing procedure was unreliable and has stated that the test used was intended only for screening purposes and would have required further confirming tests in order to be certain.  On that basis, the scientist who was responsible for the test used is concerned about the conviction.</P>
    <P>Many responsible observers have also expressed their concern about the hasty manner in which the convictions of the Birminghan and Guildford accused were pursued.  After the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme in October 1985, Mr. Roy Jenkins, who was the Home Secretary responsible for rushing the Prevention of Terrorism Act through Parliament after the bombings, agreed that serious questions had been raised.  That is over a year ago and Sir John Farr, a British Conservative MP, called for a new trial and stated that it is doubtful if they have got the guilty men inside.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to all the people who have pursued the campaign to have these trials reopened.  It is understandable that so many political figures on the Irish side should be concerned &mdash; and I would also like to pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his staff and all those who have been pursuing it, politicians of all parties including particularly the Andrews brothers for the work they have done.  It is a case of protecting the rights of Irish people to a fair and just trial.  It is something that concerns us very deeply and very gravely.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to those people in Britain also who have done so much, particularly the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; team and people like Robert Kee, to bring the facts to light.  I am not suggesting that they were not also motivated by the need to get justice for the 17 people concerned. They would have been motivated also by their own sense of pride in their own judicial system and their revulsion and horror at the idea that such a miscarriage <Col N="1419" /> of justice could happen within their own judicial system.  It is very much in the interest of the whole British system of justice that these cases should be reviewed as a matter of urgency and that justice should be done and seen to be done.  The all-party approach and the position taken here that it is not something from which parties want to draw political advantage for themselves is helpful.  The important thing it to try to impress on those who have the power to act, the unanimous and serious concern of this House.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying &mdash; and I do not want to get into the Extradition Bill which was passed last night in the Dáil, I will reserve what I want to say on that for another time, next month &mdash; is that unless these cases are dealt with satisfactorily and as a matter of urgency I could not, as an Irish citizen, envisage any Irish Parliament &mdash; and I disagree with Senator Ross on this &mdash; in 12 months time, if these cases are still unresolved and a review has not been held, agreeing to enact the extradition arrangements. The new evidence is so strong and the facts that have emerged are so serious that further delay in granting a review of these cases is not only difficult to understand but intolerable.  I hope that very soon &mdash; as was reported in a British newspaper yesterday, hopefully correctly &mdash; that not just one of these cases as speculation had it, but all of them will be reviewed and that the people concerned who have already served 12 years in jail, clearly wrongly in my view, will have recourse to a review in order to establish their innocence.  Certainly any question of a Queen's pardon I would dismiss without hesitation as would the people concerned. They do not want a pardon, they want a review.  They want to have their innocence vindicated before the world.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this has been discussed in the Seanad and that there has been an all-party approach.  I commend all those who have contributed to bringing this to public attention, particularly <Col N="1420" /> the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme, which has made the biggest contribution of all by drawing widespread public attention to the cases.  I ask the Minister and the Government to continue with their efforts to have the matter resolved as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could begin by expressing my appreciation of the remarks made by Senators who contributed and expressed their thanks and support for the efforts made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials in this matter.  It is unusual to do so.  A number of officials have been extraordinarily committed in this whole exercise.  Our ambassador in London, Mr. Noel Dorr, Mr. O'Hanrahan and Breffni O'Reilly have shown themselves utterly committed to these cases.  It is a mark of their absolute commitment that some of the prisoners have gone to the extent of writing to the media to express their appreciation of the degree of interest that has been taken by these officials.  I appreciate that the Senators have gone out of their way to express appreciation of the role played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials.  I appreciate that, and in return will offer a bouquet and say that it is a source of considerable pleasure to me that I am replying to an all-party motion in Seanad Éireann.  It is also a source of pleasure to me that this whole issue, for quite some time now, has been seen as an all-Party issue.  It has not been a subject from which people have sought to make political capital.  It is an issue on which parties have sought to achieve common ground.  Those Members of both Houses who have gone out of their way to do that are entitled to our praise and to all our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is invidious to mention individuals, but one thinks of Deputy David Andrews in the other House and of Senator Flor O'Mahony in this House, and other Members of the Houses, Deputies Bernard Durkan, Mary Harney, Liam Skelly and Senator Smith &mdash; that does not purport to be a comprehensive list &mdash;<Col N="1421" /> who have sunk party differences to come together to raise this issue.  That course of action is greatly appreciated.  I have no doubt that at times they must have been a little frustrated because given that they were acting in an all-party manner it was in a sense less newsworthy than if they were all hitting each other over the head.  I have no doubt that they must at times have been irritated when some people who were less involved in that all-party approach decided to wander into the issue and found it easier to seize the attention of the media.</P>
    <P>I will be brief.  I hope nobody will think that reflects any lack of seriousness on my part or on the Government's part on this issue.  I have spoken at some length in this House before on the subject and in the other House and to the media.  As Senators will be aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has addressed himself in public on many occasions to this issue. On some of those occasions, when I have been in this House I have gone through the facts of these cases and indicated the reasons that give rise to concern and doubts about the forensic evidence, the doubts about the admissibility of the statements and, perhaps, most spectacularly in the Birmingham Six case when the only question was at what stage were the defendants subjected to ill-treatment &mdash; before or after their confessions. I do not want to go over all that ground again, only because it has been the subject of debate here and it is not to be taken as any lack of seriousness whatsoever on my part or on the Government's part.</P>
    <P>Coming to the substance of the motion, let me say on behalf of the Government that I am pleased to be able to support this all-party motion regarding the 17 people whose convictions, to say the least, have given rise to considerable doubts.  These people were all convicted at a time when the atmosphere in Britain could best be described as highly charged. One has to pause and say that those who contributed to that highly charged atmosphere must carry a sizeable part of the blame for the situation in which we now <Col N="1422" /> find ourselves.  That was a point which was made by Senator Ross and Senator Brid Rogers, and it is perhaps most poignantly made in the foreword to <i>Error of Judgement</i> by Chris Mullen on the dedication page where he dedicates his really splendid book and let me quote: &ldquo;To Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard McIllkenny, Billy Power, Johnny Walker and their families and to all the other victims of the Birmingham pub bombings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given that those convictions took place at a highly charged time, it is only, fair that they should now be given the opportunity to establish their innocence. I want to make it clear, and it was generously acknowledged by Senators, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a personal interest in all of these cases and has been urging Mr. Douglas Hurd, the British Home Secretary, for quite some time to have the cases reopened.  In addition the Irish Embassy in London has maintained contact with the prisoners and embassy officials have gone to visit and have taken up their grievances with the Home Office.</P>
    <P>My information to date is that all three cases are currently under review in the Home Office.  Only last week Mr. Hurd wrote to the Minister saying that he hoped to be able to reach a decision shortly in the Birmingham Six case and went on to indicate his determination to ensure that the further material that has recently become available would not lead of further delay.  He also went on to add that he hoped to reach a decision in the other two cases before long.</P>
    <P>I pause to express what I hope will not be thought of as an exercise in semantics or anything of that sort; I want to express one <i>caveat</i> about the theme running through Senators' contributions. I am reminded to do so particularly by Senator Lanigan's contribution and it refers to his reference to the fact that &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; they &mdash; and he probably meant all 17 &mdash; should not have been convicted.  Later in his contribution he said they should now be given a chance to prove their innocence, and in my reply I have spoken of their <Col N="1423" /> opportunity to establish their innocence.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on record that there should be no question of their having to prove their innocence, nor should it be a case of it being a question of whether or not now &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; they should have not been convicted. The fact of the matter is that they should never have been convicted, not one of them should have been convicted unless &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; they were guilty.  I do not want to get into semantics but it is regarded as a &ldquo;golden thread&rdquo; of the English common law, as it is of our legal system, that no person should be convicted unless beyond reasonable doubt their guilt has been established.  It may be that a function of the highly charged atmosphere at that time was that that &ldquo;golden thread&rdquo; became somewhat frayed or under pressure. The question now is simply this, does a doubt exist about the validity of those convictions and if a doubt exists about the validity of those convictions then it is appropriate that they should again be considered by the Court of Appeal as is provided for by the 1968 appeals Act.  At that stage when considered by the Court of Appeal, the question will be, as it should always have been in respect of each individual, is their guilt to be established beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>I know some people are going to see that as being a rather semantic interaction but I think it is important to say it, lest in seeking to identify with the defendants one would contribute to increasing the size of the fence they have to overcome.  Not one of them is required to establish their innocence now, not one of them was required to establish their innocence 12 years ago, no more than any defendants should ever have to establish their innocence.  The onus then is on the prosecution, and the onus now is on the prosecution to establish that the convictions were safe and can be relied upon. I indicated I am very pleased that this was an all-party contribution.  I indicated, too, that I think the Seanad should be particularly grateful to the role played by Senator Flor O'Mahony who in this <Col N="1424" /> House, with Deputy David Andrews in the other House, has perhaps taken a lead in these matters.  I pause to disagree with Senator O'Mahony only for one moment and that was when he referred to the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986, soon to come before this House in this regard.  Let me say to him that the extradition Bill should be considered on its merits.  The whole approach to these cases by the Minister, by the Department and to date by the all-party committee who have interested themselves in this matter had been that these convictions are a question for British justice to resolve, that we are rightly concerned and so we have sought to persuade the British authorities that they should act.  I think that is the key word, that we should seek to persuade the British authorities to act and any attempt to establish a linkage would be quite improper.  I have to say that any attempt to establish a linkage might not be in the interests of the people who are now behind bars.</P>
    <P>It is proper that the Seanad should turn its attention to the question of the safety of these convictions, as it had done in the past, and I hope will now express a view on it unanimously.  Later today the Seanad will have an opportunity to consider the merits of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986.  That stands alone and should be considered alone and it is not helpful to link the two.</P>
    <P>In any event I have told the Seanad that all three of these cases are now under review in the Home Office.  I have told of the information from Mr. Hurd within the last week when he indicated that he would be reaching a decision shortly in the Birmingham Six case and the fact that the additional evidence that has become available through the most recent television programme will not delay that decision.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying I remain confident that there will be a positive outcome in all of these cases.  I believe <Col N="1425" /> that this motion, with its all-party support, will be of assistance to the individuals concerned by marshalling further support for their cause from the public here and in Britain.</P>

    <Title>Limerick Gas Order: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following order in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Limerick Gas Order, 1986 pursuant to section 10 of the 1920 Gas Regulation Act</P>
      <P>Copies of which Order, in draft, were laid before the House on 17 December 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this order is to establish the new Limerick Gas Company as a gas undertaking with authority to maintain, continue and expand the existing Limerick city gas network and to distribute natural gas within the limits of supply as defined in the order &mdash; the greater Limerick city area.</P>
      <P>Currently Limerick Corporation is the gas undertaking in the city and the order provides the vehicle by which the assets of the Limerick Corporation gas division are transferred to the new company.</P>
      <P>The Gas Regulation Acts 1920 to 1982 provide for the making of regulations, orders etc., to oversee the gas industry. The 1920 Act in particular provides for special orders to be made to enable new gas utilities to be constituted.  These orders must be laid in draft before both Houses and their approval given before they are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new company will be owned jointly by Bord Gáis Éireann and Limerick Corporation with shares of 70 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.  The establishment of the new Limerick Gas Company is the last stage of a process which I set in motion in October 1985 when I gave approval to BGE to construct <Col N="1426" /> a natural gas pipeline to the famous city of Limerick.</P>
    <P>That project has been one of the major engineering works undertaken in this country in recent years and in gas pipeline terms ranks second only to the Cork-Dublin pipeline.  The Limerick project involved the laying of approximately 90 kilometres of steel pipe during the late summer of this year from the main Cork-Dublin line into the city.  <i>En route</i>, the dairy co-operatives at Mitchelstown, Rath Luirc and Mallow are also receiving a supply.</P>
    <P>The total approved cost of the project was £15.6 million which is divided into three phases approximately as follows: Limerick cross-country pipeline &mdash; £13.3 million; Limerick city pipeline &mdash; £1.9 million; Limerick cross-city feeder &mdash; £0.4 million.</P>
    <P>The major portion of this work is now almost complete and is both on time and within budget.  During the construction phase it is estimated that up to 500 people have been employed.  Considerable amounts of Irish goods and services are being used and represent as much as 70 per cent of the expenditure on the entire project.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that natural gas has now reached Limerick and is already being supplied to industry on the outskirts of the city.  The approval of this order will clear the way for the more widespread distribution of natural gas to customers in the Limerick city area.</P>
    <P>It is within the Limerick gas utility area that the long term benefits will occur. The refurbishment of the pipe network within the city is due to commence shortly and will cost approximately £10 million. Employment in the gas industry during this phase could be up to 70 people in addition to those employed in the gas company itself.</P>
    <P>The advent of natural gas to Limerick will ensure the survival and the potential for growth of its gas industry, which could not otherwise survive.</P>
    <P>Domestic, industrial and commercial gas users alike will have access to a high quality, clean, indigenous and versatile fuel at competitive prices.  Consumer <Col N="1427" /> choice in a more competitive market will be assured.</P>
    <P>I recommend this motion to the House and I thank the Members for facilitating the taking of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say except that we are in favour of this motion.  As one who comes from the Limerick area, I welcome natural gas to Limerick and places like Mitchelstown, Knocklong and other places, but we in Tipperary are a bit disappointed that so far Tipperary town has not been included.  The pipeline at the nearest point to Tipperary town would not be further than 12 miles away.  Knocklong is only 12 miles from Tipperary town.  I urge the Minister to take Tipperary town into consideration because we have a very big creamery.  It might not be as big as Mitchelstown but it is as good as Mitchelstown Creamery and other co-operatives. We also have a number of industries there.  We are fortunate that we are one of the towns that has not been hit as much by the recession as other towns.  We have a few good industries in Tipperary town and a natural gas supply would be a surer way of keeping those industries in the town.  I would like if the Minister would take that into account.  I welcome the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Limerick Gas Order.  I am particularly pleased to welcome the order because I was mayor of Limerick last year and on the perhaps historic occasion in December 1985 I officially signed on behalf of Limerick Corporation the natural gas contract between Limerick Corporation, the county borough corporation involved in the town gas industry for almost 150 years, and Bord Gáis Éireann, the State gas development agency which was set up by the Government in 1976 and whose function it is to buy, sell, transmit and distribute natural gas in Ireland.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all concerned and associated with the successful outcome of the negotiations to bring natural gas to Limerick <Col N="1428" /> and its environs.  I would like to pay tribute to successive members of Limerick City Council who have sent numerous delegations to various Ministers for Energy.  I would like to congratulate the Limerick gas committee, particularly the late city manager, Tomás Mac Diarmada and the present city manager, Thomas Rice as well as officials of Limerick Corporation and Limerick Gas Company, for the great dedication and commitment they have shown over the years to the development and successful conclusion of this project.</P>
      <P>I also express my thanks to the officials of BGE and the Department of Energy for their concern over the years.  I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, Minister for Energy for the special interest which he has taken in this project.  We feel in Limerick that he is one of our own.  I would like to congratulate him for his outstanding effort and work in this regard.  I would also like to congratulate the former Minister of State at the Department of Energy, Deputy Eddie Collins, for the interest he took in the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to recall that it was in 1978 at a chamber of commerce function in Limerick that I pointed out to the then Taoiseach Mr. Jack Lynch the importance of piping natural gas to areas such as Limerick as part of a national policy of providing this country with a national grid on lines similar to those in other European countries.  On 23 January 1985 I raised the question of piping natural gas to Limerick and the mid-west region and I urged the Minister to give the green light to the provision of natural gas for Limerick and to authorise BGE to proceed with the extension of the transmission pipeline to Limerick.  The Minister in reply on that occasion, assured the Seanad that work would be underway in 1985 and I am glad he has kept to the precise terms of his word on that occasion.  I congratulate him on his work.  The contract was signed in December 1985.  I would like also to take the opportunity to congratulate BGE and the pipeline contractors for their <Col N="1429" /> expeditious and excellent handling of the project since the contract was signed. I would like to congratulate everybody associated with that.  They are doing excellent, clean work and they are a credit to BGE and to the contractors involved.</P>
    <P>This contract provides for the incorporation of a new company to be named the Limerick Gas Company Limited, 70 per cent of the equity shareholding being held by BGE and 30 per cent by Limerick Corporation.  This represents a unique partnership and co-operation between a county borough corporation and a semi-State body, for its share in the equity of the new company Limerick Corporation will transfer the goodwill and assets of its gas division to the new company and this transfer would be subject to the payment to Limerick Corporation of £2.6 million as consideration to be used to clear the accumulated debts.  It is important to stress here, as a result of this partnership that all categories of staff, pension payments and so on will be protected.</P>
    <P>I think the culmination of all this work can be seen from the fact that over the past ten years in the period for instance between 1973 and 1983 the purchase price of naphtha which was the basic feed stock used by Limerick Gas Company in the manufacture of its gas rose by from £14 per tonne in 1973 to £320 per tonne in 1983.  This represented an astonishing, unparalleled increase of 2,200 per cent in a short period of ten years.  Indeed it is true to say that on many occasions Limerick Gas Company and Limerick Corporation were faced with the dreadful prospect of the imminent closure of the gasworks, but we persevered and I am glad that the Department of Energy and successive Ministers for Energy also perserved. We commissioned an independent study on the feasibility of supplying Limerick with natural gas and the gas consultants made a clear recommendation that the most appropriate vehicle for the transmission and provision of natural gas to Limerick was the setting up of a separate independent company free from the constraints of the local authority system.  I see, therefore, in the <Col N="1430" /> making of this order today as the culmination of this great work.  I join with the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, in wishing the new company every success in its endeavours and congratulate all associated with the project.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Senators in welcoming the establishment of the Limerick Gas Company Limited and the culmination of the project which was speedily implemented under the control of this Government and under the control of the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring.  I would like to congratulate all those who are associated with this venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair to say, however, that the congratulations with regard to the manner of its presentation and the timing of its presentation, cannot be quite as fulsome.  It seems extraordinary that this House should at the last minute be confronted with what in reality is a very substantial piece of legislation and asked to express a view on it, which view can only be inadequately formed and inadequately researched.  I remember in the past bringing to the attention of the Tánaiste the complicated provisions which it was proposed would be entered into relative to Dublin Gas.  We had great faith that the Tánaiste would ensure that these provisions were in fact in accordance with the common good.  Nothing has happened since then to convince me that we should have done anything other than what we did relative to Dublin Gas.  It is fair to say that the circumstances of our approval of certain guarantees have given rise to some public controversy and that public controversy has been heightened by the fact that Members of the Oireachtas may have felt inadequately prepared and not committed completely because of the late notification they received with regard to those matters.  I rise therefore on this special order not because I disagree with what the Tánaiste is seeking to implement but to appeal to the Tánaiste and to anybody else who might hold that office in future and to this Government and any of its successors <Col N="1431" /> of whatever hue, not to continue to treat Parliament in such a way that special orders are laid before the House in matters of great importance like this with inadequate time available to the Members to examine the merits or demerits of the proposal.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned time and time again to Ministers, and not particularly to the Tánaiste, I know that Ministers examine these things very carefully, I know they satisfy themselves that everything is in order and I know that there is within his Department and indeed within other Departments a continual stream of proposals and counter proposals which ultimately result in proposals to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have no doubt that the Tánaiste is satisfied that this is in order, but that is not sufficient.  We must go one step further than that, and the Houses of the Oireachtas must also be satisfied.  If it takes the Minister's Department some months to arrive at their own policy on a matter, and if it takes it some months to get the exact formula right with regard to how to implement their policy, if it takes them some months to consult every other Department with regard to those matters and if there are amendments and counter amendments and if these matters are discussed by memoranda to the Cabinet and various amendments made that process is merely recognising the fact that the first draft of anything is not likely to be as good as the last one and that improvements are made and adjustments are made as it goes along.  Members of the Oireachtas are no better or no worse than Ministers, they are certainly no worse and we do not have the power to make up our minds any more quickly than Ministers. We need a bit of breathing space as well, and that is all.  It is reasonable for Members of the Oireachtas to get that breathing space.  I realise that the Houses are breaking up for the Christmas recess and that there might be a greater incentive to put it through the other House, because it might not come back for some time, but I appeal to the Minister not to place us in this embarrassing position <Col N="1432" /> again.  I am not going to put the matter any further than that.</P>
    <P>I have a number of individual questions to ask the Minister and I must say the questions I will ask will be pathetically inadequate because I have not had time to examine the matter.  I am aware of the basis of the Minister's Order &mdash; it is the Gas Regulation(s) Act, 1920 and it was passed by another parliament and section 10 of it empowers the Board of Trade to do almost everything.  I have no doubt that the Minister is the successor of the Board of Trade.  I have no problems with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no guarantees that the Supreme Court will acknowledge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not, nor indeed can we ever guarantee that, but one of the purposes of our exercise should be at least to limit the freedom of action of the Supreme Court, to narrow their possible areas of interpretation.  I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions. One relates to section 7 which states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Order shall release, discharge or suspend any action, suit, or other proceedings in a court of law which was pending by the Corporation...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does that cover suits and actions pending against the corporation relative to the supply of gas?  I know it must be read in context with the vesting of the property but almost everywhere there seems to be talk about protecting the rights of the gas company to take over what was previously the right of the corporation. Where in the order does it protect the right of the individual?  For example, if I have an action for negligence against the corporation, arising out of some defective work done in the gas area, is it intended that the new company would take over that?  If so, would the Minister like to tell me where that is provided for?  What is being done is that they are being given the benefit of all the actions which the council have but are <Col N="1433" /> not being expected to take any risk.  I am not talking about the ordinary trade debtors and creditors they have.  I am not concerned about that because I realise they are subject to a separate and distinct agreement.  Would the Minister tell us whether the £2.6 million is adequate to meet all the liabilities of the corporation and if there will be a surplus left for the corporation in that regard?</P>
    <P>In the definition section, reference is made to the Limerick Corporation Gas Acts and Orders, 1878 to 1950.  I could not see anywhere in the legal definitions anything which could be construed as being the Limerick Corporation Gas Acts and Orders, 1878 to 1950.  What are they? If you look up the Statutes, you do not see a Limerick Corporation Gas Act.  If you look up the most up to date list of the grouping together of Acts, it is not listed there.  I realise that they may have been private Acts.  I do not see, for instance, in 1950 anything which could be a Limerick Corporation Gas Act.  There is some kind of a local government Act which relates to Limerick but it is not a Limerick Corporation Gas Act.  This is important because in this order Article 16 repeals the Limerick Gas Act, and orders, 1878 to 1950, in so far as they relate to the corporation's responsibility to supply gas.  I have been unable to find out what they are.  The Minister might advise us in that regard.  I wish the new company prosperity.  I hope they continue to supply indigenous fuel for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very briefly to be associated with the expressions of welcome for this order and to congratulate the Minister on the very definite initiative taken and shown positively here in bringing gas to Limerick.  There are a few points I would like to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I perceive it from reading the Minister's speech, there are a number of particular co-operative societies mentioned &mdash; Golden Vale, Charleville, Ballyclough Co-operative Society and Mitchelstown Co-operative Society &mdash; as the main potential users of this gas.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify what provisions <Col N="1434" /> would exist for the enlargement of use of the gas to other operations in the industrial sphere.  I know there would be certain technical problems in that.  There are indications in the map as to the region involved.  The Minister for Energy and all persons associated with the bringing of gas to Limerick and with the establishment of the Limerick Gas Company are to be highly congratulated.  Since gas is such an efficient form of energy, it should be as widely available as possible. Perhaps the Minister will give clarification as to how the expanded use of the gas might be possible in the time ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the question of natural gas for Tipperary, a question which has been raised with me by Senator Ferris on many occasions.  The main difficulty in relation to the extension of the grid to any further towns is the question of whether there is the existence of gas mains, and which, unfortunately, in the case of Tipperary does not exist, because that obviously reduces the capital cost.  I would say as a matter of policy generally, because this has been touched on by a number of Senators, that the question of the extension of the gas grid which we are constantly updating and trying to expand, is really a question of examining the economic feasibility of the possible demands for gas in any area.  In this situation Limerick was an obvious place for gas, having the old Limerick Gas Company and the gas mains <i>in situ</i>.  What we have done in the case of Limerick is to provide a ten inch gas main connecting Limerick with the mains.  This has a capacity to deal with further expansion, if that is necessary, from Limerick.  It is probably premature as yet to say that we will be getting natural gas in Kerry shortly but who knows?  There is an interest in the Shannon region and in the Shannon Estuary generally and it is a question of looking at the capital cost of the extension of the gas pipeline and the usage and demand for gas by the industrialists or the prime markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kennedy referred to the participants <Col N="1435" /> and the various bodies who were involved in the negotiations and discussions. I would reiterate his congratulations in that regard.  Much difficult and technical work had to be done and some hard bargaining had to take place, obviously slow by its nature, but the whole proceedings were approached with a willingness to get work done and to bring gas to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary &mdash; as is his right, if not his wont &mdash; expressed some doubts and perhaps some regrets that the Parliament is not being given adequate notice.  There is always the question of balancing priorities.  In this case I am quite satisfied that despite the shortness of the notice, it is in the interest of the public good and the common good and particularly of the consumers in Limerick that this order be approved by both Houses before we rise for Christmas.  I say this because we are now putting the company on a statutory basis.  Development can now take place.  The order is ready.  The gas has arrived in Limerick but it cannot be distributed until the order is made.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Ministers' efforts to have more consultation with both Houses would give us a reciprocal arrangement whereby people in both Houses would confine themselves to short contributions. That is not directed at any person here.  In many debates, particularly in the other House if not here, we have unlimited contributions whereas a half an hour would be adequate for any contribution from any Member of either House.  With some reciprocation we could meet half way the Senator's requests.  On a general basis, I agree with the Senator's comments that it is very necessary that elected representatives have time to tease out the issues involved. There is much drafting, discussions and improving of documents before they reach the floors of either House.  The Senator is entitled to his view as to more discussion.</P>
    <P>The Senator expressed the public concern in relation to the Dublin Gas situation. It is regrettable and one of the <Col N="1436" /> unfortunate things was that the Dublin Gas Company were not taken into public ownership many years ago because of the large investment required by the State. That should have been done from day one when the natural gas programme was being approved.  I can allay any fears people have in relation to the question of whether there are letters of comfort or State guarantees in relation to the bank loans to the Dublin Gas Company.  I can state emphatically that there are no letters of comfort or State guarantees in relation to the consortia of banks and the loans from them to the Dublin Gas Company.  If the Dublin Gas company were to stop tomorrow morning and go into liquidation, the banks would be taking their chances like everybody else. The Government would not be backing up or putting the banks in a privileged position.  That is the view that is accepted by the banks from my discussions with them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the gas Acts generally, these are long overdue to be included in a consolidating Act because there are numerous gas Acts &mdash; we have the Limerick Corporation Gas Act, 1878, 41 and 42 Victoria &mdash; which Senator O'Leary can read over Christmas, the Limerick Gas Order, 1950, Statutory Instrument No. 58 of 1950, another order in 1923 in relation to gas charges, Statutory Instrument No. 24 of 1923.  I would be in favour of a consolidation of all of the gas Acts given the developments that have taken place since the 1976 Act establishing Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is well nigh time that we had a consolidating Act updating the gas laws generally and perhaps coping with the future development of natural gas because there will be an increasing development particularly in relation to the north eastern pipeline in years to come.  We are extremely fortunate to have the Kinsale Head gas field and I am quite confident that there will be further gas developments taking place off our coasts from shows to date in the exploration activity.  We are going to have natural gas as part of our fuel basket for many years to come.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 7 &mdash; actions not to <Col N="1437" /> abate &mdash; mentioned by Senator O'Leary, my reading of the section is that, while actions against the corporation are not explicitly mentioned, I am quite satisfied we can take it that they would also be included.  Any actions against the corporation which are outstanding or which are pending, like actions or suits by the corporation, would not be abated by the making of this Order.  Senator O'Leary mentioned the figure of £2.6 million and asked whether that would cover the liability. I am satisfied that is the appropriate and correct sum as negotiated betwen Bord Gáis Éireann, my Department and Limerick Corporation.  It is an equitable bargain to be struck in relation to the taking over of 70 per cent of the assets by Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>All we have to do now, as Senator O'Leary said, is to wish the new company well.  It is very important that the company is successful.  We should make no bones about that.  It is a public utility company.  It has a responsibility not just to the citizens of Limerick but to the taxpayers generally to be successful. There will be a public responsibility on the Minister for Energy of the day, Bord Gáis Éireann and Limerick Corporation to ensure that this gas company, as a public utility, is run to the highest commercial standards possible in delivering gas to the consumers, both domestic and industrial, in the Limerick city area.  I am confident that the company will take on the task they are now given by the State because it is an important task and it carries much responsibility in the spirit in which it is being given to them &mdash; to be a successful, well managed commercial company, to deliver natural gas in the city of Limerick and to do so in the best interests of both the Limerick residents and the rest of the taxpayers in the country.</P>

    <Title>Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1438" />
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which the Minister for Justice signed on behalf of the Government in February last.  That convention has as its purpose the suppression of terrorism by the strengthening of extradition and mutual assistance arrangements between the member states of the Council of Europe. All member states of the Council of Europe have now signed the convention and it remains to be ratified only by France, Greece, Malta and this country.</P>
      <P>The convention is not an extradition treaty.  Its purpose is to strengthen existing extradition and mutual assistance arrangements between member states of the Council of Europe by limiting the scope of the political offence exception. Listening to the debate in the Dáil, one would be forgiven for thinking that this Bill was making provision for the first time for extradition to Northen Ireland, Britain and continental Europe.  That, of course, is not the case.  Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, which gives effect to the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, provides the basis for our extradition arrangements with countries which are parties to that convention &mdash; that is, most of the member states of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>Those arrangements have been in place since 1965.  Part III of the 1965 Act provides for a different, more simplified, procedure which we operate with Northern Ireland and Britain based on the backing of warrants.  Those arrangements have also been in place and have been operated since 1965.  Indeed, the 1965 Act in this regard replaces, with modifications, arrangements which we have had with Britain since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the views which have been expressed in the debate in the Dáil relate primarily to our law on extradition rather than to the present Bill.  If valid, they would imply that the Extradition Act, 1965, was itself in important respects misconceived. I do not believe that is the case and I propose to return later to the <Col N="1439" /> most important issues which have been raised.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the convention, the primary purpose of the Bill is to limit the meaning of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; for the purposes of those provisions of our law governing extradition and the taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings abroad.  The Extradition Act, 1965, provides that extradition shall not be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  Such an exception is a common feature of extradition treaties and extradition legislation.  A similar provision is to be found in the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, for example.</P>
    <P>While the political offence exception has been a feature of extradition treaties snce the 19th century, there is no generally accepted definition of political offence.  The term &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; has traditionally been left undefined both in extradition treaties and in domestic legislation. There is general acceptance, however, that it is a matter for the requested State to decide for itself what that expression means.  There is also a wide acceptance among jurists and other experts that it is not practicable to find a formula that would constitute anything approaching a comprehensive definition of the term.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulty in finding an adequate and generally acceptable definition, the approach taken in the terrorism convention is to exclude certain offences from the scope of the political offence exception.  That has already been done in other conventions &mdash; the 1957 Convention on Extradition excludes from its scope the taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family; similarly, the United Nations Convention on Genocide excludes the offence of genocide from the exception.  We have followed the lead given by those conventions in the 1965 Act itself and in the Genocide Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>The key provision of the Convention on the Supervision of Terrorism in this regard is Article 1 which is given effect to by section 3 of the Bill.  Under Article 1, contracting States undertake not to <Col N="1440" /> regard certain specified offences &mdash; which are particularly associated with modern forms of terrorism &mdash; as being political for the purposes of requests for extradition from other contracting States.  The offences in question include hijacking, attacks against diplomats, explosives offences and so on.  While Article 1 is mandatory in its terms, Article 13 permits a reservation to be entered in respect of it.</P>
    <P>The effect of such a reservation would be to preserve, subject to qualification, a State's right to refuse extradition for an offence which the requested contracting State considers to be political.  The qualification is that the requested State is obliged, when evaluating the character of the offence, to take into due consideration any particular serious aspects of the offence, including the fact that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons, that it affected persons foreign to the motives behind it, or that cruel or vicious means were used in its commission.</P>
    <P>Reservations in accordance with this Article of the convention have been entered by nine of the 17 countries which have ratified the convention.  In addition, France, which has yet to ratify the Convention, has indicated its intention of making such a reservation and I understand that Greece which has also yet to ratify the convention will do so as well.</P>
    <P>The effect of those reservations is that the State concerned reserves the right to refuse extradition for an offence which it considers to be political having taken into due consideration the matters specified in Article 13 which I have already mentioned. The Government, however, have decided to frame the Bill on the basis that a reservation would not be entered.  In arriving at that decision, the Government were of the view that the offences covered by Article 1 were so odious, and so wanton and indiscriminate in their nature, that they should not be capable of being regarded as political in any circumstances. The decision not to enter a reservation also reflects the Government's commitment to the promotion of co-operation to defeat the use <Col N="1441" /> of violence for political purposes, above all on our own island, and, in the area of extradition, to play its part fully in the international effort to defeat terrorism.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, therefore, provides that an offence of the kind covered by the section is not to be regarded as a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence for the purposes of a request for extradition from a country which is a party to the Convention. The offences which section 3 excludes from the scope of the &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; exception are set out in subsection (3) of that section.  They are offences within the scope of the 1970 Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft or the 1971 Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation; serious offences involving an attack against the life, physical integrity or liberty of an internationally protected person; offences involving kidnapping, the taking of a hostage or serious false imprisonment; and offences involving the use of an explosive or an automatic firearm, if such use endangers persons. Attempts to commit those offences and participation as an accomplice are also covered.</P>
    <P>In providing for these offences the Bill follows closely the language used in the Convention although, where it has been considered desirable in the interests of clarity, or necessary for greater precision, some terminology used in Irish law has been substituted for that used in the Convention and, in other cases, expressions of a general nature that are used in the Convention are defined.  In this connection I would invite the attention of Senators to subsections (4) and (5) of section 3 together with the definition of &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; contained in section 1.</P>
    <P>In addition to strengthening extradition arrangements between contracting States, the Convention seeks to promote mutual assistance arrangements among contracting States.  Section 3 of the Bill, therefore, following Article 8 of the Convention, provides that the offences concerned are not to be regarded as a criminal matter of a political character <Col N="1442" /> for the purposes of the provisions of the Extradition Acts, 1870 and 1873, governing the taking of evidence in the State for use in criminal proceedings abroad. Those provisions are the relevant provisions of our law for the purposes of mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is related to Article 2 of the Convention.  That Article differs from Article 1 in that it is optional, not mandatory.  It allows, but does not require, contracting States not to regard certain additional offences as political offences for the purposes of extradition. The offences in question are set out in subsection (2) of section 4 and comprise a serious offence, other than one to which Article 1 applies, involving an act of violence against the life, physical integrity or liberty of a person, or involving an act against property if the act created a collective danger for persons.  Implicit in the section, of course, is the assumption that one is speaking of offences where the question of political motivation might be advanced by the wanted person.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to take the option which the Convention allows in relation to those offences but with a qualification. Section 4, therefore, instead of excluding these offences completely from the ambit of the political offence exception, provides that an Article 2 offence is not to be regarded as political where the court or the Minister, as appropriate, having given due consideration to any particularly serious aspects of the offence concerned, is of opinion that the offence cannot properly be regarded as political. The section provides that, when the character of the offence is being evaluated, due consideration must be given to certain specified aspects of the offence, namely, that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons, or affected persons foreign to the motives behind it, or that cruel or vicious means were used in its commission. The Government have decided to give effect to Article 2 of the Convention in this way because, while they were anxious to give as full effect as possible to the Convention, they are not convinced that the exclusion of the full <Col N="1443" /> range of offences coming within the scope of Article 2 would be warranted in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the Convention also creates an obligation to provide assistance in relation to criminal proceedings instituted abroad in respect of an offence coming within the scope of Article 2. Section 4 makes the necessary provision in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter I should mention in regard to section 4.  The references to the Minister for Justice in section 4 (1) do not give any new power to the Minister but simply have the effect of restricting the powers vested in him by the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>Under Article 6 of the Convention a contracting State is also required to establish jurisdiction over Article 1 offences in circumstances where a suspected offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him following a request for extradition from a contracting State whose jurisdiction is based on a rule of jurisdiction existing equally in the law of the requested State.  Under Article 7, if a contracting State refuses extradition for an Article 1 offence, it is required to submit the case to its competent authorities for prosecution.  In this way the Convention takes account of the possibility that extradition might be refused for a valid legal reason other than that the offence was political.  Section 5 provides for the establishment of extra-territorial jurisdiction over the offences in question as necessary.</P>
    <P>Certain restrictions are placed by section 6 of the Bill on the taking of proceedings in respect of section 5 offences.  These are partly intended to reflect the fact that under the Convention the obligation to establish extra-territorial jurisdiction is confined to cases where a request for extradition has been received and refused.</P>
    <P>These four sections thus constitute the core of the Bill and give effect to the Convention.  I would like, however, to mention briefly some of the remaining provisions of the Bill.  Sections 8 and 9 incorporate into Part III of the 1965 Act <Col N="1444" /> a possible ground of refusal of extradition that is allowed for by Article 5 of the Convention on Terrorism and that is already provided for in Part II of the 1965 Act at section 11 (2).  Henceforth it will be possible for extradition to be refused under that Part of the Act if there are substantial grounds for believing that the warrant under which the person is sought was issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that the person's position would be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill confers a power to apply the provisions of the Act to non-convention countries with which an extradition agreement is in force.  Such an extension, however, will require a prior affirmative resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That reflects the fact that issues which do not arise in relation to Convention countries might arise if the Bill were to be applied to other countries. Section 7 of the Bill, which is the result of an amendment proposed by Deputies O'Malley and Harney and accepted by the Minister for Justice on Report Stage in Dáil Éireann, amends section 4 of the 1965 Act.  The effect of section 7 is to require a prior affirmative resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas in the case of orders proposed to be made by the Government under section 4 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have already said in relation to sections 3 and 4 that they do not make exhaustive provision for the delimitation of the political offence exception.  Section 11, therefore, provides that nothing in the Bill will prevent a determination being made that an offence is not a political offence in circumstances or by reason of considerations other that those referred to in section 3 and 4.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the debate in Dáil Éireann on this Bill was concentrated as much on matters of general application to our extradition law as on provisions of the Bill itself.  The issue of whether we should insist on the establishment of a <i>prima</i><Col N="1445" /><i>facie</i> case in our courts before a person would be liable for extradition is an issue which goes to the provisions of the 1965 Act rather than to this Bill.  Similarly the issue of whether we should refuse to extradite our own nationals or whether restrictions should be placed on the extradition of our nationals are issues which go back to the 1965 Act rather than this Bill.  This Bill proposes simply to limit the scope of the political offence exception for the purposes of extradition and provides for related matters.  In so far as the debate up to now has focused on issues unrelated to the Bill, it would, I think, be appropriate for me to say something about those issues which have been raised.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which has attracted the most attention, I believe, is that the Bill should contain a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be established in our courts before a person would be liable for extradition.  In some cases the suggestion was that such a requirement would apply only where the person sought was an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>The Dáil decided yesterday that provision of this kind should not be made in the Bill.  That, I firmly believe was the right decision.  To introduce such a requirement now would be a retrograde step involving a return to a practice which, in relation to countries other than the United Kingdom, we dispensed with in 1965 when we acceded to the 1957 European Convention on Extradition. To require that a <i>prima facie</i> case is to be made out in the requested country would be out of keeping with European extradition norms and it is not provided for in the 1957 Convention.  That is why our arrangements under the 1965 Act with the other parties to that Convention do not provide for such a requirement. The establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case has never been a feature of the backing of warrants arrangements which we have operated with Britain since the establishment of the State.  That is why the 1965 Act does not contain such a requirement in relation to Northern Ireland or Britain.  I am forced to ask, therefore, whether those people who now insist that <Col N="1446" /> the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case is a matter of critical importance are also saying that the 1965 Act is so fundamentally flawed and misconceived in this regard.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Act was not misconceived. There are good policy reasons for not requiring the production of <i>prima facie</i> evidence in extradition cases.  Such a requirement is a serious obstacle to extradition and is now recognised internationally as such.  It is a requirement which until 1965 was shared by all the common law countries.  In dispensing with it in 1965, this country took a lead among those countries.  Since then, there has been an emerging trend among major common law countries away from the requirement.  Within the past few years Australia has removed the requirement in its extradition arrangements with many countries.  The British Government have recently published legislation which will enable them to dispense with the requirement in its extradition arrangements. Britain has never, of course, applied the requirement in its arrangements with this country.  The British Government has signalled their intention to become a party to the European Convention on Extradition and that legislation is a necessary prior condition of their doing so.</P>
    <P>A requirement related to Irish citizenship would be a requirement directed against Northern Ireland and Britain. The backing of warrants arrangements under Part III of the 1965 Act are meant to be a simplified procedure intended to reflect the close ties which exist between this country, Northern Ireland and Britain.  The situation which obtains as between this State and Northern Ireland is unique in Europe in terms of the number of persons in one jurisdiction who are citizens of the other.  That applies particularly in the context of Northern Ireland but, given the nature of our citizenship laws, its application in the wider British context should not be underestimated either.  The backing of warrants arrangements also reflects the geographical proximity of the two countries, the social and economic ties, as well as the special travel arrangements that <Col N="1447" /> exist between us, and, of course, the close similarity and historical connection between our legal systems.  To introduce a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be established in our courts before extradition could be granted to Northern Ireland or Britain would serve to impede legitimate and proper requests for the return of wanted persons.  It would also amount to a public and unambigous declaration both to the people of Northern Ireland and the people of Britain that we were abandoning the Anglo-Irish Agreement and all that it means for all of us.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I must accept &mdash; and the Government accepts &mdash; that the various suggestions which have been made are intended to address some genuinely held concerns about extradition.  One concern throughout the debate that has taken place on our accession to the Terrorism Convention has been that the Bill might facilitate a development of extradition merely for questioning in the context of extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain.  The Government had addressed this concern before the Bill was published and arrangements were agreed with the British Government whereby no warrant to be sent to this jurisdiction will, in future, be sent here for execution unless the case has first been examined at a high legal level to verify that there is, in the opinion of the prosecution authority concerned, sufficient evidence of a kind admissible in court on which to base a charge.  The British Government have stated that in respect of accused persons the only purpose of the backing of warrants procedure is to enable persons to be brought before the courts and that a warrant for the return of a person will be sought only where the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, or the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, is satisfied that there is a clear probability of a prosecution founded on a sufficiency of admissible evidence.</P>
    <P>Those arrangements in themselves represent an important safeguard.  They reflect the understanding that is shared by the two Governments that an extradition <Col N="1448" /> request implies a clear expectation that court proceedings will normally follow. The reason I say &ldquo;normally&rdquo; here is because there may be very exceptional occasions when they should not or could not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice announced in the Dáil on Tuesday that the British authorities have now also agreed to an addition to this arrangement.  In all cases where a warrant has been sent to this jurisdiction for backing, the British Attorney General will send to our Attorney General, through the diplomatic channel, a confirmatory note to the effect that he &mdash; the British Attorney General &mdash; has satisfied himself that the relevant prosecuting authorities have complied with the arrangements which I have just described.  That confirmatory note will serve as additional reassurance that these arrangements have been complied with in each case.  Parallel arrangements will be put in place in Scotland under the direction of the Lord Advocate.</P>
    <P>The new administrative arrangements, now further strengthened in this way, will, in my view, provide safeguards that ought to be accepted by any reasonable observer as being entirely adequate, and in saying this I would stress that I am not suggesting that abuses have occurred. These new arrangements will come into operation in the very near future &mdash; in some areas almost immediately and elsewhere very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government propose that, before the Bill comes into operation, sufficient time should be allowed so that those arrangements can be seen to be working in practice.  For that reason, section 13 of the Bill, which deals with its commencement, was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide that the commencement date referred to in that section would be 1 December 1987 instead of 1 June 1987.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to say a few further words about section 13. That section now provides that the Act shall come into operation on 1 December 1987 unless before that date resolutions to the contrary are passed by both Houses <Col N="1449" /> of the Oireachtas.  It will also be open to both Houses to pass resolutions that the Act should come into operation on a specified date earlier or later than 1 December 1987.  In that event the Minister for Justice will be required to make an order bringing the Act into operation on the date specified in the resolutions.</P>
    <P>That provision reflects the fact that at the time the Hillsborough Agreement was signed, ratification of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was set against the background of progress in relation to a number of matters covered by the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  These matters were public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, relations between the security forces and the minority community there and security co-operation.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made under these headings.  Legislation passed in Westminster last January will allow a greater number of offences previously tried by a judge alone to go for trial by jury.  The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill, which received its Second Reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday, provides new safeguards regarding the emergency powers of the police and army, including a test of reasonable grounds of suspicion for the exercise of powers of arrest; it introduces increased rights for suspects in police custody; shifts the onus of proof in bail cases from the defence to the prosecution; and restates the conditions for the admissibility of confessions in scheduled cases.  Measures have also been taken to reduce delays between arrest and trial, which will mean that persons will spend less time in custody on remand. Finally, certain court decisions, taken in conjunction with a statement of policy by the British Attorney General, appear to have greatly diminished the likelihood of cases being brought on so-called &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; evidence without corroboration, especially against a large number of defendants.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes I mentioned are still in course of implementation.  Both Governments believe that further progress <Col N="1450" /> needs to be made on relations between the security forces and the minority community, on security co-operation and on the administration of justice, and they will continue to work towards that end.</P>
    <P>This commencement provision has been carefully constructed to enable a further vital step to be taken towards ratification of the convention, while providing a mechanism whereby the Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to express their view again in the light of further developments.</P>
    <P>Passage of this Bill would be a very important earnest of our intent to proceed to ratification of the terrorism convention against the background of progress on other issues mentioned in the Hillsborough communique.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that the Government are not creating a direct link between this legislation and any individual reform in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  It is designed to give an opportunity to the Dáil and Seanad to review the introduction of the legislation in the light of progress overall in relation to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, relations between the security forces and the minority community and security co-operation between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, first of all, that we will be supporting this Bill at this stage, although we are gravely concerned at the intransigence of the Minister in his attitude to amendments in the other House.  We support the proposal to give effect to the European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism. Terrorism is something which, of course, has always existed.  Sometimes one feels that it is something that has only been invented or emerged in recent years.  It is worthwhile remembering that it is something that has always been there.  It is one of the methods that was used by the European powers over the centuries to colonise most of the world.  It was used in this country by one of those powers.  I <Col N="1451" /> say this not to open old wounds but to draw attention to the fact that some of those countries which are most sanctimonious about terrorism at present are countries which in their day practised terrorism all over the world in subjugating the territories into which they moved.</P>
      <P>Terrorism has become extremely prevalent in recent years.  The effects of it have been dramatic and there is no doubt that measures must be taken to deal with it so far as it is possible to do so.  We, as a member of the Council of Europe, must support this convention and support the effort to implement it and give it effect.  In ordinary circumstances this would be no problem; it would be a Bill to be dealt with merely from the point of view of the legal niceties which are in it.  It would be a Committee Stage Bill when we would possibly be putting down amendments to deal with smaller points and legal matters.  Unfortunately in Ireland the situation is not quite that simple.  The Minister of State said in her speech that there is nothing new in the Bill in regard to extradition, that extradition has been here for many years, that we operate at present under the provisions of the 1965 Act.  It is quite true that we do operate under that Act. That Act has been there for some considerable time.  Events have changed since that Act was enacted.  A lot of things have happened, in Northern Ireland and in the UK, which warrant us having another look at that Act.  The Bill before us provides for several amendments to that Act.  It provides the opportunity to look at the provisions of that Act which may not, any longer, be appropriate to present day circumstances.  That is something which we must consider.  Certainly we have had extradition up to now.  The Act is being amended and perhaps not altogether in the way which is appropriate in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What makes consideration of this Bill very difficult is the situation which exists in Northern Ireland and in the UK and the age old relationship between our two countries.  It would be quite unrealistic to <Col N="1452" /> ignore this situation.  It would be quite unrealistic to pretend that we can approve of this Bill as most other countries throughout Europe could do.  Most other countries do not have the same unique problem that we have between this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It would be quite irresponsible to overlook the adverse effect which this Bill could have on the citizens of this country and on people of Irish background.  It is not merely citizens who might be affected, it is people who live in the UK, who live in the North or elsewhere but have an Irish background and for that very reason are subject to undue risk because of this Bill.  A unique situation exists as between the two countries and we must address it.  We must see whether the Bill is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The political situation in Northern Ireland and the violence which has taken place there has given rise to a number of developments and events in recent years which highlight the difficult problem we face in passing this Bill.  We can have regard, for instance, to the Diplock courts and to the evidence of the super-grasses. Nobody can accept that the trials which have taken place in the courts are normal or fair.  Yet, by passing this Bill without any safeguards, we are taking the risk of sending people to Northern Ireland, to be tried in courts which are clearly unfair and clearly are not the kind of courts we would want any of our citizens to come before, charged with serious crime.</P>
    <P>We have the situation which is emerging in the past week in a very definate way in which eight senior members of the RUC are likely to be prosecuted on the recommendation of a senior United Kingdom police officer, for offences ranging from murder to perversion of the course of justice.  Yet, when a junior member of the RUC was prosecuted for his part in these events, not only was he acquitted but a Northern Ireland judge commended one of the officer's for the part he played in these events.  Again, can any of us feel happy about sending a citizen of the Republic to Northern <Col N="1453" /> Ireland to be tried by a judge who has these views of events of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have the sordid position of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguires, which was the subject of a motion in this House today: a motion which very cautiously referred to the serious doubts and misgivings which have arisen in regard to the convictions of the people concerned.  In non-diplomatic language, it means that all of these people were convicted on evidence which falls far short of what would be adequate for any fair and objective court.  The belief, backed by cogent argument and facts, is that they were convicted because they were Irish people and because the events in the United Kingdom at the time gave rise to extreme anti-Irish feelings.  I can understand and even sympathise with, the feelings in the United Kingdom at the time but I deplore the fact that, as a result of these feelings, injustice appears to have resulted in regard to these people. We are speaking of a situation in which something similar could arise again.  We could again have events in the UK.  We could again have a request for the extradition of people, to be tried by British courts at a time of high feeling and we could have conviction on evidence which was entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the facts of life in relation to justice in the UK as applied to Irish people in circumstances such as this, it is quite inexplicable that the Minister should introduce this Bill without any safeguards, without any provisions to protect Irish people whose extradition to the United Kingdom is sought.  There is no reason for confidence that there will not be a repetition of what I have just mentioned.  There is no reason to be assured that persons extradited to the United Kingdom would not be subject to the same kind of trials as those that took place in regard to Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four &mdash; trials which ended in conviction on the same totally inadequate evidence.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to face up to a situation which is quite different from that which was envisaged by those who <Col N="1454" /> drafted the Convention on terrorism and the Convention on extradition.  I suggest that the Minister should look at it, not as it was looked at by those who drafted the Convention in Strasbourg but as it exists at present, and as seen not from Strasbourg but from Dublin and as seen in particular by the people of the North.  It is an entirely different picture.  There are entirely different considerations involved and it should be looked at in a different way.  If there is a difference, and if the Conventions are not entirely appropriate to conditions in Ireland at present, then there must be some provisions to reflect this difference, there must be some effort to protect Irish people who may be at risk because of this Bill and because of the different situation which exists in these countries compared with the remainder of Europe.</P>
    <P>An effort must be made.  I have no doubt that if the effort was made, some provisions could be brought in to deal with the matter.  There is the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, which provides for a trial in this country of acts committed outside the country.  Some kind of approach such as provided by that Act might be helpful.  An effort was made in the other House to insist on a <i>prima facie</i> case being made before extradition took place.  At first I think the Minister said it was not possible but when I read the Minister's speech here today it is not so much that it is not possible as it would be out of keeping with the norm in such matters.  I am not sure how important that is.  It is particularly interesting to note that the United Kingdom have insisted on having a <i>prima facie</i> case made before they extradite.  They have said they are going to change that but of course we do not know whether they will. In any event, all we would be doing in insisting on a <i>prima facie</i> case would be something which is out of keeping with the norm.  I have already made the point that we do not have the norm in this country, that what exists here is not the norm.  Consequently, it would not be surprising if we should make some slight changes in our approach to extradition which would be outside the norm because <Col N="1455" /> we do not have normal circumstances in this country.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 refer to Article 3 of the convention on extradition which states:</P>
    <P>...extradition shall not be granted if the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the requested party as a political offence or is an offence connected with a political offence.  The same rule shall apply if the requested party has substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or, that the person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
    <P>It is not very far-fetched to say that in relation to the trials dealt with in the motion here today the position of the persons concerned was very definitely prejudiced because of their race, religion and nationality.  Perhaps this is a way in which we could deal with this situation in the future.  That article of the Extradition Convention has been amended slightly but it is still there and it could be used. If this is not possible I suggest that there must be other methods by which we could protect our people in the very abnormal situation which exists in this country.  I refer to Article 6 of the Convention which says that a contracting party shall have the right to refuse extradition of its nationals.  The Minister said that in the particular circumstances of this country and the fact that most of the people whose extradition is sought would be nationals this would undermine the whole policy of extradition.  There is some merit in that argument.  Nevertheless, in certain circumstances it could be availed of.</P>
    <P>There is also Article 22 of the Extradition Convention which states: &ldquo;Except where this Convention otherwise provides, the procedure with regard to extraditior and provisional arrest shall be governed solely by the law of the requested party.&rdquo;  That is a very bald article, so bald and simple that I am not sure what is intended by it or what could <Col N="1456" /> be read into it.  It appears that if we provide by our law that certain precautions should be taken before extradition, we are quite entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>Most other countries have entered reservations and exceptions in regard to these conventions.  It should not be beyond the limit of our ability and ingenuity to frame some provisions which would protect Irish people from the prejudices and inconsistencies of British justice.  I can understand the desire of the Minister to make a contribution to the negotiations under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I supported that Agreement when it was introduced in this House and I still support it.  It is not a final solution to the problem of Northern Ireland and it must be admitted that the results to date are very disappointing but it is a step in the right direction and I am glad to support it in as far as that is possible.  To accept extradition to the United Kingdom on the basis of this Bill without any safeguards for the people of this country, without any safeguards for the risks they might run by being extradited is for me too high a price to pay for progress under the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Fianna Fáil are against terrorism &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  In other words, we are only paying lip service to the efforts to deal with terrorism.  When we read this Bill and when we consider the risks to Irish people we can say in reply to that that the Minister is concerned with the protection of Irish citizens &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  He is concerned with it but he is willing to take the risk, to pay the price.  I think the price is too high.  I would like to reiterate the support of Fianna Fáil for the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. We definitely wish to support that.  We would have no hesitation in supporting it if there were not unusual circumstances which have not been dealt with by the Minister.  I find it impossible to understand the blind spot which the Minister has in relation to the dangers presented by this Bill to our people.  I hope that we may be able to help him to see the light on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of Fine <Col N="1457" /> Gael to speak on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I would like to assure the Minister of our full support in putting forward this legislation at this time.  The content of the Bill as outlined by the Minister on Second Stage is instructive.  Of particular importance is the Minister's assertion that it is not an extradition treaty, that it does not propose to strengthen the existing extradition procedure; that it is an administrative rather than a fundamental reform of the extradition law. The Minister's outlining of the basis for our present extradition legislation being the Extradition Act, 1965 is an important reminder to the House that the Government are having sand thrown in their eyes about this Bill.  This Bill is being used not only to discuss the merits or otherwise of giving effect to the European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism but as an opportunity to review the 1965 Act. There is nothing wrong with that.  The Second Stage of a Bill such as this is an appropriate place in which to assess whether the scope of the Bill is wide enough.</P>
      <P>What surprises me is the extent of the publicly expressed desire of the Opposition to amend the Bill.  I will not make reference to where it was done because it may not be appropriate but their publicly expressed desire went far beyond the Title of the Bill.  I cannot understand, if this Bill is read a Second Time in this House, in view of the decisions which have been made, that it can be used as a vehicle to fundamentally change the Extradition Act, 1965.  I fail to understand how that attempt could succeed because the Bill is in itself a limited Bill and the Long Title clearly defines what it is.  It is an Act to give effect to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism done at Strasbourg on 27 day of January, 1977 and to amend and extend the Extradition Act, 1965.  It is the last part of the Title &mdash; the amending and the extending of the Extradition Act, 1965 &mdash; which is apparently used as a vehicle to fundamentally reform the 1965 Act in a way which seems to go far beyond the original intention of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> Irrespective of whether it is sensible or not, the main impact of the public controversy about this Bill has focused around the question of whether or not a <i>prima facie</i> case is a proper pre-condition for the operation of extradition and I intend to deal with that later in my speech.  I would like to make a passing reference to the meaning of &ldquo;a political offence&rdquo; because in order to understand where the main Opposition party find themselves, it is important to comprehend what has been happening to the definition of a political offence over the years.  It is incontrovertible that there has been a fundamental change in the interpretation which our approach put on the meaning of a political offence.  It is undeniable that offences are now categorised as not being political offences that, prior to a number of recent decisions of the Supreme Court, would indeed have been assumed to have been political offences.</P>
    <P>I was present in the Supreme Court to hear judge after judge in that court reaffirm that offences committed by the INLA and, by implication, by the Provisional IRA could under almost no circumstances be considered political offences.  The rationale of their judgment appeared to be quite clearly that these people were bent on destroying this State and that their actions as a result of that automatically brought them outside the definition of a political offence.  There was a very fundamental change in practice which was given physical expression by the extradition of a Mr. McGlinchey to the Six Counties.  At that time there was a certain political controversy over whether Mr. McGlinchey should or should not face trial in this portion of the country in respect of offences which it was alleged he had committed within this jurisdiction and whether that trial should take place in advance of his extradition to the North of Ireland.  In point of fact he was so extradited.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind everybody what happened to Mr. McGlinchey.  Mr. McGlinchey was convicted in the North of Ireland and on appeal he was released <Col N="1459" /> and he was found not guilty of the offence with which he was charged.  Leaving aside for the moment the question of any miscarriage of justice which may have happened on the mainland of Britain, surely this is a very positive sign of the administration of justice in the North of Ireland. Nobody could pretend that this particular Mr. McGlinchey was unknown or did not have a high public profile but notwithstanding that fact he was ultimately acquitted of offences and as a result of that my confidence in the system of justice in the North of Ireland was considerably enhanced.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the question of what has become known as the supergrass trials further confirms my view that, taken as a whole, the judicial system in the North of Ireland is good.  Of course it is quite true that mistakes are made; mistakes are made everywhere.  It is quite true that some of the judges may be prejudiced but judges are prejudiced everywhere.  If the supergrass system is so offensive &mdash; and I may say that as far as I am concerned I would consider it offensive if it is not in accordance with proper principles of jurisprudence, but only in so far as it is not in accordance with such principles &mdash; then it can be said that in the vast majority of cases that have come to my attention, on appeal many of these cases have not been set aside.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>I do not share the apparent belief of Senator Eoin Ryan that the Diplock courts are themselves unfair courts.  Of course I agree with him, they are not normal courts.  I would think they would be far better if they were modelled on our Special Criminal Courts but I am not willing to say that in any individual cases they are fair or they are unfair.  Like all human institutions, it is possible they will make mistakes but the supergrass trials and the McGlinchey case are indications of the measure of judicial independence which exists in the North of Ireland and the determination of the Judiciary up there to uphold that principle.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of senior officers in the RUC being charged with <Col N="1460" /> certain offences, I would have seriously to question whether senior officers in our Garda force would, under any circumstances, be charged with serious offences.  It is possible &mdash; and of course I listened with interest to what the other people have had to say here &mdash; that the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and the other people to whom reference have been made are not guilty of the offences and it is probably even more possible and more likely that the basis on which they were convicted was inadequate. If that is so, I expect the United Kingdom authorities to take the appropriate action in that regard and I support the motion which was proposed in this House.</P>
    <P>During the development of the new definition of political offences by a series of Supreme Court decisions over the last few years, did the principal Opposition party at any stage say that they disagreed with that?  I have to suggest that they did not and that they indicated by their silence that this development was acceptable to them.  I do not think what we are proposing to do here under the European Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, in so far as it relates to the position between ourselves and the North of Ireland and ourselves and Britain, brings us any further than the Supreme Court had already brought us.  In bringing us there, they did it in the political silence and acquiesence of the main political Opposition and, indeed, quite a number of other recent recruits to that side of interpretative jurisprudence.  I am referring to the Progressive Democrats Party.</P>
    <P>It is then fair to say that the whole question of this <i>prima facie</i> argument which I will deal with, in so far as it relates between Ireland and Britain and the Republic of Ireland and the North of Ireland, is in fact attempting to change completely the relationship.  There was absolutely no request to change that relationship prior to the introduction by the Government of this Extradition Bill. There seemed to be no political agitation from the Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil or anybody else in those constitutional parties for changes in this <Col N="1461" /> regard.  I doubt very much that in those circumstances we could take very seriously their belief that all of a sudden, simultaneously with the production of this legislation which is to do with the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, they became converted to the fact that their 1965 Extradition Act should be fundamentally changed in so far as it relates to the situation between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>It is a bit disingenuous of Senator Eoin Ryan to say that in the United Kingdom there is a necessity for a <i>prima facie</i> case. That is not right with regard to the relationship between Britain and Ireland. It may be right between Britain and everybody else, but let them look after that.  It is not right with regard to the relationship between Britain and Ireland. There is no requirement and there has not been a requirement, for <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I am confident that our courts will continue to uphold their independence in their own unique way by ensuring that the procedures laid down by law are strictly adhered to by the United Kingdom, whatever those procedures may be.  If the United Kingdom have made a mess of a number of extradition matters by not executing the warrants in a proper fashion, our courts are perfectly right to refuse to back those warrants.</P>
    <P>I must examine the question of <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  It has never applied between Ireland and Britain.  Why should it apply now?  We are not saying it should apply with regard to terrorism but that it should apply with regard to everything. The suggestion is that it should apply if somebody is charged with burglary &mdash; the &ldquo;ordinary, decent criminal&rdquo; as he will be known.  The suggestion is that you have to establish what they call a <i>prima facie</i> case.  We have a system in this country for establishing <i>prima facie</i> cases in criminal matters: it is the preliminary examination which is a necessary part of the criminal process.  I have no particular expertise whatsoever in criminal law.  Anybody who would employ me as a criminal lawyer would be guilty of gross irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>I refer to the <i>Irish Criminal Process,</i><Col N="1462" /> an excellent book to which I referred previously in this House.  It is a joint production of Edward F. Ryan and Philip P. Magee.  On page 229 and the following pages they set out quite clearly what is the procedure for establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case in this jurisdiction.  The preliminary examination is the form in which it operates.  In practice in many cases, a book of evidence is presented and that is the end of the matter.  The criminal acknowledges that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against him, or acknowledges that people would swear what is in the book of evidence and is returned for trial.  That does not have to apply and it is made quite clear in the <i>Irish Criminal Process</i> book.  On page 237 it says under a heading of The Taking of Evidence Upon Deposition:</P>
    <P>As has already been stated, either the prosecution or the defence at a preliminary examination may require a witness to attend and be cross-examined, and be examined, cross-examined and re-examined by way of sworn deposition.  Permission of the district justice is not required where this section is invoked by either the prosecution or the defence.</P>
    <P>Any criminal lawyer worth his salt, if there was a case in the United Kingdom or a case anywhere else in Europe where a person from this country, whether he be a citizen or not, was being sent abroad, would insist on all the evidence or sufficient evidence being presented to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case and would insist on cross-examination.</P>
    <P>When you think of the complications that would arise from that procedure you will understand why <i>prima facie</i> evidence is not the norm.  If somebody was to be extradited for robbing a bank in Central London and happened to be in Ireland, it would be necessary for all the customers in the bank who were giving evidence that they observed this person in operation, to be transported to Ireland, to be examined and cross-examined.  It would be necessary for a representative of the bank to prove that they owned the money and they had given the person <Col N="1463" /> no permission to take it.  It would be necessary for all the police officers who had investigated the matter in so far as it related to any statement which the person might have made to attend and be examined and cross-examined.  What is the possibility in a large case of being able to assemble outside the jurisdiction of the country where the crime is alleged to have taken place all these people to examine and to cross-examine them and then to repeat that process in the United Kingdom not once but twice &mdash; at the prelimary stage and at the final trial stage.</P>
    <P>It is a recipe for having no extradition at all.  The reality is that where <i>prima facie</i> evidence exists as a requirement, extradition does not follow.  I understand that there has been a <i>prima facie</i> requirement between the United Kingdom and Spain and as a result of that Spaniards living in England have not over a period of time been extradited.</P>
    <P>To say that in general the law of extradition should have <i>prima facie</i> requirement is to completely turn the 1965 Act upside down because that is what the amendments are saying.  They are saying that there should be a <i>prima facie</i> requirement for all countries.  To apply it directly to Britain and Northern Ireland and to nowhere else is to change from a situation where our extradition arrangements between Ireland and Britain were the closest with any country in the world to a position where they would be the most restrictive in respect of any country within Europe and to do that on the basis that we fail to have confidence in the way in which the law is administered in Britain and Northern Ireland is to fly in the face of what our experience has been.</P>
    <P>To anybody who thinks what I am saying about Britain is incorrect I would put one question: would you prefer to be extradited?  Would you think you would have a better chance of getting off if you were extradited on an offence to France or to the United Kingdom?  I know where I think I would have a better chance of getting off, and it is not France.</P>
    <P>Any time a person is charged with any offence it is possible that he will be found <Col N="1464" /> guilty wrongly but I do not impute and I have never imputed to the British authorities bad faith, and that is what we are doing.  We are imputing to them bad faith.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the political opportunism of the main Opposition party coincided with an enormously ineffective briefing which the leader of the Progressive Democrats received and the combination was such as to give them false temporary hope of terminating the life of this Government in advance of the Christmas Recess.  I am not willing to judge the merits or demerits of our extradition law on whether this Government should or should not call a general election.</P>
    <P>For that reason, and also because I subscribe to the modern reality that political exceptions are being continually and increasingly used to excuse the most barbarous of crimes in a situation where criminal activity for profit is often inexorably tied up with criminal activity for political reasons, I think there is an inseparable link between the terrorism &mdash; forget our own problems altogether for a moment &mdash; of the Bader Meinhoff group or any one of the groups that are presently in vogue in France and actual financial gain for their participants.  There is a link there which cannot be ignored. To extend or permit the extension of the definition of political offences is, as far as I am concerned, not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The extension of political offences, or the exception of political offences, should, of course, relate to non-violent political activity.  I do not accept that blowing up any person in the North of Ireland, whether that person is a citizen of the United Kingdom, with or without additional citizenship of this country, or the blowing up a soldier, an RUC person, a UDF person or anybody, is justified by the circumstances in which we find ourselves in this island.</P>
    <P>I support the growing and developing interpretations of the Supreme Court in this area.  I support this Bill in so far as it gives expression on a wider forum and in a wider way to that emerging consensus <Col N="1465" /> because removed of its political opportunism this Bill will ultimately achieve political consensus within this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I did not notice any of the alternative administrations saying they were going to repeal this legislation if they got back to power.  If they really believed what they were saying, that is what they would promise.  There is more to this than merely an examination of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. For that reason and for the other reasons I mentioned I support the legislation and warmly welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in her opening statement put her finger on what, in fact, is perceived throughout the length and breadth of the country as being an Extradition Bill.  We can only blame ourselves for that.  The name of the Bill is Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986. All the criticisms I have heard about this Bill have come from people in the knowledge and belief that somehow, for the first time, this Government are bringing in an extradition Bill which will enable people to be extradited from here to other countries.  I was delighted that the Minister, in her opening remarks, confirmed that the Bill is no such thing.  This Bill removes from the area of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; offences which are carried out by bombing and machine guns, and enacted against particular types of people, whether ambassadors or anybody else in that category.  Any fair thinking person in this country would accept that crimes of that magnitude could not be considered, no matter what their political beliefs as being in any way remotely related to a political offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary has outlined in detail how it could not be perceived to be a political offence because that kind of crime which is being, sadly, committed nowadays in so many other countries as well as our own is a crime against humanity.  The sooner we can achieve some convention between ourselves and our partners, both in Europe and Britain, to remove this anomaly, the better.  We <Col N="1466" /> can then come to grips with that kind of a problem.  It has been a source of surprise to me to see some of the votes by some people whom I know very well in the other House.  They believe the same things that I have believed in this whole area of terrorism as we understand it. Nobody condones the kind of acts of terrorism that have been carried out throughout the whole country and, indeed, in Britain.  It has been referred today in a previous Private Members' motion.  Obviously innocent people were detained after a whole spate of terrorist acts on the basis that they were Irish and in some way suspicious.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs rightly said that the two should not be linked together and that what we are doing with regard to the Birmingham Six and others is in a different category. We are making our own progress with the British Government in that regard. The people convicted of those crimes were never extradited, which is a very important aspect to remember.  Perhaps this should stand in its own right as being a convention that we can sign with our partners to ensure that people cannot claim political exemption for dastardly acts which are committed quite often and which are used as an excuse to prevent people from being extradited.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have been condemned by Unionists.  We have been condemned by Mr. Paisley and other very vocal people in the North of Ireland for not having had regularised legislation in which we could legally and formally extradite people in the past.  Successive Governments, including this Government at one stage, considered it was unconstitutional for us to extradite people.  Our interpretation of the Constitution convinced us that this was the case.  Suddenly the Supreme Court made what I consider to be a very courageous decision when they considered a particular case that was before them, the McGlinchey case, in December 1982.</P>
    <P>In considering that case, the court decided that notwithstanding the political motivation that was claimed by McGlinchey <Col N="1467" /> at that time, modern terrorist violence is often the antithesis of what could be regarded as political and laid down the test of a political offence as being whether the particular circumstances showed that the person charged was at the relevant time engaged either directly or indirectly in what reasonably civilised people would regard as a political activity.  That was a courageous decision of the Supreme Court.  We suddenly discovered that the courts were making decisions that the Legislature had failed to make and had been unable to make because our interpretation of the Constitution in the area of political offences was confined.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary went on to explain what happened to Mr. McGlinchey.  The courts restored the confidence of many people in this country when they decided that when the man was first found guilty and then on appeal found innocent, that there was justice at its highest.  It was seen to be an action in a jurisdiction about which a lot of people, myself included, have had reservations in the past.  That was the beginning.  It was also proof that an administration about which we had had reservations could in regard to a public figure make a conscious decision, and probably a fair decision, that the man was innocent and was to be released.  That must remove all our suspicions that if a request comes for an extradition for anybody in particular, we can comply in the confidence that they will get a proper trial in whichever jurisdiction to which they are extradited.</P>
    <P>Other cases have happened in the meantime such as the case of Shannon in 1984 and the case of Quinn, which was a crime of violence against the person.  The Supreme Court in that case took a different approach.</P>
    <P>It is excellent to see the independence and the supremacy of the courts in relation to their interpretation of the Constitution.  It is refreshing.  There are some decisions of recent days that would worry some people, but it is refreshing that there is this general open approach now to looking at all Acts and laws that are passed and at the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> It is appropriate that crimes, such as the Minister has outlined, the hi-jacking of aeroplanes, kidnapping and hostage taking, which have a detrimental effect on human life and on families, should never be allowed to be used as what we would term political offences.  It is interesting also to note that the passing of this convention on terrorism does not put an end to what would be termed a political exemption as between member states and the Council of Europe.  There will still be the catch phrase that there would be exemptions in genuine political exemption cases.  It is a matter for the defendant to prove that his action was of a political nature.  This is the advantage of this Bill. At least it defines what political offences are.  It removes them from the realm of terrorism.  There are countries throughout the world in which they can sometimes almost justify terrorism as a political act when there is not a democratic process of parliament to which they can turn.  I do not think that anybody would suggest for a moment, where we have democratically elected Governments, both in this country and in Britain, that jointly and in co-operation with one another these two countries which want to maintain friendly relations cannot enact laws that will be for the betterment of humanity as a whole.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is an escape clause for the bringing into being of the Act.  The Minister was originally suggesting a date in June.  He has put in an amendment to push that back to December to ensure that whatever changes are required between the two governments under the Anglo-Irish Agreement would be in place to ensure that any worries we may have in this area could be dispelled.  The Leader of the Alliance Party last night condemned the Government as in some way going soft on this legislation.  I have a lot of respect for the present and past Leaders of the Alliance Party.  They have, at times, made a minority view known, but it was certainly a view that needed to be expressed.  They have expressed it forcibly and have never received any appreciation at the ballot box for doing so.  I <Col N="1469" /> would just remind the present Leader of the Alliance Party that it is not just the Government that will be postponing the introduction of this legislation, it will be the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The date is flexible.  It can be brought forward or postponed further, if either of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, by resolution, so decide.  It removes from the Government the responsibility of the dates.  I just want to put on record that that is my interpretation of this date.</P>
    <P>We will be going on to Committee Stage of this Bill on 14 January.  Whenever we actually pass it, the date on which it becomes law is still open to changing forward or backwards.  It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have this opportunity.  It is unusual to legislate retrospectively, but it is also most unusual to legislate for the future. Nobody can actually be quite sure of what the situation will be in 12 months' time <i>vis-à-vis</i> the continuing work that, I hope, will continue with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The changes that we are already negotiating with the British Government in the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be perceived publicly to be coming on stream and will remove some of the doubts that people might have in the area of the other administration.</P>
    <P>I want to confine myself as much as possible on Second Stage.  There will be amendments and there will be quite a lot of discussion on Committee Stage when we can deal with all the little worries that we may have about various sections and the full implementation of them.  I am satisfied from the discussions I have had with people in this area that except for removing these terrorist acts out of the area of political offences, generally speaking this Bill is doing nothing more than entering into a convention with our neighbours in an area on which agreement has been reached.  The Minister for Justice has entered into a covenant with them that we would initiate legislation at the end of this year.  Appropriately, we put these dates on it to allow time for the completion of all the other changes and improvements in the jurisdictions in which there possibly could be applications <Col N="1470" /> for the extradition of particular people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I welcome it particularly as the Minister has defined exactly what it is.  Certainly it has been misrepresented by people throughout constituencies as being a major step forward in just handing over people for every and any offence to another jurisdiction.  Of course, that is untrue and it is quite annoying at times to hear that case being made.  It is important also to know that there is an existing arrangement about extradition.  This just tidies up the whole concept of political offences <i>vis-à-vis</i> extradition and a claim for extradition.</P>
    <P>We would also hope that, from some of the applications that came through recently and which were obviously not in order and were questioned by us and by our own courts immediately, the British, who were responsible at the time, would have learned the lesson that the Irish courts are not to be taken lightly, that the Irish courts are capable of looking at a request for extradition of a particular person.  There was the Glenholmes case and there were also many other instances in which the British Government suddenly realised that the courts here were capable of inspecting applications and pointed up deficiencies in particular requests that had come.  That is not involved in this legislation.  It was appropriate that the British Government would see that our courts and our jurisdiction carry some weight and have made some courageous decisions in recent years in this area.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I welcome the purpose of the Bill.  I do not think anybody would condone for a moment somebody who was guilty of murder and desecration getting shelter under the term &ldquo;political offences&rdquo; so that we would be unable to return them for trial to the country where the crime had been committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  The only complaint I have about this Bill is that it is long overdue.  I have listened to speakers in both Houses on this Bill.  I have heard a litany of complaints as regards the treatment of prisoners in courts and <Col N="1471" /> in prisons but I have not heard one word about the victims of these people.</P>
      <P>I served with the late Billy Fox, a Member of this House, who was murdered in Monaghan.  He was murdered because he came on the scene of the home of his fiancee being burned down. Because he would recognise the people that were doing it they shot him in the back 17 times.  They did not have the courage to shoot him in the face.  When I hear about visits to prisoners I wonder how many people visited the parents of the late Billy Fox?  I wonder how many people visited his financee who was left without a husband-to-be in a short few months?  When people talk about prisoners in various jails and the crimes they are charged with and the treatment they might get from the courts; how many of these people, and of these so-called political prisoners are in jail for not having bicycle lights?  How many are in jail for not paying parking fines?  How many of them are in jail for being caught in a pub after hours?  None of these people is in jail for any of those offences. They are in jail for a murder, or an attempted murder, of defenceless people, who perhaps were people killed in front of their own children.</P>
      <P>My saddest recollection is of a cafe that was blown up in Belfast a number of years ago.  There were 300 people killed and maimed.  The saddest thing I saw was two people who visited my premises in Killarney while on their honeymoon. They had been in that cafe and they were in wheelchairs and will be for the rest of their lives.  How many people visited them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a public representative complain that this Bill should make provision for public representatives who would visit these prisons and that the people concerned should not suffer the loss of any visits because these visits were made by public representatives.  He meant that the public representatives would go and it would not affect the number of visits by the parents or relatives.  One person said that he was going to travel to England with the mother of this man who was <Col N="1472" /> charged and who was in prison to get an extra visit.  I did not hear of anyone going to visit the people who suffered as a consequence of this man's actions.  When a person is murdered it is over and done with, but the person who has been maimed has to live and everyone has to look at him suffering for the rest of his life.  Most of these people are innocent.</P>
    <P>People speak of prison hardship and say that prisoners are suffering.  In my view, Portlaoise prison is a Grade A hotel that provides billiard tables, snooker tables, colour television, videos and a library.  Some inmates, when they are served their meals show their thanks by throwing a bowl of boiling soup on the person serving the meal.  I do not know how anybody could think that there is anything wrong in extraditing from this country anybody who has committed any of those offences, offences not only in the North of Ireland but bombings such as that of Harrod's, bombing of innocent people.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a man was travelling south on his holidays.  He went in to cash a cheque in a bank in Tramore.  The bank was raided in his presence and he was shot in front of his son because he was in the way.  I could instance numerous examples.  No adult should need to be reminded of these things.  The cost to the taxpayers of these prisoners is enormous. They are people who have tried to destroy, disrupt and overthrow the Government of Ireland.  Compare them with people who have spent their lifetimes working for this country, who are dedicated to the country and building it up.  Such people are asked to live on an old age pension of £40 or £45 a week. It is sad to think of the money we are spending looking after prisoners and yet we cannot find enough money to look after our own people who have served the country so well.</P>
    <P>I do not see how anyone could complain about this Bill.  Mr. McGlinchey, known as the &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo; was wanted in England, Ireland and Northern Ireland. When he was arrested, taken to the North and convicted in the courts there was an appeal to that court, and the man was let <Col N="1473" /> out, free to go back into Ireland.  There cannot be anything wrong with the courts in general.  There may be isolated cases. Senator Eoin Ryan spoke about what a certain judge did, commending somebody who had committed murder.  One will always get that.  Sometimes one will get the wrong decision.  If there is a wrong decision in the courts, whether through human error or otherwise, the people have the facilities to appeal that decision. If their case is a good case they have nothing to be afraid of.  I can walk down the street.  Nobody is going to pull me in under the Offences Against the State Act on suspicion of having committed any political crimes because people know I just go about my business.  They do not do it.  That applies to every other citizen and anyone who lives his life as he should live it.  Law abiding people have no fear of courts, police, jails or prisons because their use will never apply to them.  The people who are complaining are the people who cause this trouble.  I do not see where the rumours of complaint lie.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Leary and Ferris have covered the situation well.  Senator O'Leary mentioned many of my points but he expressed them better than I would have.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify the question of consultative arrangements. Section 3 (a) (i) (1) states:</P>
      <P>In case the specified body is Aer Lingus, is recognised for the purposes of collective bargaining negotiations either by that company or by Aerlinte and represents a majority of the employees of those companies when the numbers of employees employed by them are added together,</P>
      <P>I think there might be some confusion in the way that is worded.  Consultation does not imply consultation and agreement. It just means private consultation and discussion.  In a company that has the right of collective bargaining, there could be some confusion that it means a collective bargaining process when it is merely a consultative process.  I see a distinction between the two.</P>

      <P>On this section, perhaps the Minister would elaborate at this stage why there are two particular approaches as set out in sections 3 and 4 to the initiating process for sub-board participation arrangements.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a point before I reply to Senator Hillery's question. It was felt, in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman and with the legal advice which we received, that two separate approaches would be required to allow for the possibility of two different situations, one where there was a clear majority of workers in a particular enterprise unambiguously in favour of such an approach and such development of worker participation, and the other where there would be a dispute as to whether there was a requirement for such an approach and for the establishment of participation.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This showing of interest by 15 per cent is an interesting idea.  I came across it first in the context of the unionisation process in the United States where the National Labour Relations Board which administers the main labour laws acts as the agency to facilitate the unionisation process.  I take it the idea is the same, to get a showing of interest before proceeding further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind it is that where there was doubt as to whether the majority of workers wanted to have a poll which would lead to worker participation there had to be in a sense, to use the American analogy that Senator Hillery referred to, a kind of a primary where 15 per cent of the workforce indicated they were interested in having worker participation and the poll that would go with it.  The section provides for a poll of employees in a State enterprise to ascertain whether a majority want participation or not.  This, in effect, is triggered by an application signed by <Col N="1476" /> 15 per cent of the workforce in the enterprise. The rest of the section is essentially the procedures which a poll would have to be conducted.</P>
      <P>The subsection to which the Senator was referring to, requires the appropriate officer to take a poll of employees in a State enterprise to ascertain whether a majority want participation or not.  It is triggered by an application signed by 15 per cent of the employees.  The subsection also requires the appropriate officer to appoint a period of from one to 30 days for the taking of a poll.  He must also appoint a day within seven days of receipt of the application referred to as the appropriate day.  Only those who are employees on that day will be entitled to vote at the poll.  The procedure for triggering a poll is unambiguous and can be used when it is unclear whether a trade union or trade unions represent a majority of employees and where for any reason the options at section 3 are not appropriate.  It is anticipated that most cases would be dealt with through the first option, section 3.  Other cases would be dealt with through the second option, and very few cases will require a poll. The period for casting votes etc. can be as long as 30 days.  This is to allow the necessary flexibility for a large organisation which may have many widely dispersed locations.  The appropriate officer is also given flexibility in picking the day of the week which would qualify those employed on that day to vote.  This is to avoid any administrative problem if the appropriate day were fixed by legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is really a fall-back position, where there is a degree of ambiguity in the perception of whether the workforce want worker participation.  The section is very explicit &mdash; it is quite long &mdash; and it is designed to have a triggering mechanism which then automatically sets off a very clear procedure.  The reason we felt it would have to be as explicit as this was if there was in the very first instance a doubt whether the workforce wanted it the procedures would have to be set down very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I also noticed in the <Col N="1477" /> explanatory memorandum that no further poll may be held for four years should a majority of employees reject the proposal.  How was the four year period arrived at?  Again, I can draw a parallel with the unionisation process in the United States where there is a decertification process for unionised employees.  We are not comparing like with like but the idea is the same.  I wondered how you reached four years because it would be longer than practice in other countries albeit not in precisely this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unionisation in the US, while it is a useful analogy, is somewhat different.  We really wanted to harmonise the period, the duration of office, that a worker director will have.  As you now know it is to be four years instead of three.  We have used the same period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 49, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) In the absence of any Agreement, the information to be furnished or disseminated by the specified body, shall include such information</P>
      <P>(a)  as may be prescribed by the Minister</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b)  such other information as the specified body would be obliged to furnish if it were a Company under the Companies Act, 1963, as amended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I would like to request clarification.  If I understand it rightly, the words proposed would strengthen the section in the following way. <Col N="1478" /> The section speaks about an agreement that might emerge but the circumstances to which the amendment is addressed is in the event of a failure to have an agreement.  Therefore it reads:</P>
    <P>In the absence of any Agreement, the information to be furnished or disseminated by the specified body, shall include such information (a) as may be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As may be prescribed by the Minister&rdquo; enables the Minister to exercise discretion as to what he would consider to be the minimum information that is necessary.  The second part, (b), of the amendment states:</P>
    <P>such other information as the specified body would be obliged to furnish if it were a Company under the Companies Act, 1963, as amended.</P>
    <P>That is information which is not only of value and importance to employees but which also could be argued is necesary within the norm of public accountability.</P>
    <P>The problem about the section should these amendments not be included is that the information to be furnished could be the subject of a managerial veto or could be left to managerial discretion which might or might not be in either the employees' or the public's interest.  If the participative structure which is described as a sub-board structure is to have any meaning, it might be useful if the Minister would take the right to specify the kind of minimal information I mentioned or equally if he were to take a model, which is a minimal one, from the amended Companies Act and regard that as the criteria.  I cannot understand, in the absence of such criteria either by ministerial prescription or by taking the model of the Companies Act, how you would resolve the situation where there was not agreement and where the balance had gone in the direction of managerial discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling this amendment we are concerned that the information to be furnished is subject to managerial veto or that it could be left to managerial <Col N="1479" /> discretion.  If this were the case the question of the sub-board structure could be reduced to a talking shop.  We are trying to ensure that there are minimum heads of information to be prescribed in the Bill or by regulation.  I trust that some of the other sections may strengthen the structure, for instance, taking sections Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.  There may be some substance in trying to circumvent any sort of effect that this is likely to have.  This is our main concern about the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the sub-board structures go this is the most important section.  I understand what Senators Higgins and Harte have in mind.  Regrettably there is a long history of sub-board structures dealing in trivia.  As one noted writer said, sub-board structures have dealt for too long with such matters as toilets and tea towels.  While I can see that information is important &mdash; later in section 6 this is mentioned &mdash; there is no indication of the type of information that should be provided when the sub-board structures are established.  I, too, look forward to the Minister's response in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would refer Senators to section 3 where it is stated that:</P>
      <P>the specified body shall, as soon as may be, make arrangements pursuant to section 6 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in a legislative obligation to make arrangements.  Secondly, I can understand the concern of Senators Harte and Higgins in relation to the nature of their amendment and its motivation. However, we should recall that we are dealing with legislation governing State companies.  For the worker participation legislation to be extended to State companies, it requires the consent of the line departments as well as the Minister for Labour.  Under the normal legislation by which any State company is established, be it by statute or under articles of association or by memorandum of association in the case of a <Col N="1480" /> limited liability company, there is provision for the Minister to give a direction in the first instance.  If the fear of the Senators is that there would be a delaying process whereby there would be endless discussion about the nature of the agreement, there is in another body of legislation, and we can go into each individual company, but in each of those individual companies the line departments particularly and the Minister for Labour would have the legislative instruments and the legal power to direct a company to do a particular thing.  That reinforces the &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as well in section 3.  I would be reluctant to have that power thrust on a Minister for Labour for this reason and this gets back to the philosophical position we had at the time of the Second Stage debate.  If it appears that the Minister has the power to make agreements in the nature and the form suggested in the amendment, it would be an easy way out for both management and labour to say, &ldquo;if we cannot agree let us kick it up stairs and let the Minister try to decide what is the best way to have an agreement for the sort of information in question.&rdquo; That would, in principle, negative the whole thrust of the legislation.  The concern of the Senators is that this legislation should not provide a loophole or a safety corner, so to speak, where endless discussion could be used instead of coming to an agreement.  We are satisfied because we have had some time to look at the amendment, even though it was circulated at short notice that if we introduced the amendment as it is, it would cast a doubt on the meaning of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in sections 3 and 4 (8).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that satisfy the matter of the minimum heads of information? From personal experience I know that these consultative arrangements can finish up like works committees, talking about minor issues such as soap.  It can be reduced to that when you are really trying to do something for State enterprise in the sense of not only helping to improve industrial relations but trying to get people to work towards the principles of peace, work and health. <Col N="1481" /> If a reference to minimum heads does not go on the record, that could present us with a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's response interesting and helpful in many ways.  I can see the point relating to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in section 3 (b) of the Bill.  I take the Minister's point that we are talking about State enterprises and semi-State bodies.  We are talking about bodies for which there is a responsibility located in a particular Ministry, as the Minister for Labour and the Public Service has pointed out.</P>
      <P>Let me make one general point.  If we were not talking about State and semi-State bodies I would be pushing this even harder because of the disgraceful lack of commitment by the major parties to implementation of freedom of information and the whole spill over from the Vredeling debate and so forth.  We are talking about State and semi-State bodies.  I am worried about the relationship between this instrument, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act as it might be, and the specific legislation governing each of the companies.  Is there a danger that, if it is not expressly and explicitly stated here, this is the instrument against which you will have a more lax interpretation, as the Minister points out, in the legislation governing the operation of the particular bodies?  That is the worry which exists.</P>
      <P>The other point is a simple one and the background in many cases.  What the Minister states is correct in relation to Departments dealing with bodies and companies.  They vary in relation to their response to issues that are stated to them regarding the provision of minimal information. This amendment is more motivated by the recognition of the breach than by the observance.  It was very much motivated by the fact that there are examples of State and semi-State bodies that have been brought to the attention of different Departments, where information was withheld and where the whole mind of management was not set towards the implementation of the spirit of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> Should this section have a minimal expression and can we rely on the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in sections 3 and 4?  Will that be sufficient to override interpretations of the other legislation?  Are we assisting the other legislation or are we weakening it by this precise formulation we have in the section?  The motivation of the amendment was to have such a specific reference as would not enable it to be watered down.  I take the Minister's point that it was not the intention of the amendment to create a situation where people would cynically try to avoid agreement and simply use such a procedure as a residual category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Michael D. Higgins, I feel that everything should be done in legislation to ensure the maximum dissemination of information and I agree with that part of the amendment. But on the other hand, I sympathise with what the Minister has said in regard to this legislation.  He is endeavouring to produce alternative ways of setting up a participative procedure under sections 3 and 4.  But in each case these are models in which the initiative and the motivation comes from below.  I feel that it would be extremely dangerous if we depended on the imposition of any movement from above.  This might defeat the whole purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say in passing that this is the second piece of legislation we have had in this regard.  The original legislation was started in the State bodies.  It was hoped that it would be so successful there that it would serve as a model for private industry.  I am afraid we must express disappointment there, whether it is the failure of the private sector to imitate, or it was the failure in the public sector to take full advantage of both sides in what was available to them.  The Minister has given another opportunity here.  Unless we get the initiative and the motivation coming from below, we are not going to solve the problems that plague us at the moment.  I say that as one who has, over many years in this House, pleaded for the right of information on the part of <Col N="1483" /> employees and of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can see that the Minister is trying to steer a somewhat delicate course really.  After all, in the Morrissey report, the report of the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation, there is considerable employer resistance to the approach the Minister is now adopting.  The FUE, for example, do not favour a statutory approach to sub-board structures, and they have their reasons for that.  A further reason I can relate to what Senator Michael Higgins has just said is that implicit in what the Minister has just said there is a reliance on the line Department to act.  That would bother me to some extent.  In other words, I think we should go as far as possible in the Bill if we want to enact it at all.</P>
      <P>I have in mind &mdash; and I raised it on Second Stage&mdash;that there are two vacancies on the B &amp; I board under the 1977 Act.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which recently examined B &amp; I.  We had a comprehensive presentation from the trade unions in B &amp; I.  There was very strong criticism of the Minister for Communications for not filling the two board vacancies which he should do in honour and by the letter of the law.  Following that public hearing I want to raise that matter here.  However well intentioned the Minister is at this point, at the end of the day he is relying on his colleagues in Government and whoever happen to be the Ministers of the day to actually act in this respect.  I am just giving an instance, under the parent Act in this case, of a keen disappointment for the people concerned and a source of worry. Furthermore, I might add that the two vacancies in B &amp; I have occurred because the two former worker directors are now redundant.</P>

We want to provide a framework within which things &ldquo;shall&rdquo; happen &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in a legislative sense &mdash; but there <Col N="1484" /> is a triggering imperative in, for example, section 4 (8) 6 of the Bill which states:</P>
      <P>In case the majority of votes is in favour of accepting the proposals to which the ballot paper relates, the specified body concerned.</P>
      <P>&mdash;which would be the enterprise&mdash;</P>
      <P>...shall, as soon as may be, make arrangements pursuant to section 6 of this Act.</P>
      <P>In our legisation that is a very clear and unambiguous statement.  There is an onus and an obligation upon the enterprise to proceed along a certain course of action. That is a very clear and unambiguous statement that there is an onus and obligation upon the enterprise to proceed along a certain course of action.  There is both the remedy of the court and the remedy of the Oireachtas for people to invoke if for whatever reason a particular board, a managing director, or a State company may be in financial trouble, such as the case in the B &amp; I who are reluctant to act on this.  I am not a lawyer but it appears to me that anyone going to court invoking this section has a very clear case if the ballot is clearly in favour of the arrangement.  We were trying to reach the balance whereby things would definitely be put into place but that we would not be required to prescribe their form or shape.  This point was made by Senator Dooge.  This must, in essence, come from the ground up but we must ensure that the ground has room to move, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think &mdash; and I have got advice from the civil servants who are with me on this, because I understand and share the sentiment that has motivated the amendment &mdash; that our response would complicate and make more difficult the balance between the participatory process coming forward with its own arrangements and its own prescribed forms, etc.  Even if they do talk about tea towels and toilets it is for the participatory process to raise the agenda to other matters.  Once people start talking they are talking on one side or the other and if one side allows itself to be confined <Col N="1485" /> to tea towels and toilets there is a limit beyond which a framework of legislation for participation can go.  We cannot prescribe the agenda at that point and say that it is a voluntary process as well.  At the end of the day it is a bit like the democratic process &mdash;&mdash; we have been responsible for the democratic process but we cannot necessarily be responsible for the parties that emerge within it or for some of the policies they advocate or propose.  To a certain extent there is an obligation on us to provide a framework in which these things can occur without prescribing the form, because the paternalism of our society is such that the minute we have the possibility of prescribing a form both sides will find it easier to kick it upstairs, force the Minister and the civil servants to produce a prescribed form and then attack it from both sides as the Minister interfering in the affairs of the company.</P>

Valid points have been raised but not ones we have been able to resolve on Committee Stage.  I agree with the Minister &mdash; as anyone with any experience of work places in Ireland would &mdash; that a discussion on the toilets would be well worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The direction we are taking in relation to information and information disclosure, which hopefully will be a feature of the sub-board structures, is a step in the right direction.  I mentioned that I am a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and when serving on an earlier committee we examined Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta, in identifying the main problems of companies that sought their financial help from the manufacturing sector, identified the reluctance of top management to disclose <Col N="1486" /> information to any interests about the plight of the company, and that included the employees.  All too often you have employees left in the dark until it is too late and yet at the same time they could be the very people who have probably one of the biggest stakes in the success and continuation of an enterprise.  This could be followed by closures when their good will could have been employed for the rescue of the company.  Equally in the case of Irish Shipping, a company we also examined, if there was more information disclosure about the operations of the company the expertise that unquestionably existed in the staff could have been tapped and liquidation could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister why he has gone this statutory route because there is considerable resistance from the employer end?  I know we are not talking about the private sector.  Quite clearly these are State enterprises and we have a number of worker directors.</P>

      <P>One of the points I feel very strongly about is an extension of the point made by the Minister in one of his replies.  I would like to thank him for looking at how the spirit of the amendment we have suggested might be accommodated. If this Bill is to be implemented the mind of the parties involved is very important.  I can think of clear examples in some of the bodies that are mentioned in the Schedule where some of the people said to me very recently, in relation to something &ldquo;Managers manage and workers do what they are told&rdquo;.  You cannot legislate to change the mind of some management people involved in <Col N="1487" /> certain bodies.  The fact of the matter is that even though the game has changed in terms of its basic rules the people are the same and they have brought their pre-legislatively prescribed democratic formula mentalities with them.  Unfortunately, in the case of worker flexibility you will find that people much further down the line are delighted to be released into new opportunities but they are simply stuck with somebody up on top who is not philosophically or practically committed to this kind of information. There is no point in not taking into account the kind of shock participation is to many people involved in management in Ireland.  I have seen great evidence of it even in relation to the professional management training bodies and the courses to which I have seen them released.  I have not seen as much emphasis on the human factor and on, for example the morality of sharing information as much as I have on what I would call lower grade competence in responding to external opportunities, including fiscal and technical ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is really to do with the line departments and the response from the line departments.  I am familiar with a certain amount of experimentation that has taken place in a number of State-sponsored bodies on sub-board structures and one in particular. I am aware that a certain amount of time and experimentation is necessary to get the formula right.  In one State body designated for worker directors it took several years to get a workable sub-board structure, which was one without legislation.  I am not pushing the Minister to be specific about what should be disclosed, my concern in the Government context is more about the getting the line departments to respond promptly and fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer firstly to the point made by Senator Hillery and then to the points raised by Senator Michael Higgins.  I do not believe that a voluntarist tradition &mdash; to use the favourite <Col N="1488" /> phrase of the FUE in the broader sense of the word &mdash; will, without the prompting of some form of legislation, bring about a participatory process.  They are great espousers and apostles of the voluntarist tradition but there are very few volunteers within it, as far as I can see. That is the reason the motivation was in the legislation in the first instance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of information, there is a culture in some of the line departments, particularly those that have a very commercial orientation, that they reflect the style of management within the country generally.  That is the point to which Senator Higgins was referring. There are many people in the Civil Service who have taken on board the culture of management, particularly from the private sector, and who would listen to a view that was clearly articulated. There is a dissenting report in the Morrissey worker participation report from the FUE, which would, without reflection upon the individual involved, find an echo in some commercial partners in the State to reinforce the tradition that, if you give people information, it is more damaging than liberation and so on.  It is not a point of view with which I agree but it is a point of view which is expressed and which attracts a considerable degree of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between a line Department, a subsidiary enterprise, such as a semi-State company, and the Department of Labour under this legislation would have a fourth dimension to it.  In an enterprise where, for example, there were no directly elected worker-directors these provisions will apply in companies where there are not such directly elected worker-directors.  In the political culture, which we have evolved over a number of different Administrations, there usually is social partnership representation in some shape or form.  If you go down through the Schedule of the companies there are many people either representing congress or representing a union in the area, appointed in a personal capacity but <Col N="1489" /> clearly representing the workers' organisations in that regard.  If you had a stalemate where, notwithstanding the provisions in section 4 (8) and section 3 (b) and where that was not being pushed very strongly by the line Department and where the line Department was not exactly in opposition to the companies responsible but on the contrary was tactically in favour of the resistance and where the employees wanted to invoke this process and to have it invoked in the full spirit of the legislation, I envisage that they would have access to the board in the normal course of events through the representation about which I am talking even though they would not necessarily have a directly elected director.  We are a fairly small homogeneous society in that respect and the capacity of the Irish people to love each other is pretty substantial. I am quite confident the process could be invoked if there were resistance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of information which is a slightly broader one but which is in the amendment tabled by Senator Higgins and Senator Harte, the House will be interested to know that the companies Bill is now at a very advanced stage and I expect it to be published very soon.  It makes substantial provision for updating and improving the process of the body and the content of information a company must provide.  Of course, there are various directives from the EC in this area.  American practice paradoxically is far in advance of Irish practice or other European nations' practice as well.  It goes for better participation and for better collective bargaining if people can agree the figures and know the figures on both sides.  There is nothing more calculated to obscure a discussion or a process than not having the facts on both sides of the table.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I have clarified the intent in the section and answered the concern of the two Senators who raised it, but we are satisfied that the provision will enable an appropriate sub-board structure to evolve and that there is in the imperative of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; a clear <Col N="1490" /> triggering mechanism in legal terms that would bring it about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the United States experience and, of course, it is true that it is commonplace nowadays to find a very high degree of co-operation between unions and management in the United States. To a considerable extent in the recent past this has been triggered by recessionary conditions.  From the management viewpoint &mdash; and of course they are not all angels &mdash; they are concerned with costs, particularly with labour costs and they have sought individual employee commitment to enterprise objectives.  In other words, they try to close the gap between the two sides.  We now have a situation in the United States where full time union officals are engaged with boards of directors in a highly participative fashion for survival, first of all, and then for the continuation of the enterprise.  Of course, the ideological differences are in turn rather different from the history of these islands in this part of Europe.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister cannot include everything in one Bill.  He touched on the possibility, if not probability, that there could be some management, or even board, resistance in some State-sponsored bodies in relation to the establishment of sub-board structures.  One difficulty in this area is the presentation of the information to the employees.  How is it presented? Is it intelligible?  If it is to be made intelligible it gets us back to the ability of the employees to understand it and that, in turn, raises the question of training literally for information dissemination and absorption.  While I say the Minister could not include everything in one Bill, if this is to succeed it is critical that an adequate amount of meaningful information is disclosed on the one hand and, of course, on the other, that the employees are actually able to understand it and they need to be facilitated and trained to do just that.  I would like to know the Minister's views on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very much with <Col N="1491" /> what the Senator is saying.  The practice in the United States is quite different. The most spectacular example was the co-operation between the United Automobile Workers' Union and both General Motors and Chrysler and the rescue package for Chrysler and subsequently in the rationalisation in GM where they established a development fund which is jointly managed by the trade unions and GM to set up new businesses for workers who would be coming out of the spare labour capacity for new job creation.</P>
      <P>In the Irish context we have a different problem.  The trade union political culture is different and the British have the same system.  The spirit of William Martin Murphy is not totally dead in Ireland.  We have a fair bit of it around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The real problem is that we have far too many unions and as a consequence the quality of the trade union official and his or her capacity to provide the information needed and to get the back-up service to spend the time to explain to members and to do so in a manner that is clearly capable of being understood without ambiguity, is something that, with perhaps the exception of two to three unions, the vast bulk of Irish trade unions simply cannot undertake. For quite some time Congress have been advocating a rationalisation of trade unions.  My first introduction to the realisation of the large number of trade unions in Ireland was from Senator Hillery when he lectured me on trade unions and professional practice in the College of Engineering in 1968.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is known that we have 90 unions, 70 within the Republic, and <Col N="1492" /> many of them simply do not have the capacity to provide the social services needed, notwithstanding the fact that we give the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as stated in the Estimates for the Department of Labour, approximately £630,000.  There is also technical assistance available through the TAG system. The training and development of the work force in any enterprise in a period when adaptability to change, particularly market forced change upon a company, are such that there would be an obligation that that adaptability be changed by management in a manner that is constructive and productive at the end of the day and some allocation of resources out of total amount available for retraining and training should go to the process of information and communication.  I am very much at one with what the Senator is saying but, he rightly says one cannot do everything in one Bill.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to something that parallels the activities of this legislation. In most of the State companies, particularly in those that have worker participation by virtue of their size and shape, there is room for this kind of thing. There is an attempt to disseminate information in a manner that is easily understood by different people but the practice varies from company to company, even within the narrow family of State companies. I am reluctant to prescribe a model or to suggest how that should be done because at the end of the day the test is whether people understand the issues and come to a decision that is to their mutual advantage.</P>

      <P>I see a danger of us wandering all over the place on the question of worker participation.  What we are after is a common knowledge and a common interest on the question of getting the highest effort possible out of them or making an effort towards a common end.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  In regard to the amendments we put down, both Senator Higgins and I would be satisfied, having regard to what the Minister has said, that not only is there further legislation liable to follow but <Col N="1493" /> there is scope, in addition, for future company law to be of substantial interest to the trade unions.  The position has been met with regard to the amendment we put down.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 7, I welcome the fact that it requires a State enterprise to describe in its annual report any action taken during the year to introduce sub-board participating arrangements and any participated agreement made during the year.  I do not want to refer too often to the committee on which I am serving, but there is plenty of room for criticism about the very wide variety of annual reports. It is extremely difficult to compare them across the board and, in addition, there is rather scant information in certain respects.</P>
      <P>One recommendation we made in the context of a recent report we issued in respect of the 26 commercial state-sponsored bodies which were within our remit is that corporate plans should be reported in the annual reports.  I raised that with the Minister for Finance last year and he referred to the confidentiality risk but, of course, in some of the State enterprises &mdash; several of them monopolies &mdash; confidentiality is not really a big problem. Equally, disclosure of information in the annual report about progress on sub-board structures could not be construed as affecting confidentiality.  I am very glad this is included.  The more information we get in annual reports the better, and I am glad that there was the vision to build it into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Senator's support for the proposal.  I was very anxious to have this provision inserted when we were drafting the legislation because it will have a demonstration effect on other companies.  On the general <Col N="1494" /> question of reports, far more energy, time and money goes into the glossy publication and production of the report rather than its content.  The printing costs of some of the reports relative to the extent of their information is totally disproportionate. In section 7 (1) the objective is to ensure that the information contained will have a demonstration effect on the participants in the enterprise and will be capable of being readily and clearly understood with regard to the process of participation by the public and by other State companies.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 provides that expenses incurred by State enterprises in establishing and maintaining sub-board participative arrangements shall be borne by the enterprise itself. That makes sense.  However, there is a tendency in many companies, including State companies, to refer to cost pressures and in the course of expenditure to prioritise what they see as important and less important.  Training is an area that tends to take the knock in recessionary conditions.  One could argue that training was never more important.  Training for change, for flexibility and adaptability is never more important than when a company is under severe financial pressure. It is one thing to establish the structure, it is another to prepare in a comprehensive way for it.  That is time-consuming and, therefore, there are costs associated with it.  My concern would be that on cost grounds a State body could use the excuse of lack of finance to get on with the job of implementing the sub-board's structures as envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a sustainable case could be made.  Depending on the physical composition and location of the enterprise &mdash; and probably the most dispersed <Col N="1495" /> that comes to mind would be CIE in terms of the number of different locations on which people in that company would have to be contacted &mdash; in terms of cash and additional outlays of moneys, the cost would largely be confined to printing and to postage where postage was necessary.  The only other cost in terms of time would be the opportunity costs of management.  It would be very hard for any company &mdash; I am reacting to what the Senator has said &mdash; to sustain the argument for any length of time, that they do not have the necessary time to do it.  If they did not have it then it would be a matter of management making extra time available.  They are not on a fixed 35 hour week.  If they are, they are not doing their job.  They have to be able to respond to certain circumstances. This would only occur once if you were setting up the process.  It is a once-off thing that would at most happen every four years.  It would be very difficult to justify saying the provisions in sections 3, 4, and 6 could not be proceeded with because of lack of money.  I cannot anticipate what the reaction may be.  Section 8 states:</P>
      <P>All expenses incurred by a specified body in relation to the establishing and maintaining of arrangements pursuant to section 6 of this Act shall be borne by the specified body concerned.</P>
      <P>It is clearly an enabling provision to ensure that they are within their own mandate in expending moneys for this purpose and are not acting outside the statute under which they were established if they are not a company under the Companies Act.  I understand the fears but I do not think it would be sustainable because the costs would be minimal other than the costs I referred to previously.  It would be manageable to work extra overtime should that be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely putting it down as a marker, perhaps a small marker in practice.  From the knowledge <Col N="1496" /> I have of companies both in the public and private sectors, those who have addressed the question of sub-board structures in a very serious and meaningful way, have set up joint working parties &mdash; it is not merely a question of managerial time &mdash; in order to secure the co-operation of the employees.  That is vital.  They have had to address the question of sub-board structures over a considerable period of time.  I was referring to the opportunity costs; I could envisage a situation where they would argue they would be quite substantial in the sense that they might argue there are other more urgent priorities than implementing this.  It was in that same context I raised the question of training, which tends to drop in the scale of priorities when companies are under financial pressure.</P>

      <P>The development of this process, if it is done in a constructive manner, will enhance the viability and the profitability of the enterprise and its efficiency.  Therefore, while there may be a short-term outlay on cost, be it opportunity costs on both sides &mdash; and you are right to put down that marker &mdash; the long-term benefits, if properly handled, would more than offset any start-up costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of course.  Certainly, the hope would be that the longer term costs would more than justify the efforts expended. However, precisely because there has been such a poor history in the establishment of support structures you have actually had to introduce this legislation, so that it would appear that many managements in the public and private sector would not share the view that there are in fact longer-term benefits and they would rather rely on voluntary means which may not achieve what you want to achieve.</P>

It really should be a matter for Senator Hillery who is alone on the other side of House and contributed constructively to this Bill.

There will be the Courts Bill, the Exchange Control Bill and the Appropriations Bill.  All these items must be disposed of tomorrow. I have just been handed a further note to indicate there is a very distinct possibility of emergency legislation, coupled with an early signature motion, on the matter that has appeared in the press this evening.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 19 December 1986.</P>
