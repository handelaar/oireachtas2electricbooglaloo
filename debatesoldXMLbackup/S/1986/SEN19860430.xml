      <P>I have had notice from Senator Michael Smith regarding a motion which he wishes to move under Standing Order 29.  I now call on Senator Smith.  I might mention at this stage that Senator Ferris had mentioned the same type of motion to me some day last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Seanad under Standing Order 29 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, the disastrous consequences on Irish agriculture of the agricultural price package as agreed by the Minister for Agriculture in Luxembourg and the urgent need for the Government to demand a special meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to review the farm price package.  I would appeal for time to be made available.</P>

      <P>I have decided that the motion is one covered by the Standing Order and I ask the Senators who support the request to rise in their places.</P>
      <P>
        <i>More than five Members rose in their places.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the intention is that the Seanad will sit not later than 10 p.m. <Col N="400" /> this evening.  Since the maximum of one hour and a half is allotted to the Adjournment Debate under Standing Orders the debate will therefore, take place at 8.30 p.m. or at the conclusion of the business ordered, whichever is the earlier.</P>
    <P>I also have notice of two matters on the half hour adjournment from Senator Mark Killilea concerning the Letterfrack &mdash; Tullycross group water scheme and from Senator Helena McAuliffe-Ennis concerning the civil legal aid and advice scheme.</P>
    <P>In view of my acceptance of the motion raised by Senator Michael Smith, a matter on the half hour adjournment cannot be taken today.  Senators Killilea and McAuliffe-Ennis may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>This is a motion on the Adjournment which I have requested for some time.  It concerns the decision by the Office of Public Works to prevent a group water scheme in Letterfrack and Tullycross in Connemara because, they say, it would upset rare heather.  I am as upset about it as the people in the community who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Item Nos. 1, 2 and 4.  Senators will recall that last week on Committee Stage of the Health Bill a certain point in the debate had been reached.  It was indicated that Committee Stage would be adjourned and taken first thing today.  It happens that the Industrial Development Bill, which might have been taken last week if the Health Bill had been finished, is a relatively urgent measure.  Accordingly, the appropriate thing is to order No. 1 but we should limit the discussion on No. 1 to 30 minutes.  In that way, in relation to the Committee Stage discussion, the Minister's view can be made known and there can be reaction by Senators to it.  I would suggest that at 3.15 p.m. we should adjourn that debate and move on to No. 2, the Industrial Development Bill.  If the Industrial Development Bill is not concluded in all its stages today, it is proposed to take the Committee Stage tomorrow morning.  It is a matter for the House to decide how it wishes to divide the time.  The position is that the Bill is an urgent one.  However, if it does pass before 2.30 p.m. on Thursday when the Minister will be required in another place for Questions, there would be no need for item No. 3 on today's Order Paper. In view of hour and a half's debate on a matter of urgent public importance &mdash; a debate in which Members from all sides of the House would wish to participate &mdash; it is proposed not to take Private <Col N="402" /> Members' business in addition.  This does not affect in any way the right of Fianna Fáil to move the motion next week nor does it affect the time that will be available.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I know that the Bills before us are important but there is a Bill which I think this House should take as a matter of extreme urgency, the Air Pollution Bill, 1986.  This Bill might not take in the effects of pollution from abroad, such as may be carried into this country from Sellafield and as a result of the major breakdown of a nuclear plant in Russia. We had a debate last week on terrorism. We must consider that the breakdown in this nuclear plant is an act of terrorism against the world that cannot be quantified.  Nobody knows yet what the effects of that particular breakdown are.  Last week the Soviet news was stated to have reported that it was one of the safest of the nuclear plants in Russia.  This week it has been the most serious breakdown in any nuclear plant that has ever occurred. There are rumours of the number of people who have been killed.  We must sympathise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point. It has been suggested that we must sympathise with the people of the Ukraine who are members of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  However, there is a news blackout.  We must ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that foreign diplomats and media people be allowed in to check out what exactly did happen in that particular area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support Senator Lanigan in seeking to bring forward the Air Pollution Bill, 1986.  This matter of the nuclear leak is one of even more seriousness than he is indicating. While I absolutely accept that a debate on agriculture is an urgent one, I would suggest that it is the duty of the relevant Minister and the Government, who I would assume to be the Minister for Energy, to come to make a statement to this House in connection with the nuclear leak in the Russian power station today, and not to be waiting around for when the Order of Business will allow for the Air Pollution Bill, 1986.  This is a matter which affects every one of us, whether we are involved in agriculture, industry or anything else.</P>
      <P>There has been a statement in another place but it is the due of this House that the Minister come in and make a statement on the present position with regard to the nuclear leak about which the news is getting worse by the hour, not just by the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask that the Air Pollution Bill be introduced in this House.  I support Senator Lanigan.  With special reference to nuclear plants I would describe as internationally scandellous the attitude of the British Government towards our request that Sellafield be closed.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House to take seriously our request to reintroduce the Copyright <Col N="404" /> Bill to the Seanad.  This is urgent legislation that we support and it needs to be implemented.  Defects in the Copyright (Amendment) Bill were pointed out in this House.  This Bill was withdrawn for rewriting.  We are in our second year now and I feel that it is high time that this Bill was re-introduced in this House.  There is growing concern in the country about the spread of video nasties.  This was what the Bill was all about and that was recorded.  Two years have elapsed.  The main thrust of that Bill was to control videos and to prohibit the sale of video nasties in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with Senator Lanigan.  While I always try to agree with Senator McGuinness, I think that the disarray in which the farming community have been put, due to the decision in Europe this week of our Government through its Minister to accept the deal, is in its own way on equal terms with any nuclear disaster that could happen.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House to tell me if he could direct his attention to item No. 4 on the agenda. It is a Bill that was brought here with, I thought, very apparent haste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the remarks of Senator Lanigan, because this is a very important piece of legislation which would allow us room to discuss this problem.  In case the House would be of the opinion that the Minister responsible is not aware of it, this matter was discussed at our party meeting this morning. <Col N="405" /> The Minister is, in fact, issuing a statement about the Soviet problems, not alone the people who have died and the lack of responsibility in regard to how information was released, but also the millions of innocent people throughout the whole country who were at risk.  I support the contention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Air Pollution Bill, is a Bill of prime importance.  I think everybody realises that.  It will be taken as soon as legislation such as the Industrial Development Bill and the CIE reorganisation Bill have been disposed of.  I might mention that the Minister responsible is anxious that the report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC on acid rain, which appears as No. 10 on our Order Paper, be debated at the same time as the Second Stage of the Air Pollution Bill.  It is impossible, of course to say when that is going to be reached. Senator Killilea expressed the fear that we might not reach the CIE Bill today, in which case it is almost certain that that will be given a very early priority.  We are still in the middle of the Health (Amendment) Bill.  It may well be that there is a fair bit of the Committee Stage to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will realise that in a few weeks we will be getting the Finance Bill.  If we are to be given adequate time for the discussion of the Finance Bill, this will occupy two full weeks of the Seanad's time.  At the conclusion of that, it is likely that the Constitution (Amendment) Bill will have come to us from the other House.  While I have been endeavouring to give as high a priority as possible to the <Col N="406" /> Air Pollution Bill, it would be extremely foolish of me to give any sort of pledge or guarantee that the Air Pollution Bill could be reached before the month of June.  It is there in a position on the Order Paper indicating its priority.</P>
    <P>Regarding the query from Senator Lynch relating to the Copyright Bill, I thank him for reminding me about this. It is some time since I last prodded the Department in regard to this Bill.  I will take up the matter immediately.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Killilea, I would anticipate that the CIE Bill will be ordered and if not completed today will be ordered and hopefully completed next Wednesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the time that the Leader of the House has given does not allow for very much legislation to get through this House over the next few weeks.  We have decided that we will take legislation on Wednesdays and reports of committees on Thursdays.  I would suggest that the Whips get together to see if we can bring forward legislation which is necessary to be got through.  I suggest that the Air Pollution Bill should not be taken with the report on acid rain because they are two totally different subjects.  Each of them needs a major debate.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Whips get together to decide if we should sit on extra days. Do we take legislation as against discussing reports on the second day or otherwise sit on three days to ensure that legislation which is important such as the Copyright Bill and other pieces of legislation, are discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are people in this House who will not see fit to come here on three days.  If we are going to get through the business of this House we have to sit either on extra days or extra hours or forget about taking the reports.  It is unfortunate that the Dáil has not seen fit, as a House of the Oireachtas, to deal with major reports coming from committees that were set up.  When these committees were set up it was supposed to be a reform of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="407" />  Unfortunately, what has happened is that we have been trying to get through the reports but the other House has not even attempted to discuss the reports that are before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>To respond to that, the anxieties which the Leader of the Opposition has expressed are ones which have been passing through my mind over the past few weeks.  The suggestion of having an informal meeting of representives of the groups to discuss this is an excellent one.  I propose to try to arrange such a meeting during the course of today's sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>As agreed last week in view of the suggestions made by several Senators in relation to subsection (2) (a), I did undertake to have another close look at the situation. I have discussed the matter with the Attorney General's Office and with the senior parliamentary draftspersons directly involved.  I would like to make the following points to the House.  First of all, as we agreed, there is little point in substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; on line 12, page 3, of the Bill because it would not have the effect desired by Senators.  I had originally offered that, but not in any very firm or hopeful way.  A change merely of that nature, unless the remainder of the subsection was also amended to remove other elements of discretion which are permitted to health boards, would have little point. We will leave that by agreement at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, therefore, it comes back to the question of whether the power to waive the whole or the part of a charge should be mandatory on health boards in all cases or whether these powers should be discretionary.  I think it boils down to that.  Considering all of the possibilities that may arise in any one case I consider that the health board must be left in a position to make a decision on each individual case regarding the facts of the case placed before the board.  Moreover, I have had a general overview of these types of actions.  In most cases many of them never reach a hearing and many are settled on the basis of a global general settlement.  In such global settlements the costs of hospital services are usually not distinguished and neither is reference <Col N="409" /> made to any specific degree of contributory negligence.  Therefore, it would not be possible in those cases for the health boards to be obliged to waive charges in circumstances that are not very specifically set out.  Where they are not mandatory, it is of course open to the health board to exercise that general discretion.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the Bill is designed to enable charges to be made by health boards for in-patient and out-patient hospital services provided for persons in respect of treatment for certain injuries caused by the use of mechanically propelled vehicles in public places.  While I have built in safeguards for the person injured, I must ensure that the prime purpose of the Bill is adequately covered as far as possible. The health boards have to be in some position to protect their interests, which are the interests of the taxpayer at large, in order to avoid, in particular, the possibility of any collusion that might arise in relation to the settlement of claims and, indeed, to ensure that charges for services provided are not generally ignored when settlements are arrived at or, indeed, in the bustle of the Round Hall negotiations which are well-known to some Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I might point also that an attempt to try to draft legislation which would cover all the complexities &mdash; these are multiple in the case of road traffic accidents &mdash; to cover these in all type of settlements would make the Bill enormously cumbersome and possibly unworkable in practice.  I strongly point out to Members of the House that the old regulations in force since 1971 had operated generally with considerable success up to December 1983.  They were operated without complaint.  We do not have on record complaints from members of the public about draconian imposition by health boards in seeking recoupment of hospital charges.  In fact, the general indication we have is that health boards bend over backwards to help and to operate to the benefit of the patient or the prospective patient.  The discretion is used very much in that direction.  We do not have complaints <Col N="410" /> from the public.  We did not have them about the considerable period in which that discretion was exercised. Therefore I am satisfied that that situation can continue.  I want to reassure Senators that I will be issuing a quite specific circular to the health boards in relation to this matter indicating that it has been raised in the House and indicating the views that have been expressed here and saying quite clearly that I wish to see the Bill when enacted implemented in that manner.  I propose to issue that particular statement to the health boards and the CEOs as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>I have consulted at length about the matter.  I am delighted with the advice I have received on the basis of the stated objective of the Bill and the safeguards that have already been built in under the Bill to protect the injured party from hardship.  I hope that my parliamentary colleagues will accept my view that we should if at all possible proceed with subsection (2) (a) as it was drafted as being in the best interests of all concerned.  It is the best we can do at this stage if I may, with that confession of humility, make that point to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am a little unhappy with the outcome of the discussions that the Minister has had over the week.  I felt at the end of business last Wednesday evening that there was a very real possibility that the Minister would accede to the amendment.  In the point he has made now about leaving it up to the discretion of the health boards, he is trying to suggest that health boards will be helpful &mdash; and I think health boards will be very helpful &mdash; but I think on the question of the specific circular to all the health boards, in a few years time it can be said with certainty that it will mean nothing at all once this Bill is passed and has become law.  Circular letters from anybody at that stage will have no effect. It might, in the short term, but over a period of years Ministers, CEOs and health boards change and so on, and it becomes lost in situations like that.  What <Col N="411" /> really counts is the Bill as produced on the day.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has a point which I would accept.  He referred to out-of-court settlements and a kind of global settlement where the question of contributory negligence might not arise but there are many cases that go the whole way to the High Court.  In that case it has been suggested down the years that 25 per cent or 50 per cent or some percentage of an award can be attributed to a form of contributory negligence.  That is the real worry Senators have in this area. For example, a person receives an award of, say, £60,000; let us assume he has 50 per cent contributory negligence, so he receives £30,000 and there is a health board bill of £20,000.  Will the health board be sympathetic?  Will they decide that they should take only 50 per cent of what they are entitled to?  Some health boards may but, given the perilous situation health boards find themselves in today, my bet would be that they would be entitled to seek their full pound of flesh.  If they are owed £20,000 and an award has been made of £30,000 they will feel entitled to receive their full £20,000. That being the case, one could suggest that this Bill is somewhat unjust because of the wording of that section.  I am not fully happy with the situation.  I would much prefer if the Minister could see his way to accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very unhappy with the situation.  We had a very lengthy discussion on this problem here last week.  In the Minister's own words he promised to ruminate on the problem initally overnight and then, when the problem became more obvious, over the week.  The situation is that we are here to legislate and try to reach some form of legal certainty in terms of the legislation that we help to produce.  The onus on us to do so is always there but it is particularly obvious when we are legislating for a situation where this House is really attempting to rectify something created when a ministerial order made by one of the Minister's predecessors under the <Col N="412" /> Health Act 1970 was held to be <i>ultra vires</i> his powers under that Act.  We are now trying to rectify that by legislation.</P>
      <P>What we are doing is creating a situation of uncertainty and we are also creating potential inequity for people who may be the subject of this legislation.</P>
      <P>For that reason I would ask the Minister to think and think again between now and Report Stage.  The fact that there are difficulties and I think he said that there are difficulties in resolving the problems &mdash; gives in a sense a negative response to the issue which was raised last week. The positive problem is that there is a difficulty.  There is a difficulty within the section and I am not happy with the situation whereby the Minister says he will issue a circular to health boards.  My understanding is that we legislate in this country in various ways but we now have a new form of legislation, that health boards will be bound by ministerial circulars, documents which will be pinned on the back of a door of a programme manager which in time will become covered in dust until something else is pinned over it, maybe a more attractive calendar or something like that.  I do not think that that is a satisfactory response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go over the arguments which were outlined in some detail last week but I want to say that section 2 (1) is mandatory in that it imposes an obligation on a health board.  It states that a health board shall make a charge upon the person who receives or who is entitled to receive such damages or compensation.  An obligation is therefore imposed on the health boards.  Section 2 (2) is discretionary in that under the circumstances envisaged in subsections (1) and (2) the health board may waive payment.  The one that gives me greatest cause for anxiety &mdash; and I mentioned this last week &mdash; is the situation where contributory negligence is held to exist by a court or indeed where a settlement is reached and the settlement is reached on the basis of contributory negligence. So there are two separate situations which can exist there.  Obviously, if a court determines the matter and makes an award and contributory negligence <Col N="413" /> enters into it, the court will state the proportion which arises.  In that case there should be no difficulty for the health board.  Taking that case the health board is not bound by the apportionment that the court makes.  The High Court can make a particular apportionment in relation to negligence but the health board is not obliged to adhere to that.</P>
    <P>Ministerial circulars and ministerial directives may indicate to health boards what they should do but health boards are autonomous bodies as we can see from the week that has passed.  When health boards are financially stretched, as we gather they currently are they may say: &ldquo;Let us waive a little but not waive as far as the High Court or the Circuit Court or indeed the District Court might specify.&rdquo;  In so far as the determination of contributory negligence is provided, then I think there should be the power to waive <i>pro rata</i> in relation to this. Secondly, in cases where there are settlements, my understanding and experience would suggest that if there is an element of contributory negligence a settlement bears that in mind and in trying to settle a matter one would normally settle it on the basis that there is not contributory negligence and then apportion the figure downwards on the basis of whatever negligence is alleged against the plaintiff.  I do not think the difficulty is as great as the Minister states.</P>
    <P>There is still a very serious problem here.  With respect, I do not think the problem has been constructively addressed.  The matter will have to be taken care of before this Bill leaves the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point being made.  I think a distinction should be made in a situation where a court or jury has stated exactly what the element of contributory negligence is.  In that case if they say contributory negligence was 50 per cent then I think the health board should have to accept that that is the amount by which they should waive their charges.  In the case of a settlement, it is a much more difficult situation.  I think an amendment should be brought in to <Col N="414" /> deal with that.  There should be a distinction between the two.  I see no reason why the health board should not have to abide by a decision of the court as to what the element of contributory negligence is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's &ldquo;rumination&rdquo;.  He has restated the problems that exist and, of course, they are very real problems but he has not addressed the problems which were pointed out to him on this side of the House.  The problems are correctly stated by Senator Durcan.  We have two separate and distinct problems.  There is the problem that exists where a court adjudicates on the question of contributory negligence.  I cannot see any logical reason in that case why there should not be a statutory obligation on the health board to take that into account.  There is no point in getting a second organ of State to adjudicate separately and to make a separate decision in such cases.  It has been decided by the court that there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff of X amount, and that should be accepted.  I do not think anything the Minister said or any of the difficulties he pointed out or any indication of what past practice was justifies departing from the principle laid down in the Act, the obligation on the health board to take into account proportionately the amount of contributory negligence found by a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to settlements. Since the Minister spoke last week, I have also done my homework and I have spoken to people who were active in this field at a time before <i>Cooke v. Walsh</i> was decided.  I was told that no great difficulty was experienced in the case of settlements; I confirm what the Minister said in that regard.  In discussion with these individuals they said that on examining the legislation which is now before the House they would feel in a far more vulnerable position now than they were under the 1971 regulations.  The 1971 regulations make no reference to abatement.  It was a practice which grew up and which was accepted on all sides.  <i>Cooke v. Walsh</i> eliminated that and new ground <Col N="415" /> rules are now being established in the context of the health boards being short of cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that what the Minister says is correct.  I also recognise that what we are deciding is that the health costs of motor accidents should be borne by the premiums of insurance policies.  I am not making any serious objection to that but the reality is that we will have a new set of rules, we will not have the reintroduction of the 1971 set of rules; we will have a new set of rules which contain an element of discretion and which must be viewed against the background of the difficult financial situation in which health boards find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation the problem that arises with regard to settlements, the pattern that will develop over a period of time is probably the same pattern as applied after 1971, but there is no guarantee that it will be.  The pattern that will develop will not guarantee in an individual case what the attitude of an individual health board will be.  The difficulty for a solicitor or any other legal adviser in advising a person to settle in advance of an agreement from a health board will be that they will not be sure that in the particular case the discretion will be exercised in a proportionate fashion and that their <Col N="416" /> assessment of what the element of contributory negligence is will be accepted by the health board.</P>
    <P>There are two separate points and I think I have a solution to both of them. One is I do not see why the Minister cannot make it statutory in the case of an adjudication by the court.  Nothing the Minister said convinces me even in the slightest that there is any reason why that cannot be done.  All it requires is the division of subsection (2) into two sections, the first portion saying a health board may waive the whole or part of a charge as it considers proper having regard to the amount of damages and the second part saying that a health board shall waive the whole or part of a charge under subsection (1) of this section in a case where there was contributory negligence and so on.  All you have to do is divide it into two, use &ldquo;may&rdquo; in one and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the other.  There is absolutely no problem.  It is not a difficult drafting problem.  It can be done very easily by dividing subsection (2) into two sections, subsection (2) and subsection (3).</P>
    <P>The other problem is more difficult.  I think it can be solved by a small amendment to subsection (3) which I mention now because it is relevant to subsection (2).  The recovery of the amount of money is dealt with in subsection (3) and we will deal with that when the time comes.  No matter what we say in this House the court will have jurisdiction to review the amount of that liability.  What is important is that the court will be given specific legislative authority to review the way in which the health board has exercised its discretion so that whether it is in the District Court or in the Circuit Court or in the High Court that the attempt is made under subsection (3) to recover the money it would be open to the court in arriving at its decision as to the amount of money due and, the amount of money being due, to review the manner in which the health board have exercised their discretion.  That problem would be overcome by adding a sentence after the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; in subsection (3) which would say something like, &ldquo;the court shall be entitled to review the manner in which <Col N="417" /> the health board exercised its discretion under section (2) of this Act&rdquo;.  That solves the problem in so far as that at least in the case of the solicitor who is going to negotiate with the health board and says this case was settled on the basis of 25 per cent, and the health board disagree with him at least there is some tribunal which can adjudicate on this matter.  That will encourage commonsense and will guarantee that it will not go to court if such provision is made in the legislation. There is no reason why the Minister cannot put an obligation on the health board in the case of matters decided by court and cannot so adjust the remainder of the legislation as to give an element of review in the way in which the health board exercises discretion &mdash; a review which the High Court would have in any case but to make it part of the legislation so that the court in which the money is being recovered can itself act under powers granted to it in the legislation to review the reasonableness of the health board decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything that my colleagues have said.  We are putting a Health Bill through this House. Following the debate last week, I thought the Minister would amend this legislation after the case made by my colleagues.  I sit on health boards and so have all the elected Members here.  The Minister comes in here and says that he is going to send a circular to health boards instead of putting it into the legislation.  Senators Durcan, O'Leary and Fallon last week agreed to wait a week for the Minister to go to the Attorney General.  I think he should listen to the three lawyers here also who have the political and legal expertise.  I am puzzled as to why the Minister is sending a circular to health boards instead of putting what the Senators are asking into section 2.  We are not supposed to refer to advisers and officials in this House, but in fairness to the Minister when he left the House last week &mdash; he has been a long time in politics and dealing with health &mdash; I think he intended to change that part of it.  Why it would not be put into the Bill before it <Col N="418" /> is passed rather than send a circular to health boards is something I do not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the Minister for the efforts he has put into meeting our wishes.  If we tease it down a bit further we will know the reasons. No Minister can put any legislation through the House without having regard to the legal opinion available to him.  The highest opinion available is the Attorney General.  As Senator Durcan said, the previous legislation was put through probably on that advice and it was then discovered to be defective by the Supreme Court.  The problem is that where a decision is made in a court which attributes certain elements of contributory negligence, you have some precedent in a court of law that the health board should have regard to; but where decisions are made outside of that there is no guideline for the health board to act on.  They have certain powers given to them in this Bill.  In section 2 (1) (c) the health board</P>
      <P>shall, notwithstanding anything in the Health Acts, 1947 to 1985, make a charge upon the person who received or is entitled to receive such damages or compensation in respect of the said in-patient services or out-patient services.</P>
      <P>We are putting a responsibility on the health board to do that.  But having done that with no guidelines we are now faced with the dilemma that we are allowing them a certain discretion in section 3 (1), which says:</P>
      <P>Any sum due by a person to a health board under section 2 of this Act may be recovered by the health board from the person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a way the provisions are contradictory. We are asking them to do it and then we say you may do it in a certain way as a simple contract of debt.  Who decides what the level of the contract of debt is? Senator O'Leary suggested a formula, by subdividing the section, that would leave <Col N="419" /> the health boards and their legal and financial advisers in no doubt that we are legislating in a particular way.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that health boards are compensated for the services they give but with regard being had to the ability to pay of the person for whom damages were agreed, so that such person would not be penalised by a section which gives a discretion to the health board to do so.  I have no doubt that the Minister has looked at all the aspects of it, but if he could respond in that light it would help.  We want to make sure that discretionary powers are not administered in a way that could create hardship to people who were unfortunate to have an accident, but twice as unfortunate to be 50 per cent negligent in the accident with the resulting injuries, expenses etc.  Whatever arrangements are made in or out of court, the legal representatives will always be looked after; but it is not always necessarily the case that where you have an injured party they will have somebody to look after them.  I want to make sure the health boards will look after them because that situation could arise.  We have certain legal advice available to us; but we do not want two court cases, one to make a decision about damages and another initiated by the health board to recover what they consider are their rightful dues from the person awarded damages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable charges to be made by health boards for in-patient and outpatient services provided for persons in respect of the treatment of certain injuries caused by mechanically propelled vehicles in public places.  The more we qualify this Bill and the more we introduce circumstances circumscribing the prospect of charges being made, the more the prospect is that this Bill could suffer <Col N="420" /> the same fate as the 1971 regulations. Those regulations crudely withdrew eligibility.  This Bill is different.  There are a number of circumstances.  I will give one example here.  A person reaches agreement with an insurance company for £100,000 and in the process of the claim being made £50,000 of that is due to the health board, which is small money for hospital charges in a road accident case. If you take £600 a week for 52 weeks of the year the person in hospital &mdash; any kind of reasonably acute hospital now is £600 a week &mdash; that is £30,000 for the first year and £30,000 for the second year. If you have multiple injuries you would be in hospital for the best part of two years, leaving out operation costs but just maintenance alone.  So the insurance company know what the claim from the hospital is, because they have given in advance clear notification to the person that there is £60,000 due.  The insurance company says to the client: &ldquo;Will you agree that you are 90 per cent contributorily negligent and we will give you £100,000?&rdquo; If we are to follow the logic of what is being suggested by way of an amendment here, what happens?  The client collects £90,000 and laughs all the way to the bank with it and the unfortunate health board, who are looking for £60,000, get, under the amendment suggested here, £10,000.  Is that the intention of the amendment?  Equally we have got to bear in mind that both sides go into court and have this approved by the court, 90 per cent confession, admission and formal registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, we know quite well that a large number of settlements are made outside the jurisdiction of the court.  Where negligence is admitted outside the jurisdiction of court in an informal way, it has no bearing at all on the health board formally getting some money in their hands. You can have a situation &mdash; there are many around &mdash; in which a person of 50 or 55 years of age finishes up with multiple spinal injuries, a broken neck, likely to be on the flat of their back in a bed for the rest of their life and at 55 years of age with a good constitution, they would live for another 20 years.  That is at £30,000 <Col N="421" /> a year in current money terms.  That is £600,000.  A settlement can be of very substantial proportion but the health board must have some prospect of being enabled to obtain recompense for the services delivered.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this point specifically.  All preoccupations which Senators have given quite correctly and understandably in the past to discussions we have had on this matter, are covered by and large in section 3, whereby any sum due by a person to a health board may be recovered by the health board from the person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  I have not got the slightest doubt that if a person gets a health board bill arising out of a settlement &mdash; remember the health board will not see a penny of that money until after the person has actually got the money and it might to be five years down the road with services having been provided &mdash; and feel or their legal advisers feel, that the charge is unduly draconian, it will be hotly contested.  It will go back into a court of competent jurisdiction. The health board will be obliged to face the prospect of costs in relation to the recovery of the debt allegedly due by the citizen to the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's industrial development policies have been under intense scrutiny and reassessment since the late seventies. Senators will be familiar with the major report of the Telesis Consulting Group and the associated comments of the National Economic and Social Council. The Industrial Development Authority produced their own internal strategic plan in 1982 and there have been many articles and reports by industrialists, research institutes and economic commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy, published in July 1984, constituted the Government's response to the debate on industrial policy and outlined a coherent <Col N="423" /> and comprehensive ten year strategy for industrial development.  The Industrial Development Bill, which is before the House today represents a further important stage in the progressive implementation of the new industrial policy. Moreover, the new Bill brings together, for the first time, in one comprehensive code, the existing body of legislation relating to industrial development and the IDA.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I would like to set out the objectives of the new policy as contained in the White Paper. (i) to create and maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs, as many as possible of them high-skilled, in manufacturing and international service industries; (ii) to maximise value-added by these sectors and to capture the wealth thus created for further investment and employment creation in the Irish economy; (iii) to develop a strong and internationally competitive industrial sector in Ireland, made up of both Irish and foreign-owned industry; (iv) to promote the more rapid development of our natural resource-based industries, particularly food and timber; (v) to promote the integration of foreign industry into the Irish economy through greater linkage with Irish industry and educational institutions; and (vi) to improve the rate of return on the Government's investment in the commercial State companies.</P>
    <P>This new policy is being actively implemented.  Before outlining the general contents of the Bill, I would like to set out for the information of the House a list of some of the new initiatives being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The National Linkage Programme got under way in July 1985.  The objective of the programme is to develop a successful subsupply industrial base in Ireland for larger industry.  From its initial focus on the electronics sector, it is now being extended to health care, consumer products and engineering.  In 1985 a national linkage team of experienced engineers and management and financial accountants was assembled from a number of the major state agencies.  By the end of <Col N="424" /> 1985, 45 electronics multinationals were involved in the programme and the target for 1986 is to place £40 million worth of business contracts with Irish suppliers.</P>
    <P>The company development approach involves the IDA, the IIRS and Córas Tráchtála working closely with selected companies to help them to identify and implement strategic development initiatives.  The programme is designed primarily to encourage indigenous companies to develop to a point where they are capable of developing their own R &amp; D programmes and achieving a strong international marketing position. Fifty-six company development programmes were approved by the IDA during 1985, bringing to over 100 the number of companies which have finalised development plans since the programme commenced.  Already many of the strategic initiatives identified by companies under the programme are being implemented.  The operating target for 1986 is that a further 50 companies will be covered under the company development programme.</P>
    <P>The regionalisation of IDA's small industries programme was successfully completed during 1985.  A full service to entrepreneurs is now available from the IDA offices in the regions except in the case of the mid-west and Gaeltacht areas, where this service is provided by Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. The administration of the small industries programme, including decision-making on grant applications, now rests with the regional small industry boards supported by 130 IDA staff at regional level.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is great potential in Ireland for developing small industries and in recent weeks a number of project and employment announcements have been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which highlight the continued progress we are making in this area.  A total of 735 small industry projects were approved for IDA support in 1985, an increase of almost a quarter on the figure for the previous year.  In the mid-west area covered by Shannon Development 164 small industry projects <Col N="425" /> with a job potential of over 1,500 were approved in 1985.</P>
    <P>A nationwide network of &ldquo;One-Stop-Shops&rdquo; was launched in April 1985 where entrepreneurs will be able to obtain information and advice on all aspects of setting up and running a business.  Initially these centres are operating as an information and research service giving details of all State services to small firms.  The second phase is more ambitious and more important and when completed will result in all the major industrial agencies in the regions either being located under one roof or providing services to the &ldquo;One-Stop-Shops&rdquo; on a visiting or clinic basis.</P>
    <P>A number of new marketing initiatives to assist exporters have been introduced by Córas Tráchtála.  The most innovative of these schemes is the Market Entry and Development Programme which is designed specifically to help exporters with the various expenses incurred in breaking into new markets.  The other schemes deal with (i) building marketing strengths within firms; (ii) market research proposals; and (iii) design and product development proposals.  In aggressively implementing these schemes Córas Tráchtála are focussing on the need to develop a market-led approach by our industries.  This implies a precise identification of consumer needs and putting in place a strategy to meet them in the areas of design, quality, pricing and after-sales service.</P>
    <P>The business development scheme, under which qualifying investors in unquoted manufacturing companies are permitted to write-off up to £25,000 per year against income tax, is designed to increase the flow of equity funds to industry.  The scheme has been improved since its introduction in 1984 and has raised over £5 million in new investment up to the end of the last tax year.  Its attractiveness has been further enhanced with the introduction by the Stock Exchange of the new smaller companies market this year.  Moreover, this year's Finance Bill includes important new tax-based <Col N="426" /> incentives for research and development and for private investment share-ownership in industry.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation Act was recently passed by the Oireachtas and the corporation will soon be in operation.  The corporation is a further vehicle for State involvement in, and the promotion of, industrial development.  The NDC's principal objective will be to invest in viable projects to assist in the maximum level of job creation. Arrangements will be put in place to ensure that there is no overlap or duplication of functions with the IDA.</P>
    <P>A Management Committee on Industrial policy has been established to ensure the prompt and effective implementation of the White Paper policies.  This committee, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department is comprised of representatives of the main industrial development State agencies.  At their regular meetings to date they have reviewed progress reports and submissions from the agencies and have ensured a co-ordinated approach to industrial progress from all the relevant State interests.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the new initiatives arising from the White Paper.  I will refer to some other new measures in the context of the Bill before us here today.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Dáil, there was an understandable emphasis by Deputies on the need to enhance the employment impact from industrial development.  This is, of course, recognised in the White Paper, which set an ambitious target of an average net increase of 3,000 to 6,000 jobs per year in manufacturing industries over the period 1984-94.  These targets are based on a doubling of industrial output over the period.  We will be striving for even better results now because of the more favourable macroeconomic situation.  While to some the employment targets may appear to be modest, in the Government's view it would have been dishonest to set higher targets simply in order to make them more politically palatable.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that in trying to increase direct employment in manufacturing, we <Col N="427" /> will have to achieve results which are in stark contrast with the trend in other western European countries.  Reductions in manufacturing employment are arising in most developed countries from the continuing advances in technology, improving productivity and the decline of certain traditional sectors.</P>
    <P>These trends should only reinforce us in our efforts to maximise the direct and indirect employment spin-off from industrial development.  I am glad to say that the central focus of the IDA in 1986 will be to get a better employment and value-added performance from the existing industrial sector and every encouragement and feasible resource backing will be given to initiatives involving significant or quantum leaps in terms of direct or indirect job impact.  Industrial policy is not employment policy, although it is an important component of it.  Our unemployment position must be tackled on a broader front as set out in the Government's national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the contents of the Bill.  As I said earlier, the opportunity is being availed of to consolidate all existing industrial development legislation into a single comprehensive code. The Bill will, therefore, repeal and reenact with amendments the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1950, the Industrial Development Acts, 1969 to 1981, the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 to 1969, and the Industrial Grants Acts, 1959 to 1969, deleting provisions which are no longer appropriate.</P>
    <P>Following detailed reviews of the structure and administration of incentives for industry in Ireland, the Industrial Development Act, 1969, resulted in the formation of the Industrial Development Authority in their present form.</P>
    <P>Established in 1970, the new Authority were given power to offer a wider range of incentives to indigenous and overseas industry.  Their new package of incentives and services to industry incorporated grants towards the capital cost of new industrial projects, re-equipment grants to assist industry to adapt to free trade <Col N="428" /> conditions, special grant assistance geared towards the development of small industries, training grants, interest subsidies, loan guarantees, equity shareholding, R and D grants, the development of industrial estates and the construction of advance factories.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Industrial Development Authority have served us well since their formation.  Their flexibility and efficiency in encouraging industrial development has been remarkable and is the envy of may countries.  The redefinition of IDA's role in section 11 of the new Bill will ensure that the IDA will be enabled to continue and extend their work into the future.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the Industrial Development Authority is to act under the Minister as a body having national responsibility for the implementation of industrial development policies.  In the exercise of their functions they act in accordance with policies set out for them from time to time by the Minister.  The Industrial Development Authority, together with the other agencies involved in industrial development, such as the IIRS and Córas Tráchtála, will have executive responsibility for the implementation of industrial policies.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made under section 4 of the Bill to allow the Minister to make a more flexible use of designation for industrial grants purposes.  As Senators are aware, this is the system under which certain areas of the country are designated as eligible for a higher rate of fixed asset grant.  As no objective or systematic review or designation had taken place since it was first introduced in 1952 the former Minister, Deputy John Bruton, requested the National Economic and Social Council to prepare an independent and objective review of the use of designation as a flexible policy instrument.</P>
    <P>The council published their report in December 1985, recommending objective criteria, based on labour market imbalances, to determine designated status on a needs basis for the future. Following receipt of the NESC report, the Economic and Social Research Institute were commissioned by my <Col N="429" /> Department to advise on the implications of implementing the NESC recommendations to enable the Government to consider the matter further.  This report has been received recently and is being examined.  I should stress, however, that no decisions have been taken as yet on any changes in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>To ensure that industrial policy evolves in an orderly and planned manner and that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are made aware of the costs and benefits of industrial policy at regular intervals, the Bill includes in section 6 a new provision for a review of national industrial performance every three years. These triennial reviews and the conclusions arising from such reviews will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. This is an important provision as I believe that Government policy in an ever-changing sector such as industry needs to be dynamic and constantly fine-tuned to maximising new opportunities and technical developments.  In fact, a policy review of developments since publication of the White Paper is already underway within my Department.  The review group are addressing a number of important issues, such as how direct employment can be maximised from the industrial sector and what further steps can be taken to develop indigenous industry.  The results of the review will be available before the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>The Bill for the first time will provide, in section 13, for the issue of directives of a general policy nature to the Authority, subject to a number of safeguards.  Such directives shall not apply to any individual industrial undertaking or to the location of an industry other than as part of a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole.  Copies of all directives given by the Minister under this section must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 21 days.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill sets out the new selectivity criteria under which the Authority will provide grant assistance to industry in respect of fixed assets.  These criteria will also apply to leasing grants, rent subsidy grants, loan guarantees, interest subsidies in relation to fixed <Col N="430" /> assets, training grants, the new technology acquisition grants, the incentives for enterprise development and equity participation.  Other grants programmes, such as research and development, international services and the incentives in respect of restructuring of industry, will remain subject to their existing criteria.</P>
    <P>The new grant criteria were outlined in the White Paper and will be substituted for the criteria set out in the two-tier grant system in sections 33 and 34 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  The new criteria overlap with the old as regards the necessity for financial assistance, the permanence and viability of the firm, the provision of employment, use of natural resources and technological content.  There will be no change in the maximum rate of grant which may be made, which will remain at 60 per cent in the designated areas and 45 per cent in the non-designated areas.  However, the average level of fixed asset grants will be gradually reduced so that savings may be applied to technology acquisition grants and the new marketing initiatives.</P>
    <P>This is quite important because the White Paper on Industrial Policy clearly envisages a shift in resources from fixed assets to technology acquisition and marketing, and this reduction must be made to effect that shift.  In addition, the new selectivity criteria will focus on the need to develop and increase linkages between overseas and indigenous industry and in particular the development of import substitution projects and export markets. Employment creation and maintenance, in addition to the new emphasis on output growth and generation of value-added within the economy, will continue to be the main focus of State assistance to industry.</P>
    <P>The conclusion in the White Paper on Industrial Policy was that grant assistance should be directed to remedying perceived weaknesses in Irish industry in the areas of marketing, management, research and development and innovation.  Companies approved for grant assistance will, therefore, have to demonstrate that they will comply with the new criteria, have suitable company development <Col N="431" /> plans and also that the equity base-financial structure of the company is adequate.</P>
    <P>An important amendment to section 21 of the Bill was passed in the Dáil which will allow new arrangements to be introduced in respect of industrial development grants for small industry.  The new system allows promoters of new small industry projects, at their discretion, to avail of employment grants as an alternative to grants towards the cost of machinery and buildings.  The result will be to encourage more small industry start-ups.  A promoter will now have the option of using employment grants to acquire modern second-hand equipment which would not qualify for capital grants.  This will be of particular benefit to industries such as clothing and engineering where there is excellent second-hand equipment available at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes a number of changes in the IDA's R and D grant programme.  Under section 29, costs eligible for assistance in future will include the salaries and wages and travel and subsistence expenses of those engaged on the project or in identifying product or process development opportunities within the company.  Secondly, in order to encourage the smaller industrial undertaking to make greater use of the R and D grants, it is proposed to allow the Authority to make advance payments of up to one-third of an R and D grant to small industry.</P>
    <P>It is now recognised that small companies are often more innovative than the larger companies, yet at the same time do not have the financial resources available to devote to a concerted and systematic research and development effort.  This new provision will assist the smaller undertaking involved in research and development and considerably ease their cashflow and working capital requirements.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that we can no longer rely exclusively on overseas investment as a means of improving the level of technology in Irish industry.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy stated <Col N="432" /> that the IDA would be empowered to give grants not exceeding 50 per cent towards the costs of acquiring new product or process technology.  Section 30 of this Bill will enable the IDA to give such grants and sets out the costs which will be eligible for grant assistance.  Product or process technology for the purpose of grant assistance will include patents, designs, trade marks, trade secrets, copyright and proprietary and non-proprietary know-how.</P>
    <P>A number of other minor technical or general amendments have been made in regard to grant schemes, incentives and equity participation powers of the Authority, the Government's powers in regard to grants, the period of appointment of, disqualification of and declaration of interest by Authority members, and the delegation of functions to boards and committees.  It is also proposed that a new limit of £700 million be set on the total expenditure by the Industrial Development Authority as from the coming into force of the new Bill.  This will enable the Authority to carry out their functions for a further three to four years and will allow the Oireachtas to review the operations of the IDA at that stage.  I will be happy to elaborate further on Committee Stage on these provisions, which are primarily of a regulatory or controlling nature or are designed to make explicit, provisions which are already implicit in the existing industrial development legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions in the old legislation are not being re-enacted, including the IDA's re-equipment grant scheme, which was of special significance during the seventies in the modernisation of industry to assist it to operate in free market conditions.  During the decade over £450 million was approved for Irish industries under the programme.  The programme helped Irish firms to adapt to the free trade conditions brought about by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and Ireland's subsequent entry to the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The programme was phased out in the early eighties and ceased in 1982.  The <Col N="433" /> Industrial Development Bill repeals these provisions permanently on the basis that they have served their purpose and continuation of the measure could no longer be justified.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply in regard to the IDA's powers to provide and arrange housing for employees in industry.  I am satisfied that it is no longer appropriate that the IDA should retain this power which is more appropriate to the local authorities, the National Building Agency and the private sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by making some general remarks on the outlook for 1986.  The growth in manufacturing output and exports is expected to continue.  Investment by industry is expected to continue at a high level, resulting in the creation of 12,000 new jobs in IDA-backed firms in 1986.  I expect this development will be encouraged by the continuing fall in inflation, the reduction in the price of oil and favourable currency exchange movements.</P>
    <P>The ESRI publication, <i>Medium-term Outlook: 1986 &mdash; 1990,</i> published some weeks ago, predicts that total employment in the economy is expected to stabilise in 1986.  The manufacturing sector is expected to make a positive contribution to this improved situation.  Medium and large Irish-owned companies will be encouraged to come forward with job-creating investment proposals.  The State agencies will continue to work with a range of firms to encourage them to draw up strategic development plans with a view to increasing the job contribution of indigenous industry in future years.</P>
    <P>I believe we have the right policies and that the new Industrial Development Bill will facilitate a renewed impetus to industrial growth and prosperity.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before commenting on the Bill, as the Minister mentioned copyright I would like to say that both Senator Howard and myself are looking forward eagerly to the re-introduction of the Copyright Amendment Bill because, as I said earlier today, there is widespread growing concern with regard to the <Col N="434" /> spread of video nasties.  The main purpose of the Bill is to deal with that.  We have pointed out the defects in the Bill and I am sure they will have been remedied.  We would greatly appreciate if the Minister would use his powers to have that Bill reintroduced.  We will support him in bringing in the legislation to ensure that this plague of video nasties does not spread further.  It is a terrible disgrace to allow them into any country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill before the House, as vice-Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, I welcome this Bill.  It is in the context of the Bill's effect on our small manufacturing firms that I will address my remarks.  The Bill is largely a consolidation measure of all industrial development legislation since the 1950s.  It also provides for a significant number of changes which will have a major impact on our smaller manufacturing firms in particular.  These are the ones that our committee are mainly concerned with.  I refer to businesses comprising of from one employee up to 100 employees.  The Committee on Small Businesses published their report on manufacturing industry on 10 May 1984, a report which was debated in this House on 12 September of the same year.  I am glad to see that some of our work is reflected in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 21, subsection (3), sets out the main criteria under which a firm may qualify for a grant from the Industrial Development Authority.  These criteria as they relate to manufacturing industry are that a grant-aided undertaking will (1) produce products primarily for export, in particular, products which utilise our own raw materials and natural resources; (2) produce products of an advanced technological nature for supply to internationally trading or skilled sub-supply firms within the State; (3) produce products for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to international competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These criteria are broadly acceptable in that they focus on the main priorities for new industrial development, as the Minister said but are also flexible enough <Col N="435" /> not to exclude worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>However, it is in the commercial and development criteria set out in section 21, subsection (4), that are of more specific interest in relation to our smaller firms. These criteria are set out in subsection (4) as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) financial assistance is necessary to ensure the establishment or development of the undertaking;</P>
    <P>(b)  the investment proposed is commercially viable;</P>
    <P>(c) it has an adequate equity base;</P>
    <P>(d) it has prepared a suitable company development plan;</P>
    <P>(e) it will provide new employment or maintain employment in the State that would not be maintained without assistance given under this Act and increase output and value-added within the economy.</P>
    <P>That is very important.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal in particular with the issues of a sound equity base and company development plan.  There is no reasonable doubt that the great majority of our small manufacturing firms are overborrowed.  We discovered this in the process of taking submissions when producing our Oireachtas Joint Committee report on manufacturing.  We have a situation where 70 per cent of borrowings and 30 per cent equity is the norm.  If one bears in mind that most borrowings are often short term, usually under three years, and that we have very high real interest rates, then we must conclude that most of our small industrialists are working for their bank managers rather than for themselves.  Although this situation is clearly very unsatisfactory, too many of our small manufacturers will not accept outside equity participation on the basis that dilution of the control of their company is not acceptable to them.  Each man, especially the small man who has built up his own business and developed and expanded and who has received financial assistance from the banking institutions, wants to retain his sole right <Col N="436" /> as the owner, manager, the secretary, marketing manager, etc.  In a way we cannot blame them for it.  If manufacturers in this position would objectively analyse their true situation and ask themselves what degree of real control they now exercise over their overborrowed firms, I am sure they would see the benefit of accepting outside shareholders in preference to being trapped within the spiral of debt.  The lower a firm's borrowings the wider are its choices.  We now have the business development scheme and the small companies section of the Stock Exchange to facilitate investment in the share capital of smaller industrial firms. The IDA and the State agencies should insist that these facilities are availed of, if that is what is in the best interests of the firm.</P>
    <P>In our report we laid major stress on the need for good management in our smaller firms saying, and I quote:</P>
    <P>All research in business success and business failures reaches a universal conclusion, that effective management is the key ingredient of success and weak or inadequate management is a primary cause of failure.</P>
    <P>Planning is an integral function of effective management and the Bill is right to stipulate a requirement for company development plans.  A development plan need not be and should not be, certainly in the case of small firms, an expensive bound volume of charts and projections prepared by equally expensive consultants.  However, each small firm should be capable of setting realistic sales targets on a three year basis, of identifying all their requirements to meet targets, and of having the means of funding these requirements.  A company development plan should not be regarded as a bureaucratic imposition by outside investors, by banks or by State agencies on hard-working entrepreneurs.  It is first and foremost a framework within which an industrialist should justify his proposals to himself, to determine whether they are feasible or need to be modified, to identify problems and see how they may be resolved.  The <Col N="437" /> main beneficiaries of good planning are the companies themselves.</P>
    <P>In our report we asked for greater flexibility in the grant aid package to include: (1) Export marketing expenditure; (2) State guarantees and working capital and loans; (3) Approval for secondhand machinery.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a problem with regard to grant aid for secondhand machinery.  I have come across many cases where it would be much easier for an entrepreneur to start up his business if he had grant assistance towards the provision of secondhand machinery.  The committee discussed this matter.  One case was brought to light where somebody had bought a secondhand machine that was supposed to be one year old and when the motor was checked it was found to have been rewired ten years previously.  There is a problem admittedly.  I know of a very reputable firm which has machinery which is in very good condition and one of its employees wants to start up a business on his own and work for the company in his spare time.  The firm is willing to sell this machinery to him at a reasonable price.  It is a chrome and polishing business which cannot cope with the workload.  They are very anxious for this particular man to start his own business.  I do not believe it will be grant aided for the secondhand machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Senator to section 21 where we are addressing this problem, whereby a small industrialist can use an employment grant scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which will allow him funds to buy a secondhand machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This man will be starting up on his own initially with the hope of developing his business to the point where that section would be of use to him.  If he has to get his machinery started and build up from there he will not be able to avail of it initially.  The report continues: (4) Grants for fixed employee <Col N="438" /> assets should be optional; (5) Payment of grant without delay after expenditure is incurred.</P>
      <P>This is very important and I would like the Minister to bring that to the notice of his officials.  We have found that where bridging finance was concerned many firms were crippled in the same way as applies to new house loans et cetera, where bridging finance is availed of. Bridging finance builds up to such a level that they are eventually caught.  The same thing happens in the manufacturing area if there is undue delay in payment of grants where grants have been sanctioned and people borrow money on the strength of the grants.  The banks should be a little more flexible.  They have screwed many a firm in this country.  The payment of these grants should be made as expeditiously as is humanly possible.  (6) The availability of long term, 15 to 20 years, fixed repayment loans; (7) the provision of aid in relation to full time employment to firms not eligible for capital grants.</P>
      <P>While the present Bill does not encompass all of our recommendations with regard to the grant aid package, section 21 (5) which provides for employee employment grants for small industrial undertakings is a very significant step forward.  We are providing for the first time IDA grants which will aid investment in labour rather than in fixed assets.  We welcome that move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are EC restrictions on the maximum grants which may be given under this measure.  The upper limit for each additional employee is 13,000 ECUS.  I make that out to be £9,300, which would add to the attractiveness of the incentive package for small industries, particularly in the vital area of new jobs.  Although there is no movement on the question of grant-aiding secondhand machinery, I understand that the Minister's view is that the new employment grant will facilitate labour-intensive firms in purchasing secondhand machinery if they so wish.  In this respect I would prefer a more flexible attitude to secondhand machinery in its own right.  In fairness, I will suspend judgment until I see the new employment grant scheme in operation.  I would ask <Col N="439" /> that the maximum flexibility be observed in the operation of the employment grants.  There are one-quarter of a million unemployed people and that means one-quarter of a million reasons for operating these grants to the maximum effect.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this Bill which I wish to discuss because it reflects a certain realism with regard to the cash needs of small manufacturing firms.  Section 29 (5) provides that the IDA may make payment of up to one-third of a research grant prior to the approved costs being incurred.  I welcome this provision which will be of genuine assistance to small firms engaged in research and development.  We have to get more small firms involved in product research and development on a much more intensive scale. Expenditure on research and development by Irish industries accounted for only 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1984, which is only one-third of the OECD average. The existing research grants with provision for advanced payment to smaller firms of a proportion of the grant, the new 50 per cent technology acquisition grants outlined in section 30 of the Bill, and the personal tax incentives for investment in research and development do provide a frame work for more investment in this vital area.  I hope there will be tangible results.  Product innovation is vital to the survival of firms now more than ever.  Innovation depends on research.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not encompass all of our recommendations although many of our recommendations require administrative action rather than legislation.  We recognise that fact.  However the basic thrust is correct, particularly the new emphasis on employment grants for small firms. I, therefore, welcome the Bill as a step forward for manufacturing firms.</P>
    <P>We all agree that most small firms have high level and low level periods which we describe as peaks and valleys.  It is more prevalent in the building industry than anywhere else.  Most small firms have severe cash flow problems for a certain period of the year&mdash;the valley period. One of the major problems brought to <Col N="440" /> my attention was lack of finance towards marketing.  We discovered in our deliberations that one of the major reasons for failure of many firms was lack of good cohesive marketing and management.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if any action could be taken to prevent a typical case of restrictive practice which has been brought to my attention recently.  The committee have taken a particular interest in the problems facing small industries.  I come from an area where closures have been rampant over a number of years.  I read in <i>The Irish Press</i> recently that the number of companies closing down either through liquidation or receivership jumped from 136 in 1979 to 574 last year.  The same paper a month ago showed that in the first three months of this year there was a further dramatic increase in the number of failures.  As I stated here before, many traders quietly closed their doors and had simply given up.  Would the Minister tell the House whether or not the Bill will create the right business climate to reverse that trend?  I certainly hope it does.</P>
    <P>We would be very concerned with any restrictive practice whereby any firm, especially a multinational firm, or any number of wholesalers or retailers would be seen to be ganging up with overseas manufacturers or multinationals to curtail the sale of a local product.</P>
    <P>I have in front of me a letter from an international firm, Scholl Ireland Limited.  I will quote this letter.  It was sent out to every chemist in this country.  It was given to me by a chemist friend of mine who is very interested in Ireland, and in the small business sector and in maintaining employment here.</P>
    <P>Dear Pharmacist,</P>
    <P>Scholl Ireland Limited are most grateful for the very supportive address made to the Eighth Regional Annual General Meeting by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union's President.</P>
    <P>The President's name is given.</P>
    <P>We offer our fullest co-operation to the Union and its members in ensuring that the sales of Scholl products <Col N="441" /> through pharmacies will increase to the profitable advantage of both the pharmacist and Scholl.  Part of our co-operation will be to alert the IPU's members to real opportunities existing for Scholl products.  As you know we have launched in 1986 a comprehensive programme of advertising and promotional support for the Scholl brand. However, our sales information for the period January to March 1986 would indicate that not all pharmacists are availing of this promotional support especially the opportunities existing for insoles and sandals.  We ask you to give full support to the Scholl brand, the only company investing in promoting chemist confined footwear, the only company investing and promoting chemist confined foot care, the only company investing in promoting chemist confined hosiery.  Their full support will increase your offtake, allow you to fully avail of our advertising support and enable you to generate higher cash margins than anyone else can offer. The opportunities are there to be grasped.  I look forward to sharing the benefit with you.</P>
    <P>In support of that letter the Irish Pharmaceutical Union issued a bulletin to all community proprietory members from the business manager dated 1 May &mdash; No. 2 1986.  I quote this bulletin:</P>
    <P>Yes, we do support Scholl and why shouldn't we?  Scholl products are confined to pharmacies.  Scholl will spend £300,000 on advertising in 1986. Scholl insoles are on television up to 27 April for the first time.  Scholl will be heavily advertised up to and during the <i>Evening Press</i> women's mini-marathon, Whit Monday, 2 June.  Scholl will help train your staff in footwear retailing.  Scholl nationwide window display competition takes place again from April to September.  Scholl foot collection on television, week commencing 2 June.  Scholl will continue 15 new products in 1986 including coppertone natural tan accelerator, a unique breakthrough in the sun care <Col N="442" /> market.  Scholl products are major OTC products.</P>
    <P>We would not worry too much about that aspect.  The final nail in the coffin is from the IPU.</P>
    <P>We do support Scholl because Scholl supports you, the pharmacists.  We must not therefore support opposition products.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious matter.  I would ask that the Department investigate that type of restrictive practice where it is very obvious that there is an effort to gang up with overseas multinationals to keep out the local product.  Senator Fitzsimons was here behind me today.  There is a firm in our area producing locally a product which is able to outsell this product but the heavy hand of the multinationals, which we have stressed many times, will be able possibly to outsell it on the local market.  I do not know if I am right in quoting that here.  If I am wrong, I will apologise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about small manufacturing firms.  There is a multinational firm who have got the support of the IPU, who sent a letter to their members of which the final sentence is &ldquo;We must not therefore support opposition products,&rdquo; even though they would be made in Ireland.  This is a scandalous situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There is no criticism.  I am asking the Minister to use his good offices in Government to try to do something about it.  I support this Bill in its entirely.  It has embodied many of the recommendations of our committee and I greatly appreciate the interest the Minister <Col N="443" /> and the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, have taken in our report and that so many of our recommendations have been implemented.  The matter I refer to is outside the context of the Bill but it seems to me a very urgent one that should receive the attention of the Department. I believe the Department will deal with the matter adequately.  I certainly support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Lynch's last point there which is basically that there is some small business in his area manufacturing this product and there is an international organisation or manufacturer who, in cahoots with a commercial organisation in this country, are saying, &ldquo;look only the products of the international outfit can be stocked and not the local ones.&rdquo;  Senator Lynch is asking the Minister if he has some powers under restrictive practices law whereby he could look into that situation.  If that is what it is, it is a very reasonable request.  As a general comment on Senator Lynch's contribution, it is the usual solid constructive stuff that is typical of him here.  When I tried to catch up on the discussion of the Bill that took place elsewhere I found that there was little of value that I could obtain.  There was a tendency to chase off all over the place. I am not supposed to criticise other places but I cannot but make the comparison. There was a good solid contribution to the debate here and it deserves to be recognised.  Senator Lynch said he welcomed the Bill and recognised the thrust was in the right direction, and that I accept.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge earlier today on the Order of Business made the point to us that there was a certain urgency and a certain priority in relation to this measure, that it was his hope and the hope of the Minister and the Government that the Bill would get through the House with the least possible delay.  Because of that, I have reduced to some degree the contribution I had intended to make.  I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Lynch has shown, this is a <Col N="444" /> non-controversial measure.  It is basically a consolidation measure.  It consolidates the previous legislation in relation to industrial development that has emerged in the State since 1950.  It brings it all into one comprehensive code.  That, of course, is something to be welcomed and something that is desirable.  As the Minister said in his address, it is a follow up, and part of the overall Government strategy for industrial development, employment and job creation.  It is the result of quite a lengthy examination of industrial policy in this country over the past number of years.  The major points in that review were the Telesis report of 1981 and the Government White Paper. The performance of industrial promotion and development was examined and also the performance of the agencies operating in this particular field.  Comments, compliments and criticisms were applied to various aspects of the work under review.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of priority points arising from the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy.  I would also like to refer to some others, because they put in perspective a number of points I intended making but which I will not be making at length. Among the policy objectives, as announced in the Government's White Paper, was the doubling of manufacturing output over the next ten years.  That should lead to a growth of jobs in manufacturing industry of between 3,000 and 6,000 a year.  This would be done by developing a strong international competitive industrial sector, made up of both Irish and foreign-owned firms.  Emphasis was laid on the fact that we needed more highly-skilled jobs and a more highly motivated workforce than is the case at present.  It was an honest observation. Indeed it is one that is necessary and that has to be part of the improved environment that we require for industrial progress.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of that intention to utilise State incentives to redress identified weaknesses in our industrial promotions structure.  The regular sourcing by foreign industry of their sub-supply needs <Col N="445" /> in Ireland is something that has been operating in my own region of the mid-west, I would not be surprised if it was pioneered there.  That sub-supply or linkage policy is something that has been actively promoted by the Shannon Development Company in the mid-western area and is, and has been, promoted quite successfully.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the White Paper also included the rapid development of natural resource-based industries.  Again, that was a point I intended to dwell on at length; but because of the request for a speedy passage, I will not be developing it as I intended to.  Another point made was a need for a strong equity and financial base and the access to venture capital.  The National Development Corporation and this Bill provide the framework to meet these requirements. This should ensure a better performance from State-owned industry, a more dynamic role for Government investment policy in industry, and a more competitive environment for industry due to the reduction in inflation to a rate below that of our main competitors.  I am being quite objective when I say that the Minister and the Government deserve our compliments for having already been well advanced on the road to the reduction of inflation to bring us to a position where we are somewhat below at least one of our trading partners and certainly coming close to parity with a number of others.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also laid emphasis on the need for the creation of higher technology jobs in Ireland.  That has been referred to by the Minister as a growth area, and events over recent years have shown that it is, indeed, a growth area. It is an area that we need to concentrate on.  A category of grant should be introduced to enable firms in Ireland to upgrade their technology through licences acquired abroad.  It says that many of the skilled jobs in the future must come in the computer and computer-related industries.  We accept that.  The measures being taken by the Government are helping to achieve that.  It also stated that the skilled base in Irish industry will also be developed by forging closer links <Col N="446" /> between universities and industry.  I welcome the fact that a special fund has been set aside for joint industry and higher education projects.</P>
    <P>I am looking at a table here which indicates a very welcome shift in the pattern of State aid to industry and industrial development since 1978.  There is a much needed increase in the proportion now going to technology acquisition, marketing and research and development.  They are areas that we have lagged behind in for quite a long time, at a certain cost to our industrial progress here.  It is now recognised that that lost ground of some time past has to be made up.  Steps are being taken and obviously the gap is being closed in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments on the White Paper in relation to our natural resources sector.  It says that Ireland is rich in natural resources but that these resources are not giving their full potential harvest to the Irish people.  There is a need for a better organised food and agricultural industry and a better organised forestry industry.  To achieve this the newly-established National Development Corporation is being given a special role to underwrite the development of long-term contracts between producers, processors and marketers in the food, fishing and forestry industry.  I simply commented on these aspects of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I had intended to develop my comments at some length, but I will not do so now.  That was an expression of Government intention.  It was an indication of their policy that industrial progress, manufacturing jobs and employment opportunities could best be created through industrial promotion and they have taken the steps necessary to implement that strategy.  Among those we had the National Development Corporation Bill not so long ago and now we have this Industrial Development Bill, 1985.  Many of the points that were raised and debated in relation to the National Development Corporation could with a certain validity be raised here, but we would simply be covering old ground and there is no point in wasting valuable time in that regard.  There is a clear acceptance <Col N="447" /> by everybody that we need more sustainable industrial jobs.  It is vital that we aim at the highest number of sustainable jobs. I would like to express a note of caution on that.  If we go overboard on emphasising only sustainable jobs, that there must be a cast iron guarantee that they are sustainable, then we eliminate the question of risk taking.</P>
    <P>In any industrial activity, particularly because of our need for jobs, we cannot work towards a situation where we eliminate all risk taking from it.  Reduce the angle if you like, cut down on risk taking, our policy should be to go for as many sustainable jobs, but not to do it at the cost of avoiding all risk taking.</P>
    <P>Resources are very scarce.  I would assume that the resources available would be used wisely and to effect in this situation.  The objectives of the Bill will supply and supplement and update industrial development legislation.  As a result of this Bill, industrial development legislation is clearly defined and it gives an imaginative mandate to the new IDA.  I agree with the comments of the Minister and Senator Lynch that the IDA have served this country well.  They have often earned criticism.  To succeed there must always be an element of risk taking. Therefore, I think that we should balance our criticism against the very many successful enterprises that have been located in Ireland through their efforts.  The IDA have many successes that are seldom talked of.  Amongst other things, we should always recognise and give them credit for avoiding the De Lorean fiasco, that could easily have been at this side of the Border as at the other.  It was good management, caution and intuition on the part of the IDA that led to the avoidance of that situation.</P>
    <P>The Government are succeeding with industrial development through a package of legislation which includes the National Development Corporation, this Bill and some other measures as well. The Government are succeeding through prudent and effective management of the economy, which is reflected in the improved level of inflation, and reducing <Col N="448" /> interest rates.  I would like to see interest rates at an even lower level.  I do not see the justification for interest rates remaining at that level particularly in view of the level of inflation and the level of interest rates in nearby countries.  They are also succeeding through the improved competitiveness of our industry and through improved industrial exports.</P>
    <P>The principle responsibility of the Government, is to create the environment.  There are other people, other organisations, other interests who also have a duty and a responsibility in the creation of that environment.  I do not wish to comment on the details of a certain matter that has made the headlines in the past week concerning an industry in the east of Ireland where 250 jobs are at risk, because of a situation relating to one employee who has been offered a substantial sum in compensation for loss or supposed loss or disadvantage that has occurred to him.  I think that putting the jobs of 250 people at risk is industrial sabotage at its worst level.  I am going on the situation as I have read it.  I am not fully familiar with the facts.  How can you succeed&mdash; with a figure of 250,000 unemployed, &mdash; how damaging to the attempts of any Government or any State agency to promote industry when that and other similar situations are there to be used by competing industrial agencies from other countries against Ireland? Responsibility for creating the proper environment for industrial development rests not alone with the Government but with everybody and every organisation and every interest affected by it.</P>
    <P>I will make one other observation that has been a bone of contention with me for some time.  I have requested here and elsewhere that an attempt would be made to analyse the content or to categorise the unemployment figures in Ireland and to assess from within that figure how many of that number are genuinely available for work and are genuinely seeking work.  I have been prompted to do this, as a result of a discussion at a county council meeting on Monday last. Under the social employment scheme 40 people are in employment in the environs <Col N="449" /> of Ennis.  There are 29 more jobs there and 29 more people are needed.  Despite the best efforts of the council so far, nine applications are the most that have been received for 29 jobs; these have been assessed and only three are suitable. Before we go overboard about the inflated figures of the number of people who are unemployed, those available for employment need to be examined and quantified and those who are not, for one reason or the other, whether it is medical, psychological or whatever.  I have asked and I believe it is necessary in the situation we are in that that figure would be established.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will help to serve the strategy of the Government in promoting industrial development in the country.  I welcome the provision in section 6 in particular for the three-year review of industrial performance.  That review begins this year, and every three years the performance of industrial progress will be measured.  I understand that that report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Members of the Seanad and the Dáil will have the opportunity of expressing their opinions on progress by the agencies and progress generally within industry in the preceding three years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the clearly defined and broad range of powers that are being provided in section 11 of the Bill. Equally, I would comment that the powers contained in section 17 appear to be very sweeping in relation to the provision of sites and services.  If there was any section, I would have reservations about, it would possibly be section 17 but my reservations are not strong enough to argue the case too forcibly.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 21 which deals with industrial incentives, the grant making power that has been given to the Industrial Development Authority.  These are wide powers which I expect are necessary but at least are going to have the effect of enabling the IDA to operate with the minimum of restrictions.</P>
    <P>On section 24, I welcome the liberal regime that is being provided in relation <Col N="450" /> to the guarantee of loans.  That was needed.</P>
    <P>On section 25, dealing with the provision for the payment of employment grants to service industries, I welcome the question of the acquiring of secondhand machinery.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions I welcome, such as the guarantee of loans and interest subsidies, loans for the restructuring of industry for enterprise and development, training grants, research grants, technology acquisition grants, grants to secure reduction of factory rents, and the provision to enable the IDA to take or to buy shares in certain projects.  It goes hand in hand with certain provisions of the National Development Corporation legislation and it will strengthen the organisation in its endeavours to successfully achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>Coming from the mid-west, I have a duty to acknowledge the part that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company have played in industrial development in the mid-western area over the years.  SFADCo is recognised internationally as the most effective regional development organisation.  It has made a marked contribution in the mid-west to the stability of employment and to the expansion and development there, the creation of new jobs and new opportunities through imaginative and innovative schemes, ideas and projects.  Eight years ago I recall a previous Minister for Industry and Commerce deciding that the responsibility for major industry, apart from the airport area, should be removed from SFADCo.  Eight years is a reasonable time-span within which to measure the effectiveness or the value of that decision.  Eight years on, little or no major industry has come to the mid-west region other than what was in the pipeline at that time.  With eight years to examine and compare the activity, success and achievements of SFADCo in previous years in relation to major industry, that arrangement has been a failure.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment SFADCo on their promotion of small industries.  That was a task given to them in 1977.  I have figures to show that there has been steady progress since then to the present day. <Col N="451" /> They have shown, in relation to the projects, that they can successfully achieve the targets established for them.  They have a most attractive small industries packet, which is yielding results.  However, the major reservation I have in relation to the direction we are taking now is in regard to these small industries SFADCo have been promoting over the last eight years.  Following changes made in the qualification area for these small industries, 30 per cent of the industries which qualified as small industries for grant aid will not qualify now.  If these incentives had not been available over the past eight years, 30 per cent of the people now in jobs would be on the dole. That restriction needs to be examined because that is the effect it is going to have.  All sorts of computations can be made, but from time to time we hear people saying that for one industrial job there is a spinoff of another few jobs, servicing or whatever.  Thirty per cent of these jobs no longer qualify under the new regime for grant aid.  I am not talking about 30 per cent of jobs in isolation but I am talking about the jobs in services that depend on them or spin-off from them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it is part of the package of Government strategies to create a better environment for industrial development.  It consolidates existing legislation and brings it into one comprehensive code.  I had lengthier comments to make on it, but in view of the request of the Leader of the House earlier on and in view of the fact that I have dealt with the ones I consider to be of major interest to me, I will conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  The positive parts of the Bill are welcome, but this is an area which would require great experience or specialist study in order to speak in a meaningful way about the Bill.  I am not totally convinced that it is going to be the panacea for all our ills.  I was brought up in very deprived conditions and, for that reason, all I had recourse to was what I would call fairy tale culture.  In the fairy <Col N="452" /> tale culture the idea of magic is a window to look out on the real world.  This Bill comes near the magic wand situation.  I always thought, in moments of flights of fantasy, that the magic wand would be a great help to anybody and would be a great help to the country.  The explanatory memorandum, with regard to the financial implications, tells us:</P>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill will not involve any overall additional cost to the Exchequer, nor will they involve the recruitment of additional staff.  The cost of the new technology, acquisition grants and the alterations in the scope and operation of research and development grants will be met from a shift in expenditure away from fixed asset grants, as outlined in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
      <P>It seems what we have here is really a bookkeeping exercise.  I fail to see how we can achieve what the Government claimed we will achieve without an extra investment of funds.  If we do, in some way it conjures up in my mind a situation where at the present time these funds are being badly spent.  Most reasonable people would agree that extra investment is needed.  I do not doubt that in some way to move the thrust away from one area to another, or to concentrate on one area more than another, can practically work miracles.  I have no doubt about that.  Nevertheless, I cannot see that any great progress will be made without the extra funds that are necessary.  We are told categorically that no extra funds will be provided or are needed.  From that point of view, I would be very suspicious of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, with the other Members, I welcome the positive aspects of the Bill.  In so far as it will be successful, I welcome it.  It is a comprehensive Bill. This is borne out by the number of Acts that have been repealed.  Under the Fourth Schedule to the Bill, 20 Acts are repealed, starting with the 1950 Act.  In addition, we have an amendment of the Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="453" /> Company Ltd. (Amendment) Act, 1970. It is quite a comprehensive Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that, since we are all agreed that unemployment is the problem, we should have a policy in this regard.  The Minister told us in his introductory speech that &ldquo;industrial policy is not employment policy, although it is an important component of it&rdquo;.  He stated that &ldquo;our unemployment position must be tackled on a broader front, as set out in the Government's national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i> The question I would ask is: why are we not tackling it now?  If the solution is set out in <i>Building on Reality,</i> and this is a comprehensive Bill, why are we not dealing with that policy? That is necessary.  I would like in passing, to make a brief analogy with another area.  I refer to the fact that we do not have an overall land policy.  I am not saying this in a critical sense.  I am just saying this in passing.  Although we do not have a land policy and doing works which are not within the context of an overall policy, we can still do works that are important and worthwhile and that help us &mdash; for example, in the area of drainage.  Of course, we can carry out drainage works.  They are important.  I am making the analogy that we must have an overall policy.  I know the Minister has indicated that he does not want me to proceed on those lines.  However, I would like to continue with it.  I think I would be within the terms of a Second Stage speech in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I suppose I would be stretching at the seams to do so.  Nevertheless, I wanted to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is our big problem.  We are all agreed about that.  The ills that follow from unemployment are crime, use of drugs, and so on.  I had very recently, a mother of a large family, coming to me.  Two of her sons are on the dole and she was very critical of the dole situation.  We are all critical of it, and nothing has been done about it.  We <Col N="454" /> know that this problem of unemployment is a fundamental one.  We know that there must be a new approach to it.  In this House previously I have mentioned that what is known as the &ldquo;Protestant work ethic&rdquo; is out of date.  It will no longer serve the community.  While I know that all our ills are not due to unemployment, most of them stem from it.  We are not tackling this problem at the base where it should be tackled.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statements that have already been made with regard to machinery and similar developments.  In this situation it is hard to arrive at a solution to the problem.  Some people say we will never solve the problem.  I feel that it must be tackled by either coming to terms with the reality that we will never again reach a situation of full employment of our people or by reducing the work hours.  We must do something to cater for the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>I realise that an Act or a Bill to deal with this problem must be very comprehensive.  At the same time, it must be very simple and all-embracing.  I am not sure whether this Bill before us, for the reasons that I have outlined and particularly for the financial reasons, will be successful.  Reference has been made to the impact of the reduction in inflation. I am glad that the Government can claim that inflation has been reduced from 20 per cent to about 3 per cent in a few short years.  We all welcome that.  Again, I am not too clear of the advantages to us following the reduction in inflation.  Inflation is coming down worldwide.  I felt that the Minister for Finance, in this House on a recent occasion, was not too clear about the benefits of inflation.  He said, as far as I can recall, that it gave investors confidence and that in some way which he did not clarify, or go into in detail, helped with the employment situation. Beyond that, I am not sure what great advantage it has with regard to reducing unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I clearly recall the Minister for Finance going into that <Col N="455" /> matter.  That is my recollection of what he said.</P>
      <P>I feel that this problem will have to be tackled on a broader base.  Look, for example, at our road system.  This has been referred to.  Our road system is in a deplorable state.  Before industry can increase we must improve our roads.  This is where it is best to start.  It might not be in order for me to enlarge on our disadvantages at the present time with regard to roads.  I am not simply talking of potholes.  I am thinking of widening our roads.  I am talking of realignment.  I am talking of improving our roads so that the traffic can drive at a reasonable speed.</P>
      <P>Mention was also made of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I would like to add my commendations of this organisation.  People are not aware of the great work that has been done by the IIRS.  I am pleased that the expertise of the IIRS will be made use of in a very broad way in the implementation of this Bill.  Their publication, <i>Technology Ireland</i>, is a very important publication. While we receive technical literature from other organisations, unfortunately we do not receive copies of <i>Technology Ireland.</i> I would ask the Minister to consider making a recommendation that copies of <i>Technology Ireland</i> would be made available to Members of the Oireachtas for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research has been referred to by the Minister and by Members.  Research is very important.  There is specific reference in the Bill to the purchase of patents and grants to firms who want to avail of patents.  I had some experience of the Patents Office in Merrion Square a few years ago.  Even then &mdash; I am sure some modernisation has been carried out&mdash; it was very out of date.  It was a small office. The staff were very helpful.  At that time I took out a provisional licence for a contouring interpolator, which was not a very costly exercise.  I did not have the finance to follow it up at the time.  At the time the outlets were very restricted for those who availed of the Patents Office. I would suggest to the Minister that it <Col N="456" /> should be possible to utilise a patents section attached to institutes of higher education.</P>
    <P>There is great ingenuity in this country. A proprietor of a Dublin garage told me about tractors taken to his garage from the country.  He said the ingenuity was unbelievable.  Pieces of string or wire were made to do impossible things.  There is scope there which should be harnessed. An attempt should be made to harness such ingenuity.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid great tribute to the Industrial Development Authority.  I would agree with him on that.  He mentioned their flexibility and efficiency in encouraging industrial development. They have done great work and, no doubt, will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to the Bill it is envisaged that the new selectivity criteria for grants will be extended to Shannon Development in respect of the industrial estate under a separate Bill.  I wonder why a separate Bill is necessary.  The explanatory memorandum begins by stating that this is a comprehensive Bill which repeals many other Acts.  At this time something could have been included in this Act specifically with regard to Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires the Minister to prepare a review of industrial performance every three years and to lay such review before each House of the Oireachtas. This is important.  At the same time, I would ask: why not every year?  Why the arbitrary figure of three years?  With regard to these reviews and reports which come before the House, possibly it would be a good idea if a select body or a special group would consider them before they came before the House and made some specific comments on it.  It would be very important to have a group of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 11 sets out the functions of the Industrial Development Authority.  Its primary role is to be an autonomous body.  I do not wish to go into all the details of section 11 because this is primarily a Bill which can be dealt with better on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 13 empowers the Minister to give general policy directives to the IDA. <Col N="457" /> Such directives shall not apply to any individual industrial undertaking or to the location of an industry other than as part of a general review of industry policy for the country as a whole.  While I would agree with that, at the same time I could see a situation where it might be necessary to deal with the particular industrial undertaking.  I would hope that that would not be excluded under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 make provision for the issue by the Minister of grants not exceeding £700 million, with the possibility of another £125 million.  Since there is no further charge for the Exchequer this is purely a bookkeeping exercise.</P>
    <P>Section 16 enables the Industrial Development Authority to provide sites and services for industrial development and to acquire land for such purposes, either by agreement or compulsorily. They have such power at present.  In many areas they have sites which will satisfy the needs for many years to come. There is a very large site in my own town, Kells.  Fortunately, we have one successful industry there.  We are hoping that this site will be used up before other areas are purchased.  Sites have been selected because they are suitable.  They have public water and sewerage facilities. These developments should be proceeded with before any new sites are bought.</P>
    <P>Section 19 gives the Authority the power, subject to some conditions, to borrow temporarily for current expenditure.  Could this be accumulative?  Could it result in expenses mounting up which would be rather costly in the long term as far as the IDA are concerned?</P>
    <P>Section 21 sets out certain criteria under which the IDA will be empowered to make grants towards the cost of fixed assets.  I gather that there is a departure from this.  The grants are 60 per cent of the cost of the fixed assets in the case of an industry in a designated area and 45 per cent in a non-designated area.  There is no increase in grants here.  With higher costs a case possibly could be made to increase the percentages in both cases.</P>
    <P>Section 28 refers to the IDA and gives <Col N="458" /> power to consult with AnCO.  I would like to pay tribute to the work done by AnCO over the years.  I am pleased to see that AnCO will be involved.</P>
    <P>Section 29 gives the IDA, subject to some conditions, the power to make grants not exceeding 50 per cent towards the cost of research and development. A case should be made to increase that amount of grant.  A case could arise where it might be necessary to give a higher grant in order to get a project off the ground.  It is a pity in that situation that this restraint will be there under section 29.  The Bill is one more for Committee Stage than for Second Stage.  It is important to deal with all those aspects on Committee Stage.  The Minister should consider that in certain circumstances it would be proper to make a higher grant.</P>
    <P>Section 30 gives the IDA power to give grants not exceeding 50 per cent towards the cost of acquiring the product or process technology.  This is not variable, but it should be.  Very often the grant would be much less than 50 per cent.  There should be some scope, in the few instances it might be necessary to give a higher grant &mdash; in some particular cases 100 per cent if the State is going to benefit from it in a way that it would make it worthwhile to invest this amount of finance.</P>
    <P>Section 31 empowers the Authority, subject to certain conditions, to purchase or take shares in an industrial undertaking.  This is a power which the IDA already have.  They have exercised it on a number of occasions.  They displayed confidence in many instances.  I am not sure what the track record is regarding those cases and it would be interesting if the Minister would refer to them.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the repayment of grants or other payments to the Authority in cases where there is a contravention of a term or conditions attached to such grant or other payment.  This could, in some way, be a penal clause.  It does not refer to a serious contravention.  It should be defined.  In the general sense and in the way businesses are carried on, sometimes it may be necessary to depart in a minimal way to which the Govern- <Col N="459" /> ment or the IDA might take exception. Here we have a situation if there is a contravention.  Presumably the Minister and the Government will decide to refuse to make a payment to an industry.</P>
    <P>Section 43 prohibits by penalty the disclosure by a member of the Authority, the board, committee or a member of the staff or advisers or consultants, of information obtained while performing duties on behalf of the authority.  The fine here is £800.  This is a small amount of money having regard to the seriousness of the situation.  In the Bill we are talking in terms of £700 million and fractions of £1 million.  A fine of £800 where there is a disclosure of confidential information is not sufficient.  Where confidence may be breached, it may often be for financial gain &mdash; possibly to another company. This fine is far too low.</P>
    <P>I am not clear on how people who have a project in mind set about getting it off the ground.  I am aware of an individual who had what he felt was a good project in the agricultural sphere.  He did not get it off the ground and he made representations to certain people.  There is that difficulty at the present time.  I am not too clear how this is overcome in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If somebody has a very good idea and can back it up with figures, but has not got the finance to avail of the grants that the Industrial Development Authority could make available, can this Bill help this individual?  Section 29 states:</P>
    <P>Subject to paragraph (b), the amount of a research grant shall not exceed 50 per cent of the approved costs of the project concerned or £250,000, whichever is the smaller sum.</P>
    <P>There are areas where small amounts of money would get a project off the ground.  I am thinking of wave power and solar energy in this regard.  There is vast potential which would be helpful to the country and it is not catered for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to section 29, subsection (5):</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> (5) The Authority may, in the case of small industrial undertakings as defined from time to time by the Minister, make payment of up to one-third of a research grant prior to the approved costs being incurred on condition that the amount so paid shall be repaid to the Authority if the research or development project concerned has not been carried out to the satisfaction of the Authority.</P>
    <P>This is very authoritarian.  Surely some other body may be resorted to to determine whether a bona fide effort was made to comply with the terms of a grant to the satisfaction of the Authority?  There should be recourse to the Minister, the Government or to a third party who would be independent.  This could, perhaps, be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to a small business in my own town of Kells.  There are in the region of 14 to 15 people employed there.  Like Senator Lynch I was given particulars of a retail professional group who issued a circular letter saying, and I quote: &ldquo;We must not, therefore, support opposition products&rdquo;.  It happens that those &ldquo;opposition products&rdquo; are the products which are manufactured in this small factory in Kells.  The products which are being publicised in the circular are manufactured abroad.  This is an extraordinary situation.  I am not going to go into details as it would not be proper on the Second Stage, but what I am saying to the Minister is that there is a general problem in this area where a section of our own professional retailers are pushing foreign products to the exclusion of our own products which give employment here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it will help.  I welcome the positive aspects of it.  I regret that no extra finance is being made available for the implementation of the Bill and without this extra finance, overall it is a bookkeeping exercise.</P>

      <P>The House itself can decide at the end of the Second Stage. First, I would like to take the opportunity of welcoming the new Bill.  Briefly, I would like to refer to a number of factors which I consider rather appropriate to Second Stage.  They can be divided into three different sections.</P>
      <P>First, there is a tidying exercise involved with which I will deal briefly.  Second, there are certain new proposals made within the text itself.  Finally, there is a more fundamental re-examination of where our industrial policy is going.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to explore that area.  I would like to refer to the last one first.</P>
      <P>The way in which we have organised our industrial development over the last 20 years has been to attract to the maximum possible extent investment from abroad and allied to that to upgrade and modernise the machinery used in our native industry.  The system which we have utilised to bring about this situation is that of grants from the Industrial Development Authority to newly-established industries, on the one hand, and modernisation of our existing equipment by way of grants, on the other.  I note that the Bill includes a proposal to terminate the modernisation aspect which served us so well in the past.  Nobody could doubt that the time for that kind of scheme has indeed long passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial development policy must be concentrated in the area of developing new projects which will help us in the difficult times that lie ahead.  We have to examine the industrial development area because of our extremely young population and a population which is in great need of industrial employment. Obviously, the policy which we have been pursuing has had a certain measure of success.  The fact that we have such a <Col N="462" /> substantial amount of unemployment should not lead us to a conclusion that it has been necessarily unsuccessful.  However successful it has been, something extra is needed in order to overcome the problem which we have with regard to our present unemployment and to the expansion of it which is inevitable&mdash;at least, in the short term&mdash;as a result of the increased number of young people coming on to the labour market.</P>
    <P>How do we, as a country, face that challenge?  This should be the central core of our industrial policy.  What policy can we pursue which will ensure that the maximum number of our young people are engaged in gainful employment?  It is in this regard that I refer to one of the proposals in the Bill, section 6 under which there would be a triennial review of the national industrial performance. While this seems a fairly innocuous provision, it could, in fact, be a most important one.  It would give the Minister the opportunity, and impose on him the obligation, of reviewing our performance on a three-yearly basis.  Presumably as a result of that review, it would give the Houses of the Oireachtas an opportunity of expressing their views on it.</P>
    <P>Much of the consideration which Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas give, for example, to industrial policy is given in the context of a specific proposal in a specific Bill like this rather than by analysing what the needs of the industrial policy are and receiving from the Minister, in the first instance, a report on what the policy is and expressing a view on it.  This is badly needed.</P>
    <P>We must look slightly beyond our own country.  Why is it that western Europe is falling so far behind in industrial employment?  Why is it, given the advantages of a young and educated population &mdash; even though I know we have disadvantages as well with regard to our remoteness &mdash; that we seem to be unable to get a fair share of the worldwide growth in trade and in industrial output?  What contribution can we make in the European scene?  More important, what contribution can we make independently of Europe to help us to develop an industrial <Col N="463" /> policy which will mean more gainful employment for a greater number of our people?  Why is it that the industrial heartland or the industrial centre of gravity is moving from America and Europe to America and Asia?  What is the reason for it?  I do not believe that it is a matter of cheap labour.  It is a lot more fundamental than that.  There are reasons for it and they are pertinent to this Bill. There are reasons why we, in western Europe, are failing to develop industrial policies which create a climate and why that innovation which is an essential part of getting our share of the new industrial growth is not encouraged in the western European context and in Ireland in particular.  In that respect the proposal in section 6 of the Bill to have a triennial review of our national industrial performance is indeed important.  It is in that context that I look forward to the Minister putting before each House of the Oireachtas as a part of this exercise a statement of the rationale behind our industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The excellent speech which the Minister gave on Second Stage today outlines quite a number of new departures and a new approach to operating the IDA, but what it fails to do is to examine fundamentally what our industrial policy objectives are.  This is where we are lacking in this country.  One of the most fundamental things we should examine is whether it is grants or taxation or a combination of both that attracts companies to this country.  The Industrial Development Authority is proceeding in a most efficient manner on the basis that one of the essential elements in attracting new industry, whether it is indigenous or foreign, is grants.  Is that borne out by the facts?  It is something around which I would like to see a national debate develop.</P>
    <P>Similarly, is the tax regime to which industrial undertakings are subjected of critical importance in the location of industry?  If it is not, we are giving very substantial discounts in tax bills to foreign operators or to manufacturers operating here, whether home or foreign, to no <Col N="464" /> benefit.  I think that the examination of these factors is more important in the long term than the actual structure of the IDA itself.</P>
    <P>The IDA is really only a creature of Government policy.  It is there to carry out in as efficient a manner as possible whatever policy the Government set for it.  If you read this Bill from beginning to end what you fail to get out of it &mdash; I think it is probably right that it should not be in the Bill itself &mdash; is an idea of what are the real policy decisions on which this Bill is based.  There are, of course, a few indications.  There are new sections &mdash; for example, section 30, dealing with technology acquisition grants. Obviously, that is a new policy departure in which it has been decided that the acquisition of technology should be given a sufficient importance to make it attract a grant.  I would like to say that this should only be part of a very fundamental re-examination of our industrial development policy.  It has been successful, but it has had limited success.  Whether that limitation has been due to some inherent defect in ourselves or to the fact that the grants were not high enough, were too high or taxation policy was right, or tax evasion policy was wrong, or due to our physical location in western Europe, must be determined.  There must be an examination of why the things that have gone right have gone right and what changes we can make to encourage a further location of industry in this country.  Whether they be indigenous or foreign is not really of tremendous significance.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a change is coming over western Europe.  There is no doubt that in countries like the Federal Republic of Germany there is a considerable shortage of educated young people. I know that the emphasis of the salesmanship of the Irish Government agencies has switched into this change.  To what extent we should exploit it by further changes in policy is something which I would look forward to being debated in this House as part of the triennial reviews, the obligation for which is going to be put on the Minister if and when we <Col N="465" /> pass this Bill.  I am seeking to use this early portion of my speech to lay down what I would consider to be the important consideration for the benefit of the Minister.  If we pass this Bill the first such report will be in the year 1986.  Therefore, giving the Minister some idea of what an individual Member of the House of the Oireachtas thinks should be included in that review would be helpful at this stage.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill consists of the consolidation of existing legislation which has worked well, it certainly has my support.  The Minister is to be commended on bringing together under one roof so much legislation gathered from over the years dealing with the Industrial Development Authority in general and development grants and areas in particular. The repeal section at the end of the Fourth Schedule is indeed very satisfactory in that it indicates that there has been a very fundamental re-appraisal and that this Bill will, when passed, represent the complete industrial development legislation and will enable practitioners and general public who have the obligation to pursue the Bill for one purpose or another to see at a glance what is the law with regard to the Industrial Development Authority and related matters.</P>
    <P>The things to which I would like to refer to are basically the new ones.  I have already mentioned the triennial review under section 6.  I think that is a very good section and the Minister should be commended on it.  There is an important new section, section 13 which deals with the question of giving policy directives to the Authority.  In line with what I was saying I certainly support the concept that the Minister should give policy directives and it is up to the Authority to implement those policy directives.  Subsection (2), however, addresses what might be an individual problem there, where it says that it shall not apply to individual industrial undertakings or give a preference to one area over another in regard to the location of an industrial undertaking otherwise and as part of the general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole, as indicated in the <Col N="466" /> directive.  I do not think that Ministers in the past &mdash; not speaking specifically about the present Minister &mdash; have always lived up to that high standard.  Very often considerations other than a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole have appeared to be important in deciding policy as it relates to individual undertakings.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is section 21 which again expands the area and lays down the Authority's general grant-making power.  I think here lies the core of what I was saying.  We have decided that the way in which the Authority can assist the industrial development of the country is by the making of grants of that kind.  The Minister has indicated that certain changes were made in that as a result of amendments in the other House.  The Minister is to be commended on that.  I am sure we will have on Committee Stage an opportunity of examining that section to see whether it now fulfills the criteria which would be proper to legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 are two other sections to which I would like to refer. Section 29 deals with research grants.  It is making a statement which no doubt the Minister will take up and elaborate on in his report in 1986, sometime during the remainder of this year, on the importance of research.  Section 30 is important in acknowledging the importance of technology and the acquisition of technology in helping to solve our industrial problems.</P>
    <P>They are the sections which come to my particular attention.  The important aspects of the Bill lie in the creation of a new regime whereby the industrial policy of the Government, which up to this has been only very fitfully and incidentally examined by either House of the Oireachtas, will now be examined on a regular and predetermined basis as a result of the ministerial review outlined in section 6.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Bill to the House, to assure the Minister of our support for it and our understanding that the vast majority of the provisions in the Bill are re-enactments of existing legislation.  We will hopefully be able to speed <Col N="467" /> the Bill's journey through the House on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never thought I would stand up on an issue like industrial policy and say that I agree with Senator O'Leary: we have disagreed on so many fundamentals before.  Quite a lot of what he had to say was of the intellectual standard that I associate with most of Senator O'Leary's contributions.  He made remarks which showed a lot of insight into certain areas and I would like to record why I agree with him there.  We do need to analyse far more fully the relative contributions of the different parts of our industrial incentives to identify which, if any, of them are cost effective.  It is always difficult to put a figure on this but the actual visible costs in terms of grant aid by the Industrial Development Authority are the most easily quantified part of the cost of our industrial incentives.</P>
      <P>The exemption from 90 per cent of our corporation profits tax &mdash; and in many cases 100 per cent exemption &mdash; of most manufacturing industries in this country, be they indigenous or foreign, is also a major loss of revenue to the State and shows up in other areas.  Even though our gross level of taxation as a percentage of GNP is not that excessive or far out of line with many European countries of similar population when they were at our current stage of development, we have chosen to exempt large areas of earnings of incomes, including profits, from taxation.  Therefore, that 40 per cent is actually being distributed over only certain sections of the community.  It is not something on which I would like to take a hard and fast position, but I do think that, given that the burden for paying for the services that people expect at our level of development is carried by a narrower base because of this virtual exemption from corporation profits tax of manufacturing industry, it does behove us to at least be absolutely certain that this level of tax exemption is necessary and desirable and is a major contributor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that survey after survey has indicated that the taxation policy is one <Col N="468" /> of the major incentives.  I do think it raises the question whether we need to pay substantial grants in the area of capital acquisition in the form the IDA has traditionally adopted.  There may well be a trade-off point between virtually zero tax and the levels of corporation profits tax payable in most industrial areas including the United States.  There may well be an optimum point, which is not zero and which is not 40 per cent, which can give us the benefit of both increased industrial employment and increased tax revenue.</P>
    <P>We should objectively assess that and attempt to quantify the relative contributions of the different incentives.  Recently surveys were published.  For instance, we were rated among British industrialists as having the best financial incentives in the OECD.  We were also rated by the same British industrialists as having one of the most unstable political environments in which to invest.  This was as much a problem of British perception as it was of Irish instability.  Speaking from my political perspective, the problem with Irish politics is that it is far too stable altogether.  Business men no more than anybody else are not particularly good in the area of politics.  In the area of financial incentives one has to accept their skills and ability and the fact that they did identify this country.  It is an interesting point as to how far we are ahead of other countries in this area of financial incentives and whether we need to be that far ahead.  There are all sorts of hidden costs in the areas of training, education and other areas that would need to be assessed very carefully.</P>
    <P>Having said that in response to what Senator O'Leary has said, I cannot but support and welcome this Bill.  It would not represent anything like the complete industrial strategy that I would advocate; but as part of an industrial strategy it would be difficult to take issue with it except in so far as it is based on assumptions in regard to other incentives that I would have some reservations about.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to associate the IDA with industrial development and to <Col N="469" /> assume in too narrow a way that this is the primary driving force for industrial development in this country.  The IDA have done a good job, and it is ironic that people who scream loudest about the inefficiency of the State sector are often those who are equally loud in demanding that the IDA do more and more.  If ever there was an image of a State enterprise, not manufacturing but nevertheless State-owned, whose policy objectives are determined by the State and whose large scale operational decisions are still under ministerial scrutiny, we have it here.  It has worked successfully and has responded to shifting market needs.</P>
    <P>I do think it is very important to recognise the centrality of manufacturing industry in the development of real employment.  There is also need to recognise the need for selectivity in the development of manufacturing industry, or in the sort of jobs we want our people to have.  We do not want to go back to a Third World model of development where we move back to low-paid, low-skilled jobs.  We want highly-paid, highly-skilled, demanding and therefore satisfying work for our people.  It is not and should not be a question of jobs at all costs.  We gave that up 30 years ago.  I do not think we should allow the problems and worries of the immediate past to deter us from keeping on in the direction of becoming a high skilled, high technology, high wage and high employment economy.  There is nothing irreconcilable about those objectives.  They have been set and achieved by some of the most successful countries in Europe, countries which are comparable in population with ourselves and who were comparable in industrial development 50 years ago to ourselves but who adopted a considerably different strategy and seemed to have been considerably more successful than ourselves.  I would identify among those, Sweden, pre-war and post-war, and Austria subsequent to the war.  Both have adopted political strategies and industrial strategies somewhat different from ourselves and have been remarkably successful.</P>
    <P>Probably the finest argument that there <Col N="470" /> is not just a passive but an active and creative role for the State in industrial development and industrial restructuring is to look at the history of Swedish industry in the 1970s.  We should not allow ourselves to be browbeaten into believing that there is no role for the State in industrial development and in identifying priority areas and that some sort of mythological market force, which probably has not existed since the turn of the century, is determining these things, because at the centre of it all must be successful manufacturing industry.  It is an important word of warning to many who would have us ape the American unrestricted market forces model that there are serious deficiencies in the boom in the United States about which we hear so much.  There has not been enormous growth in many areas of manufacturing industry in the United States.  The United States have a serious balance of payments deficit because of the large-scale import of manufactured goods from other countries.  The United States have a large-scale budget deficit because of the economic policies which they have pursued.  They also have a boom based largely on public expenditure in the area of defence.</P>
    <P>Any Member of the Oireachtas who read <i>The Sunday Times</i> feature last Sunday on President Reagan's former budget director will say that the mistakes that Irish politicians have made in the area of public expenditure are minimal by comparison with the fact that the US Defence Department budget growth rate in real terms was based on a quick calculation made by President Reagan's budget director or on a pocket calculator in a quarter of an hour.  That is why we now have a determination on the part of the American Defence Department to have a real growth in defence expenditure of about 7 or 8 per cent per annum from 1979 on &mdash; not because of a policy decision but because Mr. Stockman made a mistake on a calculator in a quarter of an hour and that became official Government policy of the United States in the area of expenditure on defence, which is <Col N="471" /> now such a huge part of American defence expenditure.</P>
    <P>That is what Mr. Stockman said.  I do not know if he is telling the truth but it is an interesting insight which should give Irish politicians who have been so severely lectured about their profligacy in spending other people's money and who have all been lectured in particular about the success in the United States not spending other people's money to give themselves a clap on the back for being a lot more careful, a lot more sensible in the decision making.</P>
    <P>One area which is mentioned in the Minister's speech and also in the White Paper, which has not yet been sufficiently developed and teased out in any strategy for industrial development, is the whole question of innovation.  We are liable to have a new competition in this country shortly which you could probably refer to briefly as a less conscientious entrepreneur.  There is apparently a species running around in this country under the general title of entrepreneur seeking opportunity which we apparently are failing to provide but which is nevertheless out there ready, willing and able to do all sorts of wonderful things for us if we only create the proper package of incentives to encourage them out from their shy nesting grounds where they are currently confined by an apparently oppressive State system.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of imagery that we have been presented with by the collective spokespersons of the new right, that we have the entrepreneurial class.  One has only to read the OECD examiner's report on innovation policy in Ireland.  I am referring not to the report but to a newsletter of the Confederation of Irish Industry published in December 1985, volume 44, No. 7 which will hardly give a summary of that report which is anyway favourable to my political or economic philosophy. Nevertheless it goes a long way beyond financial incentives and financial considerations in talking about the problems of innovation.  They make an interesting two-line summary which turns the report on its head.  The actual detailed summary <Col N="472" /> makes quite a considerable number of comments with insight on this country and why we have been relatively unsuccessful in the area of innovation.  I cannot overstate the degree of my conviction that innovation in indigenous industry in particular is the real area that we will have to look to for real development in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The OECD apparently stated that in terms of innovative orientation Ireland is currently ranked in the bottom quarter of industrialised countries.  That puts us down in terms of capacity to innovate with countries like Greece, Turkey, Spain and Portugal.  Given the advantages we have over countries like Greece and Portugal and Turkey in particular in terms of literacy, participation in second and third level education and in terms of the enormous, proportionately speaking, investment that we put into third level education &mdash; even though it is inadequate we do put in quite an enormous proportion of our GNP into third level education &mdash; it is somewhat surprising that we should appear to be so out of line with other countries in terms of our ability to innovate.</P>
    <P>The OECD identified a number of factors which they related to our lack of innovatability.  I list them in the order in which they are listed here.  I do not know whether it is the order in which the OECD listed them.  One was the lack of specific technological skills and the general awareness of new technology in Irish firms.  It was not a bad workforce, a high wage workforce, a recalcitrant workforce or the trade unions that they identified as the problem but the actual Irish indigenous firms themselves not really knowing about new technology and having a workforce which lacked the skills to use new technologies.  That is something we have to address ourselves to.  It is not a question simply of incentives.  It has to do with education, targeting areas where people are prepared to make it different and not hand out undifferentiated assistance and grants whether they be by way of grants or tax breaks to companies that are still hoping to sell buttons to Britain when we should be <Col N="473" /> selling computers to West Germany. That really is at the core of our problem.</P>
    <P>The second area&mdash;this is the buttons to Britain phenomenon again&mdash;is the production of undifferentiated low technology products sold at low prices instead of products based on quality, new technology and exclusive design.  I always feel a fundamental flaw in our industrial development strategy&mdash;it is the profound conviction that seems to have motivated most Governments in the last 15 years&mdash;is that in this whole area of new quality products, high quality products selling into international markets we somehow have to always depend on foreign investment for that development and we do not really believe in ourselves and in our capacity to develop products that are saleable on the international market. One can contrast that with a country like Sweden, a country of 8,000,000 people equally remote almost with ourselves from major markets which has produced a number of companies, large multinationals, which are among the most successful in the world.</P>
    <P>It is often worth reminding people of some of the companies that are actually Swedish owned and Swedish based.  Electrolux is one that I discovered recently to be actually owned and based in Sweden and which one would have assumed to be either a German or an American multinational, this is so pervasive all over western society.  Saab cars, Volvo cars, and Erickson, in the area of telecommunications, are large corporations based in a country that, if you are to believe the propagandist, is the least encouraging of enterprise in Europe because of the levels of taxation, State regulation etc. but which still have been among the most successful in the world.  To elaborate again on the low technology product sold at low prices, that is why I perpetually talk about selling buttons to Britain.  I believe there are far too many Irish manufacturers who believe they can continue on selling the same product of the same quality and hopefully at the same price to the same markets indefinitely and if that does not work they blame everybody, be it Government, trade unions or whoever happens to be the most convenient person to <Col N="474" /> blame at that moment in time, whereas the OECD identifies the problem as the industry's own failure to develop new products and new technologies.</P>
    <P>The third weakness identified among Irish firms was an exclusive orientation to relatively small unsophisticated Irish and/or traditional British markets.  This is a long way from the catchcry of the last five or six years which was that Irish wage rates, as it was always said, were crippling the country.  The last time I spoke about these things here I quoted OECD figures which clearly show that the growth rate of exports from this country is only exceeded by either one or two members of the OECD.  We are, in terms of growth in exports, ahead of Japan and have been for a number of years.  It is difficult to believe that Irish wage rates can be so crippling a burden if sections of Irish industry, particularly the multinational-based Irish industries, are doing so well. Most of what is being said by the OECD reflects on indigenous Irish industry rather than on the foreign multinational.</P>
    <P>The fourth defect which inhibited innovation in this country in the eyes of the OECD was &ldquo;the absence of larger progressive indigenous firms which would provide a strong technological and industrial background for small companies&rdquo;. The important words there are &ldquo;large, progressive and indigenous&rdquo;.  We have to get beyond the hand-outs mentality which believed that we had to have multinationals to give us products which are saleable on the international markets.  It is a matter of regret, as the Telesis report pointed out, that most of the large Irish manufacturing firms are not involved in trade.  They are involved in the non-trading sector, that is the sector which can safely continue to be sold here, because there are problems of communications and transport which make participation by external competitors impossible.</P>
    <P>The fifth deficiency was related to problems of communication and lack of acceptance of the need for technological change by management and workers. The sixth one &mdash; not necessarily one I would agree with but they did list it &mdash; was the lack of opportunity for private <Col N="475" /> individuals to make profit, partly because of heavy personal and capital gains taxes and therefore lack of development and venture capital.  That is one of the reasons, but it is by no means the only reason.  If you were to listen to most of the apologists for industry or if you were to read the Confederation of Irish Industry's own summary of this policy document, you would think it was the only thing that the OECD people had said.  It is identified as one of the deficiencies, though I believe some of the recent changes in taxation policy would probably meet some of those objections.  They finally identify a general lack of understanding of innovation entrepreneurship and of a strong innovative culture within firms and in Irish society generally.  I take from that that it is not just a question of attracting better and more carefully selected foreign multinationals or local industries.  It is a question of a transformation in the perception that Irish society has of itself and, in particular, a transformation where we actually believe that we do not have a cheap goods, cheap wages, low skills economy, but that we believe it is possible for us to emulate what has been done in other small European countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Austria.  The only thing I would add to that is that only one of those four countries is a member of the EC. The others found it far more beneficial to themselves to remain outside the EC.</P>

      <P>The OECD talked about what we needed to do in order to develop industry.  Like everybody else, I suppose the reason I am quoting all this is because I agree with it.  I am not quoting it just to <Col N="476" /> put it on the record.  It is a very interesting detached external view of what we need in order to achieve real industrial development which is based on innovation and new product development.</P>
      <P>They list as their recommendations the following principles.  First of all, they recommend that the State should shift towards stimulating private entrepreneurial initiative.  I am not sure what they mean there because the State has always emphasised the development of private entrepreneurial initiative.  They go on to say that the country cannot afford to increase total public expenditure.  I have said often in the past that until such time as we are prepared to talk about renegotiating the one-third of our expenditure that is paid to banks, either national or international, we cannot really talk about increasing public expenditure.  It cannot go much above the present level.  The only way you could deal with higher public expenditure is by rescheduling the massive debts we have so that they are not covered by one generation over a five or ten year period.  That is for another day.</P>
      <P>They emphasise that there is ample room for reallocating existing State expenditure, particularly a reallocation of existing systems.  They emphasise the need for decentralisation and flexibility in decision making.  It is particularly welcome that the IDA have decentralised to a large extent their decision making procedures for dealing with small industries.  The OECD would have us go further and involve local authorities and communities to the maximum extent in the developing process.  We should think that one through, about how we could involve local authorities in doing more than making speeches and asking the IDA to do something, because at local level whenever we have a problem in the area of unemployment the first thing we do is denounce the IDA rather than get involved in developing a local strategy for industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third recommendation the OECD made was to support investment in brains rather than in fixed assets.  I know the Bill goes some way in this direction.  I <Col N="477" /> would like to quote what the Conferderation of Irish Industry summarises as the OECDs recommendations.</P>
    <P>That modern development relies more and more on investment in brains.  Price is no longer a dominant factor in international markets. Advance firms of a high technology area invest in research and development, marketing, training and softwares as much as in building equipment and machinery.  Ireland should as a key element in its development strategy, move towards knowledge intensive industries while focusing on the factors most relevant to her needs and capabilities.  We should concentrate on applying new technologies, developing market intelligence, continually upgrading the labour force, enriching management capabilities and emphasising product and service quality improvement.</P>
    <P>These are things that are part of an industrial strategy which are not as widely understood or as widely accepted as they should be.  We still, both in politics and outside it, see the role of the IDA as being that of giving grants to get companies to go somewhere or to build a factory somewhere.  Either the IDA or some other State agency must have an equally important role in carrying out the sort of recommendations that the OECD have made about cultural changes in Irish society and perceptions of ourselves in Irish society which are all a necessary part of an industrial strategy which develops native industrial large scale industry.</P>
    <P>My view has always been that the State must play a central role in the development of native industry because it is only the State that can accumulate the capital resources to take the risks to develop large scale industrial enterprises.</P>
    <P>On that issue there is the question of developing new products.  That brings us on immediately to the question of research.  According to the figures produced by the Confederation of Irish Industry, the manpower engaged in research and development in this country, <Col N="478" /> full time equivalents, in 1984 amounted to 1,805 people.  It does not strike me as being a particularly large investment of manpower in research and development.  In agriculture &mdash; this is one that knocked me backwards &mdash; there were 12.8 people involved in research and development in 1984, according to the Conferderation of Irish Industry.  In research and development in agriculture in this country less than 13 people are employed full time.  I find this figure very difficult to take.  This is separate from food processing and drink processing.  It is actually agriculture itself.  Food, drink and tobacco works out at 253 people. It is not a particularly large number of people.</P>
    <P>I would like to contrast this country, with its abysmally low level of investment in research and development, with the fact that another small country, admittedly far more successful than ourselves, Sweden, actually invests by far the highest proportion of GNP in research and development.  It is far higher than any other country in the OECD.  The contrast between Ireland, as a struggling country with debts and poorly developing industry, poorly developing infrastructure, and Sweden, with one of the highest levels of industrial production and industrial innovation in the world, speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the OECD have been quite critical of the way in which Sweden has pursued industrial development in recent years.  They regard it as somewhat wasteful.  The achievement of Sweden has been to restructure its industry, to modernise its industry, so that it has the highest by far level of robot involvement in industry in the world.  It is far higher by a factor of two even than Japan.  Yet, it has yet managed, notwithstanding that degree of automation, to maintain its unemployment level in or around 3 per cent.  That is the sort of target we should be setting ourselves. The real core in achieving that sort of target is a change in how we look at ourselves and what we think about ourselves.  Lack of investment in research and development, in new product devel- <Col N="479" /> opment, is not so much an absolute shortage of funds, because there are never absolute shortages of funds; there are only relative shortages of funds and relative degrees of priority.  The real problem is the lack of a belief that that sort of investment yield the sort of results that we need and want in this country.  I always think that one of the saddest facts about this country is that one of the most successful new Irish products in recent times, Bailey's Irish Cream, was developed not in this country but in a laboratory in the United Kingdom.  The process by which cream and whiskey, which are produced probably in better quality and quantity in this country than anywhere else in the world, were combined into a successful new product, was developed not in this country but in the United Kingdom.  It is that lack of an ability to think creatively that is really at the core of the problem of Irish indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>On the whole issue of industrial development, we have to begin to look at figures.  We are beginning to get figures about growth rates and exports.  I have used them myself politically on many occasions.  I wonder how real they are. Most economists now appear to accept that transfer pricing is practised by international multinationals on a massive scale in this country.  We have a very attractive location in terms of taxation.  Therefore they price down the raw materials they supply to local branches and price up their final product to maximise the profit generated in this country, presumably to minimise taxation payments elsewhere, particularly where double taxation agreements exist, and in the process give a somewhat inflated view of our industrial exports.  Given that the average growth in exports in recent years has been of the order of 10 or 12 per cent in real terms &mdash; it has been higher on some occasions &mdash; and given that exports represent about 50 per cent of our gross national product if you have a 10 per cent growth in exports and the overall national gross is of the order of 1 per cent, there must have been a decline of the order of 9 per cent in our <Col N="480" /> domestic economy.  That is a large part of the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know how real the growth in exports is.  If it is not real then we should realise it is not and we should identify ourselves as being a hell of a lot poorer than we are.  If it is real then we have developed a dual economy.  We have a booming export market controlled largely outside the country developing new products which may or may not be manufactured within the country.  The strategy of encouraging multinationals to do research here may be attractive in the short term, but the fact that they develop their product here is absolutely no guarantee that they will manufacture it here. Given that most of the products they are manufacturing they developed elsewhere, there is no reason to believe they will stay here.</P>
    <P>We have to develop a strategy which will encourage indigenous industry with firm roots here to develop new products which will be sold in international markets.  I believe there is a central role for the State in the area of identifying ideas, of supporting ideas and of enabling the sort of capital formation and risk taking that no individual should take.  I do not believe that any part of our encouraging entrepreneurial activity should necessitate this thing that is so much boasted about and causes so much irritation in so many places, that some poor misfortunate person actually has to mortgage his house in order to set up an industry.</P>
    <P>I regard it as a barbaric practice by banks that people should have to put their family's security at risk in order to endeavour to set up an industry in this country.  If we cannot develop a more humane and sensible way of protecting the risks of the banks and of protecting ourselves, then I do not think we should expect, encourage or regard as acceptable the idea that people have to put their homes and family security at risk in order to encourage industrial development.</P>
    <P>With all of that philosophising behind me, may I say that the general strategy and the general policy framework contained in the Bill are most welcome.  Not withstanding many criticisms I have made <Col N="481" /> in the past of the IDA, it is a model for many other State enterprises of success, of economy of effort and of identifying how to do a job and to do it very successfully.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the future successes of the IDA.</P>

I asked that the Air Pollution Bill be brought forward because of problems that may arise here. I was shocked and scared listening to the news this afternoon to hear that not alone did one nuclear reactor burn out in the USSR but a second one, according to satellite pictures, has burnt out.  We sympathise with the people of the Ukraine on what happened there, but now the second reactor apparently has burned out, if the information we are getting from western intelligence is accurate. The Minister and the diplomatic corps should use every effort to get proper information from that region and find out exactly what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by welcoming the Bill.  It is nice to see that it does what I was talking about here the other day in the debate on another Bill, namely introducing amendments into the Industrial Development Authority Act. That is very interesting from my point of view.</P>
      <P>It has to be admitted that the IDA have done a very good job through the years. They will continue to do more good work even though things may become more difficult for job creation.  They will encounter more awkward situations than they have met heretofore, particularly when they are competing in counties affected by the recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The types of suitable enterprises chosen will need great capacity.  They have that capacity.  It would be ridiculous to suggest that the IDA or any other employment agency can provide a recipe for the creation of full employment.  Full employment is not easily or painlessly attained.  Jobs are not easily created.  We should recognise the role of the IDA in the pursuit of full employment, which must remain an aspiration.  The idea of full employment must be pursued.  There are many interpretations of full employment.  Some people have the interpretation of an acceptable level of unemployment, or measure their employment situation against the numbers emigrating.  We would like to think <Col N="484" /> in terms of aspiring to full employment. The IDA would like to contribute towards that.  Certainly they will not be responsible for it, nor could they be.</P>
    <P>We should look at the appropriate agencies and examine some of the major obstacles which get in the way of creating jobs.  That might be better left in the area of Government, but some assistance may be hyped off in that direction towards them.  There are impediments to job creation.  We must think about how to provoke thought about and wider discussion of the subject.  This would necessitate an examination of the choices facing each section of the community and considering broad strategy.  The IDA, despite the good work they do, are only an element in the broad strategy.  I am talking about a strategy that would embrace the concept of the economy becoming increasingly capable of maintaining full employment.  For example there is the whole area of rising standards of living based on a price and cost structure which can compete with other countries, output per worker; productivity of investments; the whole question of savings, exports. These are all part of a broad strategy &mdash; the skills and knowledge available to us. It is easy to say that these are not the concern of the IDA.  A lot of it is the concern of the IDA in the sense that they must sell it.  But it is not the concern of the IDA that they create that situation. It is a matter for the Government and the community to give the kind of leadership where the will is hardened towards that particular objective.  To realise our own potential in this broad strategy we must give them as much assistance as possible. The consolidation measure before us goes some way in this direction.  It certainly may be much more beneficial to the legislators than it is to the IDA.  There will be a spin-off for the IDA in the sense that it will harmonise things a little so that they will not have to keep jumping from one particular Act to another because certain Acts are repealed.  It possibly may tend towards greater efficiency or helping them to improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>We can introduce legislation that will <Col N="485" /> assist them, but is that the simple answer? Or should we be at the point, after three and a half years of Government, of producing a broad strategy?  While we may be on the way to it, the direct answer must be that we have not yet arrived.  The Government are in pursuit of this broad strategy.</P>
    <P>Obviously when pursuing any strategy, whether for job creation or whatever, certain difficulties get in the way.  One great difficulty in a free market society, private enterprise, is the will of particular localities, groups or special interest people.  They are not easy to deal with. They are impediments to creating a very broad strategy which would assist the IDA and other job creation agencies.  It is difficult in circumstances to achieve and maintain equilibrium in the balance of payments.  I say this because we are living in a scrambling, selfish system.  We are not prepared to give the objective we set ourselves precedence over the subordinate things that are more important to the group or section or the special interests we pursue.  Experience will show that the rate of emigration that existed in the sixties satisfied the situation regarding the creation of full employment.  The rate of emigration nowadays, coupled with other factors, will take pressure off the collective will of the community to subordinate its special interests to the overall objective.  Emigration is a good release valve.  In those circumstances it is hard to get the collective will to make the changes and to take the action that is needed to achieve full employment.</P>
    <P>Apart from full employment, it is difficult to get people to go beyond paying lip service to the whole question of job creation.  On the one hand they set down the means by which the jobs can be pursued and on the other hand when it comes to the question of the means it is like, as the saying goes: &ldquo;I do not mind change as long as it affects the other fellow&rdquo;. This is the situation that we have to deal with and it is not easy for any job-creating agency; it is not easy for any Government. <Col N="486" />  The Government are doing their best in this direction.  They are suffering, not because they are not guilty of some of it as they were in Government too in the past.  By the habits and attitudes we allowed to grow down through the years we always looked at the industrialists and agriculturalists, and so on, as being the workers and did not have regard to the community as a whole.  Consequently, the whole system has got to the stage where it is &ldquo;the devil take the hindmost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite that observation we have a duty to keep up the pursuit and to lay the conditions for job creation, always bearing in mind that the IDA and the NDC cannot be held responsible for conditions that are not laid down properly for them.  We cannot turn round and say that the IDA are doing a bad job.  On the one hand we cannot argue that a broad study along certain lines should be pursued, agree with the means and the end, and on the other hand not be prepared to suffer the consequences to realise the end and to then blame the agencies who are responsible for job creation.  Investors have a job to pursue and must take initiatives.  If we do not get the broad strategy right we cannot blame them for it.  We are here as legislators to lay down the broad strategy and to make it work in so far as it is practical to do so.</P>

When somebody goes abroad hears a few words of a foreign language, immediately after coming home they want to learn that language because they think it may be handy.  The minute they get into the language learning area they realise that they have to subordinate some other pleasures, that this is hard work and real sacrifice and then they do not want to know anything further.  This may not be the best analogy but our people talk about having desirable goals but do not like making the sacrifices necessary to realise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the fuller sense of national identity and social inter-dependence would not only have to be acknowledged, but accepted.  The widespread feeling of obligation, because of the way society and the system has grown up and the abuses of it, is a very rare commodity. If we are serious about full employment and job creation we must take another look at ourselves as a society.  In the area of leadership, tender mindedness has been unable to supply the unlimited credit that conscience of the whole nation.  What is needed in this area is an outcry from the religious and trade union leaders, employers, other organisations and institutions which have an influence on public opinion.  Unfortunately, it does not happen that way.  Until such time as it happens that way, we can forget the whole question &mdash; I am thinking in terms of unemployment &mdash; and we can get back to where we acquiesce to an acceptable level of unemployment.  I must be quite honest about this.  This acceptable level of unemployment does not appeal to me. I may be attributing that to the community &mdash; and I hope I am not wrong in doing so &mdash; but I say so on the basis of evidence of special interest and sectional groups and generally speaking, the failure, to <Col N="489" /> come together as a community to face up to the problems.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is now essential for the leaders in the areas I have mentioned to start a process of arousing the conscience and hardening the will.  If we do not choose to do this and implement the right policies, our own job creation agencies will not realise their fullest possible potential.  The potential is there, but the groundwork has got to be done.  The nation as a whole has to be influenced that they can do it.  They have got to be embraced, if you like, in this overall broad strategy.  I do not think that giving finance can change anything.  I do not think that standing up and praising the fact that it is a good organisation can do anything either.  At the same time, while we are standing up and doing this, either by action or design or because we are victims of the system we live under, we are putting impediments in the way of people who are seriously into the business of job creation.  We, rather than the job creation agencies are failing to pursue this broad strategy.  We want people to recognise it rather than pay lip service to it.  We want to put it to those people who believe in the means and the end but we do not want to utilise the means because of the sacrifice that goes with it.  They want that to be applied to somebody else. We have got to come to terms with that. To a great extent the Government are trying very hard in this area.  It is a difficult job because of the damage which has been done down through the years, not only by one Government but by a series of Governments.  Despite this the ground for advancement is being laid.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with everything the Government are doing with regard to a broad strategy, but they have accepted the challenge to stand up and be counted. Their message is not a popular one, and we have got to appreciate that.  For example, there are criticisms at present, over and above political paralysis, that we are an inept lot of people.  There have been many suggestions that we are a tired Coalition.  It is often mentioned &mdash; and perhaps it is right to draw attention to the numbers unemployed &mdash; that there <Col N="490" /> are quarter a million reasons why job creation should be pursued with greater intensity than ever before.  It is all right to talk about this but if one wants to be critical about it, it has to be realised that there is something that goes along with it.  One just cannot get up and make a broad statement, apply the safety of generalities, and expect to create jobs.  I do not know of any area where anybody advanced as a result of that type of criticism, catch cries or slogans.  They are the easiest thing in the world to create.</P>
    <P>At present there are arguments about the number of companies that go to the wall.  I could accept the criticism about that.  As an ex-trade union official, I feel very sore about jobs having to go. I was in a position where I had to negotiate a substantial number of redundancies due to modern technology and so on. It is not new.  The unemployment trend started in 1979.  In 1981, when unemployment figures were much lower than they are now, they stood at a post-war record. If you were making the argument at that time, that was the situation.  If you were making arguments about redundancies at that time, they were actually outstripping job creation just as they are now.  Agricultural incomes were halved in 1980-81. Inflation itself was running at a range of from 15 per cent to 20 per cent.  Two years in a row 1980-81, the balance of payments deficit exceeded £700 million. Of course, trade resources overall were dwindling.  It was not something new. Therefore, the criticism has to be answered to some extent and this is the way I choose to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not like to use the term that we have been facing up to clearing the mess, but the Government have had difficulties in dealing with the problems that have been growing from 1979 onwards.  I am not suggesting that this mess will be cleared up during the lifetime of this Government.  I do not think I imply either that I am satisfied with the redistribution of wealth in our society, but I am a realist and I recognise the difficulties of getting these things right.  I like to be fair when it comes to the question of criticising the Government and give them credit where <Col N="491" /> it is due.  It is easy enough to stand up and say that redundancies are outstripping job creation but this has been a fact of life since 1979.  This is the way it is going.</P>
    <P>I would like to get back to my own situation for a moment and the question of negotiating away jobs.  I do not like to emphasise it too much.  However if you take a place like Guinness's, who were faced with great difficulties, because it was a very old brewery and because the plant had to be modernised, the problem there did not last too long a period because of the spin-off from what Guinness themselves had gained.  When the season closed, malthouse workers used to get a full year's employment and Guinness made up the other eight months of the year from about 15 or 16 malthouses from all around the country, some from Athy, some from Wexford and so on. They had a casual list but in fact it was on contract to Harvey and McLoughlin, the builders.</P>
    <P>There were 232 people employed by Guinness on a day to day basis.  In most cases they got 11 months employment in the year.  Richardsons of Tara Street supplied every lorry they had to assist in transportation.  Warrens of Crane Street supplied dozens of lorries.  Other carriers throughout the country also supplied lorries.  CIE supplied trains and cars. Because of changes and new developments, all that is gone.  That is not taking into account the fact that there were in the order of 4,000 people employed in Guinness at that time.  In relation to direct employment, we are talking in the region of 1,200 or 1,300.  That was all over a very short period of time.  I have not taken into account many other things. There were a number of jobs lost which was outside the control of most people.</P>
    <P>If you make the argument about redundancies outstripping the creation of jobs &mdash; naturally I am a little concerned, because I do not want to see that happening &mdash; it goes back to the question of somebody making the decision in view of the fact that problems existed and that the trade would go somewhere else and <Col N="492" /> that you could save a number of jobs by following one of two courses.  One had the option of having the beer brewed elsewhere at a cheaper rate, or of getting into line with productivity per person and retaining a certain number of jobs.  Naturally, we took the latter option of saving the jobs for Dublin.  There was evidence at that time that they could actually brew the beer away from here, export it back in, and have it all done for about 25 shillings a barrel cheaper, in old money at that time.  That is a fact of life.  Because we were part of the community we had to accept the difficulties that existed and we had to face up to them.  That was over a 20 year period.  We have had this kind of situation all along.  It got greater emphasis in 1979 and onwards, and the difficulties are still there with us.  This is the reason it is not easy for us to stay quiet when we are being lashed with criticism which is not totally justified.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the 1981 situation, when there was a deficit of £500 million, which was a shocking figure.  It did not seem at that time that there were going to be any changes in economic policy.  It meant for the third year running that about £½ billion more than the Government collected was going out in order to sustain services.  One can see that there were great difficulties.  For example, in the Estimates for 1981 there was an opening deficit of £7 million.  It seemed a better picture, but ultimately when it was examined it was not any better than the one for the previous year.  The implication there was that £½ billion had been borrowed and now you were into the third year in succession, which was a bit of a breathtaking thing when you consider it.  This had to be met.  A quarter of all the tax revenue collected in that year went towards servicing the national debt. Out of every pound collected in income tax, 60p went on the debt interest.  This was a serious situation.  I am not an economist.  I can only deal with the question by reading from the economists of the day.  It seems that we were in trouble with the foreign banks.  They were not going to continue financing the Irish Exchequer at that rate of borrowing.  If <Col N="493" /> they had decided to cut off the credit the Irish banking system would have been able to supply the unlimited credit that would have been necessary for survival. I do not know enough about it.  I suppose I would not be brave if I did not suggest that, with the state things were in at that time, a company running business was very likely to go into liquidation or be taken into receivership.  One can see that the difficulties were going on from that time and they were not easy to deal with.</P>
    <P>Concerning job creation, I do not know what the IDA's role is in relation to cooperatives.  I think it is a very important area.  The IDA people know that the number of jobs needed in the coming decade will be much higher than it was previously, even if the percentage of the labour force did not rise further.  If one takes account of the projected growth in the labour force, the continuing level of job losses in manufacturing industry and the decline in the number in agriculture, the number of new jobs required outside agriculture is likely to be in excess of 20,000 per annum up to 1991.  We have a very big task here.  I have suggested that we need this broad strategy.  I have pointed out that we cannot stand up and support the IDA and other agencies and pat them on the back.  I am sure they do not want to be patronised in that way anyway.  We cannot do that unless we make up our minds that there is a broad strategy there which has to be followed. If the broad strategy is not followed then the whole idea of job creation becomes affected.</P>
    <P>At present we are trying to reduce unemployment by indirect means.  The emphasis must still be on creating an attractive environment for private and, in particular, foreign investment.  Somebody might say that Senator Jack Harte is not an advocate of the system.  That is very true, but he is also a realist and he lives in the system.  That is what the majority of the people want.  Therefore, when I speak in the context of looking for private enterpreneurs and so on, it is on the basis of reality: that is where you have to find people who are going to come in and set up jobs.  It has long been <Col N="494" /> recognised by the trade union movement that a mixed economy is the most acceptable and most workable for the Irish industrial climate.</P>
    <P>The question then occurs, when we are dealing with the broad strategy that we have to know if the wealth created in industry does not go automatically to the creation of employment.  We have to have means by which we make sure it gets there.  We cannot bring industries into production.  Indirect efforts are made and we get a certain amount of resistance.  We are always in a situation where there is a time lag and particularly in a depression period when the demand is reduced and industries everywhere are under extreme pressure to survive.  It is clear to me that, in fact, the whole question of sacrifice to create full employment is more talked about than actually meant.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate that we have to begin very quickly to get religious leaders, the group leaders, community leaders, trade unions and employers' leaders to try to harden the will of people.  As long as we do not act in that co-ordinated way we will always have this piecemeal situation and the reaction from the special interest groups, as I said earlier.  They will not have regard to the fact that the Government have been working on the business development scheme.  We are doing reasonably well out of it.  The Government have made it as attractive as possible.  Many people will not have regard to the fact that the National Development Corporation Act was recently passed and that that will start playing its part in job creation.  Therefore, they will not be tuned in to making the type of sacrifice that is necessary.  Some other form of leadership is needed in this area to assist these agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his Second Reading speech the management committee on industrial policy which has been established.  This is another good thing. Unless we can get the group leaders and the special interest people to sit up and take note these things can go for naught. The inference there is that the follow-up is the most essential thing in the world. One can create the climate but the follow-up <Col N="495" /> has got to be dealt with.  For example, the company development approach which involves the IDA, the IIRS and Córas Tráchtála who are working closely with selected companies is the right combination.  It does not matter whether we tell people about the 56 company development programmes approved by IDA during 1985.  They must still have the climate in which to implement programmes.  If we do not face up to the difficulties 56 companies may not be enough to meet the situation nowadays in order to deal with the question of employment.</P>
    <P>The regionalisation of the IDA's small industrial programme is also a very good thing.  It was completed in 1985 and is now available to the IDA offices.  The people of the mid-west and of the Gaeltacht areas are going to benefit by it.  On the whole question of follow-through, we must through local services and through many other means try to influence special interest groups to give leadership in the sense of calling for the sacrifices that must be made to bring about the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>It is good to see the new marketing initiatives but how far will those initiatives affect the fellow who is looking for retrospection or something like that and who is prepared to let the community suffer as long as he gets his retrospection payments?  It is not sufficient to say to the IDA: &ldquo;We have consolidated all these Acts into one Act and we have repealed certain Acts to facilitate you.&rdquo;  We cannot just say that we have a broad strategy here and if only we could get all sides to toe the line with regard to that strategy, the IDA could work much more effectively for us and we would be recognised as a much stronger force throughout the world and could attract more people into the country.  I have no doubt that, in fact, we would attract a substantially larger number than at the moment.  We will need to attract more people into the country in the future.</P>
    <P>The whole question of industrial relations here is very very important.  There is much work to be done in that direction. If we keep in that direction we can only <Col N="496" /> deal with the situation piecemeal, thus creating many problems.  May I ask what time is the debate on the agriculture motion, please?</P>

      <P>There is very little that is new in this Bill.  Indeed, there is very little in it that will have any impact on the present level of unemployment.  For the past number of years the number of new jobs created in the manufacturing industry has been considerably less than those lost.  There is nothing in this Bill that will reverse that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to certain policy changes set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy which was published in July 1984. In addition, the Bill provides for the consolidation of all existing legislation dealing with industrial development.  All the existing Acts are being repealed and reenacted with minor amendments and with the omission of a number of obsolete provisions.  This could be described as a very desirable tidying-up exercise in the area of industrial development legislation.  Something considerably more than a tidying up exercise is required in a situation where we have 250,000 people unemployed.  Over the past three years there have been a record number of factory closures.  In addition, many companies have cut back on their workforces <Col N="497" /> in every part of the country.  Workers have been laid off or are on short time. The great decline in jobs has been in the older, labour-intensive industries but all these factors have contributed to a situation where we have a unprecedented level of unemployment in the country at present.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy holds out little hope that there will be any dramatic improvement in the job situation.  In fact, if one were to read between the lines, as they say, one could only conclude that the situation will continue to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The White Paper forecasts that manufacturing output will double over the next ten years, but as far as jobs are concerned the estimate is that the doubling of output will only lead to an overall growth of between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs a year in manufacturing.  If these targets are achieved some non-manufacturing jobs will arise as a result, but the White Paper does not see the number of such jobs as being in any way significant.  If the targets are not achieved, then I am afraid the outlook, as far as our young people are concerned, is very bleak.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the IDA and every other agency involved in job creation in Ireland will have to work very hard over the next number of years if we are to have any hope of reversing the situation where the numbers of jobs lost in manufacturing industry is greater than the number of new jobs created.</P>
    <P>This country has advantages and disadvantages for industrial development. These are outlined in Chapter 1 of the White Paper which deals with the objectives of industrial policy.  Our two biggest handicaps are identified as our peripheral location in Europe and the absence of a large home market.  On the other hand section 1.13 on page seven states:</P>
    <P>We possess many advantages for industrial development.  We offer one of the most generous and comprehensive incentive packages available anywhere in the world.  There is an adequate supply of graduate, skilled and semi-skilled labour.  Increasingly our education system is being geared <Col N="498" /> towards the needs of modern industry. On completion this year of a major investment programme, we will have one of the most advanced telecommunications system in Europe.  The consistency and stability over many years of our policies for industrial development have been a major source of strength.  Changes in Government have not resulted in major reversals of policy as has happened in other countries.  There has always been a favourable Government attitude towards investment in Ireland by foreign industry.</P>
    <P>While these advantages are undoubtedly there, I believe that in order to get them into perspective we must look at them in the context of a number of other factors which are outlined in the White Paper. On page 15 in section 3.1 states that:</P>
    <P>Until the recent recession it was generally expected that the development of manufacturing industry would largely solve our employment problems.  This perception has now altered. The recession has led to a high level of job losses in manufacturing.  There has also been a world-wide fall-off in the number of new jobs in industry, because of the rise in productivity flowing from the industrial application of advances in technology.</P>
    <P>A further section in this chapter goes on to point out the international background against which industrial development in Ireland will take place over the next decade.  Therefore, it is only if we get everything right that the hope for expansion in manufacturing industry will take place.</P>
    <P>Section 3.4 on page 16 sounds a note of warning in relation to the prospects for direct employment in agriculture.  There is no doubt that the events of the past week have underlined the accuracy of that forecast.  I believe that section 3.17 of the White Paper on page 21 is one of the most relevant and important sections in the whole document.  This section states:</P>
    <P>Much of Irish industry needs additional <Col N="499" /> investment in marketing, new technology and product development to survive.  This can be provided by retained profits or increased equity. The level of profit which industry has earned, and will earn in the future, is one of the factors which will determine whether this much needed investment will take place.  Apart from the new foreign firms, 90 per cent of which are very profitable, the rest of industry has seen its profits decline rapidly or disappear altogether in recent years.  The restoration of industry's profitability must be an immediate objective.</P>
    <P>That section reiterates a basic principle which no one can dispute and that is if industry is profitable it will survive and prosper and if it is not it will go to the wall.  The section quoted refers to the additional investment required in marketing, new technology and product development.  While all these three areas are vital to the continued survival of any industry I believe that marketing is the area in which the greatest weaknesses have existed in the past.  I further believe that there is little point in investing in the other areas referred to if the improvement in marketing is not given the priority to which it is entitled and which it requires.  Many of our problems in the past have arisen not because we could not produce the goods but because having produced them we could not sell them.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5 of the White Paper deals with the incentives for industrial development which exist at present and also with the Telesis recommendation for greater selectivity in the use of these incentives. It would appear to have been with the background of this chapter that section 21 and sections 4 and 5 of the Bill have been drafted.  There is a fear in certain quarters, particularly in the west of Ireland, that if the provisions of section 21 are rigidly applied in the western counties very few, if any, industrial undertakings will qualify for IDA grant support.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in subsection 3 (b) of section 21 to industries which will produce products of an advanced technological nature for supply to internationally <Col N="500" /> trading or skilled sub-supply firms within the State.  It can be readily appreciated that most of these types of enterprises are located, and will be located in the future, in the larger centres of population, close to universities and third level colleges.  Therefore, in counties which have major constraints in terms of industrial development because of the high dependence on agriculture and the small-town structure within these counties, it will be essential to realise that small industries locating in these areas will require special attention and financial support from the State development agencies.  I hope that nothing in section 21 will be used to inhibit in any way industrial development in the west.  There are enough disadvantages in the west at present.  It needs all the help, encouragement and incentive that can be provided.</P>
    <P>Sections 5.37 to 5.41 on pages 47 and 48 of the White Paper deal with the issue of designation.  This is another area which is causing considerable worry and anxiety in the west of Ireland because of the fact that section 4 (3) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order terminate the designation of any area, or part thereof, as a designated area.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that under the Industrial Development Acts the IDA is empowered to offer a higher level of grants to projects locating in the designated areas.  The areas which have been designated are the most disadvantaged in the country, not alone from the point of view of industrial development, but also from the point of view of agriculture.  The fact that higher maxima obtain for grants for new industries locating in the designated areas has been significant in projects locating in these areas.  Indeed, the expansion of existing industry in the designated areas has also occurred in many cases as a result of the higher rate for grants which are available in these areas. It is stated in the White Paper, at paragraph 5.40, and I quote:</P>
    <P>A detailed analysis will, therefore, be carried out on the relative strengths <Col N="501" /> and weaknesses of all the counties in the country on the basis of objective criteria, and at regular intervals. NESC, which has undertaken a number of studies on regional policy in Ireland, was asked in September, 1983 to advise on these criteria.  The objective is to ensure that areas are designated for higher grant purposes for clearly defined industrial sectors and limited periods so that limited resources can be continuously reallocated to the areas of greatest need and potential.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5.41, it states:</P>
    <P>Pending completion of this NESC review, IDA has been asked to give priority in industrial location policy to locating projects in areas (a) where growth and job creation prospects are greatest, (b) which are the most seriously affected by unemployment and job losses, and (c) with highest prospective labour force growth.</P>
    <P>Since the White Paper was published the NESC report was also published and has become available.  I believe that there are many points put forward in the NESC report which are a cause of considerable worry in the designated areas.  Naturally, I recognise that there is a need to review on an on-going basis the criteria used for designation and the effects of designation.  However, I would be seriously concerned at a number of the conclusions put forward in the NESC report.  One of the conclusions is that designation should be based on potential as opposed to need. This is something that could have serious implications for many of the existing designated counties or designated areas.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would not accept the adoption as growth centres of the centres proposed in the Buchanan report.  I strongly feel that such an approach would be detrimental to the west of Ireland generally. In the Buchanan report it is proposed that there should be 34 growth centres, but of that 34 only 12 are located in the western half of the country.  I feel that the implementation of that proposal would militate against the western part of the <Col N="502" /> country.  Also, I could not agree with any proposal to concentrate infrastructural development in a limited number of locations at the expense of the remainder of the country.  Furthermore, the proposal contained in the report that labour market, balance, should be used as the criterion for designation and that designation should be determined by potential rather than by need, is something with which I could not agree.</P>
    <P>I believe that other factors should be taken into account in deciding on designation &mdash; for instance, the heavy dependence on agricultural employment which obtains in many areas, particularly in the western half of the country and also the fact that there is a weak urban structure in the areas I am speaking about and indeed a declining population and many infrastructural deficiencies.  There is also a low <i>per capita</i> income.  Furthermore, I believe that the level of unemployment as a percentage of the workforce, while in certain areas it might be below the national average, is an unrealistic factor in that a large percentage of the workforce which are statistically shown to be employed in agriculture are, in fact, substantially underemployed.  Very often there is a situation where three agricultural workers can be shown as being employed on a farm of, say, 35 acres. Therefore, the percentage of the workforce statistically shown as unemployed in a rural county can be misleading.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that full responsibility for the decision-making process in relation to small industry has been devolved to the regional offices of the IDA and that the regional development boards have been established.  I also want to welcome the fact that county development teams are now involved in examining proposals for grant assistance under the IDA's small industry sector.  I believe that county development teams are not being given, and have never been given, enough credit for the excellent work which they have done down through the years.  There can be no greater force for <Col N="503" /> development in a county than a county development team with a dynamic county development officer.  The county development team concept was based on the idea of co-operation between the key officials in the county, the volunteer groups, private enterprise and the central administration.  A record number of jobs have been created down through the years through the efforts of the county development teams.  I think it is worth noting also that the jobs which have been created through the agency of the county development teams have the lowest State cost per job of any job creation agency in the country.  The county development teams have a continuing vital role to play in economic development, particularly that of the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to refer, briefly, also to a couple of other points in the Minister's speech. I welcome the fact that a nationwide network of one-stop shops has been set up and that entrepreneurs will be able to obtain information and advice on all aspects of setting up and running a business in these one-stop shops.  This is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the establishment of the National Development Corporation and to the principal objective of the National Development Corporation, which will be to invest in viable projects in order to assist in the maximum level of job creation.  I do not know how successful the National Development Corporation will prove to be, but I believe that particularly in the designated areas, the National Development Corporation should liaise with the county development teams.  It is through this liaison with the county development teams that I believe the National Development Corporation can have the best prospects of succeeding in the area of job creation in the designated areas in the western areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a provision in section 6 for a review of national industrial performance every three years.  I am pleased to hear that.  A review is taking place at the moment and the results of this review will be available before the end of 1986.  In so far as there is an <Col N="504" /> emphasis in the Bill on providing assistance to the smaller industrial projects, I believe that this is to be welcomed.  The Minister states that section 21 of the Bill will allow for new arrangements to be introduced in respect of industrial development grants for small industry and that the new system will allow promoters of small industrial projects to avail of employment grants as an alternative to grants towards the cost of machinery and buildings.  This will encourage more small industries to start up, particularly in the case of industries which have possibly closed down, to enable the new promoter to purchase the second-hand equipment and avail of grants.  The situation up to now was that if the equipment being purchased was second-hand it was not eligible for grant aid.</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Senators who have paid tribute to the IDA and I wish the IDA continued success in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>As I said when opening the debate, this Bill brings together for the first time in one comprehensive code the existing body of legislation relation to industrial development and the IDA.  I was at pains to emphasise that a great deal of study has been done in the preparation of the White Paper on Industrial Policy, which formed the basis of the Government's philosophy in regard to industrial policy.  I should like to thank all Senators who contributed to the debate in a constructive manner.  The question of industrial development is wide-ranging and some of the contributions ranged beyond the direct involvement of the Bill before the House.  I can understand the reasons for the contributions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening speech I summarised the objectives of our industrial strategy and I outlined some of the new schemes and programmes which are being implemented.  I am glad of some of the constructive suggestions and ideas put forward by Members of this House and these will be considered by me.  I will be happy to have them considered in depth. <Col N="505" /> In Ireland there has been a broad consensus in approach to industrial development.  The evolution of policy has been on a pragmatic rather than on an ideological basis.  This has resulted in a fairly adaptable attitude towards industrial development and has resulted in a consistent environment where indigenous industrial development has enabled us to successfully promote a high level of inward investment.  A wide range of questions and suggestions have been put forward and many of them are more appropriate to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I will consider them at that stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly deal with some of the major issues raised in the course of Second Stage debate.  I agree with Senator Lynch regarding the importance of encouraging small firms to increase the equity base of their companies.  Much has been done over the past two years to encourage such a development.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch acknowledged the introduction of the business development scheme, which has been made more flexible in the last two years.  The small companies market of the Stock Exchange will create a market for shares in smaller companies.  This will also provide a mechanism to assist the development scheme. The IDA will encourage projects under the enterprise development scheme to have higher level of equity shareholding than heretofore.  The growth in venture capital companies and funds in Ireland, which has been actively encouraged by the former Minister, Deputy John Bruton, will be continued and receive Government support.  There has been a reduction in the bias in the tax code to encourage investment in equities rather than in property and in Government securities.  These are some of the measures which have been taken by the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>The matter of the Copyright Bill was raised by Senator Lynch.  I understand why he raised it.  The position is that the Copyright Bill is presently awaiting reintroduction.  This is now a matter for agreement between the Whips.  At the start of business today the Leader of the House noted Senator Lanigan's and <Col N="506" /> Senator Lynch's comments and anxiety to have the Bill introduced at an earlier date.  I am glad to give an undertaking that I will follow this through as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had quite a debate with the two Senators some time ago on this issue.  Senator Lynch also referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses on small manufacturing industry.  I made a detailed response to this report when it was discussed in this House and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, also made a major statement in the Dáil on the report and had a worthwhile meeting with all members of the committee. Many of the recommendations in the report have been acted on.  These include the &ldquo;One Stop Shops&rdquo;, regionalisation of the small industries programme and the provision of management training grants for small industries.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point made by Senator Lynch about the IPU and Scholl, I will arrange to have this matter examined by my Department, to determine if the practice involved is covered under the restrictive practices legislation.  If any of the Irish industries wish to make a complaint in this regard, that would be examined under that heading.</P>
      <P>I take Senator Howard's point about ensuring that the new selectivity criteria should not result in the rejection of potentially viable projects.  I am satisfied that this will not be the case, but I am trying to encourage companies to have properly formulated business plans and strategies and an adequate financial base to ensure that the projects have a reasonable prospect of success.  That is a reasonable request on requirement of the Industrial Development Authority which is dispensing many millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Howard's comments in regard to the important role which SFADCo is playing in the midwest region and south-west Offaly.  The Senator may wish to note that a new Bill <Col N="507" /> will shortly be introduced in the Dáil to raise SFADCo's financial limits to enable it to continue its effective role over the next three to four years.  This matter was also raised by Senator Fitzsimons. SFADCo has its own separate legislation and that is the reason why it is not incorporated in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard made some very constructive comments.  He welcomed efforts in regard to promoting the linkage programme and in regard to creating the right environment for industry.  He also made reference to equity funds in the business expansion scheme.  I am pleased to note his welcome for my commitment to strengthening the equity base of companies through the new business expansion scheme and a new selectivity grant scheme.  These are innovative and updating approaches to the use of the funds and to the environment for small industry. I welcome his supportive remarks.  The success of our industrial development strategy depends not only on the Government's commitment but on the active collaboration of all sectors of our economy and sections of our community. Senators have a vital role to play in bringing the new industrial incentives to the attention of entrepreneurs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Howard's comments that we cannot afford to leave ourselves open to charges of industrial sabotage.  I only hope that commonsense will prevail in the industrial relations area.  Specific reference was made to a certain company.  It is very sad for me to be looking at that long-standing dispute. I feel the dispute is to the detriment of all the workers in the area concerned. I would hope that sense would prevail. However, this is a matter for the Minister for Labour and I would not wish to impinge on his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard also spoke about the effect of new criteria on small industry.  I appreciate his concern.  Similar concern was expressed by other Senators and in particular by Senator Mullooly, who also raised this matter.  I would, however, remind Senators that a central feature <Col N="508" /> of our innovative strategy is that there would be a concentration of scarce State resources on those projects which have long term prospects of sustaining themselves as internationally trading companies.  The essence of the selective approach to grant aiding industry involves some fall-off in the number of projects being aided.  The corollary is, however, that the projects being assisted will be better geared and will create sustainable jobs directly, will increase the value-added and output and create the spin-off jobs in the wider economy.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Senator Fitzsimons' point that the Bill represents a bookkeeping exercise.  That is a very facile and unhelpful remark. He made a point that he was suspicious about the shift in State resources and that additional investment is needed.  It may surprise the House to learn that in 1983 £430 million was spent by Departments and agencies directly or indirectly on industrial development.  This is a very substantrial amount of money.  It behoves all of us in these difficult economic times to ensure that such money represents the best value for money for all the taxpayers and the citizens of this country.  The present Bill gives effect to the advice we have received over the past number of years.  It reflects the shift in resources from supporting fixed assets to supporting technology acquisition and research and development.  We can encourage companies to address these weaknesses in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons asked that the proposed review of industrial performance should be carried out on a yearly basis. That is simply not possible.  You could not get the trends on an annual basis. You need a period to see how trends are going.  It would not be possible to carry out an annual review.</P>
    <P>I can agree with Senator Fitzsimons' favourable comments on the IIRS.  It is doing an excellent job and we will continue to ensure that it plays a full role in our industrial policy.  I will bring his comments in regard to <i>Technology Ireland</i> to the attention of the institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> Senator Fitzsimons also spoke on the maximum amount of grants available for fixed assets in R and D and technology acquisition.  In regard to fixed assets grants there is, I believe, a consensus that the maximum grant should be pitched at the right level.  In regard to R and D and technology acquisition we are circumscribed by EC State aid rules which limit these amounts to 50 per cent of eligible costs.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the very constructive and thought provoking remarks of Senator O'Leary.  I appreciate his comments on the Bill.  Of course, the philosophy behind the Bill can be found in the White Paper on Industrial Policy and, indeed, going back to other major reports.  We have spelt out our philosophy quite clearly in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan spoke about our incentive package and a tax regime for industry, especially foreign industry.  It would, of course, be better if we were able to attract industry without any grants because there would be no burden on the taxpayer.  In fact, because of our geographical location and because of the state of development of our economy, we do need to give grants.  It is important that we pitch the level of grants at a level which will be attractive to international mobile capital.  We should indeed be attractive to indigenous entrepreneurs to become involved in industry.  The IDA operate a very sophisticated cost-benefit analysis for all major industrial projects.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also commented on innovation and I can agree with his comments on the very low level of R and D and innovation in Irish industry.  Specific new incentives to encourage such activities are included in the Bill.  First, there is the extension of eligible costs under the R and D grant scheme and, secondly, the new technology acquisition grant scheme should be welcomed by all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte highlighted the difficulties in achieving full employment and in particular the impact of technological advances on manufacturing employment. This is why I made a particular reference <Col N="510" /> in my opening remarks to the employment impact of industrial development in the context of the Government's targets for increase in net manufacturing employment as set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly expressed concern about the use of section 4 of the Bill and its impact, particularly in western counties.  In my opening remarks today I set out as far as possible the position as regards changes in the designated areas. While I have noted the Senator's comments, he will appreciate that the purpose in commissioning NESC to recommend objective criteria was to ensure that impartial advice would be available to the Government in regard to any future decisions on this very sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that industrial output increased by nearly 3 per cent in 1985 and industrial exports rose by 6 per cent.  Although this was down on the outturn for 1984, the spread of growth was more widely based in traditional sectors such as glass, cement and food, drink and tobacco.  More than 950 investment projects were approved through IDA support, well ahead of the 1984 figure. Planned investment and fixed assets by these corporations is expected to reach £½ billion.  Industry contributed to employment in the rest of the economy through purchases of services and overheads.  The estimated net growth of 7,000 jobs in services employment during 1985 was undoubtedly contributed to by this industrial growth.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks I look forward with confidence to 1986.  The macroeconomic position facing Irish industry is improving and I believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the more favourable international situation.  I can commend the Bill to the House.</P>

I have tabled amendments to Report Stage which, I understand, were ruled out of order for the same reason as earlier amendments along the same lines by Senator Durcan <Col N="512" /> and by Senator Fallon were ruled out.  I would ask the Minister to share the concern of this House with regard to the manner in which subsection (2) of section 2 was drafted and to concede at least one principle, that, where a court adjudicates on contributory negligence, that would be binding on the health board.  I will not press it to a vote but the Minister owes it to this House to consider the points raised in the discussion in this House. Members on all sides put forward an argument which was not answered and which was not capable of being answered. The Minister gave us the clear impression last week that he was in sympathy with us.  If the Minister is not going to concede on it he will not find me troublesome.  I will depart wounded but graciously.</P>

      <P>If he were to claim we would finish up in the Supreme Court in relation to the particular charges envisaged.  Since we adjourned at 3.30 p.m. this afternoon I have again consulted the senior parliamentary draftsperson, his colleagues and the Attorney General on the points raised by the Senators.  I have to reiterate that the advice I have received is to the effect that the Bill as <Col N="513" /> drafted is still the most suitable form for dealing with all the different complex types of cases which can arise in respect of road traffic accidents and at the same time providing protection to the injured party and to the health boards in dealing with charges in a reasonable and a fair manner.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the intention of the subsection is quite clear and open to only one reasonable interpretation, namely that the health boards have the power to waive the whole or part of a charge having regard to two factors, first, the amount of damages actually received &mdash; as I explained to my colleagues, that charge can only be activated after the money has been received &mdash; and second, any reduction of the amount of damages resulting from the contributory negligence of the injured party.  Therefore it is quite clear that the subsection is obliging the health boards to have such regard and implies in a very definite way that they should act on the basis of such a reduction.  They should also act in a reasonable manner.  I intend to convey that view very adamantly to the chief executive officers of the health boards.  It goes beyond the scope of the Bill and indeed of the House itself to ponder the possibility of one or more health boards in the future taking a draconian action towards the imposition or the waiving of charges.  I strongly feel the view that if they were to act in such a fashion they would be considered to be in breach of the subsection and would then leave themselves open to a very logical and very acceptable defence to any action that they might take to recover charges under section 3 (1) of the Bill.  I consulted extensively on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arises out of a Supreme Court decision.  We won the case in the High Court: we lost it in the Supreme Court. I am very reluctant at this stage, having spoken at length to the legal draftspersons concerned, and being aware that any Bill may again be subject to constitutionality actions, to disclose any further &ldquo;ruminations&rdquo; on my part.  With the weather so bad and grass so scarce, those <Col N="514" /> ruminations might not produce any milk at all.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 38, after &ldquo;which&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;damages or compensation are paid&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an award of damages is made or compensation paid (whichever is the earlier)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that a cause of action will arise in the case where damages are recovered following a determination by a court as and from the moment a determination is made in other cases as and from the time when the damages are received by the injured party.  As the section stands, the cause of action arises, is deemed to accrue, on the date on which damages or compensation are paid, which is somewhat different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that if the amendment were passed such debts would accrue on the date an award was made or compensation paid whichever was the earlier.  This could involve a demand for payment before the injured party received his or her compensation and when he or she could not possibly be in a position to pay the charges.  I do not think that Senator Durcan would wish that to be so.  A sizeable time lag could exist between the making of an award and actual payment of damages; therefore we put in, after very careful consideration, the original wording.  It is to the benefit of the injured party.  The health board would have to, in effect, wait for their money until the party have the money in their hands.</P>

I put down the amendment for the purpose of giving health boards the legal mechanism to recover very speedily from, for instance, an insurance company.</P>

      <P>Under section 29 of Standing Orders, I wish to move a motion for the adjournment of the Seanad on a specified and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, the matter being:</P>
      <P>The disastrous consequences for Irish Agriculture of the farm price package agreed to by the Minister for Agriculture and the urgent need for the Government to demand a special meeting of the Council of Foreign Minister to review the farm price package.</P>
      <P>The proposals agreed by the Council of Ministers will have a disastrous effect on Irish agriculture.  Agriculture will always be vital to Ireland's economy.  In view of our favourable climate and other natural advantages for agricultural production, to neglect this sector would represent an irresponsible waste of natural resource and bad national economic management.</P>
      <P>Agriculture employs directly 15 per cent of our labour force.  Gross output in 1984-85 amounted to over £2.5 billion and agricultural exports exceeded £1.6 billion.  This is something which should be taken account of, not just in deciding Irish economic policy but equally in settling the lines of development and the priorities of European Community policies.  If we examine the deal we are discussing here this evening as it relates to milk production, we find that dairy farmers stand to lose £29 million per year because of the introduction of the milk cessation scheme which will take 3 per cent off the national milk quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish climate enables us to produce some of the best grass in the world, which makes us very competitive producers of milk.  In the last decade we have concentrated our resources on expanding milk production, which makes up about one-third of farm output.  It is bad economics that we should be forced to renounce our natural advantage because of factory type <Col N="517" /> overproduction on the Continent based on large scale imports of foodstuffs from outside the Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the Dáil on 4 April 1984 that not only would our entitlements not be reduced in future years but that we would have priority in regard to the distribution of any additional quantities which become available.  Those words sound very hollow now that the same Minister is prepared to accept a cut in our milk quota of 3 per cent without even a murmur of protest.</P>
    <P>The tillage sector is the prime loser in this agreement.  The removal of the price supports will mean a 15 per cent price drop which could force many of the 30,000 farmers involved out of business. Indeed, the Minister for Agriculture has confirmed that these cereal growers stand to lose £10 million under this deal.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector, the real crunch is merely postponed to later this year. There is no guarantee that the carcase intervention mechanism will be used to deliver £120 million in price supports, as the Minister for Agriculture suggests.</P>
    <P>The very basis of the Common Agricultural Policy, indeed the overriding reason why this State joined the EC, is being whittled away through quotas, cutbacks and curbs.  Urban dwellers see the Community's problems stemming from the support given to those who work on the land, but the Common Agricultural Policy costs as little as 0.6 per cent of Europe's gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>We must resist every effort to dismantle the Common Agricultural Policy.  We must resist, more effectively and with greater unity of effort, the implementation of policies that would be an undoubted setback of major proportions to our economy.  We should not be caught up in a situation where quotas and penal levies are placed on lines of production in which we have not reached our potential. We are one of the least developed countries in the Community, in which agriculture plays so large a role.  This should be recognised by our negotiators at Council level.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers have had a disastrous year because of the bad weather in 1985.  Their <Col N="518" /> morale is very low, especially at present. Certainly, the deal agreed on by the Council of Ministers has done absolutely nothing to boost that morale.  I accept that there are butter mountains, a surplus of beef in intervention and also a surplus of grain.  The contribution of a small country like Ireland to these surpluses is very small, yet we are being asked to accept cuts in our output on every front. If the EC tackle the vast imports of feedstuffs from outside the Community they will overcome the surplus problems in a very short time.</P>
    <P>There is still scope for improvements and increased efficiency and for seasonal diversification here, particularly in the dairy sector.  We must also explore every possible new product that can be sold on the international market.  In that way we can help in some measure to boost the morale of our farmers and to give them a better output for their products.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister at all times not to give in to his counterparts in Europe, who are possibly more industrialised than we are.  France, England and Germany may claim they are contributing a great deal in funds to the EC, but they are highly industrialised and have a better chance of boosting their economy.  They are not as dependent on agriculture as we are.  I hope that our Minister is prepared to stand up and fight, to become more aggressive in the European scene.  As far as this side of the House is concerned he will have our full support at all times.  If he has to kick the table from time to time, so be it.  The farmers will be fully behind him and they expect him to do that.  As far as I can see the Minister will get nothing in Europe by being a nice guy. He must realise that now better than anybody because he has served at the Council of Ministers table for the last few years.  I hope that he will become more aggressive in his approach to those people, particularly as regards the problems affecting Irish agriculture at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that we have the opportunity to raise this particular problem with the Minister in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> I have been three days trying to ensure that we got an opportunity here to discuss it.  I say in good faith to the Minister as a Tipperary man that the best hurlers are always on the ditch.  On this occasion none of us were in on the team with him so we can only tell him what we would like to have done if we were on the team. No doubt as he was privy to all the discussions and negotiations that went on there he will be able to explain to us why he did not, as Senator Hussey said, kick the table and come back to us for support and advice.  There is no doubt that the final deal that the Minister has obviously agreed with his Council of Ministers was better than what was on offer in the beginning, but it is still so bad and the implications of it are so serious for the agricultural community that I feel it would have been more appropriate for him to at least kick to touch, to not agree to the package, to return home for the support of all of us in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in the country and go back to Europe with a renewed enthusiasm of convincing his colleagues in the Council of Ministers about the importance of agriculture for the Irish community.</P>
    <P>I have listened to various speeches by politicians, agricultural advisers and various farming organisations.  They talk about renegotiating the terms of entry and all that other pie in the sky as I would call it now because once we are members of the Community adopting the Treaty of Rome we have in fact divested ourselves, constitutionally, of some of the decision making processes within the Community. Having said that, I feel that the Council of Ministers at least, to say the worst, have gone back on their word of 1984 following the debacle that we had at that time on the milk levy.  We fought with the Minister, we supported him and he won what was in fact a concession for Irish farmers which was not achieved to the same extent by his colleagues for any other country.  It was certainly given to us on the basis that it would last for some time.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate the principles and objectives of the Treaty of Rome: <Col N="520" /> to increase agricultural production; to ensure fair standards of living for the agricultural community; to stabilise markets; to guarantee regular supplies; and to ensure reasonable prices and supplies for the consumer.  Arising out of those principles in the Treaty, the aim was to achieve by common organisation of the market place and member states a common agricultural policy.  It was to have Community preference which in my opinion is not being achieved by the Community.  I listened to the Minister recently when he said that we have always looked for Community preference but the other member states are so strong that, because they have trading links through GATT and other arrangements, they do not want to show Community preference.</P>
    <P>Imports from outside the Community have contributed to the massive milk mountains, butter mountains and all other surpluses that are in the Community.  The Community are now more than self-sufficient.  It is extraordinary to try to achieve all those ideals of common financing, common tariffs etc, while we are producing 1½ per cent to 2 per cent per annum more than can be matched by the consumer.  It is inevitable that we would have surpluses.  CAP should be looked at for that reason.  It has come in for criticism by many people over the last few months, by the Community, the Commission and by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>There are various voting patterns there which unfortunately the Labour Party cannot influence from here any more.  I know that the group that I had associations with in 1984 published a manifesto which gave their blessing to CAP, admitting that things needed to be done with it but accepting that it was the only policy that was working in the Community.  Now we have taken it upon ourselves, because of famine in Ethiopia, to actually look at the possibility of being able to distribute some of the mountains of food that are there when we have people throughout the Third World who are starving and dying with hunger.  It is not as easy to do it as that and that is the challenge that is upon the Community if they are to do <Col N="521" /> something realistic about the problem of over-production.  We contend that our Council members and our Council colleagues within the Community gave us an understanding the day we signed the Treaty of Rome that the Irish farmer would have an opportunity within the terms of the Community to produce an unrestrained amount of produce, which we can do better than anybody else and with a better quality than anybody else, and that we should be allowed to do this within the common agricultural policy without discrimination against us simply because we are late members of the club, because we are small members of the club and we are more dependent on the club than any other member of the Community.</P>
    <P>To give you an idea of how dependent we are on the club we depend on it for about 14 per cent of our output.  Ireland's national dependence on what we want to do in the Community is so involved in agriculture that it is important.  The Minister is aware of that.  Fourteen per cent of our output is agriculturally motivated and we are so dependent on it. Nineteen per cent of our total employment directly at least is involved in agriculture. In the other member states 4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively are involved in their dependence.  For us every move that is made in a revision of CAP in restrictions, quotas, fiddling around the MCAs, export refunds or in any other area the consequences for Ireland and its people whether in agriculture directly, the milk processing and food processing industry is of such significance that I contend that this is a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>I know that it can be argued that the Minister tried before regarding export refunds and the Commission identified in his arguments that he could make whatever decision he liked but they still had it within their discretion to change the export refund system depending on the market forces.  That gives an idea of how weak we are in the Community.  We think we are very important, we are great Europeans.  We might be good Europeans and we have always acted as good Europeans but we are such a net beneficiary <Col N="522" /> of the European Community that there is no doubt whatsoever im my mind that the Community would almost welcome it if we left them.</P>
    <P>The problems of our renegotiation, the problems about vetoes and all these things have to be judged on the basis of how important we are to the Community and how important the Community is to us.  All of us understand how important it is.  We have benefited to the tune of billions of pounds since we entered the Community.  There have been criticisms from the consumer about the actual structure of financing the Common Agricultural Policy, but the reality is that the overall concept was to ensure that there would always be a sufficient production of food within the Community and that that would be available to the consumer at reasonable prices.  I believe in a way we have achieved most of those ideals. But, unfortunately, because we have allowed a lack of Community preference, because we have allowed other member states to import cereal substitutes and other products which add to the massive mountains in all these areas, it was inevitable that factory farming in Holland and other areas in the Community would have created this massive mountain of food. That is the problem we are facing.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister should be able to use his muscle to ensure that Ireland is a special country, not because we do anything different from anybody else but because we are almost totally dependent on the production of our food by natural methods.  We have a natural means of producing the best meat in the world, which should be able to sell outside of the Community.  It can sell within the Community.  Unfortunately, some of our exporters have been using the intervention system, which is a tragedy, when you realise the quality of the meat we produce.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the fact that Ireland has probably made more efforts than anybody else to sell our produce outside the Community and thereby benefit from the export refund system. We have done it through the export of live cattle and processed cattle.  We have <Col N="523" /> managed to dispose of a lot of our commodities outside of the Community and to third countries.  If other members of the Community were prepared to do likewise, we would have fewer surpluses.  I realise the Minister fought a strong battle in Brussels, but we did not win it.</P>
    <P>We have certainly interfered with milk production and cereal production and we have put a major question mark over the actual production of beef in the future. They are interdependent.  The dairy sector alone underpins the entire agricultural economy.  There are approximately 70,000 farmers involved in dairy production and there are about 13,000 other people involved in dairy processing.  That is 83,000 people, plus the families of the 70,000 farmers, so you now run into 250,000 people.  If you put that on top of the 250,000 people who are directly involved in other food processing and the other downstream industries that benefit, you are now talking about 60 per cent of our total population being totally dependent on agriculture, its derivatives, its processing and everything else.</P>
    <P>Senators can see why it is so important for us to be able to put our views on the record of this House and to give the Minister an opportunity to respond to us, to tell us what hopes that there are of any changes with his colleagues in the Council of Ministers, and whether the two additional countries have created additional problems for us, because I understood that it was basically the area of fishing, wine and citrus fruits that the accession of Spain and Portugal would affect.  Now we have to ask whether all the other nations are against us.  I understand that France was one of our few allies on this occasion.  I would question the membership of the Community being European.  From my dealings with members of the British delegation to the European Parliament, I would say they are not really Europeans.  They have never joined the EMS.  They are so motivated towards the consumer lobby that any decisions made in the European situation by the British delegates are always to the detriment of agriculture because, as <Col N="524" /> Senator Hussey said, Britain particularly is an industrial nation and not dependent on agriculture to the same extent we are.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is so important and the implications of this particular package will have such consequences for our people, for those involved in agriculture, for family farms, for farm workers involved in agriculture and for all the workers involved in the processing industry that it is of sufficient importance to merit this kind of debate, to merit this kind of discussion and to merit a specific and positive response from the Minister, not just to say why he did what he did but to say where do we go from here.  If we realistically follow through with the revision of the CAP without making any efforts to try to market the produce, except by dumping it to the Russians or to somebody else, if that is all the Community can do, then let us forget about the Community and the Common Agricultural Policy.  Perhaps we are just a front for political unity involving the defence of Europe.  If that is what it is, that we are being used as a front, let us complain and talk about it.  My understanding was that the Community was to benefit our agricultural industry particularly.  Now that we have benefited let us hold what we have.  We are asking the Minister for his support in trying to ensure that our vital national interests in Europe are made fully explicit.  If they cannot be protected, we want to know it before any deal is signed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There never was a time when Irish agriculture required a boost as great as it does today.  It has been hit <Col N="525" /> from within the country with the curtailment of subsidies by the Government and by very devastating weather conditions. As we debate this motion here this evening it is estimated that the best part of a 250,000 animals will have died this winter because of malnutrition arising from the summer of last year during which farmers were unable to make adequate provision for winter fodder.  There was a certain amount of dismay and anger when we first learned of the outcome of the price negotiations in Brussels.  While I want to appeal to all Members of this House to treat this motion in a fair and critical way and not make a political football out of the problems that beset Irish agriculture today, we have to put on record, as our frontbench spokesman on agriculture, Senator Tom Hussey has done, that this agreement has fairly devastating consequences for Irish agriculture.  I was quite alarmed to read in the paper a report of the intervention by the former Minister for Finance in the debate in the Dáil indicating that these price negotiations had delivered about £70 million to Irish agriculture, mainly through the devaluation of the green pound.  As a former Minister for Agriculture he knows just as his listeners did that this realignement of the currency arose because of the strength of the Deutsche Mark or in turn the weakness of the Irish punt against other EC currencies and had nothing to do with price negotiations.  The outcome of these price negotiations as far as prices was concerned was a freeze.  I do not think it is fair to present in Dáil Éireann figures of gains of that kind which cannot be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust as far as the dairy area is concerned in these price negotiations has been the curtailment of what was the Irish quota.  In 1984, the quota agreed for us was 1,192.8 million gallons and the 3 per cent reduction means that about 36 million gallons will be cut off Irish production.  This is valued at nearly £30 million.  The effect of that on Irish farms is that it takes off Irish farms effectively 45,000 cows.  In turn that will take out 45,000 calves valued at their birth at approximately £8 million but at the two <Col N="526" /> year old stage at three times that, maybe £25 million.  If you take into account the inputs to those cows &mdash; the fertiliser, meal, the co-ops &mdash; one is talking about a potential loss of jobs in the region of 300 to 500.  Taking Nenagh Co-op, its total milk output is 30 million gallons, so we are talking about the total obliteration of one co-op.  Taking the west of Ireland where there is 40 million gallons, you are virtually talking about eradicating that segment out of Irish agriculture in one fell swoop.</P>
    <P>There are two other direct effects from that, that is, that the marginality or the threshold at which a farm is viable has been continually rising and the curtailment of milk production has made it extremely difficult if not impossible for a great number of small and medium-sized dairy farmers to expand.  As the cost of living increases the threshold for farming and the enterprise has had to rise and as a consequence of all of this more farmers are being squeezed into a bracket which is uneconomic and therefore have to depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>If we try to quantify the total cost to this country of taking that amount of milk out of production, one whole co-op, all the milk virtually that is produced in the west of Ireland, the loss of 45,000 calves, £8 million worth of calves, £25 million worth of cattle at the two year old stage and the pressure for more people to go into the social welfare area, then we being to realise really the impact that this is having on our country.  That is not to ignore for one minute young farmers who have no chance of getting into milk, farmers who have disease problems, farmers who have debt problems and require the extra production to meet their indebtedness.  They cannot look at this result from Luxembourg with any great hope.  They can have only a bleak future.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should vote against the package.  We have the general information from the Commission of April 1986 allowing for a decision to take place without recourse to voting.  Three delegations made statements saying that they could not approve of the agreement.  The delegations were Luxembourg and Spain <Col N="527" /> with regard to reduction in milk production, Germany with regard to the overall package.  Further down it says that Spain announced that it would take the decision to reduce milk quotas to the court of justice.  We are really asking the Minister for Agriculture as to the strategy he adopted.  We understand what the pressures are like, what the financial strictures are, how the surpluses are affecting these deliberations but we would expect an Irish Minister to come out fighting and not to put on the record such a major decision affecting our economy without voting against it.  The question of what he would undertake subsequent to that is a matter for debate but I think that should have happened as an initial stage.</P>
    <P>We also know &mdash; and this has been emphasised by Senator Hussey and Senator Ferris whom I am glad to see leading the Labour Party in this House and supporting us in this motion&mdash;that the British are very sensitive with regard to imports, particularly imports from New Zealand. We have seen how the New Zealand farmers have been able to maintain and even improve their share of the UK market. During the past ten years our share of the UK butter market has dropped by 66 per cent.  We know that the Dutch are sensitive to factory farming.  We know that it is possible for one farmer with 2,300 cows and 15 acres of land to put a chariot and four through the whole Common Agricultural Policy with massive imports of cereal substitutes from Third World countries.  It would take about 5,000 acres in Ireland for average dairy farmers to produce the same amount as can be produced off 15 acres and Irish farmers would do it without imports or largely without imports.  We are not arguing that factory farming is the base for all our problems.  Better technology, better management across Europe has pushed up the parameters of production and the world recession made it difficult to sell.  The European Community is by far the largest importer of food and other agricultural products in the world.  Its share of the world total of food imports is 20 per cent.  It is double <Col N="528" /> the amount of food imports that are imported into the USA.  It is estimated the the value of imports into the European Community has increased by 170 per cent in the past seven years.  Imports of corn gluten feed have risen by 230 per cent in the last seven years and 55 per cent of all food imports into the Community are duty free.  We have to expect that there are aspects of trade agreements which EC countries had negotiated long before our entry that have to be honoured regardless of what we want but we would expect the Minister to force a downward trend in volume and quantity terms of the amount of these imports into the Community when our Irish farmers have to share such a load of the present burden.</P>
    <P>In the beef intervention area we know that 40 per cent of cattle slaughterings take place in the last three months of the year.  So it is vital as to what is happening in the latter end of the year.  We do not know at the moment.  Eighty per cent of our beef production is exported.  The reference price in Ireland is 64 per cent of the guide price, which is the lowest in the EC which averages around 74 per cent.  We are a long distance from the market and the role that beef plays in our economy means, that any reduction in the level of EC support has greater implications for Ireland than any other country.</P>
    <P>When the intervention system was introduced in 1973 it covered all carcase etc.  In 1977 it was altered and was to trigger off when market prices would fall below a certain level; but the uncertainties that are there now cannot be overcome by a Minister's statement to the effect that he has got some kind of agreement from the Commission with regard to what is happening in the autumn.  We were promised eight weeks last year; we succeeded in getting three.  There was an agreement negotiated with Canada in relation to the export of 10,666 tonnes of beef.  It was badly negotiated and fell through.  The Minister made a statement to the Dáil on 4 April 1984, where he indicated that our quota would be safeguarded and that we would have not only <Col N="529" /> that but some share of whatever was available in the future in a situation where quotas were to be subsequently divided. So, how can we accept an unwritten promise from a Commission which has reneged on the Treaty in the first instance, failed to deliver on the guarantees given by the Minister in 1984, which were written down and refused to honour the terms of the 1985 negotiations in so far as they related to intervention? We are expected to accept from the Commission a promise, which is not written, of some safeguard for beef enterprise for the end of this year when they have failed to honour the laws, the Treaty and the written undertaking given to us in the past.</P>
    <P>In order to give other Senators an opportunity to contribute, I will deal very quickly with the cereal situation.  It is not fair to indicate that 70 per cent of our producers will not be affected by the levy. The bulk of our main grain growers will be affected because a small percentage &mdash; not more than 30 or 35 per cent &mdash; are in grain growing on a full time basis and produce the bulk of our supplies.  In a submission by the Department of Agriculture to our Committee on EC Secondary legislation they indicated that the exemption would free 70 per cent of producers from the levy.  A lot of these are not cereal producers but persons in other lines of production or in other occupations utilising the land.  The concession is not of great value to genuine medium sized producers.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of renegotiating our accession to the European Community, but I am in favour of ensuring that the Treaty of Accession would be lived up to.  We are progressively ignoring the fundamental principles of that Treaty.  We are not asking to change the ground rules. We want to emphasise the existing ground rules and see that they are adhered to.  One of the main thrusts of that was to transfer from the richer regions to the poorer regions economic improvements.  That is not happening now.  Another aspiration at that time was that lands most suitable for certain types of production would have the opportunity <Col N="530" /> to produce so as to avoid the lavish imports to Germany and Holland which are now undermining or contributing to undermine the system.  The principles are being gradually whittled away and the base for the thresholds for commercial farming seems to be the criteria by which the Commission is now deciding our future.  We have only a handful of farmers in that category.  Seventy-five per cent of our farmers are not within an ass's roar of getting into that situation and we have to try in so far as is possible to create a climate of opinion in the Community that the number of our people who are curtailed in their aspiration to economic viability on their farms is unacceptable.  We are pleading with the Minister in a passionate and in a compassionate way.  He must be aware of the situation that is fast developing on many Irish farms.  People see their prospects for the future totally undermined.  I do not want the Minister or any of his colleagues to speak in this House as they did in the Dáil last evening.  In many ways this problem transcends politics.  There are too many people out there whose problems are too great for any sort of cat-calling or name-calling in any of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Senator Hourigan, I would point out that there is about 20 minutes left for three speakers.  I would like to give the Minister the normal time, which is 20 minutes, to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be too lengthy.  I should like to say that, in common with other speakers and in common with the Minister also, the outcome of the recent negotiations has not been to the expectations of any body in this House and not even to the expectations of the Minister.  However, it was vitally important that progress was made at the recent discussions and for that reason I do not think we can find the various points of agreement and say that this ought not have been decided and this was all right.  It is acknowledged by the group that signed the Green Paper that the agricultural policy has been and continued <Col N="531" /> to the cornerstone of the European Community over the past 23 years. It is a commitment for the future as well.</P>
      <P>It is no harm that we appreciate that decisions taken in the recent past were taken against an extremely difficult background of very high surpluses in the area of dairy products and cereals and to a certain extent in the area of beef.  We must be realistic and see quite positively that the CAP continues.  For us as a country there would be nothing more serious than the dismantling of the CAP, the disappearance of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Over some months there are indicators which would suggest that there was a danger that the CAP was at risk and was threatened.  The question of renegotiation of our terms of entry in 1972 should be left aside at this time because quite frankly, we have been very substantial net beneficiaries from EC membership.  We have, in the years 1973-1985, received in total £6,075.97 million from the EC.  That has been the total EC expenditure in this country, and we had spent on agriculture a figure of £4,763.77 million or approximately 80 per cent of the total expenditure.  We are, as I stated, positively net beneficiaries.  It is very much in our interest that the Common Agricultural Policy would continue vigorously.  For that reason, the sort of areas that the Minister and his colleagues were confronted with over a week ago were difficult but, at the same time, in my opinion, something that had to be tackled.  There was the area of milk.  The result could have come out far worse from our point of view.  We must look at the milk scene, against a background of the achievement made in 1984 with regard to the super-levy at that time.  We succeeded in getting 1981 accepted as a base year; we succeeded also in getting a 4.6 per cent increase.  The total result meant approximately 22 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at the moment, and none of us is too happy about it, confronted with a 3 per cent levy starting in 1987-88 and going on to 1989-90.  Let us be realistic. We are taking that against a background <Col N="532" /> of what we achieved in the year 1984. Fortunately, due to the good efforts of the Minister and others concerned at that time, we had a starting point.  While we hate naturally to lose any percentage point, we were in a better position to deal with the present situation now than we otherwise would have been.  That is extremely important.  Our counterparts in Europe were pegged back 7 to 8 per cent in their milk production in 1984 whereas we were allowed an increase of 22 per cent on the 1981 production figure. That point cannot be over-emphasised, nor indeed can the question of renegotiation be over-emphasised because in my opinion any attempt at renegotiation at this stage would be fraught with danger. There is no guarantee whatsoever that we would come out of renegotiation as well as we would begin it.  There is also the extreme danger that we could become very easily alienated in the European context.  That would have very major consequences.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with the views expressed by Senator Smith and others indeed, that agriculture never needed a boost greater or more than it does at this point.  We have a situation, unfortunately, of an extremely late spring which has followed the disastrous winter and summer of last year.  We have a situation of extremely high mortality in cattle and other farm animals.  Therefore, psychologically as well as financially and otherwise, farmers are not in a good position to take a set back.  Nevertheless, it is better that reality should prevail and that some security for the future be established. This is important and must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Grain is another area which is extremely difficult at the present time. Unfortunately, indications for the future are not bright for it.  As I see it, we can do a great deal in the grain area here ourselves.  There is as much as £100 million of grain imports which we could substitute by Irish-produced barley and feed wheat.  That would do a great deal for the grain situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to beef, which, indeed, the Minister and others have in recent <Col N="533" /> days stressed and harped upon, there has been a positive achievement whereby intervention has been retained, at least until the end of the year when a review will be made.  It would be misleading if anybody were to suggest that intervention would continue this year and next year.  It is only correct to state that at least intervention exists for this year and, hopefully, will be put into operation, when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that the EC proposal was for the total abolition of intervention for beef.  That would have been disastrous for us.  Our Minister has succeeded in retaining it.  That is something that should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>There are many points I would like to make but I am very conscious of the time, and will have to leave them aside.  I do want to say that I, in common with other people, as I have stated in this House before, believe that this country ought to get preferential treatment.  As an island on the periphery of Europe, we have major disadvantages from climatic and location points of view and so on.  I believe that we need preferential treatment in agriculture and other areas in order to survive.  Having said that, I am personally satisfied that what the Minister agreed to in recent days was the best deal possible that he could achieve.  I am quite satisfied that he will continue in his vigorous, persistent role in the European scene on behalf of Irish farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  Senator Hourigan in the introductory part of his contribution said that while this was not a good deal, progress was being made.  I fail to see how progress was made with this settlement.  The settlement which the Minister accepted will do untold damage to Irish agriculture.  It will have a terrible impact on our principal sectors, that is, milk, cereals and beef.  The outlook is not very rosy either.  It will put Irish farmers on the bread line.  The majority of our farmers are involved in dairying and the settlement will definitely not provide an adequate income for them or their families.  Grain growers will be seriously affected and the outlook for beef, as I <Col N="534" /> have already said, is not good.  Therefore, this package is unacceptable and is detrimental to Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The farming community is about 40 per cent of the population.  There are people in jobs from the spin-off from farming and industry, the raw materials for which come from agriculture.  All these will be affected.  Senator Ferris maintained that it would affect 60 per cent of the population.  That is all the more reason why the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy should be adhered to so as to ensure an adequate income for farmers. Farmers will have debts after this package.  It is well known that farmers' incomes are less than their counterparts in other EC countries.  This is caused by the importation of substitute cereals which are producing milk in factory farms in Denmark and other countries.  Dairy farmers had hoped that they would at least maintain their position.  They felt secure because the Minister for Agriculture, when negotiating the milk quota in 1984 &mdash; and I will quote an extract from the Dáil Official Report of 4 April 1984 &mdash; said:</P>
      <P>However, after some very difficult negotiations, we succeeded in reaching an agreement that gave us a basic entitlement of our 1983 level of deliveries, plus more than 4.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>We all know that that 4.6 per cent will decrease because of a miscalculation, someone could not do their sums.  He went on:</P>
      <P>In addition, it was agreed that not only could this entitlement not be reduced in future years but that we would have priority in regard to the distribution of any additional quantities which became available, for example, from production shortfalls or market improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What basis had the Minister for Agriculture for saying this? Did he get a guarantee from the EC that our quota or the 1983 figures would be maintained? If I remember correctly, 1983 was also a disastrous year for farmers.  It was not the best year to base a quota on.  It is well <Col N="535" /> known that the income of Irish farmers are less than their counterparts in other countries.</P>
    <P>The dairying sector of the farming community and, in particular, the new entrants into milk will not have much encouragement from this package.  They are affected by disease and the quota. A dairy farmer producing 70,000 gallons can increase his yield by 4.6 per cent, which is a bigger increase than the farmer who had a quota of 30,000 gallons.  There is an imbalance here.  It works against the smaller farmer, and especially the young farmer who is trying to develop.  This should be corrected.  Farmers have many difficulties to face, especially as a result of the bad weather, cattle dying and bad fodder.  Apart from this package, there have also been other restrictions and cut-backs.  There was the suspension of many good schemes &mdash; the lime subsidy scheme, the AI subsidy and the farm modernisation scheme &mdash; which has not helped agriculture.</P>
    <P>This package will make the situation much worse.  Under the cessation scheme farmers will lose 36 million gallons of milk.  We have not been told how this will be implemented.  It could be up to 5 per cent or 7 per cent in some areas and less in other areas.  The probable outcome is that small farmers or farmers in the west who have not big quotas will lose out altogether or will decide to get out of milk.  The outcome of these price negotiations is very serious for farmers, especially as farmers owe in the region of £1,500,000 million to financial institutions.  The financial institutions are on their backs to get them to pay back.  It is about time that the Departments of Agriculture and Finance took farming seriously, especially after these bad negotiations, so as to make things easier for the farming community.</P>

      <P>The last speakers have said most of what I want to say, but I wish to be associated with some of their remarks.  As a farmer, I am less than happy with the result in Brussels; but I wonder could we have got any more? I <Col N="536" /> have great fears, not necessarily for this year, but for the years ahead.  The problem with the EC has been that over the last number of years, particularly since our accession, most farmers thought that there was money for everybody for everything.  For the first few years after joining we enjoyed a reasonably good time in farming.  We go back to Ministers such as Mark Clinton and others whom we looked upon as great Ministers.  They were good Ministers and they did a good job.  But it would also be true to say that in those days it was easier to get money in Brussels than it is today. Nobody should get away from that.  When we joined the EEC we did not have the mountains of beef, cheese and butter that we have today.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Hussey who talked about imports into the Community.  He was quite right to mention this. We have to look at our position now as farmers.  I am looking at this from the Irish farmer's point of view.  What do we do? Do we start to cut back? It appears that we have to.  Will this leave us any better off in 12 months time? If we cut back and other countries do not, or if they still allow imports in, it will be all for naught.  The Minister did the best possible job he could, as I believe every other Minister has done.  He tried to get the best possible deal.  People other than farmers are benefiting as a result of the great prices we got for years.  I recall Minister Clinton opening an ACOT office in County Louth at a time when things were going well.  I distinctly remember the housewives picketing outside the gate because he was getting too much money from Brussels and the housewife was having to pay more.  The housewife today, as a result of cut-backs, is benefiting from this and I do not think she realises it.  I am a beef farmer and, looking at the different sections of farmers, the margins of profit in beef over the last few years have been miserably low.  I look at the dairying man, who is shedding some tears at the moment. Perhaps they are the first tears he ever shed, because over the last number of years he enjoyed a good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> I defy contradiction on that.  Only last week I gave £200 odd for some calves.  I have to rear those calves to beef.  At the end of the day I am not quite sure what the future holds for them either.  Perhaps all of us have to get our own house in order and ask why we are doing this.  We have done it and I have done it as recently as Monday of this week.  I must confess that I have seen calves selling at £270 &mdash; admittedly they were continental calves. I remember a time when we used to export plane loads of calves until we, the feeders, had to buy them at dearer money.</P>
    <P>We have all to look at our own position in farming.  In those early days when we joined the EEC we enjoyed big prices. We thought that the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; would never run dry.  We believed that.  It put the price of land in some counties, and even in my own county, as high as £4,000 per acre. Some people are paying for it yet, and some people may not be able to pay for it.  People borrowed far more than they ever should have.  No one can dispute that either.  We believe that Ministers can go out to Brussels and bring home the same type of package that some of the Ministers have done over the last number of years.  That is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>My concern is not necessarily for this year.  As many Senators have said this year some farmers are on their knees.  It is true to say that.  Certainly, the weather &mdash; and I do not think we can blame the Government for that, although some people would like to &mdash; has played havoc with the situation.  In fairness to the Government, although some people made light of it, they did try to help out with fodder schemes during the winter. Again, nobody could foresee that the winter was going on for six months longer than it should, and this has not helped the situation either.</P>
    <P>As far as this year's deal is concerned, we are only wasting our time talking.  The Minister went out with his officials and advisers and took the best advice he could get.  He saw that in the game he was in he could not win.  There is a lot of play being made that he did not vote against it.  I wonder what that would have achieved? <Col N="538" /> It might have been ten to one or 12 to one.  I believe that every Minister has done his utmost for the farmers of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not long.  However, I say to the Minister now that there may well be, and I am sure there are, many farmers in financial difficulties.  The Minister is a very responsible member of the Government.  He understands the farming position quite well.  It may well be that the Minister, out of the funds which are scarce owing to the recession, will have to come to the rescue of some farmers during the coming year.  I have great admiration for the Minister.  When he goes out to Brussels in the days and weeks ahead he should talk to the rest of the Ministers to try to get our house in order for next year.  As Senator Hussey has suggested, the Community should stop imports from other countries.  All of us agree on this proposal.  We will never be able to get our house in order if these imports continue.  I am fully aware that the Minister has done his best and I appreciate the efforts he has made.  We differ about the millions that are coming. My main conceren &mdash; and I am not necessarily being parochial in this at all &mdash; is the question of beef for intervention in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  It has been a very interesting debate.  It was a much more level-headed and constructive debate than in the Dáil. I appreciate that, and it is the proper way to do it.  I have quite a lengthy script here but, as it is very boring I will leave it.  I will deal with some of the points Senators have made.  This will lead to a disjointed contribution, but it may be more interesting in ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points which arose and which was mentioned by several Senators was that of renegotiation of our terms of entry.  Senators Smith and Hourigan both made the point that they did not think it was a good idea, and I agree with them. <Col N="539" /> It is being bandied about in recent days as something that could be used to get us far more out of Europe than is presently the case.  I do not believe that.  People attempt to draw parallels with what they term as the British renegotiation and the Greek renegotiation.  I wonder if either of those could actually be classified as renegotiations.  What the British were talking about was paying less.  They were major net contributors to the Community.  They felt that the mathematical equation upon which their contribution was based was incorrectly worked out.  As a result, their contribution was reduced. That is the essence of what they were negotiating about.</P>
    <P>Some people have doubts as to whether there was Greek renegotiation or not.  It is all a little clouded.  People go through these charades at times in order to pacify the punters at home, especially at a time of election.  In essence the Greeks did not get any better deal on commodity prices. This is the sort of talk that is being bandied about.  It is dangerous and misleading.  I do not believe it would happen or that any sensible person involved in negotiations or in the working of the European scene would believe that it could honestly happen.  The Greeks did get some concessions, but they were in relation to the Regional and Social Funds.  It had nothing whatsoever to do with the reformation of the Common Agricultural Policy as it affected them.</P>
    <P>Another major reason why I do not see any possibility of us getting a favourable renegotiation is that presently in agriculture we get a net £900 million from the Community.  This is a very sizeable amount of money.  Some people might say in the course of renegotiation that one is actually getting far too much; they might decide to give you something less. The figure has actually risen since 1982 from £400 million to £900 million, which is a very considerable take, I think you will agree.  It involves a lot of aids, one being the export refunds which enable us to sell cattle to third countries at competitive prices, competitive with eastern Europe and South America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> I will give you a generalisation as to how it works.  For simplicity sake we will say beef fetches £800; £400 of that aid which the farmer gets is paid directly by the EC.  If you did not have that type of aid you can imagine the type of prices you would get for your livestock. Another form in which we get a great deal of aid is in storing our produce.  We get a recoupment for storing our own produce.  We store it on behalf of the EC. They give us a minimum guaranteed price for our produce.  That is probably the greatest advantage of all that we have received, a minimum price for an unlimited amount of produce &mdash; unlimited in some commodities, more recently limited in others.</P>
    <P>The idea of quotas was raised by a number of speakers.  Some Senators said we should have them and others said we should not have them.  That is all very interesting because there are conflicting views on that.  The quota system is not a new concept.  We have had a quota system in the sugar beet regime since we entered the EC.  It was supposed to be only a temporary imposition but as so often happens temporary becomes permanent.  Now we have a quota system in the milk system.  It will be interesting to see whether it lasts indefinitely or is only a temporary measure.  Some people advocate that we should have a quota system in the cereals industry.  I floated that idea last year in the Community and the Commission agreed with it but the other nine members at the time flatly rejected any idea of a quota system in cereals.  It would have advantages for us, in that we would know what we could grow and we would have a guaranteed price which would not be subjected to the massive reductions which are being proposed in latter times by the Community.  There are certain attractions in it. Price reductions &mdash; and I am not an advocate for price reductions in any community &mdash; have certain side effects which are beneficial to people who are feeding, for instance, pigs and poultry.  It will bring the price of feeding stuffs down.  I do not know if that is generally recognised.  It is not a net loss if you have to suffer a <Col N="541" /> price decrease; somebody else is going to benefit from that.  Nevertheless overall it is not a satisfactory situation.  I would prefer if there were price increases rather than price decreases.  The quota system is something that merits quite a deal of attention.  It has its advantages and disadvantages.  The reason the Community will not entertain a quota system for us for cereals is that it is not a Community measure.  You must have the same type of operation in every part of the Community.  You cannot have a price increase-price decrease system in one part of the Community and a quota system elsewhere.  It must be a Community measure. It must apply uniformly throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>The motion &mdash; says that what we need is a special meeting of the EC Foreign Ministers to rescind the decision that was taken last week.  Are people naive enough to think that the Council of Foreign Ministers would be any more sympathetic or generous than the Council of Farm Ministers?  I think that is really pie in the sky, with all due respect.  I do not believe there would be any sympathy.  It is a very tough situation in Europe at the moment.  I do not make any apologies for the deal last week.  I have said this before. I think it is the best we could possibly have obtained.  We could do far worse, a great deal worse.  Having been there for weeks and months &mdash; we have been at it for the last two to three months &mdash; in my considered opinion it was the best deal we could get.  People are saying they are disappointed.  Will you ask yourselves honestly, what did you expect? Surely people saw what the Commission originally proposed.  You must have seen what they proposed.  Those proposals were very drastic.  I will deal with them as quickly as I can.</P>
    <P>On the milk sector they proposed a 3 per cent cut in production of all milk in the Community.  People are saying that is a breach of the agreement we got in 1984 which said that we were not to have our quotas cut in the subsequent years of the super-levy system.  It actually said that if any extra milk became available we would have priority in getting it.  The <Col N="542" /> fact is that the position in the milk market has changed in a negative manner rather than a positive manner.  The super-levy has only been partially successful.  It was supposed to get rid of the surpluses.  It has not actually succeeded.  In the past year for instance we have taken more butter into intervention than ever before. Intervention stocks of butter at the moment are at an all time high.  The Commission felt obliged in those circumstances to take action.  The simple figures are as follows.  Before the super-levy came in in 1983 the Community produced 105 million tonnes of milk.  The super-levy brought that back to 98 million tonnes.  We only consumed 85 million tonnes.  This new 3 per cent cut will bring the output back to 95 million tonnes. Even after cutting it by a further 3 per cent we will still have an excess of 10 million tonnes which we will have to sell off at an enormous loss.  Obviously the Governments who are contributing to the running of the Community cannot accept that we should continue to do that, that we should continue to produce something which would be cheaper to dump the day it was manufactured rather than to store it and sell it off for 10p or 12p a pound. That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>The beef proposal was absolutely unacceptable to us.  You get no gratitude for defeating something which was pretty awful as long as the other contents of the package may have some unattractive segments to them.  The fact is the Commission wanted to eliminate any possibility of having intervention for carcase beef in the autumn in this country or in the Community generally, I should say, but it would affect this country more than any other.  Any farmer who is involved in the beef industry can see what the effects would be on the cattle trade if that were allowed.  I would hate to think of the extent of the collapse in the cattle trade this week if that got through last week.  People say, what did you do out there? We stopped that from happening and that was a major achievement.  I am not giving any guarantee and I have no guarantees from the Commission or anybody <Col N="543" /> else that they will introduce full carcase intervention in the autumn.  The option is there as in former years.  There was never a guarantee; the option is there and the likelihood is there.  That is as much as we can hope for at this particular time.</P>
    <P>On cereals, the House knows, the massive surpluses there are of cereals in the Community.  A number of countries prodded the Commission into doing what they did.  Some countries want to be able to take on the Americans in the world market.  They want to be able to sell their cereals at a competitive price.  That was one of the main reasons why the Commission's proposal got such support.  Countries like ourselves and the Germans opposed it vigorously.  As you saw last year, when the Germans could not get a reduction &mdash; we voted with them last year &mdash; they vetoed a price reduction which only amounted to 1.8 per cent.  This year they did not think it worth their while to veto a price reduction of 8 per cent because they knew very well as we all did that the Commission would come along and use the same mechanism as it did last year to bring about a price reduction of the same magnitude as the original proposal.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to that.  Let us not fool ourselves by thinking that by voting against it you can achieve something.  It would be lovely and politically popular for me to go and say I will vote against this and I will vote against that and kick the table, knock down doors, and beat them into giving us what we want.  That type of savagery will get you nowhere in the EC.  We are dealing with a very well organised, civilised group of people.  We have to negotiate with them.  We have to negotiate in the most skilful manner possible.  We are recognised in Europe as having the most skilful negotiating team in the Community and have been recognised as such for several years.  We take a decision on the basis of what we think is best for the country, not on the basis of what we think is politically expedient and popular.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> I was disappointed with Senator Ferris's remark when he referred to the debacle of the milk super-levy in 1984.  The milk super-levy agreement in 1984 was anything but a debacle; it was a massive achievement.  It gave us a 22 per cent advantage over the other milk producing countries in the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the House should have the correct record and not a selective quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote down this expression &ldquo;debacle of milk levy 1984&rdquo;.  I am glad Senator Ferris has corrected me on that.</P>
      <P>We got a 22 per cent advantage in 1984, which was quite significant.  Some people are trying to compare the present situation with 1984 and they say we have lost that advantage because of the 3 per cent reduction.  We have not.  We are very far from it.  We may have lost 3 per cent of the 22 per cent but it is a long way from losing the whole 22 per cent &mdash; it is a small fraction of the advantage we got in 1984.  Let me point out that the other countries are based on 1981.  If you base our milk production on 1981 then we got a 22 per cent advantage.  Everybody is gone back 3 per cent, so they have 1981 minus 3 per cent.  That is what they are getting at the moment.  We have 1981 plus 19 per cent.  Therefore we have the comparative advantage of 22 per cent all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hussey made an interesting point about the fact that we have a very favourable climate and soil for agricultural production.  So we have, and it thereby enables us to produce certain commodities such as milk and beef quite cheaply.  It is actually a comparative advantage.  People look for special exemptions.  Other Ministers come to me <Col N="545" /> in an absolute rage.  The German Minister says he has tens of thousands of small disadvantaged farms.  The French say they have thousands of square miles of hilly mountainy land where people have only three or four cows.  They are tremendously disadvantaged just as we are.  The Italians are in the same position.  The South of Italy is disadvantaged.  The whole of Greece, Portugal and large tracts of Spain are disadvantaged.  It is not going to be that easy, if at all possible, to get exemptions when we are dealing with countries which have enormous problems.  It is not true, as somebody stated in the Dáil last night, that we are more dependent on agriculture than any other country in the Community.  Agriculture accounts for 11 per cent of our gross national product.  In Greece agriculture accounts for 16 per cent.  Therefore, as Sentor Hussey said, we have a climate and soil conditions which are much more suitable than that of our partners in the Community.  One can lose sympathy by trying to flog that one too hard when people are living in much tougher conditions on much smaller farms.</P>
    <P>One Senator made the point that we should resist the dismantlement of the CAP.  That is what these negotiations are all about.  We want to see that the CAP is retained.  If we did not go along with the vote in the Council last week the Commission would come in and use its powers &mdash; and it has tremendous powers &mdash; to do what we did not want to do. They would have done it.  They did it last year.  The solutions that the Commission would have imposed would have been far more harsh than the eventual decision. The day that we hand the powers over to the Commission then we are on the way to dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is far better that the Council of Ministers should make the decisions than let the Commissioner exert his emergency powers and reduce the prices as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, which is incidental, but it does affect people in this country.  We most certainly would not have got the benefit of the green £ <Col N="546" /> devaluation.  We would probably have been left a full year without it.  At this time of year, when milk production is high, it is worth about £10 million a month to farmers in this country, £70 million in a full year and if the premiums are added it is worth another £30 million to £100 million.  If we lost the full carcase intervention, I would hate to try to put a price on that.  It would be colossal.  The advantages of having agreement are enormous.  I know it is the politically popular thing to say that one should have held out, that one should have done this and so on.  I am prepared to take my medicine like anybody else.  It is part of politics.  There is no point in trying to be dishonest with the people.  The publicity would be great.  &ldquo;Deasy stops package from going through&rdquo;.  What would I feel like or what would you feel like if the cattle market collapsed? Then we would have reason to be really sorry.</P>
    <P>The eventual outcome is a tremendous improvement on the proposals which the Commission put forward.  We must build on those.  We must see that the beef market is supported in the future.  That is my main concern.  We must see that we make the best use possible out of the milk we produce.  I have said this in the last few days on radio.  We are not making the best use of what we are producing. We convert 80 per cent of our milk into butter and we put half of that into intervention.  It is an amazing thing.  It is no credit to us.  Other countries hardly put one pound of butter into intervention. They convert it into commodities which can be sold, such as a whole variety of cheeses, yoghurts and so on.  At present we put 16 per cent or 17 per cent of our beef into intervention despite the fact that it is acknowledged as the best beef in the world.  We cannot sell it.  People talk about job losses.  There are tens of thousands of jobs to be created if we sold what we produced on the world markets, or even if we only sold it on the Community markets.  There are 320 million people in the Community at present.  It is by far the largest economic block in the world. We should be able to sell everything we produce without resorting to intervention. <Col N="547" />  If we could do that we could create tens of thousands of extra jobs and our farmers would get premium prices for their produce.  We constantly hear the complaint that all the farmers in Holland and Denmark are getting £1.10p for their milk and we are only getting 75p.  Why is that the case? The reason is primarily because they convert their milk into things which can be sold at premium prices and which can be exported to the States and all over the world.  We have a lot to answer for.</P>
    <P>We should take a good look at our own position and see if we are making the best use of our opportunities.  It is quite apparent that we are not.  Concessionary imports is an item which is being misconstrued to quite an extent.  Virtually all the concessionary imports into the Community of cereal substitutes or beef are covered by GATT arrangements.  People will ask what is GATT.  GATT is the international trading forum.  Agreements made in that forum are legally binding. The only way to terminate those agreements is if there is mutual consent.  One side wanting to opt out is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Those agreements, by and large, were made in the middle sixties long before we entered the Community.  It is virtually impossible to reduce the amount of those commodities coming into the Community.  The French and ourselves over the past number of years have tried very hard.  Because of the legally binding nature of those arrangements it is very difficult to do anything about it.  We have got small reductions in the last year in the amount of cereal substitutes coming in and in the amount of beef.  That is the first time ever there has been a reduction. It has taken a lot of doing.  You cannot break agreements just like that.  It is not possible.  It is simplistic to say you can.</P>
    <P>Another important point: the Community is the largest trading block in the world and they take in those concessionary imports.  That was the idea back in <Col N="548" /> 1965 when the agreements were drawn up.  They want to trade with countries all over the world whether it is Thailand, Indonesia, South America or wherever. They want to trade.  They sell motorcars and washing machines and innumerable consumer goods.  Many of these countries cannot trade with the Community in any other items than cereal substitutes and maybe livestock and meat from South America.  They have nothing else to trade with.  They are agricultural countries primarily.  The Community trades and the money it makes from its trading is used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy. That is how we get our net £900 million a year.  We get it because the Community makes a profit on its trading.  We benefit from that.  Let us not look at it from the narrow point of view.  Let us look at the broader prospective.  It is very easy to be blind to that.</P>
    <P>Something that did not help us last week, I might point out, was the vote the previous week in the European Parliament.  That is the first time ever that the European Parliament has voted against price increases or improved conditions for agriculture in the Community &mdash; the first time ever, unprecedented, and it strengthened the hand of the Commission and strengthened the hand of those countries who have been looking for cut-backs in agriculture for years past.  It certainly did.  It gave them a great boost.</P>
    <P>There are quite a few items I would like to refer to but I think I have kept the House too long and I will leave it at that. I found the debate most informative and constructive.  I certainly could not agree with the terms of the motion.  You get less sympathy in any other councils than the Council for Agricultural Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 May 1986.</P>
