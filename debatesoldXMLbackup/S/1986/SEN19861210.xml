      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for clarification of the effect of drainage schemes in the County Galway area on the livelihood of small farmers in view of proposals to implement a charge for drainage to move from a direct labour to a contract basis and the imposition of a contribution for maintenance of the existing drainage schemes.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order for today's business, item Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on the Order Paper.  In view of the fact that this House is sitting an extra day and that there are long hours of sitting in Dáil Éireann, I think it is appropriate for the sake not only of <Col N="634" /> Members but of the joint staff of the Oireachtas that we should have a break in the middle of the day and probably a break also in the evening.  My suggestion as regards to timing would be as follows: that we should have a break between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  If item No. 2 does not conclude until after 12.30 p.m., then of course we would take the break at that time.  In any case, item No. 3 will not be taken until 2 p.m. in order to facilitate the Opposition spokesman, Senator Fallon, who is attending the funeral of Private O'Brien in Athlone today.  Item No. 3 will be taken at 2 p.m. irrespective of what stage has been reached in the business.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I was just beginning to answer some of the points which Senator FitzGerald made in his speech.  I think it is unworthy of Senator FitzGerald to come to this House and on a Bill as specific as this &mdash; specific in its purpose of abolishing perceived restrictive practices in building societies &mdash; to make a specific attack on a particular building society.  I have checked these allegations overnight and I find from my investigations &mdash; investigations which Senator FitzGerald, I gather, did not make &mdash; that on the whole they are completely untrue.  It is a pity that a Senator should use the privilege of this House to make statements of that sort without checking them properly.  I hold no brief for building societies as such, or for a specific building society, but I think under the guise of privilege it is a great shame that, possibly for electoral reasons or possibly because Senator FitzGerald has found some new zeal for the oppressed in society &mdash; a zeal which I had not noticed in the Senator before &mdash; as the electors of Dublin South East approach him and as he comes closer to them, he <Col N="635" /> should adopt this line.  Yesterday evening, for some extraordinary reason, Senator FitzGerald was trying to include the Shelbourne Hotel dispute under this Bill which I fear is not relevant either.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is a good road to go, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going Senator FitzGerald's road.  I am replying to statements which he made which quite obviously are not being investigated and have not been investigated.  Perhaps what Senator FitzGerald was doing was indicating the highly political nature of this Bill and that he was being used by people who do not have the best interests of the building societies, nor of the depositors in the building societies at heart.</P>
      <P>I opened last night by saying that the background to this Bill is unfortunately a highly political background and it is perceived by the Government that the building societies, or certain building societies, have associations with the Opposition here.  It appears to me that in its motivation this Bill is a punitive Bill, that it is a reaction to a specific row and a very public disagreement between the Minister and the building societies.  By its nature, legislation which is born out of this sort of business, which is born out of public rows, is bad legislation.  If that is the reason for the Bill &mdash; and it is certainly perceived to be the reason &mdash; I think the Bill should be opposed.  A Bill should not be introduced out of pique because the Government do not get what they want out of certain institutions.  I am surprised the building societies appear to be the only large institutions which have been singled out for treatment for what are undoubtedly restrictive practices, albeit minor.  The Bill should be opposed in principle for that reason but not specifically for the details of the Bill which do not merit a Bill in themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed is a far wider Bill or a series of Bills, looking not only at the building societies but at the financial institutions themselves.  In his speech yesterday the Minister gave us an assurance <Col N="636" /> that this is the first of many Bills.  As far as I can understand from his speech, there is no thinking down the line about what the following Bills are.  I cannot any longer take promises from the Government of following Bills to this, purely on trust.  I do not see any indication of any further Bills down the line apart from a ministerial promise, which might be empty, in view of the fact that an election is probably due.</P>
    <P>What is partially wrong with this Bill is that the building societies are still being treated like the institutions they were many years ago when they were set up. What is not recognised is that once &mdash; not all that long ago &mdash; building societies were small institutions.  Now they are very large commercial institutions and you cannot apply the same rules to large commercial institutions as you can to small ones.  Since 1965 home ownership has gone from 53 per cent to 76 per cent in this country; a large amount of that percentage is due to the building societies' role in lending money for this purpose. This should be recognised.  I know this is a populist Bill; there is no doubt that large commercial institutions are not popular with the public at large.  They are perceived as rich, bullying and inhumane but, nevertheless, it has to be recognised that the role they have played has been significant in providing people with homes.  We have one of the highest ratios of home-ownership in the western world and the building societies must be recognised as having played a major role in providing home ownership.</P>
    <P>Deposits with the building societies have increased from £35 million in 1965 to over £3 billion in the past 20 years. That is a massive increase and we should recognise that the building societies are not the same organisations they were 20 years ago.  The same restrictions should not apply to them and they should be looked at in a completely different light now than when they were set up.  The legislation should be accordingly framed; this legislation is not accordingly framed. One of the reasons these deposits have gone up so much is the huge amount of money &mdash; which has been criticised in this <Col N="637" /> House &mdash; spent by the building societies on advertising.  I see nothing wrong with the building societies spending large amounts of money on advertising which attracts savings into the building societies, which is turn can be lent to people to buy their own houses.  There may be some ideological objection to huge advertising &mdash; which I have never quite understood &mdash; from certain sections of this House, but in terms of actually attracting deposits which means more houses are built and more people buy their own homes, I see nothing wrong with advertising. The result of advertising is seen in this massive increase in deposits in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator FitzGerald and the Minister yielding to the temptation to attack large commercial bodies.  It is cheap, too populist and ill-considered because it has been the tendency, not just of this Government, but of other Governments to regard the building societies as some sort of an arm of Government, as some sort of commercial organisation on which the Government can put significant pressure and, to a certain extent, can control.  I do not believe they should be regarded as an arm of Government.  One only had to see under the last Government the subsidisation of mortgages which is an artificial interference in the natural commercial world, or the constant pressures coming from successive Governments on building societies to keep mortgages down.</P>
    <P>Everyone would like to see interest rates lower; certainly, every Government would like to see building societies' rates down, so that it is easier and not painful for people to buy their own houses, but it is unrealistic for Governments to be constantly pulling building societies into Leinster House or Government Departments and putting pressure on them to reorganise their interest rates or to keep them down as much as possible.  These societies must be allowed to operate in a normal, commercial environment and that would be, in the long term, in the interests of the consumer because they would be competing, not with their hands <Col N="638" /> tied behind their backs, but with each other and with the banks.</P>
    <P>The building societies, I think, feel that this Bill is an anti-building society Bill and that is an unhealthy thing.  It is a pity that the Government should be seen to be introducing a Bill which is hostile to particular organisations.  While there is obviously the need to protect those who are borrowing money from building societies, there is also the need to protect the building societies and to regulate their rules in an efficient way so that they can operate properly.  There is also a great need &mdash; something which has been neglected in this Bill and in the speeches made on this Bill &mdash; to protect saver confidence because the building societies could not operate without the savers who are far more numerous than the borrowers. If this Bill and the Government's attitude are hostile to building societies, what will happen will be that the public perception of building societies and public confidence in building societies will be undermined.  We have not seen any great interest in saver confidence in this Bill; we have seen a very populist, rather weak desire to please and curry favour with the borrowers, but the savers which outnumber borrowers by about seven to one are not protected, mentioned or thought of in this Bill and they are a very important element.</P>
    <P>The building societies perceive that this Bill restricts them in ways that the banks are not restricted.  The building societies, I think, feel that they are victimised in that under present rules banks can do virtually everything building societies can do but building societies cannot do everything banks can do.  It seems to them that these are unfair rules under which to operate.</P>
    <P>The case of the Irish Civil Service Building Society which was taken over by the Bank of Ireland recently is a very obvious example because when the Irish Civil Service Building Society was being taken over by the Bank of Ireland, a bid from another building society was not permitted.  As a result of that you have a bank owning a building society; in effect, a building society being an arm of a bank <Col N="639" /> and the two of them working together as one organisation.  You see now the Irish Civil Service Building Society as an arm of the Bank of Ireland issuing cheque cards and whereas since the last budget the banks are now getting the benefits of non-disclosure through DIRT the building societies' only advantage over the banks has gone.  Now that banks have entered the home loan market and are competing with the building societies in that market very successfully for obvious reasons, what I would like to see is that if these organisations, the building societies and the banks, are going to be competing, they should at least be allowed to compete on equal terms.  This is not so at present.</P>
    <P>I have not heard anybody quarrelling with the details of the Bill in this House. It is certainly quite acceptable that redemption fees should be abolished.  It is certainly not a great source of argument. I do not believe that the societies should lose their commission on insurance or that duplication of solicitors should not be allowed.  What I think should be recognised is that the cost of these charges combined with the DIRT tax will be passed on to the consumer who is the borrower from the building society.  There is no doubt that interest rates will rise as a result of these measures, that the cost to the borrower will be larger.  It is difficult to estimate how much.  The building societies estimate it will be as much as 1½ per cent.  I think that is too high but I think you are talking about the effect of the DIRT tax and the effects of the measures in this Bill probably making mortgages about 1 per cent higher.  That is something which should be considered by those who are framing the Bill and they should decide whether it is a price worth paying.</P>
    <P>One of the concessions to the building societies in this Bill is that non-mortgage loans are to be allowed by building societies. This was heralded by the Minister both in his speech here and in the Dáil as a breakthrough in that it gave the building societies a breakthrough into new ground, that he was in some way allowing <Col N="640" /> them to expand into new areas which they had not been allowed into before. He is applying it now just to bridging loans which is such a minor advance that I do not think we should really make quite such a song and dance about it. While bridging loans are very profitable, they are related to what building societies are doing at the moment, and very closely related to them, and it is a natural extension but it is not a breakthrough of any sort to allow the building societies to enter into new areas where they sorely need to go.  What we need, I think, is to hear from the Minister, at some stage before the Bill is passed, what he intends, a very broad outline of what he intends to be in the following Bills which he has promised.  My guess is that the silence on that will be deafening because it has not been thought out yet; it has not been considered but it is a very easy thing to say when introducing a Bill like this which is very one-sided.</P>
    <P>What appears to have triggered off this Bill is the issue of tiered rates.  The tiered rates system while it appears to be an abuse and appeared at the time to be an abuse by the building societies, while it appears to be a way for them simply to make more money, in practice it should be looked at a little bit more closely.  It should be asked whether it is the malpractice it is perceived to be.  The effect of tiered rates, it is my contention, would be &mdash; and has been in the past &mdash; that the larger borrowers would subsidise the smaller borrowers.  The tiered rates vary from building society to building society but the actual effect is that those who borrow more money pay a higher rate than those who borrow less money.  I do not see anything particularly unfair about that.</P>
    <P>I see what has been wrong in the past: I see why there should be no retrospective tiered rate but I am not sure that in commercial terms the commercial world would disapprove of tiered rates because the banks have always operated a series of tiered rates.  We have had the A and the AA and the triple A ratings and different rates which have operated <Col N="641" /> there.  This has not been in the past something which has been seriously questioned as socially unfair but is the normal commercial practice which has been accepted by the commercial world.  While the issue of tiered rates has become an emotive one, it would be wrong for us just to dismiss tiered rates as a means whereby building societies are getting more money.  If rates are to be evened out across the board, the effect will be that those who have larger loans will in fact be subsidised by those who have smaller loans.  I do not think this was the intention of the Bill but it is going to be the result.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal for one moment with the consultative council which is being set up by the Minister under this Bill.  The consultative council appears to be just another means of giving ministerial and Government control of the building societies.  It appears to be a stranglehold interfering with the normal workings of a building society.  We do not see such consultative councils working on the banks, nor such consultative councils working on the insurance companies.  The establishment of this council and the powers given to the Minister and this council only fuel suspicion that the political motivation behind this Bill is greater than the purported concern for those it champions.</P>
    <P>It appears in the details of this Bill that the wish in it to restrict is running counter to the deregulation which is going on in financial markets and in commercial organisations throughout the world.  The British Building Societies Bill which was introduced recently gives greater powers of entry into new markets for the building societies.  It will be difficult for our building societies when British building societies come in here, as they will do under new rules very shortly, if we are competing with them at a great disadvantage. If the restrictions under which our building societies work are greater than the restrictions under which the British building societies work here in Dublin, we will be competing with them at a disadvantage. It would be a good thing if the Minister and the Department studied <Col N="642" /> the British Building Societies Bill and, if necessary, adapt our Bill or introduce a new Bill so that we can compete on the same terms as British building societies when they come in and so that our buidling societies may change over to Britain and Northern Ireland and grab some of that huge market which is out there.</P>
    <P>This Bill runs directly counter to the trend internationally.  In principle, I would certainly oppose this Bill because I believe it ties the hands of the building societies in a highly political way without introducing a much broader financial services Bill which is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like broadly to welcome this Bill subject to a number of things that I have to say about it.  In doing so, I will be doing, I suppose, what a number of Members of the House have done also, emphasising a number of things that are not in the Bill as well as the things that are in the Bill, which is a proper approach to a Second Stage of a Bill.  I do not think our disappointment at the narrowness of the Bill should lead us to a situation like that suggested or indicated by Senator Ross, that in some way, because we did not get the kind of Bill we wanted, the excellent reforms which are in this Bill should be ignored or opposed just to make an additional political point.</P>
      <P>I support the building societies and what they are doing.  The building society movement has served and is continuing to serve this country well.  There have been fundamental changes in the building society movement.  It is well that we would recognise those changes and legislate for them.  The building societies, within the context and framework of the economic background in which they are working, are providing a good service to their customers.  They have provided that good service for many years and there is every indication that they will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is politically popular and attractive to emphasise some aspects of the way in which building societies are run.  It is <Col N="643" /> politically popular, for example, to indicate that in some way their advertising is wrong or excessive.  While the advertising of building societies annoys me as much as the advertising of anything else on radio and television, I do not think it annoys me any more than that.  As to the percentage of their resources they devote to advertising I would like to hear whether the Minister thinks it is excessive. My own view is that it is not excessive. By and large the building societies have used advertising to build up a market share for themselves which would otherwise not have been there.  They have carved out a niche for themselves in the financial market which is important, not only to the building societies but to the country at large.</P>
    <P>We had a very serious problem with the amalgamation of the banks in the sixties.  Effectively, over large portions of the country you had only two choices with regard to loans because there were only two banks.  In some places it was the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks. In other places it was the Bank of Ireland and the Ulster Bank.  If you had any disagreement with the bank, the difficulty you had was enormous.  The growth of any alternative financial institutions, even for part of the financial services being provided, is a healthy thing.  The growth of the building societies particularly the bigger ones &mdash; the Irish Permanent Building Society, the First National Building Society, the Educational Building Society and the other two as well &mdash; has been a good thing as far as the general public is concerned.  I have no reason to suppose that the building societies are not well managed.  All the indications I have are that the building societies are well managed, are efficiently run and provide a good service for their customers.  I do not begrudge the people who run building societies their directors' fees.  There seems to be a kind of a sport of baiting people over the amount of money they are drawing from building societies.  I have no indication &mdash; given the size of the institutions which <Col N="644" /> are running &mdash; that they are in any way excessive.</P>
    <P>That having been said, it must be recognised that the concept of mutuality has all but disappeared in the building society movement.  I do not know how we can change that.  There is no doubt that the hierarchy of the larger building societies is self-perpetuating.  The members do not effectively control the election of their officers.  I do not think that is fundamentally different from the position which exists with regard to any public company.  I do not think the shareholders of the Allied Irish Banks effectively control who the directors of the Bank are going to be.  The problem associated with the absence of mutuality in the building societies is no different from the problems associated with the erosion of shareholder control over any large publicly quoted company.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overstate the problem with regard to building societies and put it any stronger than that.  In so far as changes are necessary to increase the amount of influence which an ordinary shareholder has in appointing the board of directors and in controlling the policy of his company, the same criteria should be applied to the relationship between the members of a building society and those who are presently in control.  To concentrate excessively on those who control building societies is a little bit unfair and a little bit selective.  There is a problem in that regard but the problem is no bigger than the problem which is associated with the running of any publicly quoted large company in this or any other country in the western world.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for a confrontation between the Minister and the building societies.  An attitude of confrontation has grown up between the Minister and the building societies to which I will refer.  I recognise that there is a necessity for disagreement between the Minister and the building societies because they are on opposite sides of the fence.  One is in the position of controlling and regulating the other.  The other is in the position of seeking to stretch to the limits and to minimise the amount of <Col N="645" /> control exercised by the Minister on behalf of this House and on behalf of the people at large.</P>
    <P>Disagreements from time to time are inevitable but I do not think there is any necessity for confrontation.  A feature of the recent building society-ministerial relations has been that there has been an unnecessary amount of confrontation.  It is not for me to say who is to blame for that but it is fair to say that, on the one hand, there has been a political attitude quite blatantly shown by the biggest building society in the country.  The people who run the biggest building society in the country are as entitled to have political views as anybody else but they should not confuse their political views with their public duty or their duty as those who control the biggest building society in the country.  They should not confuse those two roles.  They have become rather confused.  They must bear part of the responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable not to say that I find the attitude of the Minister unnecessarily combative towards the building societies.  It is not necessary.  The building societies are as responsible as any other financial organisations in the country and, subject only to what I have said with regard to the political attitude of the building societies, the way they have responded generally has been right and proper.  A more conciliatory approach on both sides would be beneficial to both sides and beneficial to the building societies in general.  I recommend strongly both to the Minister and to the building societies in general and to the largest one in particular that there should be a more friendly attitude towards each other so that the many problems which remain could be faced and, if not resolved, put on the back burner.</P>
    <P>The building society movement was gravely damaged by the Civil Service Building Society saga.  I had the opportunity to raise it in this House.  It was an absolute shame that the Bank of Ireland were ever allowed to take over that building society because one of the main uses of a building society, in my opinion, is <Col N="646" /> to provide an alternative to banks.  The closeness of the relationship between the building society and the Bank of Ireland is noteworthy.  The common use by them of the same computer for the purpose of cash dispensing must mean inevitably that there is in existence a system whereby the balances in one institution can be checked against the balances in another.  That is precisely what we indicated should not happen during the course of the discussion as to why the Bank of Ireland should not be allowed to take over the Civil Service Building Society.  That was a grave mistake and, in my opinion, has been a serious blow both to the concept of mutuality on the one hand and the concept of an independent building society movement on the other.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of the Bill.  Its specific measures, to which I will refer in a minute, are by and large very welcome. I accept that there is a necessity for a wider Bill.  What I do not accept and refute totally is that because there is a need for a wider Bill, we should in some way translate that into opposition to the individual proposals which are contained in this Bill.  That is quite childish and those who adopt that attitude merely want to have their cake and eat it.  What Senator Ross wants to do is to say on the one hand: &ldquo;I am a friend of the building societies&rdquo; and on the other hand: &ldquo;Of course what they are doing is wrong and the way I will get over my problems is when it is proposed to abolish some of the things they are doing wrong, I say I am in favour of it in principle; I am only against it because it happens to be in this narrow Bill&rdquo;.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross and the other Senators who feel like opposing this Bill should examine their consciences and should see whether it is right or proper that they should do so.  By all means let them make the points on Second Stage as to what is not in the Bill but they should not use that excuse for not supporting measures to which they give lip service &mdash; because that is all they give.  If they do not support it in this House all they are doing is giving, for example, the concept of abolition of <Col N="647" /> redemption fees lip service.  You either support it here, or you do not support it at all.  I am confident that, because he is such an intelligent man, Senator Shane Ross will come to see this from the same point of view as myself.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for wider powers and certainly the changes which could be brought about in the building society movement as a result of the expansion of British societies into this country need to be given due weight by the Minister and his successors of whatever party during the course of the coming few years.</P>
    <P>The only problem I see with the Bill is that a lot of the powers in the Bill are being given to the Minister.  It is not being spelled out what the powers are.  It is merely giving the Minister powers to make regulations of one kind or another. Noteworthy in that regard is section 3 which empowers the Minister to prescribe purposes for which loans may be made.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech said he intends to use this power to allow building societies to provide bridging loans, but the power goes far beyond that.  The overall extent of the power there is something which we should not underestimate because section 3 of this Bill could be used as the basis for extending the powers of the building societies far beyond the question of bridging finance.  The extent to which the Minister sees this power as capable of being developed without further amendment is a matter to which we should give some attention on Committee Stage in my view.</P>
    <P>There are other specific things mentioned in the Bill.  There is the question of tiered interest rates.  There is no doubt that this was a confrontation between the Minister and the building society which was, in my view, quite unnecessary.  The attitude of the largest building society in this regard, in my opinion, was to be regretted.  The Minister's attitude with regard to tiered interest rates is correct. It is grand to say that it will give rise to a general increase in the interest rates charged generally but one very important concept must be adhered to.  That is a <Col N="648" /> person who took out a loan on the stated or unstated belief that he or she would be charged the same rate of interest as the general borrowers from that society is now entitled to feel aggrieved if superimposed on that is a tiered interest rate in respect of his or her loan.  That kind of approach by the building society was unnecessarily provocative.</P>
    <P>Having said that I do not think we should confuse that with any other criticism of the building societies.  I do not believe the building societies have acted unreasonably with regard to the question of mortgage interest rates in general. They have been the victim of the movement of interest rates which has been outside their control.  Therefore, the fact that interest rates are high at the moment is not a reason why we should complain or criticise the building societies merely for that fact.  The reasons for that lie completely outside the control of the building societies and to a large extent outside the control of the Government as well.  There is no point in adopting a different attitude to the building societies merely because they must inevitably charge higher interest rates as a result of the general drift upwards in interest rates which was caused by the twin factors of the devaluation of the Irish púnt at the end of last summer and the uncertainty with regard to our present position <i>vis-ávis</i> sterling.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill generally deals with the additional powers of the Minister to prescribe rules.  Once again it does not lay out what exactly is to be done.  It merely gives the Minister the power to prescribe rules.  For example, it prohibits or restricts the charging of redemption fees.  Presumably &mdash; this is something that we will ask the Minister to comment on during the course of the Committee Stage of the Bill &mdash; the Minister may make these powers and may unmake them.  In other words, the Minister is under no obligation to leave the powers as he first decides them.  I do not see where it is, but I am sure it is somewhere in the Bill, that the Minister can make these regulations and can subsequently change <Col N="649" /> them.  With regard to some of these matters, I would be much happier if we wrote in that there would be a prohibition on the charging of redemption fees.  I see absolutely no reason for redemption fees. It is a restrictive practice which has prevented people from changing their houses or it is one of the contributing factors to so doing.  The idea that if you pay back a building society in 15 years instead of in 20 years you should have to pay an additional three months repayments, or six months repayments, or whatever number of months repayments the individual building society propose, has no logic whatsoever.  It is based on a misconception. It would be fair to charge a redemption fee if the building societies were borrowing long to lend long.</P>
    <P>In other words, if I went in and borrowed money from them 15 years ago for a period of 20 years, if they made a matching borrowing from another institution for a period of 20 years then of course the early redemption by me of my loan would give rise to a situation where they would have surplus funds borrowed for which they might not have any immediate use.  The reality is that building societies lend long and borrow short. The early redemption of an individual loan in no way affects them because if they have too much money all they need do is refuse to take any money the following day.  They are borrowing short; they are taking money in over the counter every day.</P>
    <P>So there is absolutely no rationale whatsoever for redemption fees where an institution is borrowing short and lending long.  It would only be justified where people had matching borrowings, in other words, they were borrowing over a long period of time.  Of course, they would be entitled to assume that the money would be borrowed by their customer for the same length of time as agreed in the original contract.  There is absolutely no reason why redemption fees should be charged.  To suggest that this is going to increase the cost to the borrowers in general may be right in the short term, but it will lead to a more efficient situation and to a greater <Col N="650" /> amount of volatility in the house market, which is in the long term interest of the country at large and in the long term interests of the building societies and the borrowers who are making use of it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I do not see why it is necessary that the Minister should make regulations about the making available of reports but I am quite happy to accept those regulations because it may be important.  The Minister will be aware that these reports have a considerable significance with regard to the question of the societies' responsibilities in examining the property to make sure it is value for money because the law has clearly developed to a stage now where the building society, in so doing, has a duty, under the Hedley Byrne series of cases, to the borrower to ensure that the inspection is properly made.  There was a case where a local authority &mdash; I think Louth County Council &mdash; were held to be responsible in that regard.  It was reported in the most recent publication of the <i>Irish Reports.</i> We must recognise that the availability of this report could be important if the building society were seen to have examined or valued the property in a careless fashion.  The borrower could have redress to the building society on the basis of their report.  That is right and proper and I support the Minister 100 per cent in that regard.</P>
    <P>Nothing annoys people more than the question of having to insure your property with a building society.  It is an intolerable situation, where the insurance is taken out of the control of the property owner.  I recognise that the societies have an interest in ensuring that the property is insured and I am sure that they can protect themselves in that regard properly. But the idea that they will determine with whom you shall insure your property and the amount for which it will be insured is quite wrong and quite inappropriate. The insurance of domestic property has reached ludicrous proportions in some cases.</P>
    <P>Some of the insurance companies used by the major building societies are insisting on applying inflation indices to the value of the property, which bear no <Col N="651" /> relation to the rebuilding cost or the proper insured cost of the property.  As a result of that in many cases the amounts for which properties are insured are far in excess of the amount which the property owner would get if the property was totally destroyed.  One of the effects of this will be to ensure that there will be a proper matching between the value of the property on the one hand and the amount of insurance which will be carried on the other hand.  I support that completely.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of legal fees, the Minister's proposal is quite right.  I support the concept included in section 6 (1) (d).  However, section 6 (1) (e) reads:</P>
    <P>the arranging by a society through an insurer or an intermediary nominated by it for the provision of mortgage protection insurance.</P>
    <P>I understand what that means but I do not understand why it is drafted in a different way.  Subsection (1) says that the Minister may make rules prohibiting the charging of redemption fees.  The making available to a member, the removing or restricting of a right or the precluding.  In other words, the Minister can do certain things; he can prohibit or restrict the charging or redemption fees. He can make the report available.  He can remove the right of a society to effect insurance and he can preclude a society from requiring legal costs to be paid.  It is then much more vague because it does not say it can preclude the society from being the institution through which the mortgage protection insurance is arranged.  It just says that the Minister may, after consultation, prescribe rules in general.  It seems to me by the way it is drafted that all the Minister has in mind is to change in a slight way the way in which this operates.  A much fuller explanation of that will be necessary on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill to which I would like to refer is the building societies consultative council.  I am very unhappy with the way in which it is proposed to <Col N="652" /> establish this council.  There is no obligation put on the Minister to do it.  The Bill says &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;.  I think that should clearly read &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo;. I do not see why it should be left as &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; because in those circumstances the existence or non-existence of the building society council is a matter for the individual Minister.  When you do not put an obligation on a Minister to do that, over a period of time &mdash; not necessarily with this Minister or not necessarily with this Government or the next Government &mdash; they become careless about it and the building society consultative council will fade into oblivion.</P>
    <P>There should be an obligation on this Minister, and on all succeeding Ministers, to appoint a body and it should be much more stringent than the provisions which are laid out in section 8 of this Bill. There should also be a clear indication as to the number of persons who shall be appointed by the Minister.  There might be some indication also as to what interest groups should be represented on it.  I do not think the only interest group that should be represented are the people who borrow from building societies or the people who lodge money in building societies.  There is a wider public interest with regard to building societies which should also be represented on this consultative council.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it might be useful to have a representative of the building societies themselves, not in a dominant position, but giving the building societies' side of anything which is being discussed.  That is something on which I would like to hear the Minister speak in general.  It is important that this should be teased out and that the building societies consultative council should be strengthened to ensure that it becomes a body with real teeth.</P>
    <P>The Building Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1986, will form a useful platform for the creation of conditions whereby building societies can develop a good and constructive role in the years ahead.  The growth of the facilities being provided by the building societies is inevitable.  They will eventually provide cheque books and <Col N="653" /> the various other facilities which we do not associate with them at present. However, in recognising the useful role which they have to play in providing an alternative source of finance to the general public &mdash; alternative from the banking system &mdash; we should also recognise that they have a particular role to play with regard to the ownership by the general public of their own property.  Underlying everything I say with regard to the building societies is the fact that it is a good thing for society that people should own their own houses.</P>
    <P>It is important in considering the criticisms people have of building societies in general that we establish on what basis people are making their criticisms.  I am making my criticism clearly on the basis that I want the situation to develop with all its faults.  It has faults with regard to the reduced mobility of the workforce, for example, but even with all its faults, the matter of people owning their own houses is a positive development in society.  In my experience there is no single event, whether it be social or economic, in which a family can engage which will give rise to an improvement of their relationship with the remainder of society than proper housing.  Proper housing, whether it be public or private, is the most important thing.  The second important thing that will give rise to a positive development is the fact of their owning their own house, having a stake in their own piece of property.  It is an excellent development which I support.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I impress once again on the Minister and on the building societies to put to one side any personal difficulties they may have with each other, to resume their consultations in a constructive and sensible fashion, to forge a new building society movement, recognising the changes which the scale of the movement has inevitably brought about and, having done so, to introduce an even more comprehensive building society Bill in the near future which will further strengthen that important sector of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the <Col N="654" /> beginning that parasites are a necessary part of human existence.  Parasites exist in the human organism to do necessary things.  They are not constructive but they are not necessarily things we can do without. That is the context in which I would judge most, if not all, of the activities of many of the private sector financial institutions.  They are necessary but parasitical organisations which prey on the economy and consume resources within it but are necessary in the society we now have of an unregulated, undemocratic economy incapable and not susceptible to democratic control.</P>
      <P>We must have financial institutions and, regrettably, we must regulate those financial institutions in the context of the powers we choose to leave with them. We cannot do the things we would wish to do with the larger financial institutions because, unlike people and politicians, those who control financial institutions do not believe in values like loyalty, patriotism and commitment to a country. They have a single-minded obsession with the maximising of return for their investors, as they would allege, but the investors return is a coincidental good on the way to maximising the benefit to the institutions.  Therefore, to do many of the things many of us wish would simply result, in the context of EC regulations, in the flight of capital out of the country and the destabilisation of the public finances.  That is the reality.  In this whole area, no matter what fighting words successive Ministers may produce, we do not have the instruments of legislation and financial control to deal with some of the more brazen barbarities of the financial institutions in terms of the way they very often threaten and intimidate the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reality in which we must look at what are necessary amendments to the way in which building societies do their business.  It is necessary to say at this stage that of course these amendments are welcome, but one has to think about the sort of society which could envisage such ridiculous things as somebody doing a survey on a house to decide whether it is in reasonable condition and of reasonable value and then saying: &ldquo;I <Col N="655" /> have done the survey but you cannot see the report&rdquo;.  If you stand back and look at any other area of society, that sort of idea becomes an utter nonsense.  The only remarkable thing about ensuring that borrowers have access to such reports is that it took us so long to get around to it. That is not in any way to minimise the significance of it.  That is equally true of a number of the other provisions.  The idea that just because I put a building society to the unfortunate inconvenience of my paying off my loan early they charge me for the privilege is equally nonsensical.  It is only because we have this dread of upsetting the mandarins of the financial institutions that such reforms are undertaken so slowly.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that the demand by building societies that they should say with whom one should insure one's house is a nonsense that should have been confronted many years ago.  It is not that they own political parties but because the financial institutions wield awesome power &mdash; as they have demonstrated on a number of occasions in recent years &mdash; that they have to be treated with such kid gloves.  No other area of interest in our society would be treated with such kid gloves and care as the financial institutions. No matter how much rhetoric there is and no matter how many hot words are issued, the truth is that all political parties and all governments are intimidated by the financial institutions. They are intimidated by the powers of the financial markets, intimidated by their capacity to undermine the stability of the currency, to undermine the stability of the public finances and, basically, to threaten democracy itself.</P>
    <P>If people think I am exaggerating I refer them to an article written in <i>Business and Finance</i> recently by a senior Irish executive of the World Bank &mdash; which is, after all, a financial institution &mdash; in which he eulogised a large number of small countries for their economic success. The one thing they all had in common was that they were not democracies, and most of them were of a more or less fascistic and right wing bent.  The <Col N="656" /> fact that they were fascist and undemocratic did not seem to matter a whit to this man.  What appealed to him was the fact that they were doing wondrous things in the area of deregulation, for instance. Anybody who thinks that it is possible to reconcile the extension of social democracy and all of its values with free market in the area of financial institutions is talking in contradictions.  You cannot have a free democracy if you leave financial power in the hands of a small minority. That is the reality of life in dealing with building societies, banks, insurance companies and so on.  As an unreconstructed socialist, and as Senator O'Leary said, that is the perspective from which I judge any legislation dealing with financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The ultimate gall and the ultimate brazenness of many of the leaders of financial institutions, among them building societies, is the extent to which they give themselves airs to talk about the need for what they would talk about as sacrifice, patriotism and for hard decisions to be taken in the interest of the national economy.  At the same time, the same financial institutions when they are asked to make sacrifices will promptly give us lectures about the business realities, the realities of the marketplace, the realities of the world economic climate and the realities of the free movement of capital.  Their attitude is it is all right for us to ask you to be patriotic, to make sacrifices and live without the necessities of life, but you cannot expect that from us.  We are above such minor details of self-sacrifice and patriotism.  We live in the world of the free market in which values and humanity do not count and in which things called market forces &mdash; which are nothing more, by and large, than the collective expression of the greed of a small minority &mdash; dominate our lives.</P>
    <P>Just by way of example, before I talk about building societies, let us not forget the calculated attempt to undermine the public finances that happened two years when this Government went some way <Col N="657" /> towards eliminating a tax avoidance procedure known as bond washing.  A concerted decision was taken by financial institutions to endeavour to sell off £2,000 million worth of Government stocks inside a week and in the process to totally undermine public finances, threaten the stability of our currency and, indeed if they had gone ahead with it, to destablised our society completely.  These are the people who in other forums and in other times when they are at one or other of these functions where they must wear their public interest hat, will give lectures about patriotism, self-sacrifice and so on but when their own interests are threatened no such values motivate them.  The speculation against the currency over the past three or four months was equally an indication of their real interests, their real values and their real priorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most shamefully &mdash; and it refers specifically to building societies &mdash; the obsessive advertising of the confidentiality of lenders' accounts in all our financial institutions says something about the fundamental values that are at work in the area of the financial marketplace. Can you imagine employers advertising jobs where they say: &ldquo;One of the guarantees we will give is that your income is confidential and we will not tell the Revenue Commissioners what we are paying you&rdquo;?  Can you imagine the enormous incentive and attraction that would be to people who wanted to avoid income tax and how ludicrous we would all regard it?  We would regard it as utterly ludicrous that people should be allowed to maintain total confidentiality about how much they were being paid for their labour because it is a normal part of a civilised society that people should pay taxation on their income.  Then we turn to those who choose to invest in a financial institution and we are told: &ldquo;No, we will not ask to know who has money there, how much they are being paid or how much interest they are gaining.  We will make it totally confidential.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If people are paying the proper level of taxation on any interest they earn, then there is no need for confidentiality. The only justification for confidentiality <Col N="658" /> can be that we are actually turning a blind eye to widespread tax evasion by financial institutions, or through financial institutions by individuals.  It is quite ludicrous in a society which legislates to protect such confidentiality to ask other people who have less, who will always have less and who are pitilessly overtaxed, to accept that there is any justice in our society.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of the way financial institutions operate.  There is nothing in it to do with patriotism, with self-sacrifice or indeed with mutuality in the way that building societies claim to have been set up and claim still to operate.  It is all worthy of being judged in the present fashionable campaign for deregulation.</P>
    <P>I would have thought, given the scandal that has emerged in Wall Street in the past two or three weeks, that the apostles of deregulation would at least have taken a deep breath before they said any more. In Wall Stret an individual is reputed to have made between 500 million and 600 million because of his access to insider information, his capacity to use that information and his capacity to supply it to others.  In return for paying one-sixth of that back to the authorities he is now going to blow the gaff on all the people who were involved.  There is also the present spectacle of Guinness being investigated in Britain because of alleged irregularities in share dealings or the major suspicion many of us have about the extent of insider dealings on the Irish Stock Exchange.  The inadequacy of regulation in the area of the stock market in Ireland is a matter that has been commented on frequently.</P>
    <P>We cannot pretend that we control any of these institutions.  We control them on the peripheries because we are afraid of what might happen if we tried to control them where they really operate and where they really work.  It is particularly ironic that we are so intimidated in the area of the building societies which are supposed to be of a different fundamental nature and philosophy to the private banking sector.  They are meant to be mutual societies, where people come together to save money to enable each <Col N="659" /> other to buy houses.  That was the original intention.  To suggest that an oligarchical dynasty like our biggest building society, where son succeeds father as the chief executive, is somehow a mutual organisation looking after my interests in an entire and utter nonsense.  The coincidence of interest between myself and the managing director the the Irish Permanent Building Society is zero.  It is a financial institution dedicated to the maximising of the interests of the financial institution at my expense to the extent they deem necessary to maintain their profitability and to maintain their notions of their own position in society. I am a victim of their manipulation of the marketplace; I am not an equal participant in some mutual society.  That is the reality of the building societies as experienced by the vast majority of home owners in our society.</P>
    <P>In that context, I do not share this widely held view that the obsession we all have with owning our own homes is necessarily such a wonderful thing.  A German friend of mine recently said to me that he had great difficulty in coming to terms with Irish society.  He said: &ldquo;In Germany we rent our apartments and we own our televisions while in Ireland you own your homes and rent your television sets&rdquo;.  He does not understand our priorities.  His view was that it was an extraordinary burden to undertake.  Part of the problem is that we buy houses because it is the only way we can have security outside the local authority market: security of tenure, the right to decent accommodation and the right to a reasonable rent.  All of these things are far from clear and far from guaranteed in Ireland.  There is a perception of uncertainty there, whatever the legal realities, and that is part of the reason.</P>
    <P>The other part of it is the extraordinarily generous level of mortgage interest relief given which only a saint or a fool could ignore.  I am getting about £50 a week from the State for the privilege of acquiring property which I can pass on to my children without any form of capital taxation or inheritance taxation <Col N="660" /> because it happens to be my own home. The objective of giving people decent houses and decent homes, of course, is without question.  Whether the instruments of policy are correct is another matter and a matter with which I, and I am sure 95 per cent of the membership of this House and the other House, would take issue.  The obsession with home ownership may have produced stability in our society but I am not sure that it is a stability out of which creative thinking or anything like that can come.  It is a stability in present day terms, given high levels of personal taxation and high levels of interest, which is based on desperation for a large number of people.  There are very few people in our society who can reasonably sustain the interest rate increases that have been foisted upon them, quite unnecessarily in my view by the building societies in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that we should look at building societies and talk about some of the nonsenses they come out with. They tell us that market forces dictate interest rates.  It is an extraordinary market force where one half of the market is rigid, confined, has no choice, has no mobility and has no alternative but to pay up.  That is the position of the average borrower of a building society; you are stuck with a loan, stuck with paying it off and you have no choice.  To try to impose a classic free market model, where both seller and purchaser have equal freedom of choice and equal right to negotiate, on the realities of life for the average mortage holder is to fly in the face of reality.  That is why we cannot allow institutions like building societies to claim to operate according to some free market model.  It just does not exist. There are suckers there to be screwed to the floor every time there is a single perturbation in the market, every time a Government threaten to do anything to deal with them.</P>
    <P>It is particularly ironic that the building societies try to claim that the introduction of the deposit interest retention tax somehow justifies a further increase in their interest rates, given the fact that they have equalised their competitive position <Col N="661" /><i>vis-à-vis</i> the banks and all the other financial institutions.  They tell us that because the level of taxation has gone from 28 per cent to 35 per cent they are justified in having a further interest increase.  This shows that many of the building societies do not base their campaigns for interest increases on what they describe as market forces.  The market does not really exist in many areas of building society operations because they have a monopoly and they have a position of total control over one half of the market, over the borrowers.  What they are actually talking about is a political perception of Irish society, of their role and their rights in Irish society and their willingness to use their political muscle to bring governments under pressure. That is why I welcome the Minister's willingness to do what he has done so far because it may bring home to them that whatever their power and whatever their notions of themselves are, they are not unlimited.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments in the Bill. However, it is a very small step along the road.  I am amazed that at a time when we are talking about improving the operation of financial institutions that after ten years the trustees savings banks are still waiting for amending legislation to enable them to compete on an equal footing with the commercial banks.  The Post Office is now having to complain about a lack of willingness to allow them to move into the area of banking and one wonders why.  All the myths about the State sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector are called into question if a group such as An Post are allowed to operate with a full banking licence.  The idea of an organisation with branches with full banking licences in virtually every small village open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. five days a week, and for a half day in the smaller branches, with opening hours that must exceed by a factor of two or three those of the commercial banks would undermine the whole monopoly position of the commercial banks.  The idea that they might have to stay open until 5 p.m., the extraordinary idea that they may have to stay open during lunch time and the more <Col N="662" /> ludicrous idea that they open on Saturdays would not be acceptable to bodies who lecture the rest of us about the values of market forces, of competition and so on.  They eulogise on these things when they affect everybody else but they assiduously ignore them if they affect themselves, whether they are the building societies or the banks.</P>
    <P>If a government cannot achieve the right and proper objective, which is total public control of all financial institutions, they should guarantee that within the public sector where a network of branches exists there is the maximum effective use of the State banking system, and that should be An Post.  An Post should be allowed immediately and speedily to have full banking facilities operated through all its branches.  That would be the sort of dynamic market force which might force the cosily cosseted banks which do not compete, which do not take risks and which only innovate under most extraordinary restrictive circumstances, to face up to a number of the realities which they choose to avoid.</P>
    <P>In terms of the future of financial institutions in Ireland, the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill 1986 is a small step along the way.  Real competition is necessary, not some sort of superficial competition based, as in my workplace, on offering a student £5 to go to one bank as distinct from £3 to go somewhere else or offering free student cards or other little things which mean very little in terms of the resources of the banks.</P>
    <P>There is need for real competition in terms of lending and borrowing.  That does not exist at present.  If it existed it would ensure that all financial institutions operated at times and on days that suited their customers rather than suiting themselves. The major merit of the free enterprise market economy is that if proper competition exists it can at least be to the benefit of the consumer.  We have the ludicrous position of financial institutions having all the benefits of a free economy in terms of how they determine interest rates, of how they determine their lending policies and of how they determine who to give loans to and at the same time <Col N="663" /> we have all the restrictions of a virtual monopoly.  We have the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <P>One of the instruments of policy the smaller countries in Europe, whom we should be attempting to emulate, have used from 1930 until now to develop economies which are more dynamic, more flexible and more advanced than ours is that of a far more regulated financial market place.  Therefore, we should begin to wonder again about building societies.  Building societies should either become again the mutual societies they were set up to be or they should become financial institutions in their own right forced to compete fully in the market place with all the pressures of competition and the pressures of people being able to move from financial institution to financial institution at times and under circumstances that suit them.  The major way of stimulating real competitiveness in the financial markets is to allow the one State institution which could do it, An Post, and the trustee savings banks also to have full access to the financial markets and full right to compete in all areas of the financial market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am glad the Minister introduced it.  I will not give him any lectures about his alleged lack of flexbility with the building societies.  They have got away with far too much for far too long and I am very glad to see a Minister at least dealing with some of the more ludicrous privileges that these organisations have claimed for themselves. It does not take more than one step back to look at these privileges to realise that they were ludicrous.  They are all part of the dreadful position borrowers are in <i>vis-à-vis</i> their building societies &mdash; the monopoly position and total control where the borrower has no option but to agree.  I hope the Minister will ensure that any of the ludicrous claims of the societies to raise interest rates irrespective of market forces wil not be allowed.  One of the fascinating things about building societies is that they can say they are raising their interest rates because of market forces when it suits <Col N="664" /> them.  Even if the market was pushing interest rates down they would find a way to push them up to maintain their own costs and miraculously if no market force came into play they would not be wiped out.  Their lenders would not go elsewhere because interest rates were out of line with the market force.  That would not happen because their financial interests were at variance with the market and they would simply ignore what they know to be a most inflexible market and carry on regardless.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will ensure that none of these amendments is allowed to be passed on to borrowers in the form of higher interest rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in Irish society that causes more problems than the problem of housing and building societies by their nature are there to help in an effort to provide housing by way of loans.  Having listened to the speeches yesterday evening and this morning it is quite clear that there are strong views on this.  Yesterday evening there seemed to be much emphasis on the fact that the Minister and the building societies were more or less at loggerheads with each other.  It is very important that these two very important institutions, the building societies and the Government, should be seen to be able to deal with problems that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier somebody said he accepted what the Minister had done but that they were only small things.  It is unfortunate that these problems have existed for so long and have not been tackled.  Anything we can do to help in the building of houses should be done, particularly in this era when so many people are having financial difficulties.  Many people who started off so eagerly on building society loans and who were very pleased to have their own houses now find themselves in a different financial position altogether.  Varying rates of interest can be frightening for them.  Senator Ryan talked about market forces and so on.  While the building societies can have a certain amount of pre-occupation in dealing with this, the mere mention that they may increase <Col N="665" /> their rates by 1 per cent can send shudders through the whole community, especially for somebody who is struggling and trying to pay an existing loan.  That kind of announcement can send tremors through the whole community.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister is there as a defence for the people who are trying to pay back these loans and can say to the societies: &ldquo;We understand your problem but there is a limit&rdquo;.  If we do not have that kind of legislation, people will almost lose hope that they will ever get out of situations where building societies can keep adding on rates of interest if it so suits them.  One part of housing costs that always aggravated me, and I am sure the Minister has heard it mentioned before at meetings, is the question of duplication in engineers reports.  The county council send out an engineer to check the house as it is being built.</P>
    <P>This does not concern the societies directly perhaps, but even in our own case, engineers go out from county councils to check the house.  They guarantee that it is all right.  The council pay out the loans and then we have another inspection by the Department.  All these things are adding to costs, the cost to the Nation.  I am quite sure the same applies to building societies in regard to reports, valuations and legal advice.  I welcome the fact that an effort is being made to cut out this duplication.  Houses are dear, repayments are dear, legal costs are dear. If you get away with one at least you have something in your favour but if you are paying two costs it is absurd.</P>
    <P>Many people have the awful difficulty of bridging loans.  Anybody who gets caught by a bridging loan pays through the nose.  This would not be necessary if loans could be paid out reasonably quickly, but then there has to be a certain amount of red tape to protect public finances.  I can accept that but sometimes, delays occur that should not occur.  I was on to the Department of the Environment this morning concerning a housing matter that was held up for a longer period than it should have been and the <Col N="666" /> excuse was that delays do take place in the Department.  That is a very isolated event but I thought it was an absurd comment for any person to make.  He could have said they left it aside and forgot it. Delays should not take place; mistakes should not be made; someone should not be held up for a long time, simply because an application form was left aside.</P>
    <P>Anything we can do to help to provide housing should be done.  There is a question which probably arises at the end of a person's life when he redeems the loan. I did not realise how ridiculous it was until a relation of mine bought out his house this year.  He had about five years to go and finished up paying a penalty of £1,200 to the building society because he was paying off his loan.  Putting an end to that kind of nonsense justifies this Bill. In normal circumstances you get discount for paying off your bill.  If you have to pay a penalty of £1,200 simply because you are paying off your bill five years in advance, something is completely wrong. I am glad the Minister has put an end to that practice.</P>
    <P>On the question of valuation reports, I can never understand how people can decide that they work on your behalf and make you pay for it, and at the same time tell you it is none of your business.  If I were borrowing from a building society for a house which in my view was worth £40,000 but the building society decided it was worth only £30,000 or some such figure, I could be living in a fool's paradise. If people are charged for a service, they should be entitled to receive the information.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance has arisen. That is an old chestnut.  Why should anybody be compelled to insure their house with the insurance company suggested by the building society.  It was a malpractice that should never have been allowed.  At least it is tackled now and we can be grateful for that.  I mentioned already the question of duplicating legal costs.  All this duplication leads to extra costs.  We should remember that at this stage people are struggling at the start of their married life to get enough money to buy a house. They cannot afford to pay £1 extra.  They <Col N="667" /> are just struggling and hoping to meet their repayments.  If they have to pay legal fees they should not have to pay, or pay extra insurance they should not have to pay, or pay for a report, or for a valuation they probably have had done themselves, they finish up paying out money they could well have spent on furnishings.</P>
    <P>While a certain amount of emphasis has been put on the fact that the Minister had to take on the building societies, we should not go overboard on this.  Nor, in fairness, should we wrong the building societies because they play a very important role in our society as well.  They are providing money for houses and providing places to invest money.  They should not be free to threaten to increase their rate of interest when it suits them, or when they feel they should do it.  It is a very difficult sector to control &mdash; what causes money to be scarce or plentiful and what causes interest rates to rise.  It is a one-sided affairs as Senator Brendan Ryan has said.</P>
    <P>They have the dice on their side and they can decide at any stage that they have reason to raise the interest rate.  For those who are borrowing money, this is so serious that the Minister should always be on the alert.  If he is seen to be taking on the building societies to protect the borrowers, he should not hesitate to do so because too many people can be affected by any variation in the rate of interest charged.  Nowadays people are no longer as sure of a job as they were and many who started off in good faith, thinking they had a job and for life, find themselves without a job and with a loan they cannot redeem.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I hope there will be no unnecessary confrontation.  I will certainly defend the Minister to the last if he has to take on the building society if he thinks they are not giving a fair crack of the whip to those who are borrowing from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for the obvious keen interest which they <Col N="668" /> have shown in this Bill and in general for the welcome which they have afforded to the measures contained within it.  The Bill will benefit many thousands of existing and intending building society borrowers. I think it is as well to remind the House again of the main provisions contained in the Bill.  They are provisions which, in many respects, deal with a number of items which have given rise over a period of time to widespread public concern.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have power to abolish the redemption fee which has been spoken about and criticised by virtually every Senator who contributed, to make regulations regarding the way in which people may take out insurance on their own property rather than through the building society or the society's nominee, to make the valuation reports which the borrower pays for available to the borrower, and to ensure that the borrower is not charged two sets of legal fees at the time of purchasing the home as well as possibly providing for mortgage protection insurance.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that tiered interest rates on mortgages shall be disallowed where a society did not charge those tiered rates before 1 August of this year in relation to existing borrowers and, in the case of those who borrowed from 23 October onwards, that tiered mortgage rates would be abolished in respect of those loans and all future loans from a date some six months after the passing of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a faster procedure to be brought into operation for the making of rules prescribing the way in which directors of building societies should be appointed, removed and remunerated as well as for the provision of a building societies consultative council. On the other side the Bill in section 3 makes an important provision allowing the Minister for the Environment, following consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, to make new powers available to building societies allowing them to extend loans, whether secured or <Col N="669" /> unsecured, for purposes which might be considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated on a number of occasions that I felt that allowing building societies to make bridging finance available was a particularly appropriate extension of the powers and functions of societies.  I am interested to examine what other areas societies might most appropriately be allowed to explore.  I indicated to the House, for example, that allowing societies to make loans available for home improvements seems to me to be a very logical extension of the activities of building societies.</P>
    <P>There were a number of points raised by Senators which I will try to deal with before making some general observations. Senator Lanigan suggested that the provision in the Bill regarding insurance run counter to what has been done in the case of local authority loans. In fact, in the case of local authority loans, through a change which I introduced earlier this year, local authority loans now automatically have a mortgage protection insurance element built into them.  I think that is a very desirable safeguard from the point of view of the borrower and the borrower's spouse because it has the effect of redeeming the loan, in effect, in its entirely on its outstanding balance in the event of the death of the borrower.  I have included in section 6 the power to give the Minister the right to make regulations imposing a similar condition in relation to mortgages extended by building societies to their members.  I have indicated to the societies that I would be interested to hear from them as to how best they would see a provision such as that being built into their loan system.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan was also concerned that there might be a limit placed on the extent of the non-mortgage lending by societies which might be allowed under section 3.  In fact, that section provides for regulations to be made and it would be my intention to ensure that a set maximum limit would be imposed so as to ensure that an undue proportion of the funds of building societies was not devoted to non-mortgage lending.  That <Col N="670" /> would not be in the interest either of the society or their investors and would, of course, obviously run counter to the original purpose for which building societies were established.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerlad referred to the provision relating to the prescribing of rules and the making available of valuation reports to borrowers.  I know different societies employ different types of technical or professional people for the purpose of making valuation reports, but the basic fact is that the valuation reports are prepared and submitted to the societies so as to satisfy the society that the property has a value which is such as to adequately cover the amount which the society intend to extend by way of mortgage on that property.  It is, of course, correct that the societies should feel satisfied that there is that element of cover in the event of a default on the loan.</P>
    <P>It is equally fair that the potential borrower who is asked to pay for that report should be given sight of it so that he too may be satisfied that the property does have, in the opinion of the valuer whose fee they are paying through the society, the value of at least the amount of the loan which they are seeking.  The report is, of course, a valuation report and not a structural report.  A detailed structural report would, in most instances, be even more expensive than the valuation reports which are normally sought.  The suggestion is merely that the valuation reports, which now are prepared and made available exclusively to building societies, but at the expense of the potential borrower, should also be made available to that borrower.</P>
    <P>There was much discussion during the debate regarding the general level of management expenses of building societies and particular reference was made on a number of occasions to the level of advertising engaged in by the societies and this was referred to, amongst others, by Senator FitzGerald.  I remind the House that the discussion document on building societies which was published earlier this year following the interdepartmental committee report concluded that direct control on <Col N="671" /> management expenses would be ineffective or counterproductive.</P>
    <P>I have outlined my belief several times that the enhanced competition and the accountability which should result from this Bill and further measures which are to follow will all in turn bring about an improvement in this area.  The House should, of course, be aware that there are in existence potential powers available to the Minister of the Environment under section 76 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, if it should be necessary and that section enables me to make regulations on the recommendation of the Registrar of Freiedly Societies and after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the building societies consultative council, which will now be established under section 8 of the Bill to make regulations, if it should be necessary, regarding the management of societies including the prescribing of limits on operation and management expenses. There is no doubt that the general level of management expenses charged by societies in recent years has risen very substantially indeed and has been a source of quite an amount of comment.</P>
    <P>A number of the other individual points which were raised are perhaps more appropriate to the Committee Stage of the debate and might better be dealt with at that time.  I would like to turn to the general comments that were made, specifically the comments made by Senator Lanigan and to a larger extent by Senator Ross.  I found it rather difficult to follow the reasoning behind Senator Ross' contribution.  On the one hand as he went through the specific proposals in the Bill he appeared to agree with each of them, with the possible exception of the measures regarding tiered interest rates.  Yet, on the other hand, he took the view that the Bill ought to be opposed for two reasons &mdash; one that it had been conceived from a conforntation between myself and the building societies, and secondly, it should be a more comprehensive measure.</P>
    <P>In relation to that last point, I had a similar difficulty listening to Senator <Col N="672" /> Ross' contribution on another measure which I had before the House yesterday and last week, the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill, 1986, making special provision for voting procedures for the disabled. On that occasion the Senator criticised that Bill on the basis that it had taken too long to produce it and that it did not provide for sufficient voting arrangements for sufficient groups.  In relation to this measure the Senator has criticised it on the basis that it is not comprehensive enough in addressing the entire question of the building society movement.  Were that approach to be adopted towards legislation generally, I am afraid it would be very seldom that legislation would be published and virtually all of it, when it did arrive, would be of such a monumental nature as to virtually take up almost the entire parliamentary year on the one item.</P>
    <P>The Senator specifically made a suggestion, which would not endear him to my colleague, Deputy John Kelly, namely, that as the British Parliament had recently published a Building Societies Act, we ought to adopt the measures in that legislation and enshrine them in our code so as to provide adequately for the Irish building society movement.  To put the question in perspective, let me give some idea of the length of time it might take to prepare legislation, not based on the British legislation, but legislation felt to be appropriate to Irish conditions, to the changing marketplace, to the increase in the level of interest in financial services, to the pending EC Directive and to the change in the British legislation which will allow British societies to trade abroad, which means that they very likely may seek now to set up here.  This British legislation which took some years to prepare, I gather, amounts to 126 sections together with 21 Schedules and runs to 286 pages.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that there is nobody more than I in the last year who has stated publicly and privately the need for building societies to change and to adapt to changes in the marketplace, to realise that increased competition is on its way, to realise the <Col N="673" /> profound changes that will be brought about through the whole of the European Community regarding the internal market and the EC Directive which is now under discussion, to realise that, because of changes in the British legislation, British societies are now permitted to operate in countries other than Britain and that some of them may well indeed if some of the rumours and comments are to be believed, be turning their sights towards the Irish market, to realise that banks and other financial institutions are now becoming much more interested in the home loan market, to realise that technology is bringing about great and rapid changes in the type of customer services that can be provided.  For all of those reasons it was incumbent upon the management of building societies to respond to these changes, to realise that many of the things which are addressed in this legislation, and which upset borrowers and the general public have all disappeared in other countries, including Britain in recent years, through the effect of increased competition and the arrival of other financial institutions into the home loan marketplace.</P>
    <P>I have made those points over and over to the building societies during a series of meetings which I had with them.  I find the remarks of Senator Ross hurtful &mdash; and to some lesser extent the remarks of Senator O'Leary &mdash; regarding this supposed unnecessary confrontation which exists between myself and the building societies.  The simple fact of the matter is that I have had, in the course of the last ten months, ten meetings with the building societies, nine of them with the Irish Building Societies Association and one meeting with those societies which are not in the association.  I gather that in the previous three years there was hardly that number of meetings, nor would it be usual for there to be more than perhaps one or two meetings in a year between the Minister for the Environment and the building society movement.</P>
    <P>I have had a series of meetings and I endeavoured to set up a working party with the members of the Irish Building <Col N="674" /> Societies Association to address all of these topics, but &mdash; I mentioned this on several occasions subsequently &mdash; I pointed out to the Irish Building Societies Association that many of these practices which are now addressed in the Bill, in sections 4 and 6 specifically, were practices which were objected to by the general public who found them unacceptable.  I invited the societies, so as to allow a working group to operate in a better climate, to agree to adopt a voluntary code of practice which would address many of these measures which have gone out of practice through the effect of competition in other countries and which certainly provoke regular criticism from the general public.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the societies that it would be in their interest, to identify in advance the sort of measures which were likely not to be adopted by new competition, likely not to be operated by, for example, British societies if they set up here where, to take one example, redemption fees are not charged and have not been charged for some years by British societies to drop those practices now and to identify in advance and endeavour to head off some of that competition, and to have their image become more acceptable to the Irish public.  To allow the detailed discussion that would be necessary to adopt comprehensive legislation and to have it drafted, they should adopt a voluntary code of practice dealing with virtually all of the things which are contained in this Bill and which were criticised here by Senators and by Deputies in the other House.</P>
    <P>The Irish Building Societies Association did not see fit to adopt that voluntary code of practice and they suggested instead that those matters might be discussed in the context of the larger legislation.  The larger legislation, quite frankly, if it is to be of the nature or the size of the British legislation is going to take many, many months in discussion and many months longer in drafting, not to mention the length of parliamentary time it is likely to take before enactment.  As those societies <Col N="675" /> were not prepared to address those questions on a voluntary basis, I felt it was incumbent upon me to introduce legislation dealing with those matters whilst, at the same time, counter-balancing them by the provisions contained in section 3, which the societies have said for some time they urgently need &mdash; the right to extend the types of loans which they can engage in so as to produce additional income for them.</P>
    <P>I found it interesting, not to say telling, that in the one very interesting and helpful discussion which I had with the societies who are not members of the IBSA, they agreed at that meeting that, if they were given a reasonable amount of additional functions under section 3, the additional income which those functions would generate for the societies would offset at the very least, but much more likely more than offset, any change in income for the societies which might be brought about through the abolition of redemption fees or the other practices, all of which have been criticised by so many people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is finely balanced.  It provides for a logical extension of the powers of societies under section 3 and thereby an opportunity for them to generate additional income and that additional income will offset any losses of income to them through the operations of sections 4 and 6, which are to deal with practices which are not acceptable to the general public.  It seems to me that that, in fact, helps to put the Irish societies on a better footing and in a better marketing position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their customers and the increasing competition which they and we are already witnessing in the home loan market coming from the commercial banks and which is likely to come from other financial institutions, whether domestic or foreign based, in the near future.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept the suggestions made by Senator Ross that this legislation was conceived because the Government, as he put it, could not get their way with the building societies. There is a clear duty upon the Government to ensure that societies which now <Col N="676" /> play such a major financial role, as do the Irish building societies, are given the legislation to allow them to operate fairly and with equity and to continue to provide the important element of home loan finance which they do.</P>
    <P>There is an equally clear obligation on Government to defend the interests of the real owners of the societies.  The real owners of the societies are its members who consist of the investors and the borrowers. There is a real duty Government to ensure that all of those members are treated equally and fairly and if practices are being engaged in to which the members and the general public object there is an obligation on the Government of the day to first seek agreement, and if that is not possible then to seek the authority of Parliament, to deal with those deep-seated problems.  That is what I am doing and that is what I believe to be the obligation of Government.  I am doing it on behalf of a large vested interest group called the general public. I am not quite sure who Senator Ross was speaking on behalf of.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this Bill will help the Irish building society movement.  I have no doubt that it will help borrowers and potential borrowers and I have no doubt that the measures contained in it are necessary and correct.  I want finally to refer to one other item and that is the question of tiered interest rates.  I do not understand how at a time when tiered interest rates were disappearing off the British market simply through the force of the market and competition that instead one society here, by far the largest society, which traded very profitably down through the years and especially during recent years, should suddenly move to introduce tiered interest rates not only for new but for its existing borrowers. I found that to be unacceptable at a time when I had hoped that other societies might have moved away from the concept of tiered interest rates.  I also found it particularly objectionable that existing borrowers were to have this tiering arrangement applied to their existing loans.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset of my <Col N="677" /> contribution, I found it incomprehensible to discover in the course of one of the meeting I had with the Irish Building Societies Association, that according to the chief executive of that society a decision had been taken by the board of that society six or seven years ago to charge tiered interest rates to its borrowers but that decision has never been made public and the borrowers of the society had never been informed.  The people who had borrowed from the society in the period between the board's decision six or seven years ago and the announcement last July were given no indication that there was a board decision to charge tiered interest rates on those loans at the time they took out those loans.  It does not seem to me that that could be regarded by any criterion as being a fair or acceptable business practice. It was for that reason that the Government felt that we had an obligation to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting for Senators to reflect on this question of tiered interest rates.  There is no uniformity or particular logic about the tiered interest rates system.  On Committee Stage on that section I hope that it will be possible to outline in greater detail some of the different bands at which tiering starts and some of the different tiered interest rates charged by different societies.  I will conclude by giving just one example.  One of the largest of the societies which charges tiered interest rates commences its tiering band on loans of £21,000 and upwards. As Senators will realise with presentday price levels that effectively means that that society for just about any loan which it extends on new houses is charging a rate above the basic rate.  As far as the majority of borrowers from that society are concerned, there is no such thing as a basic rate being available to them.  I do not think that is fair.  The different band levels at which varying societies introduce their tiering and the different levels of tiering do not seem to have any logic or justification and it is for that reason the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the Bill were specifically introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary was interested in the <Col N="678" /> concept of the building societies consultative advisory council and he said there ought be an obligation on the Minister to set up that council.  The reason that section has been now introduced into this Bill is because there was a provision for enabling the Minister to set up a somewhat similar council under the 1976 legislation. I have to inform the House that in the course of that past ten years that council was never established.  It is my intention immediately following enactment of this measure, to have the building societies consultative council established.</P>
    <P>All in all, this measure is both necessary and timely.  It is, as I have indicated on a number of occasions, only the first in at least two, if not a series of measures, which will be necessary in order to provide and regulate for the changing marketplace and changing market conditions which will apply in relation to home loans and indeed in relation to institutions operating in the financial services area generally.  The level of welcome which has been afforded to this Bill in this House and in another place and by the general public is, I think, the best possible verdict that can be passed upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations would reduce on a temporary basis the fees payable for pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Pigs and Bacon Acts and the Fresh Meat Acts from their present level of 75p down to 50p per pig.  With the approval of this House, I would hope to have these reduced fees made effective in the period from 1 July 1986 until the implementation of proposed legislation.  The Bill, with regard to local slaughterhouses is presently being drafted and is hoped to be taken early in the new year on local slaughterhouses but, in any event, not later than 30 June 1987.</P>
      <P>Under the slaughterhouse legislation which I have referred to, it is proposed to harmonise inspection standards and charges as between domestic pork and other slaughterhouses and export plants, thus removing competitive anomalies between both types of premises.  It is hoped to have the necessary draft Bill introduced shortly.  There is the big complaint all the time with the major slaughtering operations that you had these local pork people who were not contributing in any way towards levies.</P>
      <P>The whole question of veterinary inspection fees on pigs has been a matter of concern to my Department for some time.  This fee is a statutory charge for a service provided by my Department's staff at approved export pig slaughtering plants.  Between 1982 and 1985 the majority of curers had been refusing to pay these fees, leaving arrears of almost £5 million for that period.  The plants had claimed first that the fees were too high and, secondly, that they were at a competitive disadvantage on the home market since domestic slaughterers did not have to meet the same inspection charges and standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following detailed negotiations between my Department and the Irish Bacon Curers Society Limited, last year, and conscious of the difficult market conditions being experienced by the industry, I agreed to reduce the fees from their then level of £1.10 to 75p per pig and also to bring in fresh legislation on <Col N="681" /> domestic slaughterhouses.  For their part the pigmeat plants agreed to the resumption of payment of the new fees.  Regretfully, I have to report that, despite an initial resumption of fee payment, the majority of curers have again discontinued payment, leaving an amount of £1.3 million outstanding since 5 April 1985.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that the reduction now being proposed which, taken together with last year's reduction, means a fee of less than half the 1985 level, represents a very generous initiative indeed.  The amount being charged now is well below the cost of providing the service and the industry must respond positively and honour its agreement on this matter.  Hopefully, it will do this voluntarily. I must indicate very clearly, however, that if it does not do so, I will be forced to take very strong action against defaulters, action which could result in their export licences being revoked.  I appreciate that the pigmeat industry has been experiencing some difficulties. Increasing competition on home and export markets has created problems for some firms.  However, other industries in our economy are facing similar problems, but are meeting their obligations.  The pigmeat industry must do likewise.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to help the industry, I have already taken several measures aimed at improving the situation. Included among these are the extension to pig producers of the scope of the recent exchange rate guarantee scheme for short term working capital for farmers and, indeed, the lifting of the ceiling of £50,000 for pig producers.  The proposal by the EC Commission to extend the 50 per cent FEOGA grants currently available to pigmeat projects in the disadvantaged areas to the rest of the country &mdash; where the present rate of grant is 25 per cent &mdash; will also be of great help. It is of great help particularly when you consider that some of the major operations are outside the disadvantaged areas.  I have already mentioned the proposed legislation on domestic slaughterhouses which will standardise fees and inspections at factories whether they be <Col N="682" /> slaughtering for the home or export trade.  The proposal to reduce the fees is a further positive measure of aid.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat industry will now have to tackle the serious structural and organisatonal weaknesses which exist if it is to be able to meet the challenge ahead.  For some time now we have emphasised the need for rationalisation of pig slaughtering plants and modernisation of processing plants.  While there have been some hopeful developments on this front, much more has to be done &mdash; and done quickly.  Generous aid is available for this purpose to the right applicants.  If firms modernise their plants to the highest standards, they will have new markets open to them such as the US market from which they are now excluded.  Firms also need to concentrate much more on product development and on aggressive marketing.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that Irish bacon has been doing badly on UK markets chiefly because we are not producing what the market requires.  The general complaint coming back from the British supermarkets has been that our sodium content is too high, our salt content is too high, the fat content is too high.  We have some very good entrepreneurial people coming into the market remedying that situation. If we are to take this massive market seriously, we will need to have a quality food product not merely for bacon but for all our food products entering these markets.  I have been assured by the supermarket owners and by their boards of directors that we do not even need sales people if we can come up with the quality they require.</P>
    <P>Product quality and consistency are vital for effective competition.  With this in mind my Department are working towards the early introduction of the recently agreed EC pig grading scheme under which carcases are graded by reference to lean meat content.  I hope that the House will support the draft regulations now before it and also support me in calling on all involved in the pigmeat industry to tackle the urgent tasks now facing it in order to ensure that it will <Col N="683" /> continue to play a valuable role in the Irish economy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to indicate to the House that there was some question raised in the Dáil about the skim milk subsidy.  We have at present a subsidy of approximately 42p a gallon.  This means that skim milk is available at 10p per gallon.  Another point that comes to our notice in the Department is the United States market.  We are looking forward to more than one processor gearing up for a USA licence.  Undoubtedly, the United States market is there.  There is absolutely no access to that market unless we bring our slaughtering into line with USA standards.  I gather that at least one if not more of our processors is getting ready for that scene.  Our permanent food committee, which involves all the State bodies, including CBF, devoted much time recently to the pigs and bacon industry.  Shortly, we will be visiting some of the plants and finding out at first hand where the State can help and where the industry can help itself.  During a recent tour by representatives from the Commission with a view to making FEOGA grants available some of our shortcomings were highlighted.</P>

      <P>Before we begin I would like to remind my colleagues that the proposer of the amendment may close the debate on the amendment but no other Senator may speak more than once.  I say that to be helpful because there are quite a few amendments on Report Stage.  Amendment No. a1. is on the additional amendment list; it is a ministerial amendment. Amendments Nos. a1, 10 and 11 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. a1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> In page 4, to delete lines 12 to 15 and substitute &ldquo;purpose of an application under section 3 be treated as if they had not been made otherwise than in accordance with that section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Briefly, this amendment is consequential on amendments Nos. 10 and 11 being accepted.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete the reference in section 2 (1) (b) to section 10, which are no longer appropriate because of amendments Nos. 10 and 11.  Senators will recall that I indicated on Committee Stage that I accepted the representations of Senators that it was unnecessary and probably impracticable to require a person to have a policy of insurance before he undertook the preliminary arrangements for the conductng of a trial.  It is in that spirit that the amendment is put down on Report Stage.  As Senator FitzGerald will recall, he made specific representations in that regard.</P>

      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan will recall that he was very much involved in the origins of this amendment. This amendment would put it beyond doubt that the criteria for selection of participants, referred to in section 3 (1) (e), should also include information about the methods by which participants are to be recruited.  Therefore, if that important amendment is accepted by the House a corresponding amendment is proposed to section 8 (4) (c), about the responsibilities of ethics committees &mdash; that is amendment No. 7.  Accordingly, as you have indicated, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, these are being taken together.  I think I meet the wishes of the House as <Col N="685" /> expressed on Committee Stage and in particular I meet the representations made on this important point by Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I want to thank the Minister.  I am impressed with the economy in the use of English achieved by the parliamentary draftsman; it took me about two lines to express that amendment.  I have to revise my opinion of the parliamentary draftsman upwards &mdash; there was a bad patch for a while. The amendment goes a long way towards making it perfectly clear that ethics committees will have to keep a very watchful eye to ensure that some of the alleged practices we were all very worried about &mdash; which I accept did happen &mdash; do not become commonplace.  Obviously they will now have to direct their attention to the criteria for recruitment.  I thank the Minister for being quite forthcoming and being quite prepared to listen to reasonable arguments.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 6 to 9 and substitute &ldquo;the person who applied for the permission shall make an application to the Minister for an amendment thereof and the Minister shall, after consultation with the National Drugs Advisory Board and not later than 6 weeks after the application for the amendment was so made, either agree or not agree to the amendment of the permission.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment was requested by a number of Senators and in particular by Senator FitzGerald.  The wish of the Senators was that we should provide a time limit for consideration by the Minister of applications for amendments to permissions.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I thought there was considerable logic in that position because there is a time limit for considering original permissions.  As the <Col N="686" /> Senators will recall the time for consideration of an application for a permission is 12 weeks.  Senator FitzGerald tentatively suggested three weeks as a specific time limit.  I have put in the amendment &mdash; I would ask for the support of the House in this regard and for the consideration of my proposal by the Senator &mdash; a time limit of six weeks because I felt that three weeks would be a very short time and for a variety of reasons &mdash; the Minister might not be available in a three week period.  A somewhat longer period would seem prudent, to enable any amendment to a permission to be considered; it is half the time of application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with both the Minister's earlier amendment and this one.  I do not want to cause unnecessary delay in the enactment of the Bill but I would like the Minister to consider one point before we finally put the stamp of approval of Seanad Éireann on the amendment.  We are talking about 12 weeks, then a gap, and six weeks.  That is what is involved when we are dealing with a trial where perhaps an explanation is required, in order to satisfy the Minister, to be furnished to the National Drugs Advisory Board.  In all, it is a long time.  I am not pushing this point but I am asking the Minister for his reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you go for planning approval, even the most minor planning approval the local authority will not answer you until the end of the two-month period.  It may be different in parts of rural Ireland, say, in County Clare.  The Minister, from his own experience, will know that in the greater Dublin area the approval will only issue at the end of that statutory period. Are we to find a situation here in this context where somebody has been refused permission to take part in a trial and they come in with an additional submission? It has taken 12 weeks already and they consider their position for a fortnight or maybe a week.  Then they have to wait for another six weeks to get that through its stages, due perhaps to some misunderstanding between the applicant and the board or Minister.  If <Col N="687" /> the Minister wants to insist on six weeks &mdash; and I am quite happy with that &mdash; could he say something to the effect that they will not be holding back decisions in relation to appeals any more than is necessary even though they have six weeks to decide them?</P>
    <P>I can understand his point about the summer holidays and so on.  Could they be asked by the Department of Health to deal with these more expeditiously than they will deal with the average situation, given that there has been an 18 week or 20 week period in trying to get approval through all stages.</P>
    <P>We received the Government amendments today and the office of the Clerk provided us with the relevant numbers and so forth.  It is not possible to get something that refers us back &mdash; say, myself, or Senator Brendan Ryan, or anybody else who is involved in amendments &mdash; to the origin of the matter?  In other words, could we get some sort of explanatory background?  It may not be part of the workings of this House but it strikes me as something that might be a very useful guide to people faced with the simple words that a parliamentary draftsman so correctly prepares.  It is not very clear unless you are going to spend you time doing algebra and geometry to discover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to make a brief response.  Following Committee Stage we had a discussion at official level between the Department representatives and the director of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  On balance, the view was that six weeks was a reasonable compromise.  This will not, however, preclude me from issuing guidelines or from within the guidelines urging that both the NDAB and ourselves expedite any amendment applications and not stretch it out until the end of the six weeks.  I have that on record now and I have no doubt that our colleagues in the Department will do their utmost to expedite the matter.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 10 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where under subsection (1) the Minister agrees to an amendment, it shall not be acted upon&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of a proposed clinical trial, until the ethics committee for the proposed trial has given its approval to the proposed trial (as so amended) in accordance with section 8 (2),</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of a clinical trial which has been approved by the ethics committee&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  until the committee has given its approval to the amendment,</P>
      <P>and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in respect of each person to whom one or more substances or preparations are to be administered, until the person who has given or gives his consent in accordance with <Col N="689" /> section 9 has been made aware of such matters (if any) as the committee considers he should be made aware of having regard to the amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment will provide that the ethics committee may make its agreement to an amendment of a permission subject to a requirement that certain matters relating to the amendment be brought to the attention of participants.  This is because it is possible that the nature of an amendment might be such as would have a bearing upon the participant's willingness to continue to be involved in the trial.  Of course, not all amendments would necessarily be of such a nature and might not necessarily involve the consent of the participants.  For example, if it were decided to use a greater number of participants than had originally been decided, that might not be germane to the individual participant.  I accept the point made on Committee Stage that the ethics committee may make its agreement to an amendment subject to the requirement that certain matters, as I indicated, could and would be brought to the direct attention of the participants involved.  It is an important amendment.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the amendment.  I would have preferred a little more.  I always think the best person to look after an individual's interest is the individual properly informed.  There is a slight element of somebody else knowing what is good for a third party involved in the amendment.  It is a huge improvement on what was there before and I do not wish to give the impression that I am opposing it.  I am not: I welcome the amendment, but I have a slight philosophical reservation about experts of any kind being left to decide, as the amendment says &ldquo;such matters (if any) as the committee considers he should be made aware of...&rdquo;  There is a slight implication of paternalistic benevolence there.  It is like saying: &ldquo;Do not worry your pretty little head: we will make sure everything is OK.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> The Minister was most forthcoming here in the House and subsequently about the problems and, therefore, I am happy with the amendment.  I am not happy that we should walk ourselves into a situation where other people can decide what is good or bad for an individual. Nevertheless, as in the case of the previous amendment, I welcome it and I am very grateful for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is necessary because of the following amendment, No. 9.  The amendment provides for a delay before the commencement of a trial following the informing of a proposed participant of the objectives and the risks associated with the trial.  Senator Brendan Ryan and his colleagues made the point that the existing provision implies that the participant might be informed of those matters by the person administering the substance or preparation, but that this is unlikely to be the case where there is a delay of up to one week before the substance is administered.  The proposed new provision is regarded as a more suitable wording even if it were not required by the new delay provision proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 9 and am very pleased but I have a caveat about all these things.  I am not sure the Minister's perception of &ldquo;appropriate&ldquo; and the individual's perception of &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; at the receiving end would necessarily coincide.  I am very happy that we have taken a large part of the discretion away.  Individuals, whether they wish to or not, will have to postpone participation.  I believe the fact that there will be a long hiatus ought to be capable of being used by way of guidelines for clinics to make inquiries from GPs which might not be possible under the present circumstances if a person was informed, <Col N="692" /> signed a form and agreed to go through with the procedure immediately.</P>
      <P>I know that in the case of the late, lamented individual whose death precipitated this legislation.  I suppose that he gave the GP's name on his form and that GP was not consulted.  If the GP had been consulted it is quite clear that the individual would not have been deemed to be suitable.  I hope now that there is a clear period of time of six days in many cases between when a person gives their consent and when they take part in the trial, perhaps the guidelines the Minister proposes to draw up will encourage clinics to use that time to do the maximum amount of inquiries to find out anything they can about the medical records of the people participating in the trials.  I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, lines 38 and 39, after &ldquo;otherwise)&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;unless provided for by the permission to undertake the clinical trial&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other than compensation for expenses actually incurred by the participant in the trial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> I anticipated that there would be a seconder present and on the assumption that the seconder will arrive before I conclude, I propose to move the amendment.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the question of payment.  The Minister pointed out on Committee Stage a perception of specific circumstances under which it could be argued that people deserve to be compensated for discomfort, inconvenience etc.  He had a point there but the problem for me, and the problem the Minister had to wrestle with also, is whether that set of circumstances could justify leaving in a provision for payment which could extend well beyond that.  I have thought much about it in the meantime and about various amendments.  My view would still be that it would be better to see how clinics could operate on the basis of truly voluntary participation by individuals who were not doing it to make money out of it.  If it turned out that the clinics could not operate because of the fact that the pool of volunteers had dried up completely and all the participants had disappeared, we would have to look again at the question of payment or other possible methods of recruiting volunteers.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I felt obliged to reintroduce the amendment which I introduced and withdrew on Committee Stage in the hope that between now and when the Bill has completed its passage through the other House, the Minister might look at this again and think about criteria for payment which would be designed specifically to exclude any form of incentive that would entice people who were on very low incomes to participate too frequently in these trials.  I accept that much of what has been done in this Bill and the way in which it has been amended has restricted that.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the meantime the Minister will consider tightening up further the whole basis for payment.  In the light of much of the talk that goes on about social welfare recipients and their availability for work, the idea of social welfare recipients being locked up in a clinic for a week and still claiming social welfare <Col N="694" /> assistance sounds to me to be utterly at variance with the principle that people must be actively seeking employment and available for work.  If social welfare recipients faced the prospect of losing their unemployment assistance and the consequential prospect of having to wait six weeks before they got it back, that might be a considerable disincentive to get involved in these trials.  This would be quite helpful.  In this absence of my seconder all I can do is withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank this House for passing the Control of Clinical Trials Bill, 1986.  This House and the Minister have done a good number of days work in bringing the Bill to the stage it is now at.  The Bill leaves this House a very different Bill from what was originally produced by the Department of Health or by the Minister.  It leaves this House a much better Bill than it was previously.  Our thanks are due to the officials of the Department of Health who are responsible for it and to the Minister for the efforts he has made to deal with the very many concerns Members genuinely had not just on behalf of the medical profession but also drug companies and those individuals who were facing clinical trials who in the past in some instances had been taken advantage of.  It has been a very worthy piece of work and if the public realise how flexible and helpful the Minister has been it would do him a great deal more good than he realises.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress the point that this House has been discussing 40 per cent of all legislation in recent times in the first instance.  This is yet another Bill which has been initiated in the Seanad and we should be grateful to the Governemnt that the House is being treated in this fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh and your colleagues in the Chair for the assistance you have given to us in enacting this measure.  We have had a difficult period of conjoining many amendments and discussions on Committee Stage but it was done most expeditiously.  I want to thank Senator Sean Fallon for the manner in which he facilitated the proceedings of the House in taking the Bill and, in particular, two other Senators who contributed enormously towards the development of the Bill, Senator Alexis FitzGerald and <Col N="697" /> Senator Brendan Ryan, because it is and was a complex piece of drafting.  We had very little help within Europe or the United States by way of parallel legislation available to us, but the work was done and a substantial number of amendments were adopted by the House.</P>
      <P>Finally I would like to thank the medical profession, the pharmaceutical profession and the National Drugs Advisory Board officers for their exceptional representations in the course of discussions on the Bill.  It would be entirely remiss of me if I did not thank the staff of the Department of Health who faced up to the problems posed by this Bill and did so with exceptional diligence and a great deal of competence.  I am very pleased that the Bill has been enacted and I hope to be back here in the New Year with a few controversial matters.  I have quite a number in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some brief remarks to make on these two regulations introduced by the Minister today which propose a reduction of inspection fees from 75p per pig to 50p.  This goes some way towards easing the difficulties currently being experienced in the pig and bacon industry both at primary production level and at processing level.</P>
      <P>There is a great need to rationalise the entire bacon and pig industry at this time and reference to this was made by the Minister.  It is true that the producers at their level have responded quite remarkably to achieving greater efficiency and they must be helped further to achieve even greater efficiency by feed rations being made available to them at more competitive prices.  Obviously in pig production feed ration prices are a major element of cost and would significantly affect the lack of margin that may exist in a pig enterprise.  In recent times pig producers have been going through a difficult time and the margins have been pretty slender.  This has been an area of agricultural activity where only absolute efficiency has enabled people to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important aspect in the pig industry, as in the case of the whole agricultural spectrum, is improvement in quality.  At present, approximately 80 per cent of our pigmeat is consumed on the home market and by and large any expansion or development would have to come from the export side.  Therefore, we must ensure that we produce to the requirement of that export market wherever it might be.  We have to find that market and produce to the requirement of that market.  Regardless of what we might think of the product we produce, if housewives in the United Kingdom or in any European country want a particular type of rasher, they are entitled to it.  We must produce to meet that sort of need as well as keeping an eye on the home market to ensure that we develop even further the potential that exists there.  Essentially, <Col N="699" /> we are relying on massive development of the pig industry on the international scene.  Therefore, we look to the United States and other countries and we have to produce to meet their requirements. We are not producing the products required by the United States market.  I know the Minister and others concerned hope that we will work to that end and produce precisely to those market requirements.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a dramatic change in the pig producing sector. Pig production is now becoming more than a large operation carried out by far fewer people than heretofore.  In relation to the margins I referred to there is no way the person keeping a few pigs, as was traditional in times gone by could survive now from an economic point of view. Therefore, we are talking about pretty efficient operations at production level. A high level of efficiency has been achieved by the limited number of persons who are in pig production in a serious manner.  It is incumbent upon us to ensure that at processing level &mdash; bacon factory level, processing factory level and so on &mdash; efficiency matches the efficiency of the primary producer and efficiency in marketing is also brought up to the proper level.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of imports into this country at present.  People get quite excited about such things from time to time.  The only way to counteract and to combat that situation with regard to pig meat is to make sure that we are producing the sort of commodity the Irish housewife wants.  That is one way of ensuring that imports do not become a major source of concern to us.</P>
    <P>In the broader sense there is, of course, a continuing urgency for us to be more aware of the need to produce a better standard of food.  The purity of Irish foodstuffs is not exploited and we should develop that as we have many advantages in this area at present.  Because of the non-use of antibiotics and the low level of pollution in Ireland we should be able to sell our message and promote our Irish food industry in a better way, not just <Col N="700" /> from an export point of view but also from an import point of view.</P>
    <P>As has been repeatedly said by many people, a high proportion of the foodstuffs we are importing could be substituted by home produced foods.  This applies right across the spectrum and one is talking about perhaps a couple of hundred million pounds out of a total food import bill of £900 million.  Much could be done to help our balance of payments and also to create employment.  There is a massive area which must be examined in greater depth.  I know the Minister of State who has responsibility for the food industry has bent his efforts in recent times in this direction.  It is a very vital area and the progress he has made so far is very encouraging.</P>
    <P>There is a long way to go.  We must raise our standards to the requirements of the United States and other valuable markets.  We must be very conscious of the necessity, not just the desirability, of doing that.  It is absolutely essential. There are a number of definite possibilities in the pipeline which will materialise, I hope, in 1987 in the whole area of new market potential and so on.</P>
    <P>There is still a substantial amount of money outstanding which has not been paid for veterinary inspections.  This is a major weakness in so far as those who are paying the levy of 50p, as proposed in these regulations, are concerned.  This is something that needs to be corrected because, so far as I can recollect, £1.3 million has not been collected.  There are arrears of that amount.  That is quite serious. The figure was much higher before the levy was reduced from £1.10 per pig to 75p per pig.  That helped to rectify the problem to a large degree but a number of people in the business are not paying this levy.  I urge the Minister to make sure that the appropriate legislation is introduced at the earliest stage possible so that the levy now set at the level of 50p per pig will apply right across the board.  If it does not, it loses its meaning and cause much friction and frustration on the part of those persons who pay it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on taking steps to bring down the inspection costs <Col N="701" /> from the 75p to 50p.  This is very much needed in the industry.  It is the type of thing that is badly needed in the overall farming scene as well but particularly so in the pig industry.  It is worthy of the full support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was told by the Whip this morning that this draft order had been placed before the House and was being discussed in the Seanad, I took it that as usual the Minister was looking for an increase in the fees but for once this was a pleasant change.  I said to myself: &ldquo;All I have to do now is to go down to the library and read what I said last year.&rdquo;  When I looked at the Order Paper I figured out that instead of increasing the fee, it was being reduced.  I then said: &ldquo;I will have to say the direct opposite now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very happy that the fee is being reduced by 25p per pig.  It may not look much but it is a lot in the industry where profit margins are so small.  We all know that profit margins in the pig industry have been very small in recent years because of the high cost of feedstuffs, the risk of disease and the availability of markets at different times of the year. All those things have made the profit from pig production very small.  For that reason I compliment the Minister on being able to offer a reduction in fees to pig producers.  It is a change because over the past few years we have been increasing levies for disease eradication, veterinary inspections and so on.  That has been the pattern.  Sometimes when producers get their cheques and returns either from the creamery or from the meat factory they are astounded when they look through their dockets and see all the levies and deductions made for one reason or another. It can be very disheartening for producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig industry has gone through a major transition in recent years.  We have seen the pattern of pig production change completely from what we know 20 odd years ago.  I remember when I was a child practically every family in the west of Ireland kept pigs.  They kept a couple of sows and sold the bonhams at an early <Col N="702" /> stage.  They usually kept two or three of the smaller bonhams to rear into pigs. This was the pattern right down along the line and they were the major producers of pigs.  In the sixties we saw that change. We saw the pilot areas introduced.  My own parish of Clonbeirne was one of the first areas in the country selected as a pilot area and new methods were tried out.  At that time the notion of a modern piggery was thrown about and one or two farmers decided to go ahead and build a modern piggery.  They were very successful for a number of years.  Then the cost of buying the feedstuff for pigs became so high and the profit margins so small that those piggeries had to close down after a few years.  It was a great pity.</P>
    <P>Pig production now has been taken over by the large producers and, as far as I can understand it, most of those pig producers are located outside the disadvantaged areas.  I have seen some of those factory places and it is marvellous what they can do.  It is marvellous how they operate and it is marvellous the number of pigs they can produce in any given time.  It is very important for those people to have markets available.  I know we have markets available to us.  Japan is one of the areas to which we have been exporting pork.  The Japanese are very selective and they will not take every type of pork, so it is up to the producers here to try to produce the material that is suitable for those markets.  The same can be said for the United States market.  We have a market in the United States and I was shocked to note that last year a Limerick firm had to import bacon from Denmark in order to fulfil its orders for the United States.  It is a pity that that should have to happen.</P>
    <P>The industry here needs to wake up to the needs of the marketplace out there. Now that the 50 per cent FEOGA grant is being extended to the area outside the disadvantaged areas where it has been in operation it is up to those people to modernise and improve their processing and make sure they have the orders for the United States market that I believe <Col N="703" /> is there.  I consider our bacon to be far superior to anything that can be got in the United States.  We hear this from visitors from the United States who come to this country and who are delighted to sample our Irish rashers.  In most cases the one thing they will bring back to their friends in the United States is a few pounds of Irish rashers.  That is a great compliment to our producers and our processors here.  We have the product and it is a matter of producing it in the right quantities and fulfilling the orders in the United States.  There is no reason in the world why any Irish exporter should have to bring bacon from Denmark in order to fill his orders for the United States.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that skim milk is now available at 10p per gallon.  This should be very acceptable to producers because we know that milk is a very important ingredient in the production of pigs.  I am sure if there is the right mixture of skim milk and meals pigs can be produced more cheaply than they are at present.</P>
    <P>We have seen recently the rationalisation of the pig industry in the west of Ireland where three groups amalgamated. I should like to compliment all those involved because we were worried for a while that those processing plants would close down and there would be widespread unemployment as a result. They are giving very useful employment to lots of people in that part of the country where employment is so scarce at present.  The management, the unions and the workforce are to be complimented on succeeding in rationalising the industry there and ensuring the jobs of so many people involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say on this except that it is a welcome change to see fees being reduced.  As a final observation on what the Minister has said here today regarding the collection of levies, I am a little perturbed to see there is still £1.3 million outstanding even after the reduction of the fees from £1.10 to 75p <Col N="704" /> per pig last year.  If the Minister has statutory powers to collect those fees he should exercise those powers because too often we have seen factories closing down with millions of pounds owed to the Revenue Commissioners and so on.  I would not like to see that develop in this industry. That £1.3 million could be very important ploughed back into the industry either to develop the market or to help the processors in modernising their premises.  The Minister could find many ways of using it that would be to the long term advantage of the industry and for that reason it should be collected.  There was £5 million outstanding at one stage before the fees were reduced from £1.10 to 75p.  I do not think that should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>We are promised legislation in the New Year that will, I believe, harmonise inspection standards and charges as between domestic pork and other slaughter house and export plants.  If that is done the industry should have no crib about paying those fees.  I exhort the Minister to have those collected.  Again I hope it will be a contribution towards the development of the industry.  Small as it may seem, it is important to the industry especially when the profit margins are so small already.  I hope this will, in some way, indicate to the industry that the Government are serious about helping them and that they are prepared to come to their assistance at a time like this when we know the industry are in need, when they are faced with many problems out there in the market place.  Unless they are prepared to go out and sell their product aggressively, as is being done all over Europe, they will not make a success of it.  It is up to themselves to go out there and sell our Irish bacon.  There is no reason why we should not be able to produce bacon as well as the Danes, the French or anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in inspection fees.  I would ask the Minister whether he is going to collect those fees.  A sum of £5 million in arrears built up in 1982-85 and in the last year and a half it is £1.3 million.  The factories are <Col N="705" /> not competitive and cannot compete against the pork butchers.</P>
      <P>We have been promised legislation for years but have not got it.  At one stage the levy was £1.10, then it was 75p and now 50p.  I think it is even more than 50p because you must provide offices and facilities for inspectors in the factories. There are pork butchers in any kind of shack.  If we had an outbreak of any disease in those pork butchers' premises, it would be the deathknell of the Irish pig industry.  We would not be able to sell anywhere if we had an outbreak of disease which was traced back to some of the pork butchers' premises.  While we are waiting for this legislation they are not going to be able to collect even 50p. There are very strong words there about licences being revoked.  What do you do when you revoke a factory licence?  You put more pigs on the market.  We know what happened last June and July when a few factories closed even temporarily. There was no place to kill a pig.  Pigs are a very perishable commodity and if we have not got places to kill them, we are in terrible trouble.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new FEOGA grants for modernisation of factories and killing premises.  It is only in one of those new factories that we will get the efficiency that is needed.  I had discussions with the Minister and I am hopeful that something good will come out of them in the near future.  The Irish pig farmer is the most efficient in Europe and he is producing the best pig in Europe, but we have not got efficiency at factory level and I am hoping we will have efficiency if people take up this new FEOGA grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to the American market.  Unless we get people to take up this market the pig industry will be going nowhere.  The cost of killing pigs at present is too high.  The return for pigs is about £50 per cwt. and farmers would need to be getting at least £55 or £56 per cwt.  To be competitive in the world market the price should be around £50 per cwt.  The cost of killing pigs in the factories is higher than in Denmark or in Belgium.  I read lately that pig meat exported from here to Belgium and <Col N="706" /> cooked in Belgium can be brought back here at 20p a pound cheaper than it could be cooked here.  That is cooked ham. Where do we go from here?  What kind of pig industry can we have if those are the kind of costs we incur?</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to increase the figure to £50,000 because this was a terrible difficulty for pig farmers.  It was a good decision to get that figure increased to £50,000.  I wish the Minister well in reducing the levy.  I also wish him well in collecting the levy.  I am thinking in terms of the legislation.  What I would like to see today is legislation to control the pork butchers.  The sooner the Government bring that on stream the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much to say at this stage but the occasion should not be let slip without at least congratulating the Minister on doing his utmost in this line of business.  As Senator Hussey quite rightly pointed out, it is a rare thing these days to have a Minister coming before any House to tell the Members that something is going to be reduced in price.  This is a rarity and one should not lose the opportunity to thank the Minister for his effort in this respect.  While we are talking about very small money, pennies really, Senator Quealy, to whom I listened attentively and who is in pig production in a large way, would tell you that, indeed, 50p or 25p a pig in profit can mean a lot at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Senator Hussey talking about the way of life in the west and perhaps we can talk about the way of life all over the country.  In bygone days everybody kept a few pigs around the place.  We have moved from that situation to the big producer, the person who spends thousands of pounds on housing, trying to be efficient and trying to compete in the markets that are there today.  There is no doubt in the world that these people need all the help they can get because they have, so to speak, put all their eggs in one basket.  If people who have, in many cases, borrowed large sums of money to go into the business of pig production, are losing money and have to close down, not only is their <Col N="707" /> income gone, but also all the money they put into the type of housing that is suitable for pig production and is not suitable for any other purpose.  For that reason I welcome any help given to the pig producer in this respect.</P>
    <P>When one looks at this inspection fee of 50p at present, one cannot but think of the inspection fees for cattle at present. Perhaps the Minister might take a look at that in the not too distant future.  I have some little experience in that field and very often find that, with the amounts of money being stopped at factories for the inspection, the vet on some occasions has far more at the end of the day in terms of profit for himself than the man who produced the cattle.  I urge the Minister to take a hard look at this.  I am taking this opportunity to ask him to do this because margins of profits have fallen steeply.  I noticed quite recently when selling a few cattle that between the levies the haulage and so on it amounts to £10, £12 and often £15 before you can kill a beast.  Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will say I am wandering away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing attention to it because I feel it is an opportune time to draw attention to it when the Minister sees fit to reduce this fee from 75p to 50p. We are talking about far more money under the other heading.  I mentioned Senator Hussey's comments earlier about the small producer.  Well, he is gone.  I remember the old days and James Dillion, Lord rest him, who used to say: &ldquo;One more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  You do not find anybody now with those few sows around the place.  It is the Senator Quealys of this world perhaps who are in the business of producing large numbers of pigs.  I am not necessarily trying to help his case.  My brother-in-law is involved in pigs in quite a big way.  I see the amounts of money that are poured in to try to improve efficiency and to try to stay in business.  I thank the Minister for his <Col N="708" /> efforts in this field and I hope he will not forget the request I made in regard to the fees for cattle at factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points on these very important orders which the Minister has presented to the House today and to join with my colleagues in complimenting him on being abreast of the rather low trough in the pig industry from a farm point of view. Farmers who are specialising in pigs or who have pigs as one of their major husbandries have experienced a very difficult period and I am glad to note that the Minister would appear to be keeping abreast of the situation.</P>
      <P>This measure which reduces the fees somewhat will help because margins have been squeezed to the very last and many people are quite happy to break even. The provision of the low interest rate Euro hard currency loan to people in this capital intensive industry has been a Godsend and should prove very beneficial to those who availed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of fees for services to the agricultural industry should not really be left to an annual introduction of orders of this type.  The legislation here goes back to the thirties.  Perhaps the time is right to have a comprehensive review of the entire situation.  Agriculture has changed considerably and while some time ago, as a politician coming from a rural constituency, one would be advocating long term policies for agricultural development, now the industry seems to change by the day and we appear to be getting into a situation where the European Commission will have greater powers and greater freedom of action to introduce directives dealing with specific portions of agricultural industry and husbandry such as this.  In the first regulation dealing with beef the only problem I see &mdash; there are a few anomalies but they have already been mentioned &mdash; is that there is where a farmer decides that he will slaughter a heifer for his own use for the freezer.  It is daft if he has to pay CBF a levy for that.  I know the Department do not enforce that but, nevertheless, for the <Col N="709" /> small amount of money collected the levies are a bone of contention &mdash; in the very area where they are imposed and on everyone who comes in contact with them.  It is an extraordinary policy.</P>
    <P>The Department charge a fee for the return of a very small amount of money, £1.3 million or whatever the figure the Minister told us earlier on today.  At the same time, they are putting in £200 and £300 million in grant-aid in different areas.  It is just creating administrative posts and in the process annoying everybody who comes into contact with the system.  Would the Minister consider taking an overall look at the problem? Instead of trying to retrieve £1½ million through these two measures which he has introduced in the House today, that could be looked upon as part of the services the Department provide through their not insignificant budget for the development of the agricultural industry as a whole. Perhaps the Minister could argue that those sectors which are receiving the services should make a contribution towards them.  If one is to count up all the levies and all the stoppages a practising farmer reads on his returns whether it is from the co-op, the creameries, or the beef factories, or the bacon factories &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I warmly welcome the reduction in the levy but I still hold the view that, since it has not been possible for the Department to collect the levies up to now by virtue of the fact that people refuse to pay them for one reason or another, there should be a better system of servicing the industry without depending on this kind of piecemeal collection. Perhaps the Minister will avail of the opportunity at some early date to review the entire system of aid and service to the industry.  While we are dealing with the levy which is, I suppose, based on live pigs &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the summer they had a difficult period.  The second half of November and early December is always the best time.  If you could keep all your pigs until that time you would be doing very well but everybody knows that is not possible; you have got to keep the cycle going.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in regard to imported processed foods.  Cooked hams from sister States in the EC it would appear are coming in much cheaper than the price at which Irish factories can produce them.  Perhaps we have been too slow in grant-aiding firms who were setting out to provide an import substitution service in this area.  We are in an era of convenience foods and I hope the Minister will look very closely at that and ensure that the Irish percentage of this increasingly valuable market will be maintained and will have an advantage over imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We experience difficulty in competing on the international market within the Community by virtue of the rather expensive cost of transport from any of the Irish areas to the central European markets.  If that works that way, why is there not a corresponding disadvantage <Col N="711" /> for European exporters who put agricultural based commodities on the Irish domestic market at very favourable prices compared with the Irish prices? That is one of the great conundrums I have never been able to solve.  If that is a reason for the difficulties in the bacon industry, I ask the Minister to concentrate his mind and see how best we can overcome them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I compliment the Minister on being very much abreast of the industry.  This reduction in the aggregate fee will be of considerable benefit to many people.  I hope it will be taken as an earnest of the Minister's interest in this industry.  On the whole they had a very difficult year.  Perhaps they are in for better times and I wish them well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their kind remarks and general support.  It is extraordinary nowadays to be reducing something. Small and all and as the amount is, it is quite significant for the bigger producer. I fully endorse Members' comments with regard to our producers here.  They are at present the most efficient producers in Europe.  If they were not so efficient and so committed and, indeed, almost locked into the industry, they would not have survived this summer.  I accept that it was a very difficult period.  Part of that problem was due in no small way to the fact that the processors had difficulty in this context.  At one stage most of the representations coming in to me were: how would people get their pigs in anywhere? Thankfully that is now resolving itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are updating legislation from time to time to meet the changing situation.  I should like to say to Senator McDonald that I think we are doing reasonably well now.  Some might say that if you give people an inch they take a mile.  The remainder of what is left is important. We provide a very thorough veterinary inspection.  It is only fair that people should be asked to pay a little towards that.  In the case of cattle it is £3.25p.  This <Col N="712" /> fee and the fees for pigs and sheep do not in any way cover the cost of the service given.  They are a contribution towards the cost.  In answer to Senator Lennon and Senator McDonald, yes, there are substantial IDA grants as well as FEOGA grants available to the industry if that industry is export oriented.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 25p is small but what it means, in effect, to put numbers on it, is £500,000 of an injection into the industry.  I agree fully with Senator Quealy, Senator Lennon and Senator Hussey that slaughtering premises are in need of updating.  We try to help them to do this through grant-aiding.  If they upgrade they will have new markets. Apart altogether from the new legislation, there is no future for them unless they upgrade.  Al these small operations will disappear fairly quickly.  For the sake of the industry, it was hoped to have the new legislation before Christmas.  As somebody who was plugging away at various bits and pieces of legislation.  I realise it is difficult to get it through.  You are in competition with a great deal of legislation other people seem to think is more important. However, we are assured that we will have that legislation early in the New Year.  We will give a little period of grace. There will be a short period when these unsuitable premises will get an opportunity to get their act together.  Then the axe will have to come down on them.</P>
    <P>We are serious about collecting as of now because we have given our commitment. The industry asked for a commitment to the legislation.  They did not say they would not pay until the legislation was in place.  Their commitment to us was: &ldquo;We will pay when you are serious about the legislation&rdquo;.  They went ahead forthwith and paid.  Now, they have backed off on their part of the agreement. Whatever problems it may cause for the industry, we have to keep our side of the bargain.  We owe it to the taxpayers.  We will have to implement the new amounts regardless of the consequences.  I have to make that quite clear.  It would be unfair if I did not.</P>
    <P>One of the problems the industry has at present is that while our producers are <Col N="713" /> probably as large as any of the competitors in Europe, our factories are not as large.  There are many small, inefficient units.  This whole business of economy of scale has helped our competitors and has put us in a fairly difficult trading situation &mdash; not in an impossible situation. There is goodwill towards Irish bacon right across the UK.  It is very acceptable.  They regard our bacon as having a particular flavour.  Whether or not when we drop the sodium, the water and the fat, the flavour will go with it, I do not know.  It is something other people will have to worry about.  Perhaps the salt and sodium have something to do with the extraordinary fine flavour.  I am sure people are keeping a close eye on that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the United States market, as mentioned by Senator Hussey, it is a matter of regret that more of our plants are not up to US standards. I hope, however, that the situation will change and this very lucrative United States market will be open to us.  It is true that some of our plants are coming on-stream now to qualify for a USA licence. There are generous grants available for this purpose.  I sincerely hope they will be availed of.  We must produce what the consumer needs.  The trends here will be towards the leaner carcases and towards leaner meat generally.  Anybody who strolls around our own supermarkets will see that people are interested in the leaner products.  We have the raw material to produce that type of product and I think we should watch it.</P>
    <P>We have this permanent food committee. We are placing a lot of emphasises on the pigs and bacon scene at the moment.  If individual Members of this House have particular points they would like to make to the committee, I would be very pleased to take representations from them or get a consensus of the opinion of this House and put them to the committee.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal in this House about needing funds to do this and that. If money could solve all agricultural problems they would have been solved a long time ago.  I have been working long enough both as a farmer and a public <Col N="714" /> representative to realise that what we need more than anything else in the food scene is for the people who know something about food, both the producers and processors, to get together and figure out for themselves what the consumer needs both here and abroad and produce it.  It is my experience that it is just as easy and no more expensive to produce the right goods as the wrong goods.  There is no cost factor involved either in the production or the processing.  It would solve 70 per cent of our marketing problems in the UK if we could produce what the supermarkets want.  I should like to thank the House for their kind comments.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill now before the House provides a legal framework for the introduction of worker participation at sub-board level in State enterprises subject to the consent of a majority of employees.  It also extends provision for worker director elections to the boards of three further State enterprises, Aer Rianta, Foras Forbartha and the National Rehabilitation Board.  The Bill also amends certain features in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nine years ago the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, represented a novel form of legal support for industrial democracy and a breakthrough in Irish labour legislation.  It involved no genuflection either to British precedent or to any directive from Brussels.  It reflected the translation into statute of a set of policy objectives which had been developed and promoted for public debate by the Labour Party since the mid-sixties. Economic democracy is about the right of working people to know that their views and the wealth of their experience will be taken into account in the important stages of management planning.  This <Col N="715" /> is important not alone for immediate economic recovery, but is in the interest of the long term viability of firms and the security of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act represented a balance between State intervention in the interests of establishing basic rights of representation and the provision of voluntary mechanisms which leave it up to workers to decide whether or not to exercise those rights.  It was intended to serve as a guide to industry as a whole, demonstrating what might be done in a range of diverse situations.  Uniquely, the experience of the operation of new statutory provisions was the subject of an independent monitoring study conducted under the aegis of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  The outcome of this exercise has thrown light on the role of elected directors and their relations with other board members, and the management, employees and unions within their companies.</P>
    <P>The operation of the original legislative model has revealed two striking features: first, the manner in which the primacy of union authority and responsibility in the collective bargaining field was accommodated in the nomination process; secondly, the fact that the election of worker directors has generated pressures for greater accountability and highlighted the need for more progressive corporate communications policies, greater disclosure of information and agreed reporting back procedures.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many of the lessons of this experience have been slow in getting through to both sides of industry, with the emphasis on both sides whether in the public or the private sector.</P>
    <P>The worker director experiment, initially confined to the seven State companies covered by the 1977 Act and subsequently adopted in An Post, Bord Telecom and ACOT when those bodies were established by statute, has been adjudged largely successful.  Nevertheless both management and unions have been reluctant to consider the <Col N="716" /> effects of the experiment on developments at lower levels in the enterprise. For their part, the elected worker directors recognise the need for more support in reporting back and in maintaining contact with other employees.  Across the State sector generally the information issue has been tackled in a piecemeal fashion.  The outcome on all fronts has, by any standards, reflected limited success, limited awareness and hardly any integration within a wider philosophy of what workplace relationships should be about.</P>
    <P>My own approach since I became Minister for Labour has been to try to shift attention away from the sterile debate about &ldquo;top down&rdquo; or &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approaches to industrial democracy.  To this end I established a broadly representative advisory committee to advise me on the scope for the development of employee participation at sub-board level with terms of reference agreed with both ICTU and FUE.  I also made clear my intention to advance the original legislative model by extending it on a parallel level to some additional State enterprises and to reinforce it by mobilising support for sub-board structures.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill before this House gives support to employee influence without regulating in detail how decisions should be made or what decisions should be reached.  This should enable complementary agreements to be developed through the State companies which will provide for differences based upon company size, type of production, local interests etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House will provide a stimulus to State enterprises which have not yet embraced joint consultative procedures to take steps to introduce such practices; for others, it will provide a framework within which exemplary practices can be developed nationally; where satisfactory participative arrangements are already in operation, the legislation will lend statutory support to such initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives a statutory right of initiative to the employees in the State enterprises covered by its provisions enabling them to invoke procedures for <Col N="717" /> the setting up of below-board arrangements. The details of the trigger mechanisms are set out in the Bill but, essentially, the process is set in motion where a majority of the employees are in favour of below-board participation.  I must emphasise that nothing in the Bill will detract from or weaken existing sub-board arrangements.  Nor should it deter the management of any State enterprise from devising its own blueprint for sub-board arrangements for purposes of discussion and agreement with its employees.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no prescriptions about particular forms or types of participation. The emphasis is on flexibility and on stimulating labour-management accord at enterprise level on the most appropriate form participation should take.  It may be that many of the larger State enterprises will opt for some representative form of participation involving the establishment of a joint consultative committee or works councils or such like.  In other State enterprises, particularly the smaller ones, a formal structure may not be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires that the participative arrangements to be introduced must be the subject of a collective agreement and must be set down in writing.  The Bill does not set out to regulate the content of these agreements in detail.  This offers both sides the opportunity to start with a limited range of issues and gradually extend the scope of the participative arrangements to cover wider aspects of the business of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>I have stipulated in the Bill that these agreements must contain certain essential features which I believe are fundamental to the concept of participative arrangements.  The Bill provides for the regular exchange of views and information between the enterprise and its employees; the communication in good time to employees of information likely to significantly affect employee interests; and the dissemination to all employees of feedback on the operation of the participative process itself.</P>
    <P>This initiative affords all State enterprises adequate flexibility to select and <Col N="718" /> implement the type of arrangments which are best suited to their specific circumstances. I have kept the prescriptive element in the legislation to a minimum so as to ensure that the parties at enterprise level have the maximum degree of discretion available to them in framing participative proposals themselves.</P>
    <P>The ambivalence of the organisations of employers and trade unions on the question of worker participation has up to now undoubtedly reflected a preoccupation with the narrow focus of their traditional adversarial concerns.  In this regard, at least, they mirror the reactions of many shop stewards and middle managers to the worker director experiment. There has been no significant history in this country of the social partners coming together to issue joint declarations on issues extending beyond the narrow wages front.  Our situation differs from Norway, for instance, where the social partners have entered upon highly visible commitments on worker involvement in the introduction of new technologies and work organisation initiatives.</P>
    <P>For this reason the report provided to me by the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation, which was chaired by Fr. Tom Morrissey, marks a very important development.  The report, which has been published, indicates that a broad consensus of thought and action has been achieved between the representatives of the social partners on a wide range of issues.  The report of the advisory committee will, I believe, greatly assist in removing the puzzlement and the disinterest and also some of the myths which have bedevilled the discussion of participation in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the report of the committee that it was divided over the question of the prospect of the promotion of worker participation in the private sector by statutory means.  I believe that many progressive firms and managers in the private sector will see that this Bill represents a catalyst for change.  It is intended to operate on the basis of agreement and is sufficiently flexible to accommodate a diversity of circumstances. Nothing could be further removed from <Col N="719" /> the old bogey that legislation necessarily entails the imposition of a &ldquo;straitjacket&rdquo; upon firms that would divert them from pursuing more appropriate voluntarist methods.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I am extending arrangements for worker director elections to three further State enterprises.  As I already mentioned, these are Aer Rianta, An Foras Forbartha and the National Rehabiltation Board.  Two of these bodies are State enterprises whose purpose is non-commercial in nature.  I have decided that there are no grounds for restricting the election of worker directors to State bodies of a commercial or quasi-commericial character. However, in taking this step, I have had to look again at the formula which stipulates that not less than one-third of board members should be worker directors. Employees are only one element among a diversity of representational interests which have to be accommodated at board level in the non-commercial State enterprises. All of these interests are directly concerned in developing the board objectives and strategic decisions of the enterprise. It would not be acceptable if the accommodation of these interests were to suffer as a result of adherence to a rigid formula.</P>
    <P>There are also pragmatic considerations relating to optimum board size and the necessity of providing a balance at board level between a diversity of interests.  These considerations call for the introduction of more flexibility than existed under the 1977 Act particularly in the case of some non-commercial State enterprises, for example, those with very large diverse representation on their boards such as An Foras Forbartha.  The Bill provides that the Minister for Labour may, by affirmative order, vary the number of worker directors providing, of course, that there are not less than two and up to a ceiling of one-third of board members.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enables the Minister for Labour, with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to add to the number of State bodies in which worker director elections can be held without <Col N="720" /> recourse to further legislation.  By facilitating future extension on the basis of an affirmative order, I hope I have removed any necessity to wait another nine years before additional bodies can be brought within this statutory scheme.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill, I have also introduced a number of improvements in the original model which have been prompted by the experience of its operation.  The Bill will allow for the right to participate in worker director elections to be extended to the employees of subsidiaries in certain circumstances.  The initative for an extension of this kind will rest with the state enterprise concerned.  No action may be taken without such a proposal in writing being sent to the Minister for Labour and the views of staff representatives must be communicated to him at the same time.</P>
    <P>It is only at this stage that the Minister for Labour, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, will consider the enfranchisement of the subsidiary.  If it were decided to proceed, any draft order would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have also sought to extend the range of those eligible to take part in worker director elections by broadening the scope of the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; to cover part time employees working at least 18 hours a week.</P>
    <P>To ensure a greater degree of stability and continuity in worker representation at board level, I have extended the term of elected board members from a three year to a four year term of office.  This change is favoured by the worker directors themselves and also by a number of the designated enterprises.  I have also included a provision that worker directors who cease to be employees of the State enterprise should relinquish board membership.  This provision is intended to forestall a situation where employees are represented at board level by someone who is no longer one of their number, and appropriate in the context of the extension to the term of office of worker directors.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act marked a unique <Col N="721" /> development in our industrial relations model.  It still has important lessons for us about what the law can hope to achieve in the wider realm of industrial relations.  In spite of its limitations it teaches some lessons about how attitudes and traditions can be changed.</P>
    <P>It shows that change can come about through the favourable experience of legal support for new developments rather than from any direct challenge to established practice.  The limited success which we have had in pursuing and concluding participation agreements begs some questions about the need for structural reform in our industrial relations system.  I am convinced that the prospects for advancing worker participation will ultimately require a change in our system of regulating industrial relations.</P>
    <P>We have to ask whether the attitudes of organisations on both sides of industry are realistic and adaptable enough.  We came late to industrialisation and yet we seem to have drawn on British cultural heritage for our industrial relations conventions. The trouble with some traditions, of course, is that after a time they become inflexible and a substitute for thought.  In the face of the constantly changing patterns and power relationships of the modern industrial community, caution and tradition can become blinkers which serve to inhibit progressive developments.  It is not only the prospects for worker participation but good industrial relations in general which require policy innovation, accommodation, flexibility and know-how.</P>
    <P>I hope that workers across the range of State enterprises will recognise that this Bill offers them an opportunity to become involved in the decision making process of the enterprises for which they work.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that managers at all levels in our State sector will have the foresight and commitment to respond positively to this initiative; their support is essential if the benefits which can flow from these arrangements are to be realised.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil attitude to the Bill before us is positive although I must register keen disappointment at the delay in bringing it before the Seanad.  The Bill aims to facilitate, as the Minister has outlined, the introduction of sub-board participative arrangements in a wide range of State enterprises and, secondly, it is intended to extend the arrangements for the election of worker directors to three further enterprises.</P>
      <P>First, let me take the worker director aspect of the Bill.  Up to now the only aspect of worker participation which has been underpinned by legislation is that of the worker directors.  Worker directors, it is worth pointing out, enjoy the same status as other directors in that the same rules of company law apply to them in respect of disclosure of interest, confidentiality and voting.  Seven State enterprises were designated in the 1977 Act and all have held at least two elections; some have held three elections.  The application of the Act in full, in the case of these seven enterprises, and the holding of elections in accordance with the Act provide evidence of a degree of satisfaction with the system of worker directors, especially from the viewpoint of trade unions and workers.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible to assess the success or failure of the system of worker directors because no comprehensive study has been carried out to date.  Preliminary research was conducted by Murphy and Walsh of the Irish Productivity Centre and the results were published in 1980.  This study reported on the attitude of worker directors to a range of issues at the time of the first elections or shortly thereafter.  Among the findings they reported that the worker directors experienced little difficulty in fitting into their new roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also reported that support for them was forthcoming from other board members and from management and supervisors, but rather less enthusiasm was found among trade union officials and shop stewards.  Trade union officials <Col N="723" /> were concerned that the collective bargaining process should not be adversely affected and shop stewards felt that there was insufficient feedback from worker directors.  The worker directors themselves in the same study showed concern about the need to develop sub-board structures to link them with their constituents. To the extent that the Bill today covers sub-board structures it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The worker director model is, of course, only one form of worker participation. Other forms include works councils and worker self-employment. Many people would hold that collective bargaining &mdash; that is, direct negotiations between trade unions and management on pay and an ever-widening range of conditions &mdash; has been a particularly potent form of worker participation. Given the dominance of collective bargaining in this country it is not surprising that the IPC study found a lack of enthusiasm by trade union officials and shop stewards for the worker director system. Irish trade unions, like their British counterparts have for many decades catered for worker interest through collective bargaining with the emphasis on economic issues as opposed to board representation. Trade unions can argue with justification that much indeed has been won for workers through collective bargaining without having to rely on other forms of participation like the worker director model.  For their part, trade union officials and shop stewards will continue to ensure that workers do not conflict with traditional collective bargaining arrangements.</P>
    <P>It must also be said that management too have long experience in negotiating with trade unions in the collective bargaining context.  The adversarial relationship which collective bargaining implies has been understood by both sides to exclude worker representation on the board.  Over the years management have opposed worker representation at board level because they have viewed it as being <Col N="724" /> incompatible with the collective bargaining process.  The traditional management argument has been that a conflict of interest is inevitable if workers are on the board which, in turn, they argue leads to ineffectiveness in decision-making at board level.</P>
    <P>This obviously raises the question as to whether the fears of trade union officials and, for that matter, senior management have been justified by the experience of worker directors in State enterprises. Trade union anxieties have been largely catered for in that trade union activists have typically been the successful candidate in the various worker director elections. Moreover, most of those elected continue to hold some trade union office which, in turn, serves as an important link between the position of worker director and the trade union.</P>
    <P>Despite some trade union officials and shop stewards reservations, from the evidence available there is no indication that the worker director system is likely to become a seriously divisive issue.  The worker directors see themselves as representing all employees in the organisation, not only their own trade union constituencies. This greatly reduces the possibility of inter union rivalry or conflict in this particular area although, as we all know, inter union rivalry is a source of concern in the general negotiating area under collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>In summary then the worker directors seem to be successful in fulfilling their role as board members while, at the same time, not challenging the collective bargaining process and the associated trade union interests.  So far as can be ascertained, worker directors appear to have integrated well into decision making on the boards of the designated State bodies. Clearly, a comprehensive study of the worker director model over the past six years or so would provide a firm foundation for legislation and policy making. Unfortunately, no such study has been conducted and I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that such a study, perhaps funded by his own Department, would be a valuable exercise for all concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> I now want to turn to the Bill itself and to express disappointment at the long delay in bringing the Bill before the House.  This has been frustrating, for example, for the workers in Aer Rianta who have been preparing for worker directors through their industrial democracy council for some time past.  In fact, they were rather losing heart not knowing whether the legislation would arrive at all, despite their very serious efforts to prepare literally sub-board structures for the arrival of the worker directors through the election process.  Indeed, I might add in the context of Aer Rianta that they are to be commended for the work they have done because one of the lessons we have learned in relation to the introduction of worker directors is that those organisations who have thought about, studied and prepared for worker directors have been in a better position to launch the system.  In the context of this delay I would like to think that the Minister in replying to Second Stage would indicate why there was such a long delay in bringing the Bill before the House.  Furthermore &mdash; and the Minister might take this up when replying on Second Stage &mdash; why is it that only three further bodies are designated in the Bill when in fact six, that is to say three plus three, were long since promised including An Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a query on section 12 of the Bill which requires that a worker director who ceases to be an employee of the State enterprise concerned shall at the same time cease to be a worker director. That seems perfectly sensible.  My query is this.  The section goes on to say that the resulting vacancy will be treated in the same way as a casual vacancy, that is to say, that the vacancy may be filled by the appropriate Minister who shall have regard to the results of the previous election in making an appointment.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies which recently examined B &amp; I.  In the course of the evidence to the committee the trade union representatives expressed very considerable concern that two <Col N="726" /> worker directors who had become redundant had not yet been replaced.  I recognise that the Minister for Communication is the appropriate Minister in respect of B &amp; I, but I would ask the Minister for Labour to take up this issue as a matter of urgency with his Cabinet colleague so that the rights of the workers in B &amp; I will be honoured under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I note that in section 13 the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in the Principal Act is amended to include &ldquo;part time staff working at least 18 hours a week&rdquo;.  The need for part time workers arises for a number of reasons, including the redistribution of skills brought about by new technology.  A number of studies have pointed to the likelihood of a dual workforce. It is envisaged that there will first be a critical workforce or core group who will be responsible for carrying out the more specialised activities of the organisation. Side by side with this highly qualified critical workforce will be the peripheral workforce.  These peripheral workers will be working part time or will be sub-contractors or workers who are on fixed term contracts.  That is one explanation for the number of part time workers.  Only this morning on radio I heard of the very major growth in the number of part time workers which has arisen primarily because of the shortage of full time employment.  I must say, therefore, that I welcome the extension of the right of part time staff who work at least 18 hours a week to participate in the elections for worker directors as provided in section 13.  It is a recognition of current realities.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the second thrust of the Bill, namely, sub-board participative structures.  The 1977 Act indeed gave an impetus to worker directors at board level.  It is true to say that employee participation schemes, be they of the worker director model or sub-board structures, do not enjoy a high priority among employer associations or trade unions generally.  The sub-board participative arrangements envisaged in the Bill represent a modest step in this area.  Clearly, the Minister wants to leave <Col N="727" /> it to both sides to work out their arrangements. Let us hope they will.  An underlying assumption of participation is that the subjects of participation are those in which there is a mutuality of interests as opposed to a divergence of interests.</P>
    <P>This contrasts with the concept of collective bargaining which assumes that management and workers have conflicting interests which can only be solved through structures based on an adversarial approach, a power relationship. We can anticipate that trade unions will be reluctant to co-operate in the establishment of sub-board structures unless they are founded on existing trade union structures.  It goes without saying, therefore, that those forms of sub-board structures which complement collective bargaining arrangements rather than replacing them offer the best prospect for success in the Irish situation.  This should not exclude the right of management to communicate directly with their employees on various issues if they so wish.</P>
    <P>If the sub-board structures are to succeed they must enjoy strong support from the trade unions.  Worker directors could play a particularly valuable role in advancing the establishment of sub-board structures precisely because they are worker directors.  Sub-board structures should enjoy a higher profile within the organisation and a greater degree of commitment from other board members because they will have the backing of worker directors.  Such commitment from the top of the organisation should help to ensure that the sub-board structures are taken seriously by all concerned. There is a pretty long history at attempts of sub-board structures and works councils and so on where the items for the agenda have turned out to be very trivial. Let us hope that the sub-board structures envisaged in the Bill will come up with more than that.  Full consultation should take place with line management before the establishment of sub-board structures, because they are the people who will be actively involved in the operation of these arrangements.  They should, <Col N="728" /> therefore, have a substantial input at the design stage of these structures.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill outlines the essential features of the sub-board participative arrangements which will be drawn up jointly between the State company concerned and its employees.  These concern a regular exchange of views and information between management and employees; secondly, the giving in good time by management to employees of information about certain decisions which are liable to have a significant effect on employee interests; and finally the dissemination to all employees of information and views arising from the participative arrangements.  Presumably management will ensure that employees are briefed on relevant matters and trade union representatives of these sub-board structures in turn will hopefully ensure that management, in turn, is made aware of staff and union opinions and attitudes. Subjects of interest &mdash; and these are not named in the Bill &mdash; will probably include budgets, results, manpower policies, strategic plans, redeployment of labour, productivity and wage costs.  These are all legitimate topics for discussion in these potential sub-board structures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 7 of the Bill which will require the State enterprises to describe in their annual reports any action taken during the year to introduce sub-board participative arrangements and any participative arrangements made during the year.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, I feel the more relevant information that is provided in their annual reports the better.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, on the whole I welcome the Bill but must criticise the Minister for the exceptional delay in its introduction. The worker director as a form of worker participation has been a worthwhile experiment.  The worker directors can and do make a valuable contribution to policy-making in our State enterprises. We would need further research on their experiences to gauge how successful they have been in meeting workers' needs for participation and in contributing to an <Col N="729" /> improvement in the operation of the State companies.  The worker directors themselves are acutely aware of the need to improve communications with their worker constituents and the provision for sub-board arrangements in the Bill represents a modest but welcome step in meeting that challenge.  I will reserve further comment and criticisms for Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Hillery, I would like also to welcome the provisions in the Bill.  I know he has been critical in relation to the delay but I would point out to him that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is a relatively recent appointee to this portfolio and in a short period he has demonstrated his commitment to this area.  He has a very thorough grasp of his portfolio and is dealing with an area which has been strewn with misfortune because it has been the victim of generations of suspicion and very much riven through and through by the wholehearted endeavours, on the one hand of people representing labour, and on the other hand, people representing employers.  Down through the years there has been a natural adversarial attitude or atmosphere which was not so much cultivated as developed in this area.  I compliment the Minister. While Senator Hillery has described it as a relatively modest proposal in that we are dealing with the extension of workers directors to a mere three other companies and sub-board participation to a whole raft of other companies in the Second Schedule, I do not think, taken in the overall context of our past history of industrial democracy, it is necessarily by nature or by concept such a modest role. I see it as a definite step forward in a long progression which lies ahead of us and which will have to be undertaken by future Administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister has stated, this provision is the natural off-shoot of a report of a committee established by the Minister which was given a very limited timespan within which to produce its recommendations, that is, the report of <Col N="730" /> the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation. Having read this document and taken cognisance of the fact that the committee was given a very brief duration within which to produce its recommendations, I find it a very concise and worthwhile document, a tremendous reference document for people who want recourse to (a) the past history (b) the present state, and (c) the aspirations for the future in relation to what developments should take place on the industrial relations front.  I unreservedly compliment the chairman and members of the committee on having produced an excellent bibliography, dictionary or reference book to which we can all have recourse to seek out what has happened, what is happening and what will happen hopefully in the future in industrial relations democracy.</P>
    <P>The document deals not alone with the topic in front of us &mdash; indeed it was the genesis of this Bill &mdash; but it also deals with the other models, other options, or the other examples of industrial democracy in which we have participated, or in which other countries have participated, in most case with benefit.  There are, as the committee pointed out, various options in relation to industrial democracy. There is the business known as &ldquo;circles&rdquo; where groups of employees, 12 to 14, come together sit down, parse, analyse, examine, scrutinise the strong points, the weak points, the areas requiring development, modification, improvement within a particular enterprise.  It is an example that has been borrowed from the UK which it was borrowed by the US and by the Japanese and has worked with significant success, particularly in the United States of late.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the pleasure of visiting the Salt River project which is an Arizona irrigation electrification and power structure. Having seen the manner in which it works I have no doubt that it is the type of experiment that we could justifiably take on board.</P>
    <P>While there I had the experience of seeing the development of the &ldquo;better way&rdquo; concept which is where a company <Col N="731" /> offers its employees the necessary incentive to come up with ideas for better work practices, time saving devices, expense saving devices and so on.  I note that in year one of its operation alone, enough ideas and initiatives came from the shop floor to save the company in the region of 280,000 dollars.</P>
    <P>I welcome the committee's report because it provided the necessary stimulus to get this legislation under way.  It is a comprehensive document.  It sets out the history and evolution of employee participation.  It sets out the scope of development for the future.  It sets out the need for education and training participation by people on both sides of the industrial sphere; on the management side and on the employees side.  It points out that there are models other than those outlined in this document, even though this document is largely flexible in relation to the type of models that can be undertaken.</P>
    <P>First, as the committee pointed out, there is the open door policy and, secondly, there is the more indirect policy of work councils as has been alluded to by Senator Hillery.  There is no doubt that in harnessing the goodwill, energies and abilities of both sides, we have been very remiss in leaving a lot of untapped potential on the sideline.  This has arisen from the fact that there is by nature an adversarial attitude that people's domains have been threatened, people's preserves are under threat and, on the other hand, by giving an inch, one is giving something to the other side to the mutual loss or negligence of the particular enterprise.  It has been proven time and again that where there has been a relaxation a flexibility and a culture of understanding built up in the industrial relations sphere, not alone has the enterprise benefited, but the workers have benefited, job satisfaction has benefited, productivity has benefited and, by and large, the whole atmosphere and thrust have been very positive.  Participation brings benefits to everybody but in trying to inculcate and sell this message we are trying to allay suspicions that have been <Col N="732" /> built up over a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>There is a dual obligation here.  There is an obligation on the part of the workers to ensure that they understand the process and participate in it wholeheartedly and that employees, in electing people to sub-board positions of responsibility, will ensure that they do so for the best reasons and pick the best people possible to represent them.  On the other hand, they should ensure that the people who represent them do not allow a vacuum or a void to build up over a period of time. The people who are elected to responsible positions by workers to represent their interests at board or sub-board level should not allow a void, a vacuum or a psychological gap to develop between them and those who elected them in the first place.  That would be tragic for democracy and it would undermine the whole concept, genesis and aspiration on which this measure was founded.</P>
    <P>There is also the responsibility that, while the reporting back process is very important, the employers would ensure that they participate with trust, confidence and without reservation giving wholeheartedly of themselves not only to the practice, but to the spirit that is contained in this document, to ensure that the necessary finance is made available by the company and that no stone is left unturned to ensure that the best possible structures develop therefrom. There is a dual benefit from the point of view of employers and employees.  It can provide the employees at board level, and indirectly by exercising their influence on the people they nominate to the board, with opportunities to influence the course of action of the enterprise in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it can and does generate commitment and hopefully will continue to generate commitment on the part of those participating.  It creates a sense of work satisfaction by drawing on the knowledge and skills of their employees.  Managers are not only flattering their employees but are being practical and pragmatic in ensuring that <Col N="733" /> much of the experience, skills and reservoir of knowledge these people have, and which have been untapped thus far, are now being drawn upon to the mutual benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there would be reserve and caution and, in some cases, possibly hostility to any changes. People who enter into this arrangement should do so in the knowledge that they are doing so for the benefit of each mutually or collectively as a unit and that they are not undermining their respective roles.  In fact, they have the benefit of the participants, the benefit of the enterprise and the long term survival of the enterprise very much at heart.  Full commitment is necessary from all concerned employers, the trade union side and from a person put in a position to ensure that the necessary procedures &mdash; in this case the secretary of the company &mdash; are adhered to.  All people should enter into the spirit of the agreement wholeheartedly to ensure that the necessary aspirations set down therein are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The committee produced a very worthwhile document.  It deals with the considerable developments that have taken place thus far and it is only right that it should target in on the public sector.  If we cannot achieve a level of industrial democracy in the public sector, where people by way of contractual obligations, documents and so on have guaranteed jobs in this sphere of our national economic activity, it is very difficult to expect the private sector to take these recommendations on board.  As has been the experience, if something is left to the voluntary volition of people, irrespective of how magnanimous their intentions might be, irrespective of how generous their verbalisations might be, irrespective of how good their intentions might be, it simply will not happen.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is as a result of lots of pious platitudes in the past, lots of aspirations and lots of verbal commitment that this enabling legislation finds its way into the House.  It is based on the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, which has been successful.  The Minister has been cautious in his <Col N="734" /> acknowledgment of its success but it has set the tone, the seeds and the ground work for this legislation.  It involves a whole process, an evolution, a series of measures and a breaking down of traditional suspicions and inherent latent tendencies to suspect the other side.  D Day is very near and unless we begin to get our act together in relation to industrial relations participation it will be forced upon us from the outside.  We have already debated at considerable length two measures on industrial democracy: the Vredeling Directive and the Fifth Directive on Company Law.  We have seen that it is expected of us to get into line with the rest of Europe.  Therefore, we should get down to the business of devising models that suit our requirements rather than having the full weight of the European Community brought to bear on us.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the Vredeling Directive and the Fifth Directive and we have seen that we have a mammoth task in front of us.  In looking at the recommendations from the various bodies, we have seen that two of the greatest areas of reservations came not come from the trade union side but from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They felt that by taking these measures on board, by greater democratisation, by making available to workers various facts, indepth information, analysis of the performance of the particular company, matters that would have a bearing not only on the long term survival of the company but the day to day welfare of the employees &mdash; there was an attitude evident in these documents very much in the direction of the belief that by relaxing the rules, by giving greater worker participation, by providing free access to information &mdash; all of this together would prove a deterrent to foreign investment in this country.</P>
    <P>We had set out for us by the IDA or by the Department of Industry and Commerce, as a result of figures provided by the IDA, the degree to which we, as a country, are indebted to the Japanese, the American and the Continental investors in this country.  There seemed to be <Col N="735" /> the underlying message or theme that if we are in fact to democratise, give greater participation and greater involvement this could do irreparable damage to the salesmanship job being done abroad by the IDA and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That judgment is sad because again it copperfastens what is very much underlying the whole principle which has given rise to this Bill, that there is not enough voluntary commitment on both sides to undertake the development of the necessary roles without the stimulus, the prod, the probing or the overseeing, managerial influence of the Minister or the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that what has been undertaken here or has been begun here, while it is not quite as modest as Senator Hillery would say, will provide the necessary headline for the private sector to get on with the job further.  While this measure extends participation to a whole raft of semi-State agencies and gives them sub-board status etc.  One notices that in the public sector where I think there are a total of 210,000 employees, there are huge areas precluded &mdash; huge areas where there would be this difficulty with, for example, the Garda Síochána, the teaching profession, etc.  In due course irrespective of the inherent difficulties, these will have to be included.</P>
    <P>I believe that in passing this Bill we are fulfilling a fairly vital obligation; we are going a fairly conspicuous and fairly significant step down the road to industrial democracy; we are setting the headline for the public sector; we are breaking down these suspicions to which I have alluded previously.  It will lead to a heal-their atmosphere overall in the industrial relations sector.  There will be greater productivity which will be one of the main allurements, attractions or magnets from the employer's viewpoint.  There will be greater job satisfaction and the whole atmosphere of industrial relations will become such that we can justifiably market ourselves abroad as an industrial democracy where the best of all worlds prevails and have a solid good base for <Col N="736" /> investment by foreign enterprises in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of clarification, could I just pick up a point Senator Higgins made?  My criticism of the Minister in regard to the delay in bringing in the Bill did not relate, in fact, to sub-board structures, because they were the subject of the Morrissey Report, which was compiled in excellent time. What I was referring to was the Minister's delay in extending the worker-director remit to other State-sponsored bodies, something which he promised the best part of two years ago.  I just want to get that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can claim to occupy a fairly unique position here today.  On the one hand, I have had a fair amount of experience as a trade union official since 1947.  On the other hand, I was a director of the sugar company in the Republic and the Management Development Service in the North, an organisation set up to train and equip especially young business management in how to do it.  So, I have some experience in that field.  I do not know of anybody else here who was actually a worker director.  So, drawing on the experience both as a trade union official and a worker director, I obviously would have something to say about this progressive step. The first thing I have to say is that I welcome it.  I welcome the language in the Minister's address and the important part of his speech today is the way he deals with the psychology of industrial democracy, what he really means by worker participation, what he really means by involvement of the workers. We did have examples in the world of worker democracy to a far greater degree than imagined here.  If we can remove from our minds the bias against the Communist countries, worker democracy there does its best to get right down to where worker democracy really belongs &mdash; and it is not at the top.  It belongs on the factory floor.  It belongs at the point of production or the point of distribution. It belongs in involving the worker, as <Col N="737" /> such, not necessarily a trade union.  It means involvement of workers.  I have looked at the worker director experiment here &mdash; the early one &mdash; with favour.  I said it was a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough.  That is what I said at that time.  I would like to see much more progress towards our ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>Again, we have not travelled far enough and fast enough and I note that, in the advice to the Minister in this report of the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation, reservations were held by the representatives from the FUE.  They said they preferred the voluntary effort rather than the legislative effort.  Now, I understand this perfectly from the point of view that anything that is volunteered is much better than anything that is conscripted. Consequently I looked at it again and I believe &mdash; Knowing something of management's attitude to worker participation &mdash; that that is not a true statement of the real feelings of the employer side: I believe it is a stall.  I do not think the employers' association has told the full truth by stalling on that and saying that the preference was for the voluntary method.  I believe the voluntary method is better than legislation.  Volunteers are better than conscripts at any time, if you can assume that by legislating for something it is conscripting people &mdash; it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary method put forward by the FUE representatives on the advisory committee is not the full truth and that is what I have to say about that attitude.  I have looked after various enterprises in Derry and Donegal for the Irish Transport Union and in any of the enterprises for which I was responsible on the workers side, I set up, where the management would agree, a system whereby workers would be involved in a representative way.  If I had five shop stewards, ten shop stewards, three shop stewards, they would almost automatically be the front line representation, but whatever committee I set up, I also made provision for the co-option of workers and &mdash; or management side as well.  So, if the workers on the factory <Col N="738" /> floor were involved in the way the Minister has said, his knowledge of the psychology of worker involvement and participation is &ldquo;dead on&rdquo; distinct from the language which was used about the legislation and the mechanics of elections, the committees and the communication.</P>
    <P>We are talking about democracy in industry and by democracy I mean, in any case, openness &mdash; open management in this case, the opening of the books, opening especially of the knowledge that is not retained inside the management files for their professional advisers.  That is what I mean by involvement in decision making.  You cannot make decisions responsibly, you cannot make them intelligently, unless they are based on knowledge. If that knowledge is kept within the closed book of management, the closed book can cause more problems than the closed shop.  Until these books are opened and the workers are sufficiently educated, not only to actively participate but to participate in a way that is meaningful and is based on knowledge, worker involvement does not mean very much, especially to the worker who might become disillusioned and frustrated.</P>
    <P>One of the things that can flow from worker involvement in any enterprise is good industrial relations, but that is not the main objective.  Of course it is a desirable end; it is not the end in itself.  There are many other things that can be discussed inside the worker involvement enterprise experiment.  They can talk about unit costs &mdash; that means talking about efficiency.  They can talk about measurement and that can be a troublesome matter and was a troublesome matter in this country in 1952 when very few on the management side and the trade union side knew very much about it.  Everybody claims they know all about it now, but in 1952 they did not and that is on record.</P>
    <P>I had to face that problem.  One of the ways in which I faced it was that I got management to agree that the workers would become actively involved in anything that was being proposed or drawn up.  I then went about drawing up model <Col N="739" /> rules in the various enterprises where I was meeting this problem and the problems flowing from and related to that specific problem.  I drew up model rules and not only did they discuss unit cost efficiency, they discussed incentives, productivity, quality control, training and retraining, and health and safety measures.</P>
    <P>Again I am adverting to the socialist countries.  In the socialist countries, not only did they discuss educational facilities, medical facilities, and especially preventive medical facilities, but they actually set up the facilities and applied them.  That is worker involvement on an intelligent plane.  That is what I mean by worker involvement.  It is best that it might come from voluntary, model rules, from the factory floor and not from the top down.</P>
    <P>Being a worker director in the sugar company at that time, 1972-73, I was more or less told to prepare myself to carry out pilot schemes inside the sugar company and I did that.  One of the things I did first was address the workers.  I told them that as far as I was concerned they were going to become involved.  The representative method is one method and that did not mean that we could not have factory floor people involved provided we set up a proper communication system inside the plant.  As well as industrial relations having to improve &mdash; I will come back on that &mdash; all these things can be discussed.  Where is there a factory in this country where there are educational facilities, preventive medical facilities, facilities for the enjoyment of leisure pursuits? If I were on the factory floor these are the things I would be pressing for.</P>
    <P>For all strains of management &mdash; I will come to the trade union attitude &mdash; the management attitude in the conflict of interest arena is they cannot see further than their noses and realise that the greatest resource to tap is their own manpower because nobody knows better than a worker the best, the quickest and the most efficient way to do any job from digging turf in the bog to the finest engineering feat at a lathe.  The worker knows <Col N="740" /> the answer and, provided he is given the right to speak or to write suggestion even for a box &mdash; as simple as that &mdash; you have worker involvement.  Could I remind the Seanad, and indeed the public at large, that when the Single European Act is ratified, this will become a very important instrument with which to face what might look, to some people like unbridled competition. I am not saying it is going to be unbridled.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73 when we went into the EC, I was president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I am one of the people who said: &ldquo;We do not want to go into the EC at this stage because we are not ready; we are not against the principle but our industries are not ready&rdquo;.  Fortunately for Ireland we got a breathing space in 1973 and there is no use in whinging that we are not ready now.  It is too bad that we are not ready.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for reminding me of that.  What I am saying is that this Bill, and what is going to be set up under it, will help industry in a lot of ways that we do not see as yet.  It is a good Bill.  What I would like to see following this Bill is that the whole private sector, which is basically the main area of potential development and investment and growth, would actually adopt something on their own voluntary basis which they say they prefer.  They said they would prefer the voluntary basis rather than the legislative one.  What I want them to do is to set up on a voluntary basis any model scheme they can produce.  That will be the test.  In this conflict of interest situation it does not inevitably follow that it has to continue as a conflict of interest for the very simple reason that it is not a conflict of interest on real examination of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the point of production in producing a commodity for the consumer, and likewise in distribution, a service for the people we must establish that management and workers must be partners <Col N="741" /> in that context.  There can be and will be disagreement about the sharing of the wealth so produced through what is called the collective bargaining system.  The disagreements need not necessarily lead to confusion in thinking and the ultimate strike.  When I met young Jim Larkin in 1947 he told me that when you get to a strike situation it means that you as a trade union official have made your contribution to a failure.  I never forgot that lesson &mdash; a strike is a failure in resolving the conflict between the partners &mdash; and they are partners; in any work place, any point of distribution, they must be partners.  The objective is that they both be there together and the place must be managed.  Can you imagine a perfect situation where the workers actually elect management?  That is done in the world too.  Supposing we elected management, that management would still have to manage.  They would still have to give instructions and, provided the worker is sufficiently and intelligently involved in the process, he will understand why the instructions are coming in such a way from management and he has recourse to whatever is laid down in the model rules, if he is offended or they are offended, and he has his trade union.</P>
    <P>I might now come to the trade union attitude.  Anybody who is afraid of change is indicating quite clearly to me that he is afraid of his own ability to control the changes.  That is all that means to me.  There are many cases in history where people did not even know they could control the change, but they took the plunge anyhow.  Perhaps some of the fears we are expressing about the Single European Act may come into that category.  The trade unions are afraid the collective bargaining system might be interfered with and that the structures they have patiently built up could be wrecked.  That fear is not well founded. I am not saying that because I am suggesting to the trade unions for one moment that they should control the workers inside the plant who are taking part and participating.  I would not like that kind of control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Obviously, we must have some influence to exert but I would not like the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; or the idea that workers who are participating on the factory floor at the proper level from the bottom up should be under any kind of control.  That could be dangerous.  The workers must understand what their trade union policy is.  They must not subvert it and they must not do anything that would interfere with it.  I do not see the possibility and, therefore, the fear is unfounded of the collective bargaining system being set aside or seriously hurt by worker participation models such as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I said, provides leadership. We in this country, management and trade unions, have not acted with sufficient appreciation of what needs to be done in the area of worker involvement and participation.  While the Bill is welcome for the distance it goes, the language used and the edifice and structures it sets up for the election of the bodies and so on, it simply must be regarded as a headline.  It is going in the right direction &mdash; down towards the factory floor.  I would like to see all public and private establishments, enterprises and whatever we have, taking on board the basic idea, applying the principle and implementing it along the lines I have indicated and the Minister has indicated and the lines Senator Hillery and Senator Higgins have clearly indicated.  We might then be ready for the competition which might come out of Europe.</P>
    <P>Trade unions are, I think, very nearly at the point of having a look at their traditions and ideas.  The trade union movement in Ireland aims at efficiency to the best of their ability.  That must be said about them.  While many of them did not understand in 1952 what work measurement was about, when it was revealed to them that it was good for industry, for workers, for incentive measurement, they opted for it.  They have done their best to broaden the industrial base, to provide an industrial relations picture or scenario so that actually the potential investor would not be worried.  The big thing is the lack of investment.  If this Bill in its operation <Col N="743" /> makes that kind of contribution, it is a very good Bill from that point of view also.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill and on the details of it and his grasp of the psychology of real industrial democracy and especially on how he spells out participation and the involvement of the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not keep the House long with the few points I would like to make.  I note the report of the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation and that the Minister is adding to the number of State enterprises included for worker participation.  One of them, in particular, is Aer Rianta.  In the Cork area we suffered more than anybody else perhaps over the last few years through the problem of people losing their employment. It is not pleasant to have a situation where many people at the one time are losing their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the previous speakers' remarks on worker participation.  I sometimes wonder &mdash; I suppose there is a certain amount of truth in it &mdash; whether there is a lot of theory in it rather than action and practice.  I do not see it operating in many areas.  I was visiting a trade union official's office some time ago and I thought we were preparing for an early general election because many faces were displayed with big print naming people seeking to be elected to the board of a State body.  If worker participation means people are going to advertise in a big way and, indeed, spend in a big way, to make sure they get back on a particular body, the impression created among the general body of workers is that there is something in it for these people only.  I do not like that.  That impression was created in Cork where there was advertising for a position on the board of CIE through worker participation.  There were lovely photographs with fine big print and they certainly were not made for a few bob or, for that matter, for a few pounds.  When you see that happening &mdash; as a worker it struck me quite hard &mdash; you get the impression straight away that there is something in it for this person.  Is <Col N="744" /> it working out so that this person, if he does get on the board of CIE, is going to have more than everybody else?  When I checked out the facts the answer was, yes.  At the end of the day, whether that person on that board and the workers on the board have done anything better for the vast majority of workers is questionable.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see on page 42, section 119 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation a reference to something I think could bring about a better position for all the workers.  The previous speaker made a very important point and I did see it exemplified, sadly in the Cork area over the last few years, where many jobs were lost because of the non-involvement of workers and the attitude of management in failing to pass down information.  I feel these jobs should not have been lost.  If the workers were kept involved in the ongoing situation, it could be emphasised that if the plant were to go we might rationalise rather than eliminate.  We might point out what we would have in five or ten year's time.  Nothing like that is going on anywhere that I know of. Aer Rianta are now being added to these State bodies and Aer Rianta last year made something in the region of £11.2 million.</P>
    <P>Our State bodies are often &ldquo;knocked&rdquo;. Where bodies like Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and, in particular, CIE are getting a world of abuse from the general public and, I suppose, on many occasions rightly so.  I am speaking here only for myself.  I worked for CIE for 11 years.  The vast majority of workers in CIE just could not care a damn and these are the facts, whether we like it or not.  The impression is given that whether they like it or not, or whether we like it or not, the job is there anyway.</P>
    <P>When can we say that shares should be given to workers?  In CIE it would be hard, but in Aer Rianta it would not be half so hard, or in other State bodies, for example, Irish Steel where much money was spent over the past few years.  Shares could be given to workers rather than have participation by a particular group. <Col N="745" /> Why can we not say to the workforce, if we are so confident or if there are so many excellent people on a committee set up by the Minister to come in with a report on development and worker participation, that this will be done?  Why was the ball not put in the court and the workers told: If we want to keep this company together, let both of us invest. I know of a private concern in the Cork area where shares are allocated to workers over a period, a certain number of shares or a certain amount of money, and that company has gone from strength to strength.  There is never a problem, never any disputes or shortage of money and there is certainly no discontent felt by anybody.</P>
    <P>An example like that, I feel, could be followed in Aer Rianta.  Are we going to say at this stage to the workers in Aer Rianta that if all of us together, management and workforce and Government get our act together so as to be competitive against everybody else in Europe and in the world, this is what it is worth to you if things go well?  But this is not being said.  It is being said to the few. &ldquo;Get on the board and make sure discussions go on and say we look after people who are sick and so on.&rdquo;  The concept in many of these situations is good.  Much of it, whether we like it or not, is theory and I do not see it working in practice.</P>
    <P>I have seen in my area more than in any other area the dilapidation in places in a very short period of time where many workers had been working and are now idle.  We have an area in Cork where you could throw a bowl &mdash; the Marina &mdash; and no more than three years ago we were talking about 4,000 extra people working in that area.  Now they are gone.  Participation, proper discussion and, probably, proper negotiations could have brought about a rationalisation programme.</P>
    <P>I am very embarrassed and I am certainly not proud of the fact that £25.5 million was spent to eliminate 800 workers in Cork city.  That is immoral in my eyes.  All belonging to me are trade <Col N="746" /> unionists.  I would not say as a trade union official that we must eliminate a company because it is worth so much to us.  That is exactly what happened.  They can say what they like but the management in this company were wrong to a point because proper negotiations did not go on.  If we had sold the idea of a rationalised programme rather than an elimination programme probably 400 people would be still working.  About £10 million could have been spent on the elimination of 400 workers and £15 million on updating the plant.  That is proper thinking.  Why is this not happening?</P>
    <P>There are other areas where we bawl about many plants, companies like Irish Steel, and State bodies in liquidation having money pumped into them.  Up to last year Irish Steel made a profit for the last three or four months.  What the Minister is saying is excellent in some areas but there are other areas where it is not going to work.  Let us not just put up the carrot but the whole bunch of carrots and say: &ldquo;This is what it is worth at the end of the day provided you do this, that and other.&rdquo;  We are not doing that.  We are not showing any example to workers or management.  We are not showing any example to our State bodies either.  In private sector companies in Cork where shareholders and workers are involved get their share capital or bonuses back every year because the companies are doing well.  Everybody is involved because people are spending money on Friday.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we cannot tell the workers in Irish Steel that there are shares available which they can purchase. That would be much better than worker participation.  The person who is advertising in a trade union office because he wants to get on a State body does not interest me.  Like all politicians he is dedicated. I see no reason why we cannot say to the workforce in Aer Rianta that we will give them shares.  They made a profit of £11.2 last year and I understand they are doing better this year thanks to the prices at their local duty free shops.  That is the area we can get workers involved in, especially in State bodies, by offering <Col N="747" /> them £5 or £7 a week.  That also applies to people on part time work who work more than 18 hours a week.  There is no reason why we should not tell them they can participate.  The general impression is that worker participation is there for the few.  I advocated two years ago when we were allocating something like £12.5 million to Irish Steel that we should implement a scheme of shares in Irish Steel.  The Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, had no objection to it.  I do not know whether the board have to put it before the workers of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>These are my ideas on worker participation where the workforce are totally committed.  The proof is in the pudding in the Cork area where shares have been given out by private companies.  The companies have gone from strength to strength and there are no problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I would like to make to the Minister in the consideration of this Bill.  It is a complex piece of legislation which obviously will have to be considered in great detail on Committee Stage and I look forward to doing that.  I will confine myself broadly to the principles the Minister has outlined both in the very fine explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill and also in the Second Stage speech which the Minister made here.</P>
      <P>There is one area of worker participation in the State sector in respect of which the Minister and myself are in fundamental disagreement.  I will come to that later.  There is a large area in which we are in agreement and I should emphasise that this large area of agreement exists.  I am firmly of the belief that commercial undertakings of all kind, both State and private, will in the long run benefit from the participation to the greatest possible extent of workers in the running of these enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain category of non-commercial undertakings to which that might also apply.  I am, however, unable to produce a definition which would satisfy both the Minister and myself with <Col N="748" /> regard to the areas in which such participation makes sense.  This is where I find myself in some disagreement with the Minister.  There is a problem with regard to definition which I think the Minister also appreciates.  The Minister in his speech makes the following pronouncement:</P>
    <P>In this Bill I am extending arrangements for worker director elections to three further State enterprises.  As I already mentioned these are Aer Rianta, An Foras Forbartha and the National Rehabilitation Board.  Two of these bodies are State enterprises whose purpose is non-commercial in nature.  I have decided that there are no grounds for restricting the election of worker directors to State bodies of a commercial or quasi-commercial character.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is no automatic reason just because something is not commercial that there should be no worker directors.  There is a category of organisation in which worker directors should play little or no part.  For example, one would not suggest that the workers in Leinster House should be able to nominate members directly to the Dáil and Seanad.  There are bodies which, of their nature, are representive themselves where the nomination by those whose duty it is to work in the enterprises of some of the &ldquo;boards of directors&rdquo; would not make much sense.  I am doubtful whether many of the companies included in Part III of the First Schedule could be usefully included in the group of people where worker directors would form a useful part.  I realise, of course, the fact that they are in part III means, for the time being, they are not included in that Schedule.  There has been a certain amount of movement from Part III to Part II with regard to Aer Rianta, An Foras Forbartha and the National Rehabilitation Board.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the workers in the Central Bank, for example, have any useful contribution to make as directors of the Central Bank?  There are many <Col N="749" /> other examples like that where the service which is being provided is essentially a community service and where the interests of the staff may be directly opposite to the interest of the community at large.  In those circumstances we have to be very careful about putting these people as staff representatives in great numbers or at all, perhaps, on the boards of bodies like this.</P>
    <P>RTE is another example.  I have no objection to any person working in RTE being nominated a director of RTE but in an organisation like RTE there is a clear difference between the public interest and the staff interest.  They are not necessarily the same.  It is important, when you are providing a service of that kind and character that that distinction should be recognised and appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister might share with us when replying on the Second Stage the reason he believes An Foras Forbartha should be included in the Schedule.  An Foras Forbartha is a body, the purpose of which is to supervise the making of various physical plans and to establish various criteria to aid the Minister and the various public bodies throughout the country in their physical planning.  I wonder how the staff of that organisation fit into something which is essentially national in character and where the interests of the staff of An Foras Forbartha might be very different from the interests which the organisation as an entity wish to serve?  I do not know enough about the National Rehabilitation Board to be able to say anything about them but I suspect that it is quasi-commercial in character.  There is a commercial dimension to it which does not excite me.  The question of Aer Rianta is a matter I leave to the Minister. I wish over a period of time to contribute towards preserving a situation where we categorise public sector companies differently and where we recognise that in certain cases the interests of the community may be in conflict with the interest, of those who are working there. I want to preserve that situation and recognise that limitation in the exercise we are carrying out.</P>
    <P>I know that in the State bodies where <Col N="750" /> worker directors have participated over the last few years and have been elected many of the outside directors and the non-worker directors are fairly frustrated with the attitude of worker directors.  In a number of cases they feel that the working directors allow their interests as trade union representatives, to outweigh their other duties and responsibilities.  I am not very worried about this because in the long run it is a developing process.  It is something which over a period of time, is going to establish itself.  There is a problem with worker directors where something is in discussion at the board of directors which is of considerable importance to the members of a particular trade union or to the people working in the company.  It is only because these discussions are taking place in secret that there is pressure put on the worker directors which they respond to in different ways.  In some cases they keep quiet about it and in other cases they let the cat out of the bag fairly quickly.  I do not mind them letting the cat out of the bag in cases like that.  The conflict, which undoubtedly exists between themselves as workers and representatives of the workers on the one hand, and as parts of the corporate identity, which is the board of directors, on the other hand, will over a period of time sort itself out.  They have sorted themselves out in other countries and I have no reason to suppose they will not sort themselves out in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remaining portion of the Bill and the enabling portion of the legislation &mdash; that is the portion of the legislation which deals with the establishment of what is inelegantly called: &ldquo;sub-board participation arrangements&rdquo;&mdash; that is something which is certainly worth enacting.  I wonder in the long run how widely used it will be?  I look forward to an assessment by a committee, like the advisory committee on worker participation who produced such an excellent report.  I would like an assessment by that committee after a period of four, five or six years to see how these sub-board arrangements have worked.  There may be a reluctance to participate in these arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> I welcome the Bill in general and assure the Minister that on Committee Stage we will examine it on a section by section basis.  We will go in greater detail into the various powers that are being given to the Minister and to the other organs of State in this matter.  I will be pleased to support the Bill at the end of Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to extend my appreciation to the House for both the courtesy and the welcome that has been extended to this legislation and for your co-operation in enabling me to conclude Second Stage. Committee Stage will enable us to go into greater length on many of the points that have been raised.  I am conscious of the time that is available to me now.</P>
      <P>No one piece of legislation can be, and certainly is not proposed by me to be, a comprehensive panacea for the problems of economic growth or for labour management relations.  We have made some progress in the general area and what are required, in no particular order of priority, because they are interconnected, is worker participation both within the State sector and in the private sector, too, we hope, a modernisation of our Companies Acts in the broader sense of the word, the taking on board of some of the new measures that are emanating from Brussels, including specifically the question of access to information and the sharing of information both for the public at large and for participants within companies and, finally, modernisation of industrial relations legislation and procedures. I am not coming to this House with this Bill suggesting that this of itself will solve all the problems in the State sector.  That would be a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record my regret at the delay which was properly voiced by Senator Hillery in his opening and welcoming comments from the Opposition. The delay is deeply regretted by myself politically.  It is regretted because of the wear and tear on the intellectual and physical resources of the staff in the Department of Labour and in the Bills <Col N="752" /> office who have been worrying this through.  Largely, because of its complexity one would think that the measure to be extended the 1977 Act and to provide a mechanism for appropriate sub-board structures is pretty much a straightforward measure.  The complexity of the legislation was not willed upon by some Byzantine mandarin desire to produce complex puzzles called legislation but was the product of what became necessary. The alternative would have been three or four separate legislative measures which I do not think any of us would have wanted.  There is an attempt at consolidation in this legislation.  I apologise for its complexity but it was not voluntarily offered.</P>
    <P>The general remarks made centre round a number of points.  I will try to deal with them in general terms without going into the specifics of individual contributions but I will refer to them where they have arisen.  The premiss of participation rests on the belief that everybody in an enterprise has a contribution to make.  The very fact that an employer hired that person in the first instance is a recognition that they have a contribution to make.  As Senator McGonagle said, the person at the coalface doing whatever skilled job happens to be required of any nature has a view as to how good that job can be done and how better it can be done if anybody wants to come and ask him.  It does not necessarily mean that the person on the lathe wants to be managing director.  It does mean that the person on the lathe might have a better view as to how that expensive piece of machinery could be used all of the time instead of some of the time.  Tragically in many cases, we have not had a system that asked that person the question which they wanted to have asked of them.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, and it was referred to by others, we came late to industrialisation.  We inherited the Victorian attitudes of adversarial conflict between worker and employer.  They are inappropriate in a State company sector where the communal interest of the management and worker is similar.  We need <Col N="753" /> to develop within the State sector a participatory structure, not only on the commercial side, but right through the entire array of semi-State companies because the way in which people make their contribution, and the productivity of that contribution, very much depend on whether they are being utilised to maximum capacity, if one wants to maintain an engineering or a mechanical analysis.</P>
    <P>I do not think that our experience to date would show that relying entirely on a voluntarist tradition which, of its nature, produces a system whereby information would flow from top to bottom, or that workers in a particular area would be asked what their view was on how best to achieve a management objective is the best course.  There is no evidence to suggest, despite the protestations of the FUE of their belief in voluntarism, that members of the FUE have come forward in any significant degree with a voluntarist system.  As Senator Cregan already indicated, in those small tentative companies where that has occurred, those companies have been the beneficiaries of that kind of participation.  This legislation is designed to provide a framework which will act as an impetus on the one hand and not as a prescriptive straitjacket on the other.  In trying to strike that balance we have ended up with family complex legislation to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>There were some specific points made and I shall relate to them.  There is no conflict in what Senator Cregan said about having elected worker directors and having full participation by all of the participants in an enterprise, be it as large and as monopolistic as CIE, although in reality it is not all that monopolistic because there are many competing modes of transport for that company, be it rail, freight, or road passenger.  There is a need to motivate people and you can do this by giving the kind of remuneration they require or giving them a sense of being involved in a process that takes account of their own knowledge and skills.</P>
    <P>Hopefully the reorganisation of CIE <Col N="754" /> about which this House had a long and substantial debate will provide a framework within which management can achieve some of the objectives that will motivate people.  If you look at the motivation of a company like Aer Rianta who have an exclusive monopoly of the services they provide as distinct from CIE, the difference in the motivation and the performance of the workforce in different conditions and locations to that of other State companies cannot be attributed to the legal framework within which they operate.  Clearly there is a factor of management at work and management on both sides &mdash; the management of the workforce by the trade unions involved in the sense that they represent them, and the management of the enterprise by management itself.</P>
    <P>As I said in my introductory comments, this is not a panacea.  There are other factors which will have to be taken into account in the exercise of industrial relations and economic growth.  We have excluded a number of companies &mdash; and reference was made to this by Senator Hillery &mdash; from our original intentions. The VHI have been excluded because the Minister for Health has appointed a worker director directly and there is revised legislation coming through with regard to the VHI.  It was felt appropriate not to put them up immediately in the present context, but to wait until the new legislation was in place.  Irish Steel have been experiencing difficulties and the Government have decided to defer the question of extending the arrangements to these enterprises.  However, the Bill allows, when the matter of their current difficulties has settled down and been resolved, with the agreement of the Minister concerned, for the worker participation provisions to be extended to those companies.</P>
    <P>The question of confidentiality and conflict of interest has been raised in recent times, particularly in management circles, with regard to worker directors. It is amazing how people always say there is a conflict of interest for a worker director to be on a board of a public company, <Col N="755" /> particularly a large commercial semi-State one, or a non-commercial semi-State one.  Nobody seems to worry about the potential conflict of interest that might arise in relation to directors who have been appointed by successive Governments.  In many cases there are potential conflicts of interest with regard to the activities of those companies.  I recall, and I am subject to correction, that for many years a representative of the beet growers was appointed to the board of the sugar company.  Clearly, there was a potential conflict of interest here in the sense that this person was representing, in a very formal capacity, a major supplier to a company who was effectively the only purchaser and, therefore, matters relating to the price of beet was something that could cause a conflict of interest.  We will not avoid the difficulties of conflict of interest in any human society unless we recognise that we are human and that there is a potential conflict of interest for everybody who participates in any activity and that the only safeguard to avoid abuses of that conflict of interest is to have proper and adequate information.</P>
    <P>This is why we have required in this legislation that one of the provisions will be that the semi-State companies will have to give a report in their annual accounts each year of how they have been promoting the concept of information exchange and participation at the appropriate level.  I agree with what Senator O'Leary said in relation to the necessity to review this process.  There is no guarantee that because the idea appears to be good in theory, as Senator Cregan said, it may automatically work.  In all probability it will work very unevenly because the motivation or the personalities of people at particular points in time in different enterprises will vary in such a way as to perhaps show little or no interest in some companies but a very active interest in another.  For example, the management of Aer Rianta have expressed concern to me on a number of occasions at the delay in the introduction of this legislation because of their desire <Col N="756" /> to proceed with the sub-board structures. They have virtually anticipated the legislation because they have moved ahead on a number of fronts.  That is clearly a function of personal motivation on behalf of the management and the unions participating in that company and not a question of legislation on its own.</P>
    <P>Legislation, as I think the House will agree can only provide a just and orderly framework within which human activity and human relations can be conducted. It cannot determine totally or absolutely the outcome of those relations.  For the reasons that Senator O'Leary raised, it would be very useful that we should have a review.  We have people in the universities and in the RTCs and elsewhere who can do it in a scientific and productive manner.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake to confine worker directors exclusively to the commercial semi-State companies.  The economic activity indirectly related to the work that is done by many non-commercial semi-State companies has enormous potential. The skills and general education levels of workers throughout the entire workforce, particularly in many of those enterprises, require that the way in which they are asked to contribute their skills and the method of delivery of those skills is as important a factor as the elaborate procedures of qualification, interview and selection we have established to hire them in the first instance.  It seems a contradiction to go through one very elaborate process of selection and then to ignore, in many cases, the capabilities of these people to decide how best the work can be done.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank Senators for the general welcome that has been given to the legislation and to express my agreement with their regret at the delay which has occurred.  I have given an explanation as to why the delay was there and the House, when it goes into Committee, will recognise the legitimacy of that explanation.  We have created, on balance, something that is particular to our own economic and social culture and which is not borrowed from <Col N="757" /> somewhere else.  We should draw confidence and strength from this experience to-date and extend it, where appropriate, in the areas of the broad public sector where it can have a positive effect.  In doing this, the House is interacting correctly with the broad public sector.  We are providing a framework within which these things must happen, but we are not providing a strait jacket which states: &ldquo;Not only must these things happen, but they can only happen in a particular way&rdquo;.  The very principle of participation is that people should be urged to participate but the way in which they do so and the methodology of it clearly, by definition, must in the final analysis belong to them and not to this House. This is why we have done this in this manner.  I thank Senators very much for their support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  That it is expedient in view of the importance of allowing the maximum public participation, political accountability on such issues, for example, as the need to reaffirm the principle of neutrality of Ireland in international affairs and to declare that Ireland's foreign and defence policies continue <Col N="758" /> to be based on this principle, demilitarisation, and development strategy and providing an opportunity for debate in the foreign affairs of the State that a Joint Committee (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Foreign Policy) consisting of seven Members of Seanad Éireann and eight Members of Dáil Éireann be appointed to review, examine and report to each House with its recommendations on all aspects of foreign policy of the State.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to appoint sub-committees and to refer to such sub-committees any matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution.</P>
    <P>(3)  That provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members of the Joint Committee or each sub-committee who are unable to attend particular meetings.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(5)  That all questions in the Joint Committee and in each sub-committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular inquiries.</P>
    <P>(7)  That any Member of either House may attend and be heard in the proceedings of the Joint Committee or in each sub-committee without having a right to vote, subject to the prior consent of the Joint Committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(8)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it <Col N="759" /> together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every report of the Joint Committee shall on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(10)  That no document relating to matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution received by the clerk to the Joint Committee or to each sub-committee shall be withdrawn or altered without the knowledge and approval of the Joint committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(11)  That the quorum of the Joint Committee shall be four of whom at least one shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and one shall be a Member of Dáil Éireann and that the quorum of each sub-committee shall be three at least one of whom shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and one a Member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Tugann sé áthas mór dom an Rún seo a mholadh, atá curtha síos in ainmneacha na Seanadóirí atá ina mbaill de phairtí An Lucht Oibre.</P>
    <P>In moving this resolution I think we could not have a more appropriate day. On the one hand it is International Human Rights day and, on the other hand, it is also the day on which the other House is moving towards concluding its consideration of the Single European Act.  The inter-purpose of this motion is:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient in view of the importance of allowing the maximum public participation, political accountability on such issues, for example, as the need to reaffirm the principle of neutrality of Ireland in international affairs and to declare that Ireland's foreign and defence policies continue to be based on this principle, demilitarisation, and development strategy and providing an opportunity for debate in the foreign affairs of the State that a Joint Committee (which shall be <Col N="760" /> called the Joint Committee on Foreign Policy) consisting of seven Members of Seanad Éireann and eight Members of Dáil Éireann be appointed to review, examine and report to each House with its recommendations on all aspects of foreign policy of the State.</P>
    <P>The rest of the resolution is mainly technical but paragraph (6) is important in so far as, drawing on our experience of committees in this House, it suggests the giving to such a committee a number of powers which would get over obstacles that have arisen in practice in the operation of some other committees.  Paragraph (6) states:</P>
    <P>That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular inquiries.</P>
    <P>There are 11 paragraphs in the motion. Paragraph (10) is equally important because it equally extends the powers of committees.  It reads:</P>
    <P>That no document relating to matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution received by the clerk to the Joint Committee or to each sub-committee shall be withdrawn or altered without the knowledge and approval of the Joint Committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>This effectively gives a discretion to the committee to decide matters about which it should concern itself.</P>
    <P>I want to flesh out some of the reasons why this motion has been placed before the House and in doing so I want to explain some of the basic principles initially.  The important point about there being maximum public participation and political accountability in foreign policy has been adverted to in practically every parliamentary assembly I know of in Europe.  Perhaps the most radical expression of this is in the case of Denmark where elements of foreign <Col N="761" /> policy are initiated in the assembly and thereafter go on to be executed by the professionals who execute Danish foreign policy.  We are far short of that.  We are at the other end of the spectrum.  We are out of step in relation to many countries in Europe in not having a full joint committee on foreign policy, as exists in the British House of Commons.  I believe there should be support now for achieving the establishment of this committee.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;the maximum public participation&rdquo; again and again in my time as spokesman for foreign affairs of the Labour Party, the point has been raised by many people who write to me and ask what is Ireland's position on one matter or another, be it on apartheid, on a vote at the United Nations, on the position we were taking in relation to Europe and so forth.  I have often tried to explain to them the logic behind a particular position taken and sometimes &mdash; in fact quite frequently &mdash; I have been unable to explain why we voted, abstained or opposed a particular matter.  I regard that as setting a tension inevitably between two quite different things which have been discussed in other countries and which arise in the inevitable evolution of parliaments, that is, the distinction between the practice of diplomacy which is, of its nature, secret and the execution of foreign policy which responds to the moral temper of the people.  For example, there is no doubt in my mind that there is a generous response to breaches of human rights, not only in Ireland but universally.  I am very conscious of that.  The evidence for this lies in the fact that many countries seek to abuse the concept of human rights and use it as a term of abuse, one against the other.  Equally in relation to racism, there is a common position now in Ireland, thankfully, that opposes apartheid.  In relation to development aid, people are moved by the appalling scenes that are presented on their television sets which show horrific circumstances of death.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of this motion, therefore, is to allow that moral response and the concern that exists in the foreign <Col N="762" /> policy area, in the great areas I mentioned. There are questions such as what is our contribution in prosecuting positive neutrality?  What do we mean by it?  I used the term in the motion &ldquo;the principle of neutrality&rdquo;.  I am speaking about positive neutrality.  I am not interested in hedged phrases, such as remaining neutral in matters of military importance or matters of military significance.  That is a condition I do not apply to neutrality. Here, I am drawing on a long tradition which goes back to Tom Johnson, which goes right through all of the leaders of the Labour Party, including one of my predecessors as spokesman on Foreign Affairs and as Chairman of the Labour Party, Michael Keys, of Limerick, who spoke about neutrality being important as a major contribution towards making wars impossible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the neutrality I am speaking of is not conditional in the sense of being available as a negotiating point for the unification of this country, or conditional in another sense when this extraordinary phrase is use, that we are on the one hand militarily neutral but not ideologically neutral.  Ideological neutrality is left usually without the specification in geographical terms as to where it is assumed freedom lies, what the definition of democracy is, and so forth.</P>
    <P>All of these issues such as questions of neutrality and the other great topics I mentioned should be debated.  I make reference to demilitarisation and to development strategy in particular.  Here all of us have been appalled by the enormous wastage of human and physical resources in the war effort.  Should our response stop at being a moral one?  I am not arguing that these moral expressed opinions do not translate into political practice.  What I am saying is that there is a need for an integration in our policy and that integration will be provided when voluntary and expert agencies will have a committee &mdash; as exists in other parliaments, I emphasise &mdash; to which to come and offer their evidence and indicate their support.</P>
    <P>I said previously it is easy to move people by telling them such facts as that <Col N="763" /> 40,000 children die every day from malnutrition, most of them under the age of one year and, for every one of those children who die, six will live in conditions of chronic poverty condemned to blindness, illness, illiteracy, hunger and lack of shelter in this developing world or that before the end of the century we will have comdemned 650 million or 700 million people to conditions of malnutrition. These are facts which move people instantly.  Equally so do facts on armaments &mdash; that one scientist in five will spend his or her intellectual energies in the war effort while, at the same time, there are crying needs in the development area.  It is not possible to prosecute the project of peace and demilitarisation without its being linked to development. I think we would agree on that.</P>
    <P>It is not possible either to have a moral response at home and not have it reflected overtly in foreign policy in terms of a required political response.  I am very worried about a number of aspects that bother me in this regard.  A number of injurious fractures have arisen in relation to some of these issues.  May I just cite some of them?  In relation to the issue of neutrality itself, how is neutrality balanced with the requirements of our industrialisation policies?  I wish it was not balanced at all, that there was never a condition placed on it.  I know from my own experience on many occasions in the past when those of us in this House who believed in peace took a position that was critical of some of the major investors in this country, the messages came quietly but regularly to elected representatives in this House and in the other House that we should draw in our horns, that it was not the time to speak of human rights in Nicaragua; it was not the time to speak of the ignoring of the International Court of Justice at the Hague; nor was it the time to speak of armed mercenaries.  Yet the facts of these breaches explode on our television screens.</P>
    <P>If we have a policy it should be an integrated one.  That is my simple plea.  I cannot for the life of me see any evidence <Col N="764" /> of how we can achieve this as parliamentarians, not to speak of members of the public.  You might say &mdash; and I do not want my case to fall on this one &mdash; there is a committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities who deal with some matters which are relevant.  I was a member of that committee when it was originally established.  When the committee reported as it did in the past on the Dooge Report and others, we had an opportunity for some debate.  That is not what I have in mind.  The terms of reference of the committee I am suggesting enable them to address the issue of foreign policy in the broadest sense.  When one looks at the conditions I have laid down in paragraphs 2 to 11 I want the committee in establishing such powers to draw on the experience of other committees.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the establishment of the committee system in this House but I said at the time that the committee system must be given teeth.  It is very interesting to note that when the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Procedure) Bill, 1976, establishing the committee system was introduced in its initial form, it contained a section which would give power to committees to summon witnesses by letters delivered to them personally by registered post, to examine witnesses and require witnesses to be present and so forth.  Equally I argue that we need to go much further than that and enable witnesses to come and enjoy privilege before the committee so that the committee may be able to do its work to the fullest extent possible. When we think of the Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies there were occasions on which witnesses did not come.  There are occasions when the committees can be manipulated by the non-availability of a Minister of the day.  It is, therefore, terribly important that the committee that is established has the powers I mention.</P>
    <P>When I was drafting this resolution I looked at the experience of other countries where the committee system has been established and there is a commitment to it.  The members who serve <Col N="765" /> that committee are professionals, independent of the process of government. This is the norm in many countries, the idea being that the Parliament itself will be able to enjoy a full and unrestricted scrutiny of what is the regular practice of the Government of the day.  That is a full committee system.  I am putting that provision contained in the document prepared in 1976 in its original form back in and suggesting that this committee has that power.</P>
    <P>There will be enormous advantages to this committee.  Among these will be that it will be able to draw on the great anxiety that exists at present for political education which will include aspects fo foreign policy.  The proceedings of this committee will be studied by people in places where foreign policy, thankfully, is becoming a matter of great interest.  If one looks at the published works on the history of Irish foreign policy, one finds that people have pointed out that it has been necessary on occasions for people interested in foreign policy to sneak in and out of the country in case people found they were missing from their constituencies. Thankfully, those days are changing.  Our eyes have been opened as the media have opened the windows of the world exposing us to the realities of war, the needs of development, the hunger I described and the great challenges that face us.  There is a new atmosphere now and we should take advantage of it and make foreign policy a matter of regular and vibrant debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The existence of the committee is absolutely essential in this regard.</P>
    <P>For instance, we should resolve the issue of neutrality once and for all.  I admire the work of the Royal Irish Academy but I recall their debate on neutrality. Unfortunately I have not had the pleasure of making a contribution to the group in relation to any aspect of foreign policy but I look forward to doing this in the future.  Their discussion on neutrality was very interesting but it was all somewhat tendentious.  If the papers that were read on that occasion were presented to a foreign policy committee we would all <Col N="766" /> benefit, we would have a full discussion, we would be able to talk about the quality of evidence, what was a matter of comjecture and what was a matter of fact.</P>
    <P>If Members of this House need one example above all else in favour of what I am saying, would they not agree that the atmosphere in which the Single European Act has been discussed in this country vindicates the establishment of a committee? I read with great care the document produced by the Government on the Single European Act and the explanatory guide.  I have read other articles on the Single European Act.  I have been interested in trying to tease out the implications in relation to the three great principles that are a matter of debate &mdash; the question of neutrality, military and defence alliance, the implications of the single market and the protection of employment, and the question as to whether, having removed all tariffs, you can do what has never happened in history: restructure competition so as to give away benefits to the peripheral regions. I want to be convinced and I feel that a committee like this might enable us to hear all the arguments.  Let us have them fully and let us leave them unemotionally.</P>
    <P>On that issue I would like to see the committee begin by taking up the first of those.  It might come to the conclusion &mdash; a conclusion which my party favour &mdash; that the position of neutrality be given a legal basis, that it be put into the Constitution. I am very conscious that we are on the eve of debating the 50th anniversary of the 1937 Constitution and I have long said that it is not a Constitution that we should lug around on our shoulders for ever.  There is not a specific provision for equality of men and women in that Constitution.  Be that as it may, I believe we should discuss the appropriateness or otherwise of a constitutional affirmation of our position on neutrality.</P>
    <P>When I was a Member of the other House and I sought information as to why we voted on particular matters, I was not always able, as an elected representative, to find that information.  As in so many other things, there has grown up in Ireland what I would call the fallacy of <Col N="767" /> expertise.  The suggestion is often made that expertise in some matters arises in practice and that practice is governed by criteria of pragmatism.  What I am saying is that we are surrounded by an anxiety which is based on idealism by many people to understand and participate in a world made safe against war, a world of peace where the issues of development will be applied.  I am not arguing against pragmatism.  I am simply an old-fashioned logician.</P>
    <P>I believe I was elected here to discuss foreign policy and that the other House has elected Members to discuss foreign policy.  It should be debated in these Houses and on a complex matter this committee should exist and we should attend it with seven Members from the Seanad and eight Members from the Dáil.  We should let experts come and we should let professionals come and we should see what our policy is.  We should let the public have the full view of why we hold particular views on any matter. I cannot see how anybody can be afraid of this process.  Of course, the response will be that the matters discussed are often so delicate and the nuances are so great that really one could not trust people to know what it is that we are achieving.</P>
    <P>I have so often read the phrase, &ldquo;We have explained to our partners our feelings on this matter and we are working towards a position&rdquo; and so on.  I am sure much of moral significance has been achieved in this regard, and I would not want to endanger any of it, but I am not going to pay the price of not having accountability on foreign policy for such a process. I feel a little irritated this evening about that matter.  I am very angry at the manner in which some of the aspects of European political co-operation have been discussed in the last year or two. We had an opportunity to look at some aspects of it here when the reports came from the Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities but it was hardly full enough, for example, in relation to the single market and the meaning of terms like &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo;<Col N="768" /> and so forth.  I would have liked a much fuller debate on all of that.</P>
    <P>There are many matters outside of Europe.  There is the business of our attitude towards issues that arise in Africa. There was a long saga as to what the Government's position was in relation to South Africa.  There is the question that arises in relation to Nicaragua.  I am not in the business of meeting people at the airport, bringing them in and managing to have them received by officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs to whom I am extremely grateful.  My point about it is that I would like to discuss the events that are taking place, for example, the hiring of mercenaries, the question of the displacement of funds.  In the absence of this committee I am left open to the charge that has unfortunately been made against people like me before, that people are weary of listening to anti-American speeches and so forth.  I am not making those speeches but I feel that as a parliamentarian I am entitled to enjoy the mechanisms of the majority of Parliaments, that is, by having a committee who would deal with these matters and would discuss them.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the amendment which, I am afraid, I would ask the movers to consider withdrawing. I think it would be unacceptable for a reason that perhaps was unintended.  The amendment suggests the deletion of all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo;.  In doing so it deletes the first part of paragraph 1.  It deletes even the reference to the maximum public participation, political accountability, the reference to neutrality, to foreign and defence policies based on the principle of neutrality, demilitarisation and development strategy.  That is not left in in the amendment and, knowing the generosity of my colleagues on this side of the House, this is probably an oversight.  I presume that their amendment was probably more directed to the structure of the committee.  The amendment suggests that:</P>
    <P>Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that <Col N="769" /> consideration be given to the establishment of a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in order to promote as wide a consensus as possible on all matters of Foreign Policy and that informal all-party discussions be initiated to discuss the terms of reference, the structure and the procedures of the proposed Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>That formulation would do credit to Sir Humphrey because it not only stops us from doing something in the lifetime of this Government, it also involves us in a process of consultation that would so erode everything that is aimed for in the motion that with the greatest respect I suggest it is not likely to amend or approve the basic motion and reluctantly, I would have to say it is not acceptable either to myself or to the group for whom I speak.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have support from all sides of the House for the kind of committee I mention.  It is now likely that the Single European Act will be ratified.  Do the Members of the House not agree that the existence of this committee will be even more necessary in those circumstances than it is now?  Surely in relation to all of the issues that I have mentioned, for example, if you take the welding together of common positions even in relation to development, will that not be necessary to be considered by such a committee?  What about the increasingly difficult circumstances of retaining our neutrality in practice?  In that regard I hope the committee will flush out something that is becoming a little wearisome. There are different views on neutrality. There are those who believe in positive neutrality, and there are those who do not believe in it at all.  To their credit they have been speaking out lately.  They said this whole thing is quite meaningless.  I want to hear the views of people as to whether it is useful for a while, or it is conditional, or so forth.  That debate should take place.  Otherwise we are in danger of eroding democracy and Parliament itself, using language that is <Col N="770" /> devoid of content and is devoid of some commitment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the entire thrust of this motion is to try, while allowing professional practice within the diplomatic realm, to restore the position of Parliament, to allow parliamentarians to debate foreign policy, to allow the public to see parliamentarians debating policy which reflects and responds to the values they hold and the concerns they have. Once the policy has been decided it should be executed with the professionalism which has always been of an enormously high standard within our Department of Foreign Affairs for which I have the greatest respect.</P>
    <P>If we do not do this, not only will the process be secret, not accessible, not contribute to education, not build on what we have achieved in relation to public awareness and development, but it will be worse than that.  It will mean we will have a policy that means something in some circumstances.  For example, I might ask a simple question.  I do not know how to answer a letter somebody wrote to me &mdash; well, I do, I have answered it &mdash; which asked the question as to whether when industrialists are being wooed in the different investing countries we ever feel it necessary to say we are a neutral country.  It is a good question from a person who is a citizen, interested in industrialisation, interested in peace, interested in human rights, interested in all of the issues of disarmament and so on.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for any crude simplicity to replace what might be regarded as a sophisticated complexity that has served us well over the years.  I am expressing a view that has been debated within the Labour Party, that has been accepted by them as policy, but far more important, there is a desire among the public and there is an anxiety on the part of every parliamentarian in either of these two Houses with whom I have ever travelled abroad to be involved in forming foreign policy.  This will simply, very modestly, without any great changes put us into line with other Parliaments in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion which stands in the name of the Labour Party group.  The Parliamentary Labour Party have discussed this subject at length and as the chairman of our party, Senator M. D. Higgins, knows, we have a foreign policy section and this subject gets a lot of coverage within our group.  The formulation of what we want to do here has been agreed in principle by the parliamentary party who have approved bringing it to this House as an expediency motion.  This is not to be confused with either the Single European Act, which we will be discussing next week, or a motion which will be in the name of the Leader of the House and myself in connection with the Single European Act which is similar to the resolution in Dáil Éireann which deals specifically with Ireland's position on neutrality.  That motion would read:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann reaffirms Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances, and notes with satisfaction that the provisions in Title III of the Single European Act relating to the co-operation of the High Contracting Parties (that is the Twelve member states of the European Community) on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer coordination of their position in this area do not affect Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.</P>
      <P>That resolution will be taken in conjunction with the debate on the Single European Act.  This declaration and expediency motion deals with that aspect of our positive neutrality as the Labour Party chairman has said, and also deals with the actual legal process that will be set in place if this motion is carried.  In other words, this is an expediency motion and if it passes through this House &mdash; which I hope it will &mdash; will automatically go to the Dáil for consideration and if passed by them, a formal process will set up an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins talked about the Labour Party's position on the question <Col N="772" /> of neutrality.  It cannot be denied, that we have held a very strong view on this matter over a longer period than any other political party and we are very proud of that.  That has been reaffirmed quite recently by our present party Leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, at a meeting of the Socialist International Group in Portugal.  We are responsible for this resolution in both the Dáil and Seanad and are anxious to reaffirm our position on positive neutrality.  I agree with Senator Higgins that, if it is possible to frame a suitable wording that could be put with all-party agreement in a referendum, once and for all the position on neutrality should be enshrined in our Constitution.  We would certainly favour that course of action if it is possible legally to have proper wording that could be put to the people.  To avoid additional expense, it could be put to the people on a general election day so that there would be no ambiguity about our views or our methods in approaching this problem.</P>
    <P>Our attitude towards neutrality is included in the first paragraph of this Private Members' Motion.  I am rather disappointed that, unfortunately, in an area in which I thought we could have agreement, an amendment has been tabled by my colleague, the Leader of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>His name and my name appear on the motion for next week and his name and mine appear on other resolutions in different capacities in the House, but it is a pity that we differ on the strategy to be adopted on this issue. The Leader of the House, in his capacity as a member of the Fine Gael group, is entitled to put down an amendment, which he has done, and no doubt he will explain in his contribution why he feels his procedure is better than ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our reason for going about it this way is that it is an expediency motion and, as such, would have an effect in the other House.  It would carry on into the other House and come back formally to set up <Col N="773" /> the actual procedure.  I hope it is not seen by the Department of Foreign Affairs as anything but supportive of developing a policy on the many differing areas of foreign policy.  We are a neutral country. We are non-aligned and in many ways we are a very influential small country in the area of foreign policy.  We play a specific role within the Community and we hope that the structure we are suggesting will develop a policy which will be implemented within the Community.  We have a specific all-party policy which has been followed in the UN from the date of our joining the United Nations to which we have all subscribed.  We hope this joint committee will be a development process for the continuation of our foreign policy input into the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We also have the Inter-Parliamentary Union which annually sends delegates representing the Parliament &mdash; not the Government &mdash; to meetings throughout the world at which we are expected to contribute on areas dealing with foreign policy.  We have to depend on support and information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and I want to commend them for that.  I have often had the opportunity to speak on behalf of Irish delegations abroad and have had nothing but co-operation from the Department of Foreign Affairs in trying to formulate a position for an all-party group.  We are suggesting that it should be done in a more formal way and we hope the Department will see this as being supportive of developing such a programme. We are suggesting that these formal structures should be welcomed by the Department and, indeed, by any Government.</P>
    <P>This committee should represent all parties in each House and that representation should be commensurate with the numerical strength of parties within the Houses.  If we follow that through to its logical conclusion any Government of the day would have a majority on the Oireachtas joint committee and could influence it, if they so wished.  The Department of Foreign Affairs could benefit and would have a <Col N="774" /> consensus from differing political affiliations within the Houses of the Oireachtas to help them formulate a policy that would have widespread support from the people.</P>
    <P>If this course had been followed in the Single European Act a great deal of controversy would not have arisen.  Much of the controversy arose because people did not fully understand the implications of the Single European Act.  If this process had been followed it is possible that some of the worries and fears of the people, the trade union movement, the Irish sovereignty movement and other interested people who have been sending us reams of information, as well as the Council of the European Movement, would not have arisen.  When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities attempted to approach the problem of the Single European Act they had to consider whether their terms of reference allowed them to discuss it.  In section 6, on page 3 of their report when the question of discussing the Single European Act arose, the joint committee considered whether the subject came within their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arose before when they were considering the European Parliament's draft treaty establishing the European Union or the Spinelli Treaty as it was called.  Because these two items had been discussed within the context of the Community, they felt they had a right to discuss it, but they immediately questioned whether they had any position which they could have taken on the Single European Act.  If there had been a specific foreign policy committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas there would have been an immediate forum in which the discussion we all wished to take place on the Single European Act could have taken place.  This would have been of benefit to those who have been promoting our position in Europe.  I want to congratulate Senator Dooge in the efforts he made to try to ensure that the Single European Act would reflect Ireland's interests.  We had an opportunity in this House to discuss it in the past and I <Col N="775" /> think most of us commended him for the supreme effort he put into it.  It is only when it will be explained properly to people that they will fully understand the kind of work he put into it and the reservations he expressed on behalf of all of us, particularly in the area of neutrality. We have had to do the same thing in the Socialist group, many of whose members are members of NATO.  Any common manifesto we have implemented with them has always had a sort of <i>caveat</i> that because of our neutrality, the Irish position had to be reserved on issues which were outside the concept of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Higgins that in most democratic parliaments in the world some formal structure is there to deal with foreign affairs and I think it would be a welcome development if we could achieve a consensus on it.  However let us look at the US congressional committee system in which members of the Executive of the United States are required in a public way now to be accountable for their actions in relation to foreign affairs and to their foreign policy.  There is the incident which has now been described as a possible illegal action in relation to Iran and the movement of funds arising from that illegal transfer of arms to Iran, transferred for the overthrow of another Government.  If the United States did not have some sort of formula by which they could ask even the Executive to be responsible publicly, you could imagine the dilemma that the ordinary public in America would be faced with.  No action could be taken against either a President, or people acting on his behalf or with his agreement or even without his knowledge.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that anybody in our Department of Foreign Affairs will do things like that.  However, we are anxious that a procedure be devised to allow us to discuss foreign policy and to send for documents or people with whom the committee might like to have discussions.  Sittings could be held <i>in camera</i> if the matters under discussion were top secret.  When a <Col N="776" /> request is made to an Oireachtas Joint Committee to treat matters in a confidential way, generally speaking such a request is granted.  I would not have any worry about this question whatsoever, especially in the area of foreign policy, when what we are doing is generally something all of us can be proud of in whatever forum the Irish nation is represented.</P>
    <P>Our performance in the area of foreign policy and our condemnation generally of acts of violence throughout the world is a record of which we can be proud.  I think it is appropriate that Members of the Oireachtas would have an input into that process.  As I say, there would always be a Government majority and if the Minister or the Government felt strongly enough about a matter, that particular view would prevail.  Governments change but usually a foreign policy that has been developed on behalf of the country stands on the record, whether in the UN or in the Community.  It is important that there would be an all-party, across the board input into a sensitive area like foreign policy.  I hope the House when it has heard all the points of view will agree to the motion as set out.  There may be reservations about the actual legal structures, but we felt it was appropriate to do it in this way.  It means it will automatically go to the other House for discussion and I hope it will receive the support of all parties of the other House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the Leader of the House hears the case from all sides he may be prepared in his private capacity to withdraw his amendment.  I welcome the Minister of State and hope that he will have an opportunity of responding from his Department's point of view to what the Labour Party are trying to do in this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that consideration be given to the establishment of a Joint Committee <Col N="777" /> on Foreign Affairs in order to promote as wide a consensus as possible on all matters of Foreign Policy and that informal all-party discussions be initiated to discuss the terms of reference, the structure and the procedures of the proposed Committee on Foreign Affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to broaden the discussion and to make sure that there is a full discussion of this extremely important matter before we do proceed to establish any structures.  I would make it quite clear that I am not moving this amendment as Leader of the House, I am not moving it as leader of the Fine Gael Group.  I am moving it as the spokesman for the Fine Gael group on foreign affairs and it is seconded by the Fine Gael spokesman on European affairs.  I do not want any additional weight to be added to my words other than the logic of my argument.</P>
    <P>There are several questions raised by this motion.  The first one is, should there be a committee on foreign affairs in this House?  I do not think anyone who knows the interest I have taken in foreign affairs over the past years can doubt that I would agree wholeheartedly that there should be a committee on foreign affairs. Senator M. Higgins said there are many such committees and the spectrum ran from Denmark to the UK.  If we look perhaps at the two ends of that spectrum, I do not think that we find a good model.</P>
    <P>What does the committee on foreign affairs in the UK deal with?  It has dealt, as far as I know, with three or four matters since its inception some years ago: the constitutional problem of Canada and the invasion of Grenada.  Since they are part of the Commonwealth, it is virtually a Commonwealth committee.  It is not a committee on foreign affairs.  In regard to Denmark, they do not just have one committee on foreign affairs, they have three committees on foreign affairs and it seemed to me that Senator Michael Higgins was endeavouring to hold up Denmark as a better example to us.  Let us look at the record of Denmark.</P>

      <P>You would need to stop a good deal short of the Danish example.  Danish negotiators in the EC have been stultified by the excessive powers of the Committee of the Danish Parliament or rather one of the three committees.  They have a committee on foreign policy, they have a committee on foreign relations and they have a committee on the European Community. This committee on the European Community has terms of reference that ensure that the negotiating position that Denmark takes up in the EC has to be approved of by that committee before it starts.  I want to say that I think Denmark has lost in the past ten years by that position.  Denmark has lost by the rigidity that its committee structure imposes upon it.  I do not think this is a good model to follow.</P>
      <P>When this motion was put down I went to the trouble of looking at what was the position in regard not only to our fellow-members of the Community but in regard to Europe generally.  This matter was discussed at the Conference of European Speakers held in Copenhagen in 1984 and Dr. Steerkamp, who was a rapporteur on the relations between Parliament and foreign policy made the following remark in his introduction of his report and I think it is highly relevant to what we are discussing today.  I quote from Dr. Steerkamp on page 94 of the report to the Copenhagen Conference.</P>
      <P>First in the field of foreign policies the relationship between Government and Parliament should be one of delegated confidence and not of organised distrust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Michael Higgins does not hold the position of full confidence in the Government at the moment but I suggest that is no reason why he should go right over to a position of organised distrust.  I fear that, in fact, this motion is very close to organised distrust of the Minister of <Col N="779" /> the day and of those who assist him in the carrying out of his duties.</P>

      <P>The committees which have been set up by Parliaments are of various types.  Many of the committees &mdash; including the foreign policy committees &mdash; that exist in other countries exist because all legislation goes through committees before going into a plenary on the floor of the House.  Many of these committees, certainly in their foundation, were founded as legislative committees.  They exist also for the interchange of information.  They exist for the preparation of special reports as do our own committees.  Some committees are set up for the purpose of investigation when things go wrong.</P>
      <P>Senator Michael Higgins has laid a great emphasis on section 6 of his motion, on the unlimited power to send for persons, papers and records.  That is the hallmark of an investigative committee, not of an informative committee, not of a legislative committee, not of a committee which is attempting to reach a position of trust between a Parliament and Government. In that, the motion goes too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the amendment excluding all the words in section 1, the attempt in the amendment was to be as economical of words as possible.  Certainly to ignore section 1 of the report is not to say that one disagrees either with the principle of neutrality or with the principle of having a development strategy.  I think there has to be a good deal of discussion.  I agree with Senator Michael Higgins that we should have been having this discussion. We should have discussed it before now. We in this House have discussed foreign affairs to a greater extent during the past 12 months or so than they have not been discussed in either House for many a year.  We have to decide what should be the proper procedures because this is an extremely delicate situation.  If we move too quickly with an expediency motion, if we move to quickly to set up a committee with these powers, we may find ourselves <Col N="780" /> in fact not achieving the objective which we all have.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the report of Dr. Steerkamp who, having talked about the position in the Netherlands, then talked about the general problems that arise in this area.  I am quoting now from page 132 of this report where he is talking about the influence of Parliament on foreign policy.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...for what may happen is that a government is forced by Parliament to assume a certain starting-point in negotiations which from the beginning does not stand a chance.  Parliament may then have exerted a significant influence on foreign policy, but if the actual effect of this policy is reduced to next to nothing, one might wonder whether it has thus not missed the mark.  If Parliament wishes to exert effective influence on foreign policy it will have to take into account the above-sketched special conditions to be observed when formulating that policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on page 133 this rapporteur who is President of the First Chamber of the Parliament of the Netherlands &mdash; that being the Chamber that corresponds to this House in their system &mdash; says:</P>
    <P>Parliament will gain no good by providing the government with a rigid mandate for negotiations.  The government's hands are then tied beforehand, and it will not be able to help to reach a decision which in such circumstances is usually only feasible by giving and taking compromises.</P>
    <P>I think we need a committee on foreign affairs which will establish the principles on which there can be no compromise.  It should be quite easy for the parties in this Parliament to do that.  I do not believe that the committee which is the subject of an expediency motion here tonight is the form of the committee to accomplish that.  I believe that the powers that have been given to it are excessive.  I am forced to react to this proposition here in public, on my feet.  I am required because this <Col N="781" /> motion is put down here in Private Members' Time to discuss this in public.  I would far rather have had informal discussions among all the groups before we came together.  Indeed that always has been my attitude to foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Higgins will remember that when I had responsibility for foreign affairs, on one particular occasion I went to a good deal of trouble to ensure that in regard to the question of EI Salvador that there would not be three motions in Dáil Éireann on the question but that the parties should come together so that we could have a united position on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the compliment.  It may be that the example has not been followed to the extent to which it should.  I am a believer in this approach.  I feel the motion goes too far. It is as simple as that.  I can sit down with Senator Michael Higgins, Senator Lanigan and other Members of this House, the Minister of State or the Minister and we would have an extremely large measure of agreement.  Foreign policy must allow for an input from Parliament, but it also must allow for the fact that the main responsibility is the Minister's.</P>
      <P>This motion seems to take the attitude that there is no future for diplomacy. That remark was made by Bismark on the outbreak of the Crimean War.  Indeed if we do in our own age have an outbreak of war it may well be it would then be correct to say there would be no future for diplomacy.  I think there is a future for diplomacy.  I think there is a future for delegated confidence in Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers of State for Foreign Affairs.  I think delegated confidence can only and properly be given if there is a good deal of exchange of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience has been &mdash; before I was Minister for Foreign Affairs and after &mdash; that the Department of Foreign Affairs are remarkably open in the <Col N="782" /> manner in which they are prepared to brief Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, Senator Dooge hardly requires that one minute. Senator Dooge wishes to conclude by saying that I believe we should set up a committee on foreign policy that will lead to an improvement in the delegated confidence which we have in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department.  I do not believe the motion that is being put before us tonight will do that and I think we have a duty &mdash; all of us have a duty &mdash; to seek how that may best be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the amendment so clearly proposed in that forceful speech from my colleague, Senator Dooge, I do so for the reasons which have been very clearly outlined.</P>
      <P>I have long held the view that this House was an ideal place in which to have a committee specialising in foreign affairs and foreign policy.  In 1979 many of our colleagues here will recall that I established and <i>ad hoc</i> sub-committee specifically dealing with foreign affairs which had the honour and the benefit of receiving and hearing a number of distinguished ambassadors and foreign statesmen who visited this country to speak with us and apprise us of various aspects of foreign policy, not only in Europe but in the world in general.  It is all the more desirable now, having regard to the fact that since joining the EC Ireland is more and more dependent on the development of foreign policies in the EC and the new situation that creates for us.  I share the view that the motion as proposed by my friends in the Labour Party is perhaps a little bit too strong.  Indeed, it would constitute one of the strongest committees in the House.  I doubt that we need that kind of strength in this area which is now of such importance to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1975 I had the honour serving as vice-chairman of a small five man sub-committee at the bureau of the European <Col N="783" /> Parliament.  We were charged with examining and reporting on the working conditions of the then proposed directly elected European Parliament.  In the course of our studies we looked at the systems in the US, Canada, Switzerland the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and the USSR.  While we were not looking at committee systems in particular, it was clear that there was an advantage in Parliaments where committees covered delicate areas such as foreign affairs and European affairs. It was quite clear also that in countries where the committee system had a sound grip the Department of Foreign Affairs had very little leeway when it came to negotiating for and on behalf of their respective countries.  That, I think, breeds intransigence at international level.</P>
    <P>From my constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs I know they are more than willing to provide Members of the Oireachtas with briefing material at all levels.  There is an excellent working relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister and the Minister of State and the individual Members of the Houses.  We appreciate the fact that so much information and statistics are made available to us.  I am glad members of the joint committee had the opportunity over the past couple of years &mdash; it is unfortuante that it was only over the past couple of years &mdash; to visit projects grant-aided by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>This gives Members of the Oireachtas an opportunity to see for themselves the problems the development countries must face.  It is not possible to have that appreciation without having firsthand knowledge, without seeing on the ground the difficulties which masses of people in the developing countries must face.  It is important that we should have in the Oireachtas a strong committee with the members dedicated not just to recognising the problems of developing countries and trying to appreciate their difficulties, but able to visit them and come back with a commitment to do <Col N="784" /> something very tangible about those problems.  The progress we have made under successive Governments &mdash; but none better than the present &mdash; must continue.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Dooge's views that this matter is of extreme importance.  Therefore, it is important that we should have a committee that will work.  In order to achieve that there should be the widest negotiations on formulating and setting up this committee.  For that reason I ask the House to accept that Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that consideration be given to the establishment of a joint committee on foreign affairs in order to promote as wide a consensus as possible on all matters of foreign policy and that informal all-party discussions be initiated to discuss the terms of reference, the structure and procedures of the proposed committee on foreign affairs.  This is a necessary first step to get this off the ground.  At no other time in the history of the State have we been so dependent on the policies of other countries.  We never had such an input into international affairs as we have now and as exercised by the Government with style and imagination.  The input from Ireland has been second to none, more especially in the EC.</P>
    <P>When I first came into this House in the sixties the then Minister for Foreign Affairs had made a dynamic impression on the United Nations.  The work undertaken there by successive Ministers, especially by the late Mr. Frank Aiken, put this country firmly on the map.  We have no vested interests in the super powers or the power blocs.  The words and speeches of Irish Ministers are listened to with respect because of the basis from which they are delivered.  I formally second the amendment as proposed by my colleague, Senator Dooge.</P>

      <P>Open Government it may be.  I am privileged to be in on this discussion between the two parties.  I am not too sure of the nuances involved in the Leader of the House not addressing us as the Leader of the House but as a member of the Fine Gael Party.  He is seconded by a Senator from the Fine Gael Party not on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, but as as member of the foreign relations committee of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>So I presume that the exchanges are coming from the far side to try to hold me to within my 15 minutes. We are discussing foreign policy and the differences between the two parties seem to be of minimal importance.  The motion before us is very narrow in one sense. We will be discussing the question of neutrality next week within the ambit of the Single European Act, and also demilitarisation, development of strategy and various other items mentioned in this motion.  The Leader of the House, acting not on behalf of the Government but on his own behalf, put down an amendment which is very wide-ranging.  It can involve any aspect of foreign policy.  I suggest that we should sit down, in an informal manner, and discuss whether we should have this committee.  Since the debate is between the two Coalition parties I will react to certain things that have been said.  If we look at the Order Paper it has to be said that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there are a number of items dealing with foreign affairs and there is obviously a need for the debate on foreign affairs to be brought within the ambit of one committee rather than as is the case today.  On the Order Paper today there are motions on: Developing Countries: Apartheid and Development in Southern Africa; Legislation of the European Communities; Cereals; Stock Exchange Regulations; Co-operation <Col N="786" /> with Developing Countries; Report on visit to Zambia, the Sudan and Ethiopa. All those motions are obviously matters which are of interest to the Department of Foreign Affairs and should be of interest to the proposed committee that might be set up.</P>
      <P>Various people have said here this evening that they are very satisfied with the attitude of the Department of Foreign Affairs towards people going abroad and in the briefing they give.  On occasions I have found that briefings from the Department of Foreign Affairs, before going on a visit abroad, were not as comprehensive as they should be, but were very narrow.  At all times I found embassies, consuls and embassy staffs abroad very much <i>au fait</i> with the situation in the countries in which they are operating.  It may be that sometimes what they find on the ground is not relayed back to a particular desk in Iveagh House.  I would put in a <i>caveat</i> before giving the Department of Foreign Affairs full credit for being up to date with the situation on the ground.  I do not think they are, but the embassies, consuls, ambassadors and staffs, whether in the political field or in the industrial commercial field, are at all times very constructive in their attitude towards the problems that confront them.  They have been very helpful to visiting members of the Oireachtas and I give them full credit.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs are elitist in a sense.  They do not play a major part in internal politics in Ireland.  When legislators go abroad there is the feeling that they are going on junkets.  Nevertheless, much of what happens in Ireland can be dictated from abroad.  More and more we are being conditioned by foreign affairs policies of other Governments.  It is necessary for us to look at the operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs in depth.  We must look at our attitude towards them and we must have a better means of communication <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Department and the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that on a day on which a soldier of the Irish Army was buried in Athlone this matter should be discussed. <Col N="787" /> We send the condolences of the House to the widow of Private O'Brien who was killed in the Lebanon and to the Army, the Chief of Staff, and the Minister for Defence on this sad occasion.  We are debating foreign affairs and there was an intrusion, which I think was unfortunate by the Minister for Defence into the situation regarding our presence in the Lebanon.  It was suggested that, after looking at the situation on the ground over the next few days, he will come back and will advise the Government on what we should do regarding our presence in the Lebanon or our withdrawal from the Lebanon.  I feel that is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposers of the motion can cite examples in the motion, I should be able to cite examples in my response to the motion.  Government policy on our involvement in the Lebanon should be left to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is a political decision.  It is not a matter for the Department of Defence or the Minister for Defence.  I suggest in relation to foreign affairs that no cognisance should be taken of any suggestion by the Minister for Defence that we may pull out of the Lebanon for any reason. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of any member of the Army to whom I have spoken, that irrespective of the heavy losses we have suffered in that area we are needed to fulfil a peacekeeping role there.  I suggest that the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, should have a look at the situation on the ground and report back to the Government but not make suggestions as to what we might or might not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the area of foreign affairs at a time when nobody can believe the words of the Department of Foreign Affairs of any major country.  The British Government are in total disarray because of their activities in the area of foreign affairs.  They have proved that they are quite willing and capable of getting <Col N="788" /> involved in the internal politics of this country.  They have got involved in the internal politics of Nicaragua and El Salvador. They have got involved in the Middle East conflict in terms of their involvement through Israel with Iran. They have got involved in many conflicts. It is vitally important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we take up a position on foreign affairs.  When mention is made of the setting up of committees I have often felt I would like to query our representatives in the United Nations when we find that on issues which are of major world importance it seems that we sit on the fence too often and do not vote.  Neutrality is not about not voting.  Neutrality is something which is quite positive and mention has been made of positive neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neutrality is mentioned quite specifically in the motion so I am speaking to the motion.  The question of our neutrality is something that we should not be ashamed of.  Because of our positive neutral stand in the world, we have been able to have a bigger influence in world affairs than our size or our population should grant us.  Senator Higgins mentioned that we should be aiming at a world made safe against war.  There is no way I can see that we can make the world safe against war.  We cannot be protected from war either.  The situation in the world at present would allow us, as a small country, to have a positive place in world peacekeeping.  We have never been involved in colonialism.  We have never been involved in any war of attrition. We have never been involved in anything except in our own attempts to have a Thirty-two county State provided here. We have fought against an oppressor which was the biggest colonial power in the world at one stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> Mention was made in the Dáil yesterday of the difference between neutality and sham neutrality.  I do not think there is such a thing as sham neutrality. We are either neutral or not neutral. I do not consider neutrality to be sitting on the fence.  At all times we must take up positive neutral positions.  We must fight against oppression and we must be seen to fight against oppression wherever the oppression comes from.  I do not want to become part of any power bloc.  I do not want to become part of a power bloc which is associated with the East.  I do not want to become part of a power bloc which is associated with the West.</P>

Mention was made of open congressional committees in the United States.  I sat in on one of these open committees when the question of extradition was being debated last year in the United States and I thought that it was the biggest sham I ever sat in on.  It was a public meeting gone wrong.  Every member, whether they were Congressmen or Senators, was speaking to their own constituencies and were not speaking to the actual extradition Bill.  I can remember one particular quote, even though everybody at the time suggested that no extradition Bill would be brought in.  One Senator said he could imagine how it came about.  Maggie was sitting down one night with Ronnie.  After having a nice meal Maggie said to Ronnie: &ldquo;I want a `B' from you Ronnie.&ldquo; Ronnie asked what was that.  She said: &ldquo;I want an extradition Bill to be brought in. In actual fact Maggie got her `B'.  She got her extradition Bill.  Unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would appear to me that, basically, what we are not talking about here is the setting up of a committee which will have positive and worth while results.  That is basically the conflict between the two parties in Coalition.  That does not mean we should not have a further look at the relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In conclusion, I suggest that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was not too sure what is meant by that.  Parliament should determine foreign policy.  I do not think we should accept what comes from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We should tell the Department of Foreign Affairs where we should be going in terms of our policy.  That does not mean we react on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from day to day in regard to items which might come up. Is there a future for diplomacy?  I do not trust diplomats.  Diplomats never tell the truth.  Diplomats are people who react to statements made by other people.  Diplomats are people who have not got a place <Col N="791" /> in the real world and they are sent out because they can listen.  They can prevaricate and they are plausible.  I am not suggesting that Senator Dooge in his capacity as a diplomat was plausible or anything else.</P>

The position in my party has always been that we prefer to trust diplomats than generals.  It is far safer and much more democratic.</P>
      <P>I second the proposal Senator Lanigan made in relation to the tragic death of Private O'Brien.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs that we have killing by Israeli surrogates, a State with which we have friendly relations.  Quite recently we entertained its President.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a protest about the killing.  It is disgraceful that the Israeli's continue to make Irish troops targets, using surrogates.</P>

    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the amendment put down by Senator Dooge in whatever capacity.  Either as Leader of the House, as spokesperson for Fine Gael or as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Somebody remarked this evening that the amendment would do justice to Sir Humphrey.  It is a classic piece of draftsmanship.  Senator Lanigan can escape from that classic Fianna Fáil dilemma of being presented with two options and wanting to do nothing.  In this case he can decide.  Senator Lanigan expressed support for Senator Higgins's motion.  By passing this Labour Party <Col N="792" /> motion we would have a foreign affairs committee with substantial power and sharp teeth.  There should not be a dilemma.  The problem probably would be to convince Deputy Gerry Collins that it would be in his interest as well as that of the country.  Then we might see Fianna Fáil voting on this rather than sitting in their seats.</P>
    <P>We have a number of joint committees. When they were set up by the Leader of the House at the time &mdash; Deputy John Bruton was the person who initiated such committees &mdash; it was felt that they would contribute enormously to the work of Parliament and to the development of policy.  I find it quite extraordinary that in an area of foreign affairs some people feel such a committee is not necessary.  It is interesting to note the question of the arms to Iran that somebody who negotiated on the American side preferred to have a passport-forged or not &mdash; which purported to come from this country.  That gives an indication of the status afforded to people from the Irish Republic.  It is recognised throughout the world that this country has no colonial past.  It wishes no nation ill and it has always been involved in trying, in so far as it could, to strengthen international peace and in fighting for international justice.  It is worth nothing that the Irish passport is such a badge and we should be proud of it.</P>
    <P>There is the point by Senator Lanigan in relation, for instance, to the United Nations.  The only forum to which our diplomats there are answerable to, presumably, would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Iveagh House.  Ireland, under Frank Aiken at the United Nations, had a positive and well-stamped-out position in relation to nuclear war and to nuclear weapons.  Over the years that position has been eroded.  We are now one of a large number of countries in the United Nations.  For some of those reasons a joint committee of the Houses would have a dynamic role to play in evolving Irish foreign policy.  The fears that Senator Dooge expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue has arisen, as I understand it, for a number of reasons.  While some of these have been addressed by way of answer to a Parliamentary Question as late as yesterday in the other House, there are still some matters that cause me some concern.  It would appear that there has been a <Col N="794" /> decision by Cabinet in response to the review of arterial drainage in 1983 to 1985 to take a number of steps, including the transfer of responsibility for drainage, that section which was within the care of the Office of Public Works, to the Department of Agriculture.  There is disquiet &mdash; and I will come straight to the point &mdash; in the minds of smallholders who are affected by drainage itself, as to what the future criteria will be on the occasion of the transfer of function.  For example, what criteria will be implemented in relation to drainage that will go ahead and secondly, what criteria will apply in relation to the maintenance of schemes? There has been disquiet which I can understand about, for example on the one hand, while giving representation to those who are likely to be affected by schemes, one may require them to make a prior cash commitment so that such a scheme would commence.</P>
      <P>Should this be so, it would be too crude in its operation.  The fact of the matter is that when one looks at the structure of land, one finds an enormous difference in the circumstances of the farmers who are affected by drainage.  They fall into the categories of direct beneficiaries and those who are indirect beneficiaries.  The direct beneficiaries vary enormously in relation to their capacity to benefit.  In the area in which I live, in the case of the people who contacted me, 75 per cent of the holdings are under 50 acres, 50 per cent of them are under 15 acres and some of those holdings are fragmented, held in different places and there are difficulties of access.  There is no way that these small farmers have access to the economies of scale that have benefited farmers in larger holdings that are better located and to which there is better access.  There are other social difficulties.  Many people are relatively elderly; they have not had the opportunity of some of the benefits which many of us enjoy in relation to other things.  Also, there are simple soil difficulties that arise; some of the soils involved can be used more beneficially than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What all this means is that a crude requirement of a prior deposit before a <Col N="795" /> committee could present its viewpoint would fall against such smallholders.  This is one concern.  The other concern which has been expressed to all public representatives who wanted to listen in the area, was in relation to employment.  The transfer of functions from one office &mdash; the Office of Public Works &mdash; was accompanied by a statement that the transfer would be in the context of overall Cabinet thinking in relation to the viability of schemes.  If you talk about the viability of schemes and true cost-benefit analysis, what all of us who know the situation must bear in mind about true cost benefit analysis is that there is a general and a specific point to be borne in mind.  The general point is now that with every person who is employed and who is put on short time or who is unemployed, or who was permanent and made casual, there is an immense social cost that arises in relation to social welfare, both in terms of unemployment benefit and assistance.</P>
    <P>There is a second point: those who have worked on the drainage schemes, both in their basic structure and in their maintenance, by and large, are people many of whom are beyond the middle years of their lives.  Their employment represented some of the most dispersed and regionalised kind of employment available in this heavily centralised State. They are people who cannot reasonably, apart from the general features of the present labour market which has contracted so many opportunities, look to comparable employment at their stage of life and where they live.</P>
    <P>Putting these two points together in regard to the commencement of new schemes and their maintenance, and the employment effect, I can well understand the anxiety of those who might be interested in drainage, in its continuance and in its start-up, and also the number employed.  There is another factor which is not borne in mind sufficiently in relation to thinking about agriculture in this country, that is, that many people are both small farmers and workers, part <Col N="796" /> time and full time.  They eke out an existence by combining their different opportunities for putting their income together. They are affected.</P>
    <P>I was particularly worried about the suggestion that it was time to look at non-labour intensive forms of drainage activity both in terms of initiation and maintenance.  I am well aware, having seen the machines in different parts of the country, that there are many things that one could do with machines which would save cost.  Perhaps this is so.  There are two points to be made here: the case is not being made for the inevitable cheaper outturn of contracted work as opposed to some of the direct labour forms of employment which exist at present.  To say that one would either freeze the employment level and implement contract work on a trial basis is the thin end of the wedge.  It is perceived as such by the people who are involved; they feel that if they are using machines it is the end of the road for them.  One is destroying a certain kind of rural employment which is valuable.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the transfer of functions from the Office of Public Works, there is an inevitable weakening of its position.  I might say that a new grouping in Irish politics that seems singularly bereft of policy suggestions of a positive kind, has already set its eyes on the Office of Public Works and suggested that it be disestablished.  That position is based on both a paucity of thinking and ignorance. We all know the contribution of the Office of Public Works to Irish life and we are anxious to defend it.  On the occasion of the moving of functions from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Agriculture it is terribly important that the overall employment level be not be caught up in the general thinking in relation to embargoes, staff and so forth.  We could have a net loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying this because, as I have said, I want to leave time to Senator Killilea to speak also. There are many positive parts of the review of drainage that I am certainly not opposing.  I certainly think there is a need for a far greater integration of services as <Col N="797" /> they impact on the lives of small farmers. There is a logic to giving the Department of Agriculture as many grouped activities as possible.  For example, I have long believed that in the development of the farm incomes of the people who are involved you should have a mixture of the social aspects of retirement and the health entitlements of people who are ageing on small farms; they should all be within the general concept of rural development.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter this evening because Senator Killilea and I have an interest in it and because there is a great deal of uncertainty.  What will be the criteria of the cost-benefit studies?  Will they be as wide as I have suggested to take into account the cost of unemployed people?  What will be the cost-benefit structure in relation to, for example, people who cannot immediately agree to invest money for work for the benefit of their land.  What about those who know it will benefit their land but will not be able to invest immediately and take advantage of land that has now been drained?  All of these areas are uncertain. What criteria will be used in discovering the levels of beneficiary and the contribution the different beneficiaries should make?</P>
    <P>What is meant by the phrase &ldquo;modest local contribution&rdquo;?  Modest local contribution means different things to different people.  A very small sum of money is a great proportion of the income of the farmers affected; it is very little to other people.  Above all else, in relation to the question of maintenance and the implications of shifting to contract work, has this been discussed with the trade unions involved?  Have the opinions of the workers been sought?  In addition to that, have there been discussions with local authorities in relation to the charges when functions are moved from local authorities to the Department of Agriculture? Did such consultation, if it took place, include the inevitable protection of workers?  These are the main reasons I sought permission in the Seanad to raise this issue in view of anxiety among the <Col N="798" /> farmers involved and those affected by the employment situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senator Higgins for allowing me these few moments because I too am interested in this matter.  While we may be opposite in our political outlook, on this particular issue we are together.  There is serious disquiet among farmers on the one hand and the employees on the other.  What alarms everybody is that we were not made aware of this fact and there was no discussion locally, through the local councils or the unions in the workforce or through the farmers' associations.  Just to read in the newspaper this had happened is not the proper way to do it.  I have felt for some time, and I said it here four years ago, that in regard to arterial drainage the Office of Public Works should have been regionalised because there are different regions where there are different applications.  In Connacht we had the stop-go policy of years gone by, perhaps not wrong in itself in those days where we were shifting skills from Connacht and Leinster to Munster, the northern parts of the county and the north western parts of the county and back again to the west.  If this had been done a little less consistently in each of the regions it would probably have been a better answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is tremendous skill within the Office of Public Work as regards arterial drainage.  The tragedy is that skill may be lost.  We may express all the pious platitudes we like about it, but eventually that is what will happen and I will give an example.  For doing smaller drains that are not listed in main arterials, we have a programme called an LIS scheme operating within the county councils.  What is the main problem regarding those schemes?  The main problem is, and has been, this &ldquo;modest&rdquo; amount of money that the farmers are expected to pay. Approximately 80 per cent of them will pay but the other 20 per cent do not have that &ldquo;modest&rdquo; amount.  Will there be the same criteria for the maintenance of Office of Public Works drains?  Secondly, if it does not work what is going to happen <Col N="799" /> to the workers we have in operation? That is a serious problem because they are most skilled people quite clearly and categorically.  To their credit to this day we have the Clare river drainage scheme. It is an example of what can be done.  We have the Corrib-Mask-Robe scheme now almost completed in main arterial terms. But it was stopped and abandoned when there were many requests for extensions to it.  That scheme was not fully finished in the true sense.  What will happen? Absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>It was quite unfair of the Government to come up with this idea that they should transfer the functions to the Department of Agriculture.  What has happened to all the schemes in the Department of Agriculture since 1979?  They have been whittled away one by one &mdash; the western package and the western drainage scheme: to all intents and purposes they are practically useless.  We have seen them all and we have learned a lesson. There is very little time for me to discuss those matters but I am giving a general synoposis of what I see.</P>
    <P>There is another burning question which has to be answered &mdash; the legal status of the Department of Agriculture. Do they carry the legal status that the Office of Public Works had to travel over lands, to compel people who may not be interested in drainage because of one reason or another to co-operate?  For example, a man is not talking to his neighbour on the left-hand side or not talking to his neighbour on the right-hand side, or maybe he is an old man and he does not want to get tied up in all this expense to maintain the drain at the bottom of his land.  What happens to the legal status the Office of Public Works held by which they went through the legal formalities and could do that job?  This is fundamental for progress and if that legal status is not transferred in total the whole operation is pointless and it will fail.</P>
    <P>There is a major scheme yet to be carried out in our county, the Dunkellin drainage scheme but it is a long long story.  It is going back to fine Deputies who served in the other House and many <Col N="800" /> fine Senators in this House.  It can be traced back to the days of Paddy Beegan &mdash; God rest his soul &mdash; and that is going back a long time, and it is still not done. It is still required for an enormous amount of fine agricultural land which is absolutely useless unless something is done about it.  Where is the arterial drainage? It is very unclear what is happening. Press statements say one thing.  Why could we not come into this House, the other House or both Houses and sit down and discuss the proposals, weed out the problems, seek and search through the programme and try to come up with a balanced change, if change is necessary? Perhaps change is necessary.  I am not saying it is not, but to be launched on us in this way is the main source of protest.</P>
    <P>In Headfort, in the most northern part of our county, drainage is the source of the people's incomes.  There is nothing else in that little village in North Galway to give an income to create stability. What will happen to the maintenance workers?  What will happen to the main arterial workers there?  What will happen to their skills?  I heard in recent days of the fascinating amounts of money being offered to skilled people who have spent their lives in arterial drainage.  They are being bought out and told to go home. As Senator Higgins rightly said, it will become a social problem at a later stage in the community.  This is not the way we should be doing things.  The skills that these men have developed, in some cases from the cradle of arterial drainage to this day, should be nourished and developed. They should be encouraged to supplement and improve what has been done.</P>
    <P>There is also the feeling of the workers on privatisation.  I am not against privatisation but we have privatisation in the LIS schemes of our counties and they are not working.  Why are we trying something we know has not worked, if that is what we are doing?  The local improvement schemes have not worked as regards drainage.  They do bits and pieces; one farmer is complaining and the other five want it done and there is a <Col N="801" /> perpetual squabble.  That is what is happening. That is the history of this country and there is nothing I or Senator Higgins or any other Senator in this House can do about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must put on the record of this House that the skilled workforce in arterial drainage and maintenance drainage of the Office of Public Works will be kept intact.  They have a major role to continue to play &mdash; particularly those involved in maintenance, taking into account the conditions prevailing in our county today.  We suffered a night unparalleled in weather conditions in any other part of this country last Thursday night.  Parts of the roads and parts of the drainage scheme in the Cloughbrack, Cornamona area of north Connemara were swept away.  Thirty eight yards of one particular road in Cloughbrack were washed away.  Why?  Because the arterial drainage scheme, as good as it is, was not capable of taking the torrential flood. Now all those drains will be damaged. They all need to be maintained.  Who will maintain them?  When will they be maintained?  In normal circumstances you could send a letter to the Office of Public Works informing them that the matter is urgent.  In fact, there are no better people to come out and maintain what they had built.  I fear that structures of main arterial drainage, on which we spent a lot of money over the years, will be lost because of this lack of cohesion regarding maintenance.  I believe the maintenance will fall behind in any place where there was a successful scheme and we will go back to the original problem in years to come.  All the systems we have in full operation &mdash; maybe not as many as we would like &mdash; will become choked. We will have water again spreading across those lands and the fruitful work that has been done will be lost to us.</P>
    <P>Assurances from the Minister, Deputy Hegarty, are absolutely necessary that the maintenance will be continued at the same rate as heretofore.  Maintenance is of major importance and a word, positively and clearly said, might eliminate <Col N="802" /> some of the disquiet regarding the stability of the workforce involved in maintenance in the Office of Public Works. Main arterial drainage is a separate question and one which we should tackle in a separate way but the major worry concerns basic maintenance.  I would appreciate if the Minister could give us that assurance tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will probably take 30 seconds in support of my colleagues. There are two points which they have not actually covered.  They arise out of the transfer of responsibilities from one Department to another.  From my experience as chairman of South Tipperary County Council, when we went to the European Community in connection with grant assistance for the Government to drain the River Suir, we were warned not to make an application under the FEOGA funding because of strain on it through CAP and other dimensions.  It was important that we should claim on the regional funds for major arterial drainage.  If the Department of Agriculture are now making a claim on the Community for any grant assistance it will be looked upon as an agricultural development.  On a cost-benefit analysis of most of our drainage in the country, if we depend on agriculture solely, it probably would not meet the criteria laid down by Europe.  It is imperative that we should deal also with the other benefits like tourism and industry and fishing, so that they will consider it under the regional fund within the European Community. It is important that the Minister should address himself to that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came to my notice today at a meeting of the general council of agricultural committees that lands that had previously been drained &mdash; and had been grant aided for drainage &mdash; had been refused grants for afforestation.  When we are trying to develop other enterprises, to debar somebody from afforestation grants <Col N="803" /> because they had drained their land is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday issued a statement announcing the terms of the Government decisions in relation to arterial drainage. The motion before the House this evening raises a number of issues which are affected by those decisions, specifically the questions of a charge or contribution towards the cost of drainage, maintenance as well as construction and the use of contract, rather than direct labour, in the carrying out of drainage operations.</P>
      <P>On the question of requiring a contribution towards future schemes, the Government concluded that a more active commitment to derive benefit from such schemes would be obtained by requiring the prospective beneficiaries to form local committees.  One of the functions of the committees would be to collect a modest local contribution towards the cost of future arterial drainage projects, thus acknowledging the enhanced use and value of land which would follow drainage.</P>
      <P>In regard to maintenance of existing drainage schemes it was decided that beneficiaries should make a realistic contribution towards the cost involved, which are, after all, incurred in securing for those beneficiaries the advantages gained by the maintenance operations.  I should stress that the intention is that the contribution should be of modest proportions and that the vast bulk of the costs will be borne by the Exchequer. Indeed, the local county council would have the power to decide.  They would know the local circumstances and the ability of people to pay.  You would not have the very serious problem envisaged by Senator Killilea of a scheme being &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; because of a lack of contributions from one or two people.  I accept that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another decision taken by Government was to carry out by contract, on a trial basis, an element of the drainage <Col N="804" /> scheme works currently in progress. Heretofore it had largely been the practice to undertake drainage projects by means of direct labour.  Both systems have their advantages and their drawbacks in major engineering enterprises such as arterial drainage.  Surely it is entirely prudent and reasonable to undertake the exercise proposed so as to obtain a yardstick by which the merits and demerits of the two methods can be assessed. A part of the Monaghan-Blackwater project has been chosen for execution by contract and the results will be closely monitored.  The results might prove what Senators have been saying here this evening, that the old way is the best way.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in these decisions which warrants concern on the part of small farmers in County Galway, large areas of which have been drained by schemes for the Corrib-Clare, Corrib-Headford, Corrib-Mask-Robe and Killimor-Cappagh rivers.</P>
    <P>The Government are confident that the decisions provide for the future a sound basis for the improved appraisal and execution of drainage works.  To dwell very briefly on the few points I have made, the unions are aware of what is happening.  I reiterate that the fears of the Senators with regard to the modest sums involved &mdash; they will be modest sums &mdash; are groundless.  It is just a check to see if we are getting the best value for money.  Bear in mind that making out the contract does not mean we will have any shortfall in employment because contractors will also have to employ local people.  As the Senators know better than I, most of these works involve building bridging and fencing and that sort of thing.  They will have to be carried out by the self same people.  There is a big worry for people about going over lands.  We had this with gas lines also.  The legal status of the Office of Public Works is being transferred in its entirety to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It has always been the position that requests for extensions to schemes are fully considered and they are included or excluded on the basis of their economic <Col N="805" /> worth.  Surely, since you have local farmers on a council, who better to assess the economic worth?  To take Senator Higgins's point, if the farmer was not in a position to take up that land immediately, if he had a long term proposal, I am sure the local council would identify that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cost-benefit analysis, the criteria to be used would basically involve providing the Government with a range of options, thus facilitating decisions as to the best way to proceed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> To conclude, I would like to reassure the House that this is an exercise in finding out, having a yardstick to balance one against the other.  It is appropriate that Senators should raise this matter so that they could allay the fears of their constituents.</P>
