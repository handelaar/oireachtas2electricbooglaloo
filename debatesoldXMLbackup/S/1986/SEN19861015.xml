      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review speed limits on roads.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. until 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to Senators a correction on today's Order Paper. The notice of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges' meeting should read for today and not for tomorrow as indicated on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. No. 1, which is the Air Pollution Bill, and No. 2, which is the report on acid rain, are being debated together and will continue to be debated together. Item No. 3 is the National Monuments Bill. This will be taken only if Nos. 1 and 2 are disposed of before 5 <Col N="414" /> p.m. I would also suggest that if, at 5.30 p.m. the Minister of State has commenced her concluding address, she be allowed to conclude it. Otherwise we will take our break as normal from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., and Private Members' Business will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>For the information of Senators, it is proposed to sit tomorrow and the business tomorrow will be Nos. 5 and 6 on today's Order paper. No. 5, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, 1986, will be taken in the morning and No. 6, the Fifth Report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, will be taken tomorrow afternoon.</P>

      <P>Is it proposed that if the Air Pollution Bill and item No. 2 are not completed by 5.30 p.m. that we continue the debate on these items in the morning, or is it suggested that we start tomorrow morning with item No. 5? I suggest that we do not break at 5.30 p.m. but continue until closing time this evening. In my view, taking breaks is utterly ridiculous. Many of those who look for breaks are not here when they are wanted.</P>

      <P>This is the third time on the Order of Business that I have tried to raise the subject of the economic crisis in the country. Last week I was told in reply that I could raise it in the normal course of events by putting a motion down on the Order paper. Item No. 38 on the Order Paper is a motion in the name of the Fianna Fáil party about the crisis in the economy which has led to unprecedented borrowing, a record current budget deficit and a crisis of confidence. In order to test the goodwill of this House. I am challenging the Order of Business today. I oppose the Order of Business. To test the Government's goodwill, to emphasise the fact that the Seanad is sitting, and there is an economic crisis in this country and that the Seanad will not debate it, I propose that item No. 38 be taken today and that it not be delayed for three weeks.</P>

      <P>Can the Leader of the House say whether there are any proposals to have a discussion in this House on the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare, a very important document?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have waited patiently, as the Leader of the House no doubt knows, for item No 26 on today's Order Paper, that is, the Committee Stage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, to be taken. I have been patient because of promises of Government action in this area. It is 12 months since a Government response to this problem was published. There have been two hours' debate on the issue in the other House. Can the Leader of the House give me any time table as to when it is expected that this issue, which this House has treated with great patience will be dealt with by the Government and as to when this House can deal with it? If it cannot be dealt with by the procedures the Government had in mind, then we ought to proceed with Committee Stage of my Private Members' Bill and not leave homeless people living on the streets of our cities for yet another winter. This will be the third winter the homeless have awaited a political response to their problems. I raise this subject now having been patient for 12 months and because it is approximately the first anniversary of the publication of Government legislation. Do the Government intend to do anything about it, or has the issue been abandoned?</P>

      <P>I support the suggestion made by Senator Fallon about <Col N="416" /> the possibility of discussing the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare. This report is a document of crucial importance in the whole area of social welfare. It is most important that the proposals in it, and the whole restructuring of the social welfare system which is envisaged by it, should be discussed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to deal with the various points raised. First, I should like to confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that we will commence at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow with item No. 5 &mdash; Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill &mdash; irrespective of what stage Nos. 1, 2 and 3 have been reached today. In regard to the question of taking item No. 38 today, that is an item of Private Members' Business. We have a well established system in this House which, to my mind, is working very well, that is that each group in turn choose the motion on the Order Paper for discussion in Private Members' Business Time. It is the turn of the Labour Party to move a motion at 6.30 p.m. this evening. They have indicated their preference and I think it would be against the whole way in which we have agreed to operate Private Members' Business if that were to be disturbed. Certainly I would not support a proposition to disturb that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of a debate on the report of the Commission of Social Welfare, once again of course if this is a high priority with Members of the House it can be dealt with in Private Members' time. I take it that the question that is being addressed to me is whether I am prepared to give Government time for discussion of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. In that regard there is a vast amount of legislation and if as the weeks go by we tend to dispose of that legislation certainly I will take up with the Minister the question of allowing some Government time in regard to that. In regard to the Homeless Persons Bill, we have a Private Members' Bill here in the Seanad and a Government Bill in the Dáil. First I would like to thank Senator Brendan Ryan for his patience.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances I would not disagree with what the Leader of the House has said regarding the ordering of Private Members' motions. However, I think the people outside this House are looking for guidance from the Houses of the Oireachtas with regard to matters on the economic front and there is a motion in front of us which would give us an opportunity to debate the very serious situation everybody in this country is facing because of the mishandling of the economy by the present Government. On a day on which <Col N="418" /> interest rates have risen by 2 per cent, when businesses are going to be eliminated because of the huge increased costs which have been acknowledged by everybody as being as a direct result of Government mismanagement, we would have to support the plea by Senator Ross that item No. 38 be taken today.</P>

    <Title>Air Pollution Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at considerable length on this previously and if everybody takes as long as I did, the debate could go on for a very long time. I have a special concern in this area and for half a lifetime I have been giving advice on a national scale with regard to energy conservation, in particular, the fireplace in society and in the home. Developments over the last 20 years have been of major importance in this area. There have been improvements with regard to refinements in the fireplace, the details of the flue, under floor ventilation and provision of air for combustion. Originally according to the specification, invariably the flue had two or more bends; now the theory is that the flue should be straight, to give one illustration. There have been many refinements in regard to the fireplace and the efficiency of the fire. Suddenly, a question mark is placed after the fire in the home, which is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Some people believe this Bill is a smokescreen. I do not necessarily go all the way with that belief. Nevertheless, the Bill is reacting to EC pressure. The Government do not believe there is an inherent necessity for it.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister said that heretofore implementation of EC directives was by administrative means. Through this Bill we will now have statutory provision to comply with the directives. That will not work miracles although there are those who seem to think it will. We have sufficient legislation to deal with the problem of air pollution, except in the area of traffic pollution.</P>
      <P>I mentioned before the different areas where we have statutory control but do not seem to have solved the problems. One of these areas is with regard to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (No. 1) Act, 1977. That legislation is very comprehensive and many people felt when it was introduced that water pollution problems were over and done with, but, in fact, as the House would agree, even this year we have had many serious water pollution problems. Indeed, in many cases local authorities whom we expect to oversee the working of this Act and carry it through, are the culprits. The Factories Acts are very comprehensive, yet the number of accidents continues to increase. The Litter Control Act has done very little for our problem as those who travel through rural areas would admit. Earlier in the year it was proposed to increase the fines for litter control but this will not solve the problem. I could quote many other cases where legislation will not deal with the problems. In effect, what I am saying is that those who think that this Bill is the answer to all our pollution problems will be very disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have missed out with regard to administrative means. Over the year the problems as they arose could have been dealt with in various ways. For example, with regard to heating, and home heating in particular, everybody is now aware that enclosed stoves are far more efficient than the open fireplace. Yet there was never any attempt at departmental level to encourage the use of enclosed stoves. Grants would have been a very effective way of doing this. We have new house <Col N="421" /> grants and house improvement grants, but there should have been a special grant for the provision of enclosed stoves in houses. It was very shortsighted not to have provided such a grant. Even with the introduction of the last house improvement grant by the Government which was very worth while and welcomed by everybody, this problem was not dealt with. That was the one area where people could have been enticed to get away from the open fireplace and use enclosed stoves. The provision of advisory services would have helped in this regard. I know it is very expensive to consult heating engineers but in the long term it is well worth while.</P>
    <P>The IIRS do a very worth while job in this regard and I must commend Hotline for the help they give. It is unfortunate that this service is closed for a considerable part of the year. The service is needed all year round. Many people would be building or rebuilding houses in the summertime which is a period when they would want information. Hotline should be available, too, on free phone. This might be considered as another area where help could be given.</P>
    <P>Solid fuel has become very popular on a national scale. On page 84 of the latest statistics from An Foras Forbartha, <i>Private House Building in Ireland, 1976-1983</i>, with regard to central heating details in estate houses it states that solid fuel usage with radiator systems increased from 13 per cent in 1976, to 31 per cent in 1978, to 37 per cent in 1979, to 52 per cent in 1980, to 60 per cent in 1981, to 69 per cent in 1982 and to 75 per cent in 1983. There was a steady increase all the way.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, I spoke about natural gas. It appears that the sulphur dioxide problem is decreasing because of the increased use of natural gas. I understand from the newspapers that the life expectancy of Kinsale Gas is 20 years. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would give some indication as to what is expected to happen after that 20 year period. Will we be hoping for the miracle of another find and if none materialises, what will then be the situation? From my <Col N="422" /> experience natural gas is very commendable from the point of view of efficiency. We know that no fuel is absolutely free from having some polluting effect. It is nihilistic to argue that we can have absolutely clean air. We can have clean air if we have no industry, no transport, no fireplaces and, above all, if we have no people. All of these cause pollution, people especially. There are many who express the view that this would be a far better country for tourism and for the environment if we had fewer people but we should realise that the country, the environment, the land and everything we have is for the people. It is from that point of view we should proceed.</P>
    <P>Industry is the great pollutor. One cause of the decline in pollution levels in England is the decline in industrial production. As I said on the last occasion, we have the same situation in Dublin. Dublin port is almost free of pollution and has been so for a long time precisely because it is free of industry. I visited the site and examined the situation there when we were dealing with the legislation for the development of Dublin port.</P>
    <P>The Irish coal industry accept that there should be research and that where the conclusions are that coal is a problem, appropriate action should be taken. There should have been a White Paper to allow interested individuals and groups to participate in drafting the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government as a corollary have a duty to consult these people. There was not even a Green Paper in regard to this important matter and the Bill, in reality, was sprung on the people. The coal industry is an important one and it has spent much money. As I said on the last occasion, I appreciate the help I received from the coal industry representatives when they made representations to us.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before the problem regarding car fumes. In this city and all urban areas, cars that are not properly serviced are spewing out poison at a level which is dangerous to those of us breathing in the air. The Bill does nothing regarding this problem. This is unfortunate and it is a serious defect in the Bill. People who do not ensure that their <Col N="423" /> vehicle is in good mechanical condition are polluting our streets. This is a criminal act and yet they remain scot free while a person lighting a fire in a smokeless zone will be committing an offence and will be criminalised for it.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned before that this Bill does not deal with noise control, which is another serious defect. For enjoyment of the environment it is most important that statutory provision be made to control the problem of noise. This is dealt with in &ldquo;The State of the Environment&rdquo;. I shall quote one short paragraph from page 159 in the introduction to the chapter on noise:</P>
    <P>While all noise is sound, not all sound is noise. Sound becomes noise only when the listener finds it objectionable. Noise is a major environmental factor adversely affecting the quality of people's lives. More than that, noise also poses a threat to health, such as impairment of hearing and interference with sleep or with recovery in hospital.</P>
    <P>High urbanisation, high industrialisation and high mobility are major reasons for the continuing increase of noise. Without some controls, noise will increase not only in urban areas, but it will spread to areas where peace and quite are at a premium, such as tourist regions, forests, beaches and residential districts.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, noise pollution has not featured prominently in the ongoing environmental debate. This situation is likely to change because noise levels are increasing and affecting more and more people. However, noise is coming to be recognised as an unjustifiable interference with ordinary human comfort and well-being. In this regard international organisations, in particular the EEC and OECD, are promoting a greater awareness among member countries of the growing problems of noise and of the need for effective measures to mitigate it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in framing this Bill noise control was not included and I <Col N="424" /> would welcome the Minister's assurance to the House that such control will be included. We have an overall serious situation with airborne and disco noise. There are complaints about problems consequent on disco attendance and problems are created because these noises seem to drive young people into a frenzy. Many feel that these youngsters are on a &ldquo;high&rdquo; from which they do not descend perhaps until the following morning. Something could be done about this problem here.</P>
    <P>We also have a problem in some areas with regard to the nuisance caused by smell. In my own town a truck passes by quite regularly loaded with animal products and leaves a smell which is a serious nuisance for hours afterwards. Not alone are tourists affected by this, but also people living and working in the area. It is difficult to have these trucks covered but provision should be made in a Bill of this kind to ensure that trucks transporting products of this nature are properly covered. If necessary grants should be provided for concerns of this kind to have proper trucks.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned many times before crude sewage from this city being diverted out to Dublin Bay, causing a serious environmental problem. The Minister could also include some provision in the Bill to deal with this serious problem.</P>
    <P>The pollution caused by smoke and so on follow on the energy situation. Conservation is very necessary and the Government are not doing nearly enough in this regard. There is potential from solar energy, wave energy and air energy and we have slipped up in all those areas. Solar energy in this country is negligible. Some years ago kits were available in builders' providers to be erected on the roofs of buildings but due to the low demand I do not think it is possible to get these any more.</P>
    <P>I have referred many times in this House to the potential of air energy. Indeed, anybody who visited the energy exhibition at Milton Keynes of a few weeks past would realise the importance of heat conservation and the landscaping <Col N="425" /> of shrubs and trees to give shelter to houses and other developments. A considerable amount of money is being spent on publicity. There should be some attempt to do likewise in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 14 of the Bill, the home should be inviolate. Section 14 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), an authorised person shall, for any purpose connected with this Act, be entitled, at all reasonable times, to enter into any premises and to bring therein such other persons or equipment as he may consider necessary for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Personal liberty is the great privilege of a democracy, and I do not agree with that section.</P>
    <P>Traffic in the Dublin region causes a very serious pollution problem even though it is ameliorated because of the recession and no growth, but with new growth it will become a very urgent problem again. Serious consideration should be given to non-polluting transport such as an underground railway system. This is under serious discussion at present so I will not develop it any further. An underground railway system would give work; it would revitalise the city centre; it would reduce the sense of isolation in suburbs, particularly in Tallaght. From Tallaght to the centre of the city a link could be provided to the DART. CIE have plans for this and are buying up land off Dame Street. All this should be approached in broad terms because there are many benefits.</P>
    <P>To single out the domestic hearth as being the cause of the problem is grossly unreasonable. When the Minister introduced the Bill she gave a very balanced speech on it. Those involved in the coal industry have been very open and anxious to co-operate and would still like to talk with environmentalist groups. Perhaps the Minister feels some benefit would be gained from that. A total ban on coal sales in Dublin would cost hundreds of jobs, at least 600 directly in the coal industry, and as many again in selective jobs. It would cause extreme hardship. <Col N="426" /> Hypothermia deaths occur disproportionately in smokeless zone areas. In cold weather more people die from hypothermia than ever died from smoke. I believe coroners are unwilling to report deaths as having been caused by hypothermia because they feel they are making a social comment.</P>
    <P>The report on acid rain is very comprehensive and it is appropriate that it should come before the House at this time. Looking at the list of members of the joint committee I see that the late Deputy Cathal Coughlan was a member. I lament his untimely passing and say sincerely, ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <P>I protest that the Department of Energy did not send a representative to a meeting of the sub-committee. There is no reason given but on page 2 a short paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy declined to send representatives to a meeting of the Sub-Committee. The Joint Comittee wishes to express its regret at this development in view of the longstanding mutual working arrangements the Joint Committee has fostered with Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Why did the Department of Energy not send a representative to meet the sub-committee? This House is entitled to know the reason. Last week with other Members I deplored the fact that the editor of a Sunday paper would not attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights but it is far more deplorable that Government Department would not co-operate with this important committee. I would like the Minister in replying to this debate to comment on that aspect.</P>
    <P>It appears that acid rain is not a major problem here and neither is it a problem to which this country is contributing in any great measure, yet throughout the country I hear reports of ancient monuments, Celtic crosses for example, in exposed areas where serious deterioration has been observed over the last number of years. Many people feel this could be attributed to acid rain, but from <Col N="427" /> my reading of this report it would appear that this is not so.</P>
    <P>I agree with the conclusion of the committee that this country should co-operate with the EC directives. In conclusion, I will read out a very brief paragraph from page 58 of the report:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee feels that Ireland has a duty to the citizens of the Community not to contribute to atmospheric pollution. Countries such as Denmark and Germany are making serious efforts to deal with acid rain. Our best protection against the threat of transboundary pollution from mainland Europe is to comply fully with all the Community measures on air pollution when implemented and to insist that all Member States, particularly the UK, do likewise.</P>
    <P>In order that we would be in a position to insist that other members play their part, we in turn should play ours.</P>
    <P>I welcome this comprehensive Bill, despite the shortcomings I have mentioned. It could be considered major legislation. I hope it will have the effect which some people think it will have. I hope that when we come to Committee Stage, the Minister will agree to include some amendments and to include some other areas which will only enhance the Bill, for example with regard to noise control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, on a comprehensive and clear presentation to this House some months ago on the introduction of this legislation. In a 21 page document, the Minister set out extremely clearly all aspects relating to the need for the legislation and went into great detail with regard to the various items and matters in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point, we are talking about the environment as a resource. The environment is made up of rain, soil and air. We must recognise that these various components are affected by developments in society and in business and by developments generally. The very fact that <Col N="428" /> human beings exist means that there is an infringement into these areas of environment. Obviously with an increase in the population in the world, with greater organisation and more technology there will be greater pressures on environmental areas. It would be ludicrous on the part of anybody to suggest that modern situations do not require up-to-date legislation the same as they require up-to-date practices in other ways. That, as I perceive it, is the background. We must recognise that times are changing and that therefore there is a need for a change in legislation also.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out the need for a balanced approach in regard to environmental control. Other Senators have referred to that already. A balanced approach is what is required. Nowhere is this more important than in relation to the development of industry and employment, whether agricultural-based or otherwise. It must be accepted that it is not possible to have perfectly clean air. There is a trade-off between an acceptable quality of air and an acceptable volume of industrial and commercial progress and employment. That is one of the facts of life that must be accepted and understood fully. Those who ignore that fact are, in my view, closing their eyes to reality. An old saying attributed to a Kerryman is that you cannot live on scenery. It is true that modern science and modern progress have brought in their wake, and will continue to bring in their wake, certain side effects that need attention from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred specifically in her speech &mdash; and this is an issue that is also outlined clearly in the Bill &mdash; to the question of the burning of straw. Reference was made in the Bill to the need for control in this area. Even on this issue the question of a proper balance must be considered. For example, we must examine the question of the incidence of excessive straw burning in rural Ireland. The question we might ask ourselves is whether it is really such a problem as to warrant legislative intervention. For many farmers the burning of straw is the most efficient method of disposing of an <Col N="429" /> unwanted by-product of their agricultural activities. Additional costs will be imposed where we unnecessarily restrict this practice. Given the pressures which the Irish agricultural community already face, the question may well be asked as to whether the prohibition of the burning of straw is an appropriate response to that problem. I take straw as an example of general disposal matters in farm activities because straw is mentioned specifically. There are a number of other matters also such as burning of waste from fences that may be cut down, the burning of rushes from low-lying land and various other things of a waste nature that would necessitate disposal in a manner similar to the burning of straw.</P>
    <P>While the intention of the Minister is that there be a broad and correct approach to this matter and that nobody would be unduly penalised, an over-zealous official from the Department of the Environment could find it possible to impose very unjust and severe penalties on individual farmers and persons who might be seen to violate this part of the Bill. It is for that reason that I intend, on Committee Stage, to introduce certain amendments that I hope the Minister will agree with and which I do not think will significantly change matters but at the same time will provide a safeguard for people who could otherwise be in a very awkward position. For example, if it is decided to prohibit the burning of straw we must ask how the law is to be enforced? The law presumably can only be enforced where there has been a continuous episode of straw burning in a particular region or locality. Obviously if one precludes the disposal of straw by means of burning one is entitled to ask what alternative there might be for getting rid of a by-product such as straw.</P>
    <P>Straw is recognised as a form of biomass which could be used in power stations to generate electricity. One could justifiably ask whether thought could be given to the setting up of a State agency to use straw along these lines.</P>
    <P>These kinds of issues would demonstrate a fairly complex situation. It may be something to which there is an easy <Col N="430" /> and simple answer. At the same time all those areas need to be explored. There is the long-established tradition of the burning of heather and gorse. This is a form of control sanctified, as it were, by long usage. It has its positive as well as its negative aspects. The process of burning, as we know, enriches the soil and renders fields more fertile, apart altogether from being a highly efficient method of controlling the spread of unwanted gorse and waste material generally. It is reasonable to assume that urban dwellers may be offended by the burning of gorse, straw and other materials of that sort, but there are sound agricultural reasons for farmers opting for this method of disposal and control. We are not only talking about disposal, we are also talking about controlling gorse and the growth of other unwanted vegetation. This must be borne in mind. For that reason the State and the Minister acting for the State in this instance through this Bill should move with the necessary caution.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects with regard to the matter of straw which one could talk about, but I do not think it necessary to do so. The burning of straw is confined essentially in this country along a line from County Louth along the eastern seaboard to County Wexford and the extent of it inland is to a depth of one or two counties. It is more substantial in a few counties, but the total area in any year will be perhaps 20,000 acres. We are talking about the burning of winter cereal straw, so about 20,000 acres is the amount of straw burning that we are talking about. Obviously, in years of scarcity of roughage like last year, little or no straw was burned because it was a valuable product and not something to be disposed of in this way.</P>
    <P>With greater intensity of farming, if farmers are to maximise EC benefits in the best possible way they are expected to double and treble their output. For that reason they have no choice but to have fairly substantial amounts of this product to dispose of. Rather than straw, gorse or other waste materials to which I have referred burning and being a threat <Col N="431" /> to the environment, they would be a greater threat to hedgerows and plantations and the like. That aspect should be monitored carefully.</P>
    <P>A great deal more can be said about that, but I would like to say a word of caution to the Minister on this question of straw burning. It has wider ramifications altogether than just the disposal of straw, whether it be 20,000 acres or whatever. Its ramifications could affect the disposal generally in farms, and I submit it would have little effect on polluting the atmosphere. Preventing persons doing this sort of thing could be very serious for the individuals concerned and could be very costly.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many aspects to which one would like to draw attention. One that strikes one readily is the fact that some figures are not as up to date as they might be particularly as they relate to the Dublin area which is probably the most important area in regard to air pollution. About one third of our population reside there. The figures for Dublin Corporation, if brought up to date, would be of enormous help.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very important and no effort must be spared on the part of all concerned whether it be a corporation authority, county council or whatever, to ensure that whatever data are needed are made available to those who will assimilate them in the correct manner. I have mentioned Dublin. It is encouraging to know that the quality of air in the greater Dublin area has improved dramatically over the past year. It is important that we recognise this point and identify with it. Smoke levels during last winter were 60 per cent below the EC limit values and the number of local excedents was reduced to two in the Ballyfermot area where it is understood domestic smoke may be the source of the problem. I mention that because Ballyfermot has been highlighted in the past in this context. That sort of scenario would throw some doubt on the sometimes very exaggerated type of comment from certain environmentalists in relation to the quality of Dublin's air. The reasons the quality of <Col N="432" /> Dublin's air has improved are complex. They include a decline in industrial activity in Dublin to some extent which obviously is to be regretted. They include a spread of the population from the inner city to the outer peripheral areas of Dublin, in other words, the suburban areas of the city, and that is a move forward.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is also the whole question of the choice of fuels. Now a wider choice of fuel is available to people, and that is important. Also in conjunction with the question of fuel there has been a great advance in greater efficiency in fuel burning appliances which means less and less waste material emanating from the various burning appliances.</P>
    <P>It could be asked whether the powers given under section 14, to which Senator Fitzsimons referred, to local government inspectors are correct. I tend to the view that probably they are going a little too far and perhaps overstep certain rights of individuals. I agree also that old people, young children or whoever should not be forced into having to supply information from time to time if they are accosted for it.</P>
    <P>Another report we are asked to comment on is the report of the joint committee on acid rain which is taken in conjunction with this legislation on air pollution. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am particularly concerned about the contribution of acid rain to air pollution and the consequent damage to our natural environment through precipitation. I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities who prepared the report on acid rain which is before us in association with the Air Pollution Bill. I expressed my deep concern about this matter in the course of our committee debates. While I am reminded of it by my colleague, Senator Fitzsimons, let me also pay tribute to my colleague on that committee, now departed, the late Deputy Cathal Coughlan. His contribution to the work of that committee was very substantial indeed and we regret his passing very much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> Acid rain is caused mainly by emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides which are produced by the burning of fossil fuels especially coal and oil in power stations, industrial plants, motor vehicles and domestic heating appliances. These constituents react with moisture to produce, in effect, a diluted solution of sulphuric and nitric acids which may have severe effects on the environment receiving such rainfall.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems associated with acid rain is trans-boundary importation and exportation, in other words, the whole question of the flow by winds of the acid in the atmosphere. This has the effect of making some countries such as the Scandinavian countries net importers and countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy net exporters of sulphur dioxide. The impact of acid rain on natural and built environments has been devastating. Lakes become acidified, killing off fish and stocks. Forests have been devastated. Let me state at this point that we do not have a major problem with regard to acid rain. What I am talking about is the general effect acid rain in large quantities could have on the environment. I am not referring to this in so far as people might perceive it as something relating to an Irish scene. Agricultural crops can be affected through dry deposition of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Wild life is also threatened by acid rain as habitats change and acid sensitive species give way to acid tolerant ones.</P>
    <P>The most challenging threat of all of acid rain is that posed to human health through contamination of drinking water. The ravages of acid rain are manifested by the damage it has inflicted on many of our public buildings throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to trans-boundary air pollution is not significant but that does not mean we should be complacent about it. I was saying a moment ago that we do not have a problem of any consequence in this regard. Nevertheless we must guard against ever having a problem bordering on what I am referring to.</P>
    <P>The newly commissioned electricity <Col N="434" /> generating station at Moneypoint is the main focus of attention at the moment. Our committee &mdash; the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities &mdash; received conflicting evidence from the ESB and environmentalists about the possible consequences of emissions from Moneypoint. The cost of bringing Moneypoint into line with the proposed Council Directive on the limitations of emissions of pollutants into the air from large combustion plants could have serious consequences for electricity charges. On the other hand, economic growth must not ignore the consequences for our physical environment. Nobody in their sane senses could support and condone a suggestion that economic progress should supersede the general quality of life and the general wellbeing of the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The joint committee, in their report, endeavoured to reconcile these opposite concepts. We must take a long term view of environmental protection and not subordinate it to short term economic gain. In the European Community the importance of the environment has been formally acknowledged through the inclusion of a special subsection relating to it in the recent single European Act which incorporates amendments to the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>While the joint committee were critical of the ESB's reluctance to install flue gas desulphurisation plant nevertheless they acknowledged the board's sterling record on environmental protection. The pumped storage station at Turlough Hill in County Wicklow is good evidence of this. It would be a tragedy if at this stage the situation at Moneypoint were to spoil this fine track record. I urge the board to consider carefully the joint committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In view of the social costs of atmospheric pollution, the joint committee made proposals as to how the costs of the installation to which I referred, FGD could be modified for the ESB, for example, with partial Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>We must not ignore the effects of low level polluting agents such as cars and <Col N="435" /> domestic fires. In the report of the joint committee we recommend grant aid for natural gas conversion for private homes and industry. I do not want to talk for too long about the joint committee's report because the purpose of the joint committee is to short circuit detailed discussions on these matters.</P>
    <P>I want to make reference to a recommendation in the report. I would like careful consideration to be given to the entire report. I recommend the report to those persons who may not have had an opportunity to examine it in detail. It is appropriate when talking about this report that I should place on record our appreciation in particular of the work of Senator Mary Robinson who put so much effort into the preparation of that report on acid rain and piloted it through the committee through many stormy and difficult sessions.</P>
    <P>The Air Pollution Bill we are discussing here today in conjunction with the report on acid rain is a very comprehensive measure to provide a modern legislative framework for the control of air pollution in order to meet the requirements of EC Directives. More than that, it is an effort to protect ourselves against problems caused by modern science, technology and development. What is envisaged in this Bill gives significant power to local authorities with regard to air quality. I have no hesitation in supporting very fully what is put forward in that Bill, with some minor modifications. I believe that should be the view of this assembly.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few general remarks. We should look at the background. It was not, as we know, until after World War II that people became seriously concerned about the effect air pollution might have on health and the environment. The 1952 smog in London is the most quoted example of a severe air pollution episode when levels of air pollution contributed to over 4,000 excess deaths in that year from bronchitis, pneumonia and related diseases.</P>
    <P>The 1957 Clean Air Act in the United Kingdom has brought about a reduction <Col N="436" /> of smoke and sulphur dioxide to acceptable levels in most areas. There are two main types of emissions which are relevant and can be described under the headings of stationary and mobile emissions. The stationary sources are domestic, commercial, industrial buildings and power generating stations. Mobile sources would include aeroplanes, rail transportation, vehicles, road and maritime transport. Emissions can also be classified as natural or manmade. Natural sources would include wild fires, decomposition of organic matters, denitrification of fertilisers, sea spray and wind blown dust. Manmade sources would include combustion mining, quarrying, chemical and industrial processing and nuclear reactors.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to refer to the effects of air pollution in a broad way. The kinds of effects known and suspected to be produced by air pollution can be grouped under three general headings: first, material damage meaning direct damage to structural metals, secondly, surface coatings, fabrics and other materials and, thirdly, a frequent and widespread effect of air pollution. The damage may be in the form of weight loss, loss in strength, fading, discoloration, loss of gloss, cracking and so on.</P>
    <P>Agricultural damage is attributable to a large number of food, forage and ornamental crops which have been shown to be susceptible to air pollutants in other countries. Examples of damage range from various types of leaf damage, stunting of growth, decreased size and yield of fruits to destruction of flowers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the health effects on humans, air pollution can produce fatalities particularly in population subgroups at risk such as the very young, the old and those with pre-existing chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disease.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what are the major air pollutants. There has been reference in the House on quite a number of occasions to that of smoke. Smoke comes about from the combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal and peat and particularly <Col N="437" /> from domestic fires but also from industrial, commercial, power generating and transport sources. Sulphur dioxide arises from combustion of sulphur containing fossil fuels, especially oil and coal, smelting of sulphur bearing ores and industrial processes. Hydrocarbons arise from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels such as motor vehicle exhausts and from stationary sources. Carbon monoxide is the result of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels mainly from motor exhausts but also from domestic fires. Cigarette smoke can give a high concentration of carbon monoxide indoors. Nitrogen oxides are relevant in this context and arise from motor vehicle exhausts, high temperature stationary combustions, atmospheric reactions, such as lightning and volcanic activity. Indoor sources include smoking and gas-fired appliances. Lead is another pollutant, added as tetraethyl lead to petrol to improve petrol quality, not an uncommon occurrence, and expelled from engines when that fuel is burned. It arises also from dust, lead and paint. I am talking about excesses in these various areas of pollution where it is most important that there be greater efficiency and thus less danger of pollution.</P>
    <P>I have a lot of statistics with which I do not intend to bore the House except to demonstrate that sulphur dioxide, smoke and nitrogen oxides increased by 30 per cent, 9 per cent and 25 per cent respectively between 1972 and 1979. It is encouraging to note that such emission levels fell between the years 1980 and 1983, with the exception of smoke. Over the same period there was an overall increase in emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. The value of 500 tonnes per year given for lead emissions related only to that emitted from petrol-driven vehicles. Data on industrial emissions are not available. The trend in sulphur dioxide emissions was determined largely by the demand for fuel oil in the power sector. In the case of smoke, the major factor was the level of consumption of solid fuel in the domestic sector. Road vehicles contributed a significant proportion of the total emissions of carbon <Col N="438" /> monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. I do not propose to dwell on the various comparisons made with many other countries.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should examine the legislation existing here relevant to the various areas of pollution to which I have referred. For example, there is the Alkali Works Regulations Act 1906. The provisions of that Act deal with emissions from specified industrial and chemical processes named in the Act which give rise to noxious or offensive gases. Special limits for acid emissions are laid down in a few instances. In general, the Act requires that the best practicable means must be used to minimise harmful emissions. All works named in the Act require annual registration with the Department of the Environment. There are also the control of atmospheric pollution regulations, 1970. These regulations, made under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1962 and which came into operation in January 1972 restrict from fixed installations, excluding private dwellings, smoke of varying degrees of darkness and dust, grit, gas or fumes. These regulations set limits on the length of time during which dark or black smoke &mdash; as determined using a Ringlemann Smoke Chart &mdash; may be permitted from premises other than private dwellings. It should be noted that those regulations apply to smoke and other emissions from the curtilage or gardens of private dwellings and to buildings containing several private dwellings, having a furnace exceeding a certain capacity. I should say that the regulations are enforced by the sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>There was then the Local Government (Planning and Development Acts) 1963 to 1983. The planning Acts provide a statutory pollution control mechanism of a general nature. Conditions for the control of pollution may be attached to planning permissions for development. Conditions may also be imposed in the interests of avoiding or reducing air pollution from existing uses of land. The issue of compensation may arise in the latter case. The 1976 Act provides that an application involving a development <Col N="439" /> for the purposes of any trade or industry which would emit polluting substances and cost more than £5 million must be accompanied by a study of the environmental implications of the development. Then there were the 1963 regulations regarding the construction, equipment and use of vehicles. These regulations were made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and provide &mdash; in respect of the maintenance of vehicles &mdash; that every vehicle shall be maintained in such a condition that there will not be emitted any smoke, visible vapour, grit, sparks, ashes, cinders or oil substances and that reasonable steps should be taken to prevent damage to persons or property as a result of such emissions. Enforcement of the Act is the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In addition, EC Directives relating to air quality apply as follows &mdash; I will give a synopsis: the EC directive on air quality limit values and guide values for sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates over annual winter and daily sampling periods; the limit values which became mandatory from 1 April 1983 are based on the World Health Organisation findings of dose-effect relationships between the two pollutants taken together. An EC Directive adopted in 1975 restricts the sulphur content of gas oils, used in domestic and small boilers, to be consumed in member states. An EC Directive adopted in June 1978 restricts the lead content of petrol. However, Ireland obtained a derogation until 1986. This was waived with the introduction of the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1982, which brought Ireland in line with the levels applicable to other EC member states.</P>
    <P>The EC is currently examining the implications of further reductions leading possibly to the elimination of lead in petrol. Under an EC Directive adopted in 1982 air quality standards for lead were set and member states were asked to take measures to ensure that five years after notification of the directive the concentrations should not be greater than the limit set. As of now, the EC has not <Col N="440" /> adopted air quality standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides in general, although a draft directive on air quality standards has been adopted in principle.</P>
    <P>I referred to many of these Acts and directives to highlight the fact that there is an awareness in this country, in Europe and in other parts of the world of the dangers and hazards of air pollution, including acid rain. What we are talking about today is a clear updating of regulations, legislation and so on. We should realise that progress, whether in industry, agriculture or any other sector brings with it certain responsibilities. If we ignore those responsibilities we will be doing so at our peril, particularly in the longer term. It is very irresponsible of anybody, particularly Governments, to ignore the effects of pollution on the quality of life in the long term. In my estimation, there is nothing that needs protecting and guarding so much as the quality of life. In this context we are talking about the quality of the atmosphere, keeping the atmosphere, water, rivers and so on, free and clean.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to say that perhaps we have a problem in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other larger centres of population but generally speaking, we do not have a major air pollution problem and we must keep it that way. Speakers have referred to the serious situation in Dublin. Frankly, conditions in Dublin could be improved but I would not classify them as being extremely serious. I know air pollution is caused by a high volume of traffic, industrial development and so on and we must take all the appropriate steps not just to legislate for these things but to make sure that the appropriate control mechanisms are established. When new technology is being implemented we must ensure that we have a clear and definite way to dispose of any extra pollutant that comes into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there is a point to which I would like to make a very special reference and that is subsections 39 (2) and (3) of the Bill. I will discuss this further on Committee Stage. I suggest <Col N="441" /> that under section 39 an effort should be made to identify the source of the pollutant. In my view, the effect of those addenda would be to require local authorities to identify clearly the source of the pollutant rather than to respond in a very generalised way. In my opinion, one of our greatest problems at present is the identification of the pollutant, in other words, the offending party, must be always clearly identified. There is no point in our making efforts to solve a problem if we cannot identify what is causing the problem.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on a very lucid presentation but I urge that a certain amount of caution be exercised to ensure that what is being introduced is correct, is warranted, is workable and, above all, is something that will solve a problem. That is extremely important. We should not hide or run away from something that may happen in the future but within the framework of this legislation we should attempt to solve potential difficulties that could arise in the future.</P>

      <P>There was a song in &ldquo;Hair&rdquo;, a rather risqué musical of the sixties, the first line of which was &ldquo;Hello carbon monoxide, welcome sulphur dioxide, the air, the air is everywhere.&rdquo; It was something of a chant at that time particularly as the United States of America had suffered enormously through air and water pollution and the pop and rock songs of the time came back to this theme again and again. I am in a rather unusual position here. I can usually stand a safe distance back from whatever is the establishment, point a finger at them and denounce them with great delight but I am not in that comfortable position at present. My profession outside this House is that of a chemical engineer and because in that profession I educate and train people, or participate in their education and training in a small way, who become the operatives, technicians and managers of large-scale chemical process plants, I am in the position of being to a certain extent part of the establishment in this issue. My <Col N="442" /> discomfort, in which no doubt the Leas-Chathaoirleach will take great delight, is going to be obvious in what I have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pollution and the whole question of our environment runs up against the macho attitude. It is a bit like safety in industry, it is a bit like cigarette smoking. There is a sense in which you must pretend that it is only people with a slightly dubious attitude to life generally who get themselves worked up about environmental matters. The word &ldquo;freak&rdquo; is very easily stuck on the word &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; in the eyes of many people and yet it is inextricably linked with a view of ourselves and it is something that we do far too much in this country, and that is to apologise for our own uniqueness and our own individuality.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that both in the report of the joint committee and in much that has been said there is a presumption that there has to be some degree of tradeoff between industrial development and high quality environmental protection. I challenge those who say that to produce the evidence that there is any country in the world which has stifled industrial development because they went too far in the direction of environmental protection or to produce any correlation between the level of economic achievement of countries and the degree to which they have been prepared to sacrifice their environment.</P>
      <P>I do not believe, for example, that the countries of Scandinavia, which have incidentally vastly more successful economies than that of our nearest neighbour and have had so for the last 40 years, have anything like the scale of air pollution that is regarded as acceptable and tolerable in the United Kingdom. They have managed to achieve extraordinarily high levels of economic development hand-in-hand with an obsessive concern for the quality of the environment, not just of air but of water and indeed the visual quality and the human quality of the urban environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> Pollution and the whole issue of the environment is not just a question of measuring the concentrations of a long list of more or less toxic substances in the atmosphere or of measuring the concentration of another list of equally more or less toxic substances in our water supplies. It is a whole philosophy of how we relate to the world in which we live. There are assumptions being made about a correlation between the sacrifice we will have to make in terms of our environment and the jobs we can create.</P>
    <P>There are large areas of pollution-free industries that are available to us. There are many areas of high technology in which the environmental impact, other than of a visual kind, will be minimal. There is also the fact that when you talk about costs you must not just talk about the cost on an individual enterprise because there is also the cost to the community in terms of health and of a general sense of well-being. We have a State-sponsored Health Education Bureau publicising with great effect and, I hope with great success the idea of a person's sense of well-being, of health being much more than the absence of illness while, at the same time, the health of many people in large cities although it may not constitute illness is seriously and deleteriously affected by the air they breathe and by the presence in their lives of various artifical substances whether they be in the form of pollutants or in the form of additives to their food or additives to their drinking water and so on.</P>
    <P>Referring to the whole question of environmental protection does not mean we are set against growth. It is not a question of the good people who like to live in a nice, clean, green Ireland setting themselves up against industry. It is possible for industry and for all forms of industry to conform to standards. It is equally possible for industry to operate without standards. The Bhopal disaster in India is a classic case of an extreme deviation from standards tolerated because of the extreme conditions of a particular country. It is unquestionably <Col N="444" /> true that if the Bhopal disaster had happened either in western Europe or North America every single plant producing what was produced in Bhopal and every single process related to it would have closed down instantaneously and would not have been allowed to reopen. It is a tragedy of life that the value of human life depends on whose life is lost and where it is lost.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of the New Right assault in economics on what we would have regarded as the consensus on these matters until recently has been under the flag of deregulation. Deregulation is dressed up to mean getting these nasty bureaucrats off the backs of these fine hard-working entrepreneurs who want to create jobs for other people. This image of the altruistic entrepreneur is difficult to sustain but it is nevertheless an image which is presented to us very often. Deregulation has become the order of the day and prominent Irish academic economists, who I am beginning to believe have shares in the national broadcasting service considering the frequency with which the same five or six allegedly independent commentators surface, have written about deregulation not just in terms of reducing the numbers of forms people have to fill &mdash; a perfectly healthy objective and one that is more than worthy of attention by the Department of the Environment. In my own experience the amount of paperwork involved in the simple process of building a house extension astonished me, just because I wanted to cover up a drain of three feet. People may argue that large-scale environmental protection is impossible because of shortage of staff, but apparently I am not going to be allowed to pollute my backyard or half a dozen senior officials of Cork Corporation will be accountable to somebody. I never understood why so much paperwork should be involved.</P>
    <P>I fully sympathise with anybody who says deregulation means reducing paperwork but that is not the same thing as what is being argued. What is being argued is that somehow there is a correlation between lowering standards and <Col N="445" /> increasing economic activity, that there is a correlation between reducing planning controls in industry and economic activity, that there is a correlation between reducing the detail of safety regulation within industry and economic activity and there is a correlation between the reduction of environmental protection regulations and the performance of industry. There are senior people in the current United States Administration who are publicly hostile to the whole area of environmental protection by the federal authorities on the grounds that it is holding back economic development.</P>
    <P>This is not only destructive and potentially destructive of our environment and of the quality of industry but it is also wrong. The profession to which I am attached has long argued &mdash; and this may surprise people &mdash; that in terms of the safe operation of a large chemical industry high standards of safety produce high standards of efficiency which in turn produce high standards of profits. The occasional short term, short cut profits made from poorly run, unsafe, polluting chemical industries are rarely of any long term benefit and often explode in the face of the earner of the profit.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that there is some conflict between the quality of our environment as standards demand a standard of response which will determine the quality of the industries we want. If we choose to work on this idea of the minimum standard tolerable at the time we will get minimal standard industries with minimal standards of technology at high levels of environmental threat.</P>
    <P>We are not so impoverished that we need to destroy that which makes this country so much better to live in than many other countries in Europe. It was a revelation of our own lack of self confidence that when a recent study by an American academic was published about the relative enjoyment of living in various countries, and when we were placed eighth in the world, well ahead of the United States and the United Kingdom but considerably behind a number of Scandanavian and European countries, <Col N="446" /> the response of our media was astonishment.</P>
    <P>This was because we have convinced ourselves that we are in the worst country in Europe with a whole host of problems which bear no comparison to those of anybody else. Speaking as one who lives outside this dreadfully overgrown capital city, I say that we have an enormous amount that is worthwhile in our environment. The region in which I live is well developed in terms of quality of environment and of lifestyle. It is not something we should give away easily or cheaply. It should not be argued away on the basis of relative measures of short term cost to one or two major stage utilities. It is not that sort of an issue, but an issue about the choice we want to make about our future environment.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that if we impose higher standards we will, therefore, reduce the number of jobs. I see from the Department of Industry and Commerce, in terms of the draft directive of the European Community, that if you put up costs you affect competitiveness and lose jobs. That simplistic correlation is a collection of nonsense of the first magnitude. If that were the case, Switzerland would be the least developed country in the world and India would be the most developed because the Swiss have very high costs and wages and the Indians have the opposite. The idea that the price of products alone determines competitiveness is a gross travesty of the truth. Once you move away from the idea that pure simple price determines competitiveness, then the whole question of the relative cost of environmental protection takes on a totally new perspective. This is not Brendan Ryan's eccentric theory. Anybody who wants to read the OECD's report on innovation in Ireland will see that they make precisely the same point &mdash; that competitiveness in the future is not simply a matter of producing cheap goods, that it is a question of quality, innovation, attention to consumers' needs, a follow up of support of marketing and so on. It is possible to sell goods at a higher price <Col N="447" /> than the competitor in terms of the quality of the goods, of their reliability and of the follow up to them.</P>
    <P>This idea that all we have to do is make sure that everything that we produce here is cheaper than in other countries and that then it will sell is arrant nonsense advocated by people who have, incidentally, a far more rigidly ideological view of the world than anybody I know operating in what can be euphemistically called the Irish Left. That is the only way to explain the simplistic argument foisted upon us about competitiveness and which is at the centre of many of the arguments about our electricity costs. I do not accept a large part of the argument about the apparent enormous cost the ESB expect that the proper regulation of emissions from their generating stations will put on us. The presumption that that, therefore, means we will lose jobs because of higher prices may be true of specific industries but it is not necessarily true on a grand scale. The one quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> is a plant in Limerick. Many people argue that it might be a huge investment but the net value added within the Irish economy of many of these large scale multinationals is quite small.</P>
    <P>In terms of an engineering approach dealing with any particular hazard, whether to the environment, the individual working in the plant or to people living around the plant, there are three levels on which it should be dealt. It is frequently forgotten that the best way to deal with the hazard is to eliminate it completely. It is worth mentioning that the ESB have attempted to do that by changing the quality of coal they are using in Moneypoint but they have no guarantee that that will be successful. The second is by controlling that hazard and I hope we will succeed in doing so. The third is the extreme case of certain streets in Japan where people have to have breathing apparatus supplied to them &mdash; that is on the level of personal protection. If we intend to protect our environment and ourselves from environmental pollution we have to know what we are talking about and the standards within which we <Col N="448" /> are operating. Consequently, I am always astonished by statements that things are absolutely safe or the even more sweeping assertion that because something is not proven to be hazardous, therefore, we must assume it is not hazardous.</P>
    <P>In terms of human health, whether we are talking about toxic substances or air pollution, we do not have a satisfactory way of forecasting, with any degree of reliability, what damage a particular substance may do. We cannot really carry out experiments on human beings on a scale to see how many will die. We can carry out experiments on mice and rats to see if 50 per cent are dead in a week's time. That gives an indication of the relative degree of damage of different concentrations of toxic substances. However, we cannot do anything like that with human beings. Therefore, we are left with epidemiology studies with large groups of people over a long period of time. However, the problem with that approach is that you are effectively counting bodies. In other words, we discover that something is pollutant or dangerous because people die and that certain levels produce death. We can carry out tests on animals, on micro-organisms, or on volunteers but we are always left with a degree of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Toxic substances were tested on animals and found to be safe but turned out to be carcinogenic on humans. There is no absolute level of safety. The classic example of the fundamental flaw in this whole issue has been the nuclear argument, that because the nuclear industry was so safe unthinkable accidents could never happen.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of politics, it is a question of fact that there is no such thing as absolute safety. Therefore, to say that a hazard is not proven and to use that as an argument for not doing something which has been proven to be necessary in other countries at a later stage in development is illogical and self-contradictory. To the extent that there are accepted standards of what is damaging to health, whether in terms of the concentration of toxic substances within an industrial environment or the concentration within <Col N="449" /> the atmosphere generally, we must remember that every revision of what are regarded as unhealthy concentrations of any noxious substance in the atmosphere has been downwards. Therefore, what is stated to be safe in 1960 may well turn out to be unsafe by 1980. It is in that context that this legislation, as legislation in principle, is most welcome. There is nothing in the legislation except for a rather sweeping provision to invade the privacy of domestic homes in one section. I would like to discuss with the Minister on Committee Stage the necessity for it and particularly the choice of language which leaves an individual with a lot of freedom to decide what is urgent and what is not. By and large, the legislation is most welcome and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Since we are discussing this legislation in the context of the joint committee report on acid rain I would also like to address myself to that issue. The legislation will be as good as the standards we choose to accept and, incidentally, that we choose to enforce. There is an increasing view that it does not matter that standards are set because they are rarely enforced, whether they be standards in water pollution, in driving &mdash; as Senator Daly will raise later on this evening &mdash; or in many other things. It is one thing to set standards, but we have to have a will to enforce them. There cannot be nods, winks and indications that because a particular process provides jobs or is a contributor to the local economy we will not enforce the regulations. Consequently, if we are to have this kind of legislation we must have the resources to ensure that it is implemented. We must have the technical skills to ensure that it is implemented and we must be sure that those who are given the job of enforcing these regulations are independent and are not in any way open to influence by bodies which might have different motives or interests in mind. The great quality of the Garda &mdash; and I say this as one who has been a rather frequent critic of theirs in the past &mdash; is that they operate by and large with considerable independence and integrity in deciding how and where the law should be enforced. If <Col N="450" /> we are to introduce air pollution legislation, as we now intend to do, it will only be as good as the standards we choose and the commitment we are prepared to make to its enforcement.</P>
    <P>We could talk about the different contributors to air pollution. I do not want to because it has been done a few times since this debate opened. It is undoubtedly true, as Senator Fitzsimons pointed out, that we will not be addressing the problem of air pollution until we do something about emissions from car engines and other engines. As many people have pointed out, the State transport services, particularly in Dublin city, do not set a good example to the rest of the community. I hope we will hear shortly about controls on emissions from cars. I hope also that the question of regulation of domestic fuel consumption will not be avoided. It may be difficult but it is equally necessary. We have to deal with the two major problems of sulphur dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen. In the context of the problem that confronts us and Europe at present, I want to talk a little about sulphur dioxide.</P>
    <P>I do not know how people formed the impression that science can give absolute answers and that if you wait long enough science will give you an answer. Science does no more than measure what happens. It sets up experiments to compare what happens under one set of circumstances with what happens under another set of circumstances. It is not surprising that people have not yet produced scientific evidence which has persuaded people unequivocally that sulphur dioxide emissions are connected with acid rain problems in Europe. Neither does it surprise me that the loudest arguers against the thesis that sulphur dioxide emissions in some countries are the cause of acid rain in other countries are those who have the largest emissions of sulphur dioxide and that the strongest arguers on the other side are those who perceive themselves to be suffering most from sulphur dioxide emissions or from acid rain. Ultimately, we cannot wait for somebody out there, i.e. the scientist, to give us an unequivocal answer. We did not get it on <Col N="451" /> nuclear power and we have never got it on environmental issues generally. We have to make our own choices and decisions. It is in that context that we have to look at the ESB and in particular the Moneypoint generating station.</P>
    <P>The ESB have produced arguments on their own behalf to justify the non-provision of proper sulphur dioxide removal plant in that process. They have a number of arguments, some to do with dilution factors and others with the current degree of sulphur dioxide pollution of the atmosphere. The one that frightened most people is the figure they produced of £400 million to fit the necessary equipment. Again, I have to counsel caution because the ESB &mdash; and I do not hold it against them; in fact, I have a fairly high view of the ESB &mdash; have made mistakes before. The ESB had us very close to an irreversible commitment to building a large nuclear power generating plant in the Minister's own constituency, indeed, in the Minister's own backyard almost. I do not think anybody was aware of it at the time, but they were probably going to have to build two because it is almost an axiom that you must have spare capacity equal to your largest single generating unit in case that one fails. Therefore, since the nuclear power plant was going to be by far the most powerful you would have to have two. The ESB convinced large section of Irish society, including a number of Governments and a number of Ministers, that they had absolutely no choice, that nuclear power was cheap and safe, and that we would need it by about 1985 or 1986 or definitely by 1990.</P>
    <P>They were wrong. They were wrong in a number of cases. They were wrong about the safety. They were wrong about the need. They were wrong about the economics because they accepted the economic analysis of the nuclear industry which conveniently left out both the cost of developing nuclear power, including weapons research, and also the later real cost of decommissioning nuclear power plants after 20 years. We have power plants in conventional sectors which are running for a lot longer than 20 years and <Col N="452" /> they will not require security forces to defend them for indefinite periods after they are decommissioned or after they are closed down. The ESB, therefore, are not infallible. When they produce a figure of £400 million and a 20 per cent increase in prices out of thin air, we are entitled to ask: <i>cui bono</i>, to whose benefit is this argument about £400 million?</P>
    <P>It happens to suit the ESB to say £400 million. That is a justification for their argument. It is perfectly possible to specify a particular kind of process to deal with anything involved in the chemical industry. We do not know what assumptions are built in. We do not know what specifications are built in and we do not know what time scale is in mind. It is perfectly possible to generate a figure of £400 million.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that other reputable authorities quote figures which are a fraction of that. It is a bit much to take a capital cost of £400 million and talk about it as if it were a current cost to be stuck on to electricity prices. Capital costs are not paid for in a 12 month period. I do not know the period of time within which the ESB expect to recoup the capital cost of any investment but if it is 12 months, then the ESB must be one of the most productive and efficient industries in the world. I would say three, four or five years. It would be more realistic to spread this exaggerated figure of £400 million over the number of years in which a normal ESB investment is required to pay for itself, or is required to be paid for, as the case may be. In that case, the scare figure of a 20 per cent increase in the cost of electricity comes into a much finer perspective and does not seem nearly as intimidating or overpowering or impossible. I suppose the cost should have been the last matter which I discussed.</P>
    <P>Other arguments are used about sulphur dioxide emissions, not so much to justify the ESB's alleged 50 per cent increase in sulphur dioxide emissions as to justify our derogation from the proposed directive. Many of these arguments are difficult to take seriously. One is that because we are a small country we <Col N="453" /> produce a small amount of pollution and therefore we should be given special conditions. Any unit of population anywhere in Europe could make a similar argument: because they were a small area of population and produced only a small amount of pollution they should be left to their own devices.</P>
    <P>We have currently very low standards of emissions. It is interesting, but nevertheless frightening, that we seem to believe we must wait until we are as polluted as Europe before we start working backwards to where we were before we were polluted. Surely it is a far more practical and sensible objective to decide to avoid exceeding under any circumstances levels which would begin to bring us near European standards of pollution. Because we are situated, by our own good fortune, on the right side of the prevailing winds and, therefore, in terms of imported pollution we will have less of a problem than many other countries does not justify us in saying that what we create will be carried away and, therefore, we need not worry too much about it.</P>
    <P>We must address the question of what are acceptable levels of sulphur dioxide and other emissions in our own atmosphere. They cannot be based on the fact that we are well below other countries' standards because other countries' standards are admitted now by most of them to be far too low. The standards must be based on what we as a community decide are acceptable standards and on what are the real costs, not just for ourselves or for industry, but for the entire community. That includes, incidentally, the entire tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry can well be undermined, because image is as much a part of the tourist industry as reality. This country's image must not change from that of a country with clean air, clean water and a commitment to such matters to a country which has the lowest standards of environmental protection in Europe and which in the words of the Department of Industry and Commerce &ldquo;has made every effort to secure total <Col N="454" /> exemption for Ireland from the provisions of the draft directive&rdquo;. In other words, the rest of Europe believes sulphur dioxide emissions should be reduced to a certain standard; we say we do not want even to meet that standard but we want total exemption. We want to make our own standards.</P>
    <P>That argument is naive in the extreme. It allows certain technical gobbledegook to be generated by certain interest groups to intimidate policy makers. There is no reason why we should not have a highly pollution-free environment with a high level of technological development in the chemical industry area, the electronic industry area, the food industry area, or whatever other area we wish to develop. There is no reason why both cannot be done. It is a question of whether we are willing to set standards and whether the quality of what we produce is saleable on the market place. Therefore, I regret enormously the way in which we seem to have run away from the issue of sulphur dioxide and its damage to our environment. When will we suddenly discover that we need to do something dramatic about sulphur dioxide? When we reach European levels, what will we do then &mdash; bring the levels back down? It becomes ludicrous after a while.</P>
    <P>Other people have recognised the problem. If we cannot accept cut-backs, we can at least say now that there is a limit which we will not tolerate. If there is a limit beyond which we will not go, the solution is not to sit back and wait until we reach the limit and then impose standards. We must impose standards now because we have now reached our limit. It is obvious that we should minimise emissions in the meantime and minimise the risk of reaching that standard.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it is universally true about what are regarded as acceptable standards of pollution and emissions that every time they are revised, they are revised downwards. The fact that we are well below what are regarded as currently acceptable standards may well be as much a reflection on the fact that current standards are too lenient as on any scientific evidence. One cannot produce some <Col N="455" /> sort of comprehensive scientific evidence and say this proves that a certain concentration of sulphur dioxide is safe and this proves that a certain concentration of sulphur dioxide is unsafe. It is not like that and it never can be like that.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Government not to be hypnotized by the ESB's technical gobbledegook into believing some of the things they have said. Having suggested that many of the other arguments about why we should escape from this directive are less than worthy of the Government's efforts, nevertheless the Bill is welcome. Of course, it will be entirely meaningless if we carry on the argument we started on sulphur dioxide by saying standards here will be different from everywhere else because we are not as polluted as everywhere else. To say that we can tolerate more pollution because we are not as badly off as the rest of western Europe implies that when we get to European standards we will start moving backwards. Surely we should learn from what others have experienced, particularly from Scandinavia and Switzerland, that it is possible to combine high levels of economic achievement with high levels of environmental protection and set ourselves that target.</P>
    <P>No country has ever succeeded by setting low standards. If we want to preserve the uniqueness of this country, which is part of its attraction to investors and tourists, we have to set our own standards and those standards must not be based on a sort of crude over-simplified economic model of what determines investment and economic growth. We can create both industrial development and environmental protection if we are prepared to. I regret that on present evidence we are not prepared to do so and that we will tolerate destruction of our environment on a considerable scale in order to make spurious and probably negative progress in industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact that it has built into it the concept of a devolution of power to the local authorities. This, of course, is absolutely <Col N="456" /> necessary because there is no way that one could control air pollution without having local authorities very much involved in such matters affecting the environment. It is good to see the local authorities getting these powers in the area of air quality. We must find the best practical means for this prevention of imported pollution. The power to make charges may not be very popular because we all know about local authority charges, but they will have the power to make charges, where necessary. They will also have the power to prosecute and will be involved in the licensing of industries. It is interesting to see that they will be involved in survey, research and investigation. These things are all worth nothing because there is some discussion at the moment on the involvement of the local authorities in this area, and on the question of devolution of power. A seminar has just finished in Sligo on the whole question of devolution of power. Here is an area into which the local authorities can get their teeth. Let us hope this power will be followed by others having regard to the policy to devolve power.</P>
      <P>Air pollution in the urban areas has increased dramatically because of the burning of coal in domestic houses. This is most noticeable in large urban areas like Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment carried out a survey in 1981. The main pollution emission sources categories in Dublin city suburbs were domestic, commercial, industrial power generation and vehicles. The total emissions from all were estimated to be about 55,400 tonnes of SO2 per year. The survey gave a break down of the constituents of air pollution and said that over 80 per cent of the pollution emitted originated from the use of fuel oil; sulphur dioxide from coal, was 10 per cent, and 5 per cent pollution from gas and oils. The survey reckoned that the consumption of solid fuels accounted for 75 per cent of air pollution. The survey showed that the emissions from oil fuels are small with the exception of diesel driven vehicles which were, in fact, <Col N="457" /> calculated to contribute to about 10 per cent of air pollution in 1981.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the ESB but the survey found, that although the ESB stations contribute 65 per cent of the SO2, because it was dispersed at a high level it was not as bad as a smaller amount being emitted at ground level. Elderly people may not be as affected by the emission of pollution from the ESB stations as they would be by emissions from adjoining industries largely using coal. This is what the study hinged around. The survey showed a co-relation between deaths and air pollution. The survey cannot be as accurate as it claims if it did not look at other habits of people such as heavy smoking, the type of work they did, their previous medical history, their care, nutrition and so on. However, there is a problem and it is great to see a Bill being introduced to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The use of natural gas and other fuels can help to cut down pollution. London is a very good example of that. Years ago London was probably one of the worst polluted cities in the world. Nowadays in the greater London area, one is talking about a very substantial traffic flow and maybe 12 million to 13 million people; and that position has been reversed in London.</P>
    <P>It is accurately reported that the domestic sector in the Dublin area in 1981 accounted for 81 per cent of the total smoke emissions but it must be remembered that the winter smoke level in Dublin for 1983 and 1984 was the same as in 1973 and 1974. It was not any worse and it was even a third less than it was 20 years ago. One would wonder if there was anything missing in the surveys carried out.</P>
    <P>I am really worried about people who are coal users. People have reared large families in smoky rooms in tenement houses and have lived to 80 or 90 years of age.</P>
    <P>That is one consideration. Was the presence of lead in the atmosphere taken into consideration in the surveys? One wonders whether carbon monoxide emissions were properly monitored prior to any survey, and with what result. I <Col N="458" /> accept, that urgent action is required to curb carbon monoxide emissions but I wonder are smoke free zones the answer. Are there other practical alternatives which might have a less drastic effect on the price of coal and so on? When one is talking about air pollution and blames most of it on coal one must consider that there has been a great growth in the use of back boilers. Many people in the working class areas have to rely on coal and turf. If anything increases the running costs of central heating we are talking about higher subsidies in the final analysis to cater for these people. When introducing plans to lessen our pollution problem we must not forget that many people die from hypothermia, so we cannot just do surveys and studies and overlook the people we should protect. These people can only afford to buy in small amounts, small bottles of gas, small amounts of turf, small bundles of wood, small amounts of paraffin and so on. If we are not more careful about our studies and observations we may impose hardships on many people who will not be able to live with them. If we get to the point where we actually compel consumers to use more expensive fuels, we are imposing hardships, Smokeless fuel which may not be the answer to our problems, will cost more, maybe 50 per cent more. People in the poorer areas cannot afford to buy oil in bulk and they must be considered. By using smoke reducing appliances to improve air quality, we may be doing a lot of damage in other ways. Apart from the cost to the Government it would cost more in subsidies to people who could afford the new types of fuels if it ever came to the point where it got so bad that we would have to introduce these types of appliances that would make it much more difficult for people to use the ordinary fuels.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the arguments about our levels of pollution being the highest in Europe are correct. I do not believe that this is true. In the directive which came into force in July 1982, mandatory EC standards were laid down in relation to sulphur dioxide. I believe these were met in Dublin and in all other areas. France, <Col N="459" /> Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom have admitted to the EC that their levels were above the mandatory standards. So we are not alone in this. We should not go overboard about it. The Bill is there and the powers are within it but I do not think we should get into the area of trying to crucify the power in our application of it. That is why local government involvement is very important. They would know more than others about what is happening and would be able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into this any further. I think it has been fairly well covered. I will just say that I wonder what attention was given, when studies were being carried out, to the question of fog which we get fairly frequently here. Fog cannot be confused with smoke although I very often confuse it with smoke. We live on an island and we suffer from sea pollutants as well. We have got lead also. I do not know what produces all the pollution but I would venture to suggest that studies in this area have not been finalised. The surveys and the research are not up-to-date. I hope that the Bill, as it is set out, is enabling enough to allow for that particular aspect to be looked at so that we would not be producing results of studies and scientific reports that are exaggerated and a little frightening.</P>

      <P>In the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this Bill we are told that the purpose is to provide a comprehensive, modern, legislative framework for the control of air pollution in order to meet national requirements and to enable full effect to be given to relevant EC directives. While the purpose of the Bill is indeed praiseworthy, the reality is that it is merely enabling legislation. The Bill represents a lost opportunity to provide effective pollution control. What is required, of course, is legislation which directs local authorities to implement rules and regulations which must be observed. This inevitably means that the resources must be provided for local authorities to carry out that job. Local authorities are not <Col N="460" /> negative or defeatist but actually welcome extra functions provided they are given the wherewithal to carry them out. In recent years we have had a list of Bills &mdash; for example, in respect of water pollution, casual trading and litter &mdash; which have been implemented only on a very limited scale due to a lack of staffing and the necessary resources. In the course of this contribution I will refer to the health hazard associated with air pollution. I will refer also to some policy options, for example, smokeless zones and, finally, I will say something about the potential sources of radioactive contamination of the Irish environment after Chernobyl.</P>
      <P>The air pollution over Dublin city which is aggravated in winter high pressure climatic conditions is a source of real harm for people, especially the elderly and the young. In this regard I want to refer to an article entitled &ldquo;Mortality in a General Hospital and Urban Air Pollution&rdquo; by Drs. Ian Kelly and Luke Clancy of the Trinity medical school and which appeared in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> of October 1984. In the course of this article the researchers point out that a rise in air pollution does indeed have immediate adverse effects on health. These effects include an increase in the numbers of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, increases in the demand for hospital beds and, of particular context in the Bill we are discussing, an increase in mortality among patients already suffering from chronic respiratory diseases. The researchers further point out that the young and the elderly are among those most vulnerable to these adverse effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically the researchers conducted a study in St. James's Hospital in Dublin which showed an excess mortality rate in the winter of 1981-82. The major cause of deaths during this period was respiratory in nature. The researchers compared the increase in the mortality rate to the air pollution figures and found that there was a close match between mortality and air pollution. Based on their findings it is their belief that the episode of air pollution in that period was a major factor in the excess mortality. In <Col N="461" /> broad terms there was a twofold increase in mortality in January 1982. When studied on a daily basis it was found that during the period 11 to 14 January 1982 exceptionally high levels of air pollution, particularly smoke, were recorded in Dublin. In regard to smoke as an air pollutant it is particularly disappointing that under the Bill local authorities can choose whether to set up smokeless zones. Furthermore there is no compulsion under the Bill to include domestic dwellings which are the principal source of air pollution.</P>
    <P>With regard to air pollutions and the options that are available, I readily acknowledge that this Bill is necessary not least because we have not yet fulfilled all our legally binding commitments under European Community law. The heating systems being installed in new housing indicates that the air pollution situation will not improve over the next five years. In regard to new housing the local authority houses all have open fires with back boilers and in the case of private new houses 73 per cent use solid fuel central heating.</P>
    <P>Ths leads us back to the problem of smoke to which I have already referred. There is some positive news in this regard. Early tests show that smoke heating appliances could reduce smoke emissions by 50 per cent. If these appliances were generally installed the air pollution problem resulting from smoke would be considerably eased. However, it must be said that these new appliances have yet to be proven in practice. In a paper presented at a conference in the RDS in November 1985 entitled &ldquo;Irish Policy Options&rdquo; Professor Frank Convery of the resource and environmental policy centre at UCD, made the following recommendations. He urged that we press ahead with testing the smoke heating devices and that a prototype smokeless zone of 4,000 houses in one of the worst affected areas should be introduced. On smokeless zones Professor Convery drew attention to the UK approach which provides for the implementation of grant-aided conversion for smokeless zones. He estimated that if 4,000 houses were <Col N="462" /> converted per year in the Republic the total cost would amount to about £2½ million and would take about 15 years to cover 40 per cent of the solid fuel burning housing stock. Professor Convery recommended the installation of smokeless fuel burning closed stoves in all new local authority housing and the same for private housing in those zones which have a severe and continuing air pollution problem.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to air pollution and the very current and worrying area of radioactive contamination. Viewed from an Irish perspective the principal and most dangerous source of nuclear pollution is the release into the air of objectionable and dangerous material from nuclear establishments in the UK and further afield. A second important source is the discharge of radioactive waste into the sea, for example, waste from Sellafield. A third area of risk from what is by no means an exhaustive list is where accidents occur in which radioactive material is released from nuclear powered ships or ships carrying nuclear weapons or radioactive waste in the vicinity of Ireland and in particular in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>First let me take Sellafield. Low level liquid radioactive wastes have been discharged from Sellafield since about 1952. Public pressure, which must be sustained, has resulted in more stringent regulations being implemented by the Sellafield management. However, it is now well established that traces of radioactive effluence from Sellafield have sprayed over most of the European Continental Shelf, as evidenced by the detection of traces from this source near the coasts as far away as Greenland and off the west coast of Ireland. This evidence has been very well documented professionally by Dr. Peter Mitchell of the Department of Experimental Physics at UCD. The distribution of these radioactive elements around the whole coastline of Ireland has been studied in detail at UCD in recent years. As we know, the coastal region most affected by these marine discharges has been the east coast and in particular the north-east coast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> I want to focus briefly on what is potentially the most serious and most immediate threat of nuclear pollution. This, of course, would arise from large accidental releases into the air of radioactivity from nuclear reactors used for civil, military or research purposes in the UK and Western Europe. As the disaster at Chernobyl unfortunately demonstrated, radioactive contamination spreads very quickly over very large areas when a reactor explosion or fire occurs. Such contamination has no respect for international boundaries and, indeed, the relevant authorities do not necessarily consider it their duty to notify their neighbours immediately. A worry in relation to major nuclear accidents is that the official risk assessments have been proved to be seriously defective. These official estimates claimed that a major disaster like Chernobyl would occur only once in a century. However, as we know with regret, in less than a decade, not to mention a century, we have witnessed the Three Mile Island disaster in the US and Chernobyl only a few months ago, together with two or three near misses in the US.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the points I have just made, I ask the Minister to reply to a number of questions, assuming she has the appropriate responses, as follows. First I want to pose some questions in the international context. Are we in Ireland, the authorities here and specifically the Government, satisfied with the existing bilateral arrangements with the authorities in Britain regarding the immediate notification of our own authorities of any significant airborne release of radioactivity from nuclear establishments within the British jurisdiction? Secondly, what progress has been made since the Chernobyl disaster regarding international arrangements for the immediate reporting and prompt dissemination of all information relevant to neighbouring countries to enable them to protect their own populations by taking appropriate remedial action? For my third question, what progress has been made on the setting up of an international inspectorate or, at the very least, an EC inspectorate <Col N="464" /> with sufficient powers to enable it to close down out of date nuclear establishments or establishments which do not conform to the latest international standards? I would be less worried about the discharges into the Irish Sea from Sellafield and more concerned about the older, out of date stations in mainland Britain which it seems present a much more serious threat in the nuclear area.</P>
    <P>Now I want to put a number of questions to the Minister on the national front. First, are the statutory authority here, namely the Nuclear Energy Board, now in a position to provide an immediate warning of any increase in radiation levels throughout the whole country or at least in the main centres of population and the principal geographical regions? Second, is such monitoring done continuously or intermittently? Third, almost six months have elapsed since the accident at Chernobyl. What progress has been made in the area of contingency planning in case an accident of similar proportions took place in a country much closer geographically to Ireland? Fourth, unlike most if not all other European countries, no report has yet been published by the Irish Government or their agencies detailing the levels of radioactivity in Ireland and in particular in foodstuffs as a consequence of Chernobyl. Do the Government propose to publish such a report in respect of Ireland?</P>
    <P>The final issue I want to refer to is the area of acid rain and the Burren. I have a particular interest in the Burren, being a native of west Clare. Clare County Council and the ESB are to be commended for commissioning An Foras Forbartha to recommend monitoring programmes in respect of sulphur emissions from the coal-burning station at Moneypoint. The possibility of acid rain affecting the Burren must receive the closest attention. I ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that as soon as An Foras Forbartha have collected their results, their report will be made public and that both Houses will have an opportunity to debate it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me make the point again that the purpose of the Bill is <Col N="465" /> entirely laudable, but it is merely enabling legislation. It does little more than provide the structure within which local authorities may or may not act. Local authorities would welcome not alone the functions in the Bill but important additional functions. However, they will not be able to give effect to this legislation, or many other Acts on the Statute Book, because they have not been provided with the financial wherewithal to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I must lay emphasis on the good sense of adopting a very gradual approach in dealing with the problem of Dublin's air quality. It is important that we do not allow ourselves to be panicked by very occasional instances of excedents. The Minister is to be congratulated on her very level-headed approach to the whole debate. She has not allowed herself to be misled by some of the wilder claims made about the air quality in Dublin. On the other hand, the Minister has been careful to respond to the legitimate concern of our citizens about the need to ensure that Dublin's air is as clean as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out, rightly, that it is not possible to have perfectly clean air any more than it is possible to have anything else perfect. There must be a balance between economic activity and air quality. The whole matter is a question of balance and a certain amount of common sense. In this Bill the Minister seems to have got the balance about right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives in the Dublin area in particular will never forget the hardships caused in the sixties when local authority houses were built without adequate means of heating. For the poor the most important consideration is that the fuel they use be available to them at a low cost and in small quantities. It is useless to expect those who are less well off to order their year's supply of fuel at one go or to pay large quarterly or bimonthly gas and electricity bills. Time and again experience has demonstrated that this simply does not happen. In the sixties the failure to provide adequate <Col N="466" /> heating facilities in local authority houses led to complaints about dampness, to a growth in pulmonary illnesses and to the infliction of real hardship on those least able to protect themselves from the effects of poorly thought-out legislation. The final outcome, as we all know only too well, was that the State was forced to build, at great cost, fireplaces in homes originally built without them. Surely that experience ought to make us pause and seriously consider the ramifications and folly of too draconian pollution legislation. At the very least the experience of the sixties demonstrates that special control areas ought not to be introduced without full investigation. That is a reasonable demand in the circumstances in which Dublin finds itself, where the quality of our air is generally satisfactory and where it has been improved in recent times.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Seanad has found itself subject to many representations from bodies interested in the passage of this Bill through this House. Most of these representations have been level-headed and well considered but some, regrettably, have shown an alarming disregard for the facts.</P>
    <P>This experience highlights one of the problems facing the members of this House who have no independent facilities to carry out research and are at a disadvantage in trying to judge the merits of the cases made by different pressure groups. Perhaps it is time the Oireachtas considered the provision of an independent research arm for members of both Houses. The Minister may say that the Government's research is sufficient. Is it not naive to accept that all Governments at all times are motivated by the best intentions in relation to all their activities in all legislation they produce? That the legislature should be free to make up its own mind is a cardinal principle of democracy. One must wonder in view of the intensity of some of the representations we have received whether or not the time has come to review our capacity to initiate independent research free of Government and pressure groups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> We are very lucky in this country that we still have a generally high standard of air quality. Due to our geographical position and the mainly western winds we are not greatly affected by transboundary air pollution, and in no way to the same extent as other European countries. Other favourable factors which mean that we enjoy relative freedom from air pollution are our low population density and the absence of urbanisation, and also, the 1963 Planning Act which imposed restrictions on the emissions from new premises in all planning applications.</P>
    <P>In recent times people have become more aware of air pollution and more interested in its prevention. There are many different air pollutants. The most common are smoke, sulphur dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and lead. All of these result from the combustion of fuel in one form or another whether it be in the case of commercial and industrial power generation or on the domestic front. It is therefore clear that the problem is the concern of us all and one in which we must all play a part if we are to successfully come to terms with it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the reduction of lead content in petrol from .40 to .15 led to a reduction of 60 per cent in lead emissions from motor vehicles. Only the other day the Minister went out personally to show that we will, in the near future, have completely lead-free petrol which should result in a further reduction. It shows how effective that operation has been in reducing the pollution emissions from motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in imposing regulations in section 24 (1) with regard to the limiting, and where possible, the prevention of emissions in premises, the term &ldquo;best practicable means&rdquo; is defined as having due regard to the balance between the needs of development and the needs of the environment. The responsibility of implementing the Bill is entrusted to the 27 county councils and, at the time it was introduced, the five borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. Under the new <Col N="468" /> reorganisation Dún Laoghaire Corporation will become one of the Dublin county areas.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that the local authority may transfer authority where a high degree of expertise is needed. This is only right because if the local authority find themselves without the sufficient expertise they can engage people like An Foras Forbartha or other bodies to give them this expertise. Different people have expressed reservations as to why local authorities should be entrusted with the implementation. This is another step in the delegation of power to the local authorities which has been a continuing exercise in recent times. This is natural enough because no central body could cater for different counties so that there is a considerable variation in different areas in the need and level of local services. Local authorities already control the administration of planning, water pollution, sanitary services, roads and housing. It is only natural I suppose that they should also have control of this Bill on air pollution.</P>
    <P>Section 33 allows for reviews of licences at intervals of not less than three years or at any time where the local authority have grounds for believing that an emission may constitute a serious risk of air pollution or a change that was not foreseen at the time of the granting of the permit.</P>
    <P>Section 34 allows for appeals to An Bord Pleanála in a similar manner in which appeals are carried out against planning and water pollution. It is only right that air pollution should be in that category. There are many and varied self-appointed experts who talk about the serious pollution standards in Dublin. Many of those are exaggerated and they emanate from anonymous sources which are in no way substantiated.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill enables the local authority to declare all or part of an area to be a special control area where the level of pollutants may require special abatement measures. This section could be of special significance in the Dublin area where the smoke levels may on occasion be exceeded. The results of <Col N="469" /> Dublin Corporation's monitoring levels are reported in bulletins from time to time. It is encouraging to see and to note that the position for 1985-86 shows a reduction in the monthly mediums as compared with 1984-85. The figures show a continuing decline in pollution levels in the Dublin area. Smoke levels for winter periods are as much as 60 per cent below the EC standards &mdash; the winter period being October to March. Figures for the first three months of 1986 also show a further reduction.</P>
    <P>It is interesting and encouraging to note that the smoke levels for Dublin in 1965-66 were of 140 microgrammes whereas the figure for the year 1985-86 is 40 microgrammes only, a dramatic reduction. The main cause of air pollution given regularly by environmentalists is domestic coal. This is the pollutant most easily visible and therefore attributed blame. The fact that coal sales increased dramatically in the period in which there has been a reduction in the smoke zone over Dublin seems to give the lie to this accusation. Invisible pollutants such as atomic radiation exist. But sulphur dioxide and toxic substances, such as lead nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide generally are invisible and are overlooked on account of the high visibility of smoke.</P>
    <P>The coal industry &mdash; in their own interests &mdash; have a deep interest in air pollution problems. They believe that the basis on which measurements are taken should be expanded to include all elements of pollution including smoke, sulphur dioxide, lead and nitrogen oxides. They believe that it would strengthen the provisions of the proposed Bill were it mandatory for such research to be undertaken prior to the implementation of specially controlled zones in any area. The forecasts of independent experts have been borne out regarding the decline of smoke levels. The reasons are well documented. They are a clear indication of what is factual in the Dublin area. The reduction in such smoke levels is due to the spread of population from the inner city to the suburbs, the greater choice of fuels, the availability and use <Col N="470" /> of smokeless fuels and the development and use of more efficient fuel burning, smoke free appliances.</P>
    <P>The coal industry are continually trying to find new ways to ensure the reduction of smoke levels and are undertaking every effort to make smokeless fuels available in small lots to suit all demands. We may have an air pollution problem in the city. However, it is not, as yet, so acute as to demand immediate action and the adoption of panic remedies. We are all lucky that current pollution readings are well below EC standards and that we have time to plan the assessed desirable level. It behoves us to take necessary precautions and adopt every possible means to reduce those pollution levels. That is the concern of us all. If we do not allow ourselves be driven into taking panic measures we can look forward to the time when we shall have hopefully a brighter, healthier air stream in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the wisdom and foresight she has shown in her approach to this Bill. It is worthy of the support of every Member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I would agree with Senator Belton in welcoming the Bill although with some reservations. But I would have to say I disagree most profoundly with him in almost everything else he said in the latter half of his speech. I would agree with him indeed in saying that, as Senators, we need independent facilities for research. I would suggest that the second half of his speech is a brilliant illustration of why we need independent research for our speeches, as a great deal of what he said was virtually a direct quotation from the submissions which all of us have received from the well heeled coal industry. In this instance I would point out that those people who suffer from asthma, bronchitis and other pollution-related diseases have not got the same amount of money behind them to put forward submissions to Members of the Oireachtas which would attack the emission of smoke and other pollutants in the Dublin city area. <Col N="471" /> They have certainly done a very good job in showering us all with splendid little leaflets explaining that if you take an average of the figures over the whole year they went down between the years 1984, 1985 and 1986. That assertion ignores the fact that they rose steeply from 1981 onwards and the main reason that the worst excesses were avoided in January and February of 1986 was that we had a period of very strong east winds which drove away a great deal of the smoke pollution.</P>
      <P>There is worldwide concern about general environmental pollution. As Senator Hillery said, this has been brought to a head by some environmental pollution, by nuclear power accidents such as occurred at Sellafield and Chernobyl. It is not only freaks, environmental extremists or whatever who are concerned about the way in which our environment is being polluted. I agree with the Minister that it is essential to introduce this kind of legislation. My sole worry about it is that it is very much an enabling Bill. I have some doubts about how quickly or effectively will its provisions cope with the situation with regard to air pollution.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to understand how anyone can suggest there is not a serious pollution problem in Dublin city. I live in the south suburbs of Dublin. Practically every day I drive into Dublin city. On any day like today &mdash; a beautiful fine blue skied day &mdash; if one looks down the hill from the south suburbs of Dublin to the city below or indeed, as I had the experience, if one goes up to, say, the Bon Secours Hospital in Glasnevin and looks down on the city below, one will have no problem whatsoever in seeing an immense cloud of smoke and other sorts of pollution sitting on top of the middle of the city, such as would really make one afraid of going in to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to look at our public buildings. Take, for example, St. Patrick's Cathedral. Not very long ago this cathedral, which as well as being a religious place of worship is also a public monument, was cleaned and repaired at very great expense. If one goes and looks <Col N="472" /> at it today one will find that the same filth is gathering around it as was on it before. No doubt the same would apply to the Bank of Ireland and Christ Church Cathedral which have been cleaned more recently. We have only to look at our own surroundings to see the damage that has been done to the stonework of the National Museum, this very building and the National Library by sulphuric emissions which attach to stone work. There have been reports from the building authorities in Trinity College, with photographs attached, which show that the palisades, the little banisters as it were, along the top of the buildings there have been eaten away by pollution in the Dublin atmosphere to such an extent that they have become totally unsafe and have all got to be replaced. The photographs show the actual pillars eaten away by the level of pollution in Dublin. I find it impossible to believe that we have not got a serious pollution problem in the Dublin area at the very least.</P>
    <P>As far as the figures are concerned, if one averages out the whole city, including the outer suburbs, over a whole year, one arrives at a certain figure but if you look at the different local measurements in areas like Rathmines, Ballyfermot and Trinity College itself, you will see that there have been quite a number of occasions where the smoke concentrations have gone way above the EC safe levels for a certain number of days during the last few years. I would certainly agree with my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, that what is regarded as safe today may well be regarded as unsafe in the future.</P>
    <P>Of course, domestic smoke is not the only cause of pollution. There are various industrial emissions and there is also the problem of both petrol and diesel fuels. Every pedestrian or cyclist in Dublin and in some of our other towns is only too well aware of the fact that petrol and diesel fumes and in particular diesel fumes from buses and lorries &mdash; CIE are considerably at fault here &mdash; are very uncontrolled and can make a cyclist riding in the wake of one of these vehicles feel quite ill. This must be affecting the <Col N="473" /> health of both cyclists and pedestrians. I am of course delighted to hear that the lowering of the lead content in petrol has helped this position. I am also delighted to hear that we are beginning to have lead free petrol, and may we press on with this. Nevertheless we still have to cope with the problem of diesel which is used by heavy commercial vehicles. So far as I as a driver and a pedestrian am concerned, I do not see any effort being made to control the clouds of noxious black smoke that emit from both buses and lorries every day of the week in the countryside and in the cities.</P>
    <P>On a more mundane level where there is pollution any housewife who hangs her clothes on the line will find black spots appearing on them. Likewise any ordinary person who walks through Dublin city for a few hours and comes into their own house and does that simple thing &mdash; blows their nose on a white tissue will know if there is pollution in the area. I ask my colleagues to try this out. They will find nasty black stuff has collected through breathing the smoke pollution that is surrounding us. There is really no problem in a little bit of self-independent research, without scientists measuring things for us, to find out what is going on.</P>
    <P>Naturally I welcome the Minister's Second Stage speech about the necessity for this legislation and how it will improve the situation, but I am afraid that, as in many other fields such as water pollution and planning, we may have extremely good legislation but extremely poor enforcement. I understand that with regard to the 1977 Water Pollution Act, which was an extremely good Act in its way, power was given to local authorities to make water quality management plans for the rivers and lakes in their area. Now, ten years later, only one such plan has been drawn up. There is a danger in introducing extremely good enabling legislation and then not taking immediate steps to put it into effect.</P>
    <P>Once again I am afraid this may turn out to be what we describe as an Irish solution to an Irish problem. We make things look extremely good on the surface. We paper over the cracks and <Col N="474" /> having done that, we say &ldquo;That is done now. We have a splendid Air Pollution Act&rdquo;, but do nothing about it. To describe, as the Explanatory Memorandum does, the Act as a comprehensive, modern, legislative framework for the control of air pollution is just not enough. We need more than a framework. The Bill says the memorandum is largely a framework for regulatory action, but it is the regulatory action we want as well as the framework.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the position in Dublin city, in the countryside we need to be particularly careful because one of the things we pride ourselves on is our green and fresh countryside. This is very important to our tourist industry. We need to be particularly careful that this kind of pollution does not spread outside the cities and become, by sheer neglect, a problem in the countryside as well. We have seen in the acid rain report the danger of pollution being spread from country to country. It is rather easy for us, as other Senators have said, to sit back secure in the knowledge that, because of the westerly winds that blow across this island, pollution which we produce will be blown across to other people and that we will not necessarily suffer from it. Listening to the various discussions on the radio and reading in the newspapers the discussions about the danger of pollution emissions from the Moneypoint power station, I find it very difficult to accept the arguments of the ESB with regard to the enormous costs of controlling this pollution. I find it very strange that we do not seem to take any action to ensure that safeguards are included at the building stage, rather than letting the public authority or private industry build the factory, start manufacturing and then tell them they have to do something about the pollution because quite obviously it is going to cost a lot more if they have to make corrections after the building has been completed and the emission has been allowed.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to talk about the requirement on occupiers of all premises, except private dwellings, to use the best practicable means to limit or prevent <Col N="475" /> emissions. Unfortunately, a very large amount of smoke pollution is due to the use of open coal burning fires in private dwellings. Senator Belton has talked a great deal about the difficulty of poverty and the need for people of small means to be able to get fuel cheaply and in small quantities. There are a number of things I would say about this. I appreciate the need of people who have not got a great deal of financial resources, but I would make a comparison with other cities, in particular Belfast where they have just as many, or nearly as many people with fairly small financial resources and who need to be able to buy fuel in small quantities and so on. The authorities in Belfast have pursued a policy of taking area by area of the city and providing subsidies for people to change to types of fuel which are not pollutants.</P>
    <P>In the various pieces of special pleading which we received from both the coal industry and, I think, more effectively from those who manufacture stoves, fireplaces, and so on, it has been asserted over and over again that they can make fireplaces, stoves or whatever which will use non-pollutant, smoke-free or virtually smoke-free fuels, and that the coal industry can supply these fuels. This is splendid. If they are able to do this, then let us make our legislation effective and let us provide for them to do this. The manufacturers of fireplaces and stoves are afraid that employment may be lost, but I suggest that if we followed this policy of changing the areas of the city bit by bit, perhaps starting with areas, such as Rathmines and Ballyfermot where smoke pollution is at its worst, we would not only not lose jobs but we would create jobs by bringing in legislation and, if necessary, a certain amount of subsidisation to change over from particularly smoke producing fuels to smoke free fuels.</P>
    <P>I can only feel that the coal industry are weeping crocodile tears when they talk about people who need to get fuel in small quantities because they are poor. If you have ever bought a couple of stone of coal in those little plastic bags and if <Col N="476" /> you have ever added up what the price of a ton of coal would be if you bought it in those little plastic bags, you will know that the cost of coal bought in small quantities is infinitely higher than the cost of coal bought by the ton, dear as that is.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to accept this kind of weeping over the need of people who have to buy fuel in small quantities by an industry which is deliberately charging such high prices for small quantities of fuel. If they sold the coal in small quantities cheaply to the unfortunate poor I would have a great deal more sympathy for their argument. They should take the beam out of their own eye before they start taking the mote out of the environmentalists' eye.</P>
    <P>We tend to be very self-satisfied and to say, for instance, that in Dublin of course our situation is not nearly as bad as it was in London in the 1950s when that city was forced by the ferocious smogs that happened at that time to introduce clean air legislation and to change the whole situation radically. Why do we take up a position that we must wait until things gets desperate before we will do anything about them? Why can we not say that we have this legislation in place now, that now is the time to act and now is the time to prevent things getting any worse than they are? I suggest that they are quite bad enough to do something about it.</P>
    <P>It is positively criminal to take the attitude that we will wait until we have the London smogs, that we will wait until we have people wearing masks on the street, that we will wait until we have people dying of bronchitis every winter because of this extreme pollution before we feel it is necessary to make this legislation effective. Perhaps this sounds like scare-mongering but nevertheless I have sufficient experience of the introduction of enabling legislation of this type which then sits on the Statute Book without being put into effect. I want to speak very strongly on this and to urge on the Minister that where local authorities are not going ahead and dealing with the matter he should use the residual powers under the Act in order to force local authorities to act and, if necessary, to <Col N="477" /> provide funds to help them to act in this matter.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the Bill is a step forward but it is only one step forward in a long walk of progress which we need before we can be really confident that we have a clean and healthy environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate this afternoon and on the previous occasion has been very wide-ranging. Many of us have very strong views on the protection of the environment and on the measures that are required to ensure that the air we breathe is as clean and as unpolluted as possible and the countryside &mdash; particularly in this country renowned for the quality of the waters and the unpolluted nature of the landscape &mdash; protected as far as possible.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to formulate a comment on the two proposals in front of us, first, the legislation and, second, the report of the joint committee on acid rain. I propose to deal mainly with the issue of acid rain. Other Senators have talked in detail particularly about the pollution levels in this city and that is understandable for people who live here.</P>
      <P>The broader issue of acid rain is one that affects not only the entire island of Ireland &mdash; it certainly does not respect geographical or political borders &mdash; but is a problem faced by the whole western world and indeed those countries, though undeveloped, that border the industrial giants of the west. The term &ldquo;acid rain&rdquo; is one that everyone is familiar with now. It is a term that every household hears now and again but one that was probably not heard at all up to five or six years ago. Most families discuss it in some sort of vague way and are aware that it is a type of pollution that should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is acid rain? I will define it as follows. Rain is naturally acidic but measured on a pH scale &mdash; and this is referred to in the joint committee's report &mdash; of one to 14 from most acidic to most alkaline. Rainfall far from industrial areas is usually in the range of four and a half to five and a half. In industrial regions the pH of rainfall is often below four and has <Col N="478" /> been measured in Europe as low as 2.6. It is most important, therefore, to distinguish between the acidity of rainfall and that of lakes and rivers and sources of water into which the rain falls because obviously some lakes in alkaline areas, in limestone for example, can cope very readily with neutralising high acidic rainfall. Others in non-limestone regions collect acidic rainfall very readily and the pollutant effect can certainly endanger many of the life forms existent in those lakes.</P>
    <P>Lakes are not the only part of the environment affected by acid rain. Forests and man-made objects such as historic mounuments are being eroded steadily and they are probably even more important if measured by the cost of society of the damage caused to them.</P>
    <P>The lake is a good example because we can readily classify the killing effect of varying degrees of acidity and how it affects various life forms in a like. I refer briefly to the levels of acidity that kills off various forms of animal life. Below a pH of six, crustaceans, snails and molluscs will die; below 5.8 salmon, trout and roach will die; below the same level, sensitive insects, plants and animal plankton will die; below 5.5 white fish and other aquatic forms will die and below 4.5 eel and brook trout will die. There are various gradations by which the acidic level of a lake will kill off life.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus in a real way on this problem. Where does the acid rain come from? The major air pollutants associated with man's industrial activity are sulphur and nitrogen oxides, particules of dust and hydrocarbons emitted by stationary sources such as heavy industry, power plants, and mobile plants, such as vehicles and vehicular traffic. They all add to the pollution of the atmosphere and transform the atmosphere sometimes into a source of potential danger to all living things and eventually to humanity.</P>
    <P>This matter is becoming a very live and real issue for most people who are interested in the environment. Much research has taken place in the developed countries on the effect of acid rain, and the consciousnes of the experts and the <Col N="479" /> population of the EC countries has been raised on this issue. Let us look at the various impacts of acid rain. The loss of fish and other aquatic life has already occurred in many countries, in Scandinavia, eastern Canada and in the north east of the United States. The lowering of pH is believed to damage the sodium balance of fish gills, especially if the changes are sharp or occur quickly. The effect of acid rain on forests is readily understood and data are available.</P>
    <P>Recent reports put forest damage in central Europe as affecting more than one million hectares. A recent survey carried out in Germany showed that 34 per cent of the total forest area showed damage symptoms from acid rain. Forest damage in North America has, to date, been reported at higher altitudes only. Scientists have discovered a significant reduction over a wide area of the United States at the rate of a tree diameter growth in several species of trees in the last two decades. Acid deposition is a more correct term than acid rain because the acidic level does not fall merely in rain but in any precipitation. The effect of acidic deposition on crops has been researched and underlines the damage done to very sensitive species of food crops.</P>
    <P>Our buildings and monuments are being attacked and eroded by acid rain. Lastly, and of paramount importance, we must consider the effect of acid rain on human life itself. It is very difficult to relate the damage directly to human health of air pollution in acid deposition, but it is regarded now within the OECD countries as being significant enough to warrant further research. Senator Catherine McGuinness and others referred to the need for research in this area. It is only in the last number of years that any research has been carried out. We are now building up a bank of new understanding of the phenomenon of acid deposition, how we are contributing to it and how it is accelerating. The precise link between emissions from power plants, industrial sources or vehicles at one point and how they affect another <Col N="480" /> point in a different location, in a different country, is beginning to be understood. We know the correlation now between those emissions and the damage they have often caused in neutral countries not causing the original pollution.</P>
    <P>Many countries like ours are innocent victims of another country's industrial programme and have to endure the bad effects of that country's industrial programme without benefiting from it. There is a detrimental effect on our health and environment from the British nuclear programme in Sellafield and the various other nuclear installations that exist throughout the United Kingdom. We do not benefit from the European industrial programme to any great extent. Because of the prevailing winds we do not suffer unduly from acid rain as far as we can ascertain. Its effects are cumulative and we obviously need to address it in a very courageous, straightforward and determined way.</P>
    <P>We have learned about the consequential effects of pollution and consequent damage and by studying the climatic patterns we can determine the sources of pollution and quantify what deductions or reductions will mean for an environment in another area. Many things can be done. There are two aspects to addressing the problem. One is by recognising it and taking action against it <i>post factum.</i> For instance, if an acidic lake is polluted by acid rain, which happens in Scandinavia, an approach of liming should be adopted to neutralise the acid rain. That is a reaction to a problem that has already occurred and which has been identified.</P>
    <P>A far more effective approach would be to prevent the pollution occurring in the first instance which is easier said than done. The solution to acid deposition is to tackle the source of the problem, that is, to reduce what goes up into the atmosphere. That is the only way one can be sure that too much of the same badness does not come down again. The joint committee report said that in many instances the problem was the cost involved. But there are many factors <Col N="481" /> involved: the choice of fuel, the treatment it undergoes prior to combustion, the combustion process itself, the cleaning of combustion gases before emission and so on. They all contribute to either increasing or reducing the polluting effect of the industry involved. The solutions are there. Many members of the public ask why the problem exists if the pollution is so readily identified and the solution mapped out. However, the cost is significant.</P>
    <P>The joint committee report on page 18 said that the benefits of a controlled programme as proposed by the European Commission are not quantifiable owing to the imperfections of the knowledge of both the mechanism of acid rain formation and its effect. The economic consequences for an undeveloped expanding economy such as the Irish one are proportionately much more severe than for relatively stagnant developed economies.</P>
    <P>There is a hedging there because there is a mass of detailed scientific knowledge now available. The nettle must be grasped. We must decide that we will do everything within our power to reduce our contribution to the pollution of Europe. It is only in that way that we can have the moral authority to put pressure on our European partners and to the broader economic family of nations to reduce their more serious and more major contribution to pollution and creating acid rain.</P>
    <P>For instance, one of the most significant economic programmes we have undertaken in recent times was the Moneypoint project. The ESB suggested in their submission to the joint committee that the cost of installing the necessary equipment to eliminate sulphur and nitrogen oxides from Moneypoint would be as high as £145 million. The board estimate that a further capital cost in the order of £255 million would be involved in modifying all their power stations with a consequent increase in electricity charges to the consumer in excess of 20 per cent. They went on to postulate that, if that occurred and if electricity prices increased by that amount, more people <Col N="482" /> would switch from electricity to solid fuel burning. There would be a spiral; what we would gain on the swings would be lost on the roundabouts. Pollution might be prevented at Moneypoint but more people would burn solid fuel in their homes. Therefore, there would be no serious reduction in pollution. I find that difficult to accept. We either have a determined policy of reducing pollution, taking it step by step, or we do not have it. If we do not have it within our own borders and within the projects that are directly controlled by the State, we have very little moral authority in addressing the situation within the greater industrial nations who obviously contribute so much more to the problems that we have faced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. Senators said it is a framework for action. It is a significant step in addressing a real, major and significant problem.</P>
    <P>The evolving role of Ireland would be to sell itself as a clean, fresh nation among a family of nations whose air, water and land is far less wholesome and far less pure than our own. We have to preserve that now and it is most seriously under threat. If you talk to a German, a Dutchman or someone from northern Italy, their image of Ireland is one of freshness, of clean rivers for fishing and unpolluted countryside. We must maintain that image for ourselves and for future generations. We must do that by being courageous now and shouldering the economic cost of preserving something for all generations to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we have the opportunity to debate the Air Pollution Bill in association with the report of the joint committee on acid rain. This debate comes at a time when there is extreme worry throughout the country as to the effects on the atmosphere as a result of incidents which have occurred in Great Britain, Russia and the Atlantic over the past number of weeks. Unfortunately, we do not have very much control over our atmosphere. Senator Howlin mentioned the fact that people see Ireland as a country with clean air, <Col N="483" /> clean water and an unpolluted countryside. Unfortunately, in many cases the pollution which occurs cannot been seen. It is very easy to see the pollution caused by a smoke stack. Unfortunately, after the Chernobyl incident nobody could look up at the sky and say it was clear and unpolluted and there was no danger. It is unfortunate that as we discuss the Air Pollution Bill we do not have control over the atmosphere. Trans-boundary pollution occurs, trans-country pollution occurs and trans-continental pollution occurs. Although the Air Pollution Bill will solve some of the minor problems associated with pollution it will do very little in terms of reducing the overall level of pollution that is occurring here because of trans-country and trans-continental pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is extremely limited in the sense that there is no costing put down. The only costings mentioned are the fines that can be imposed on people who pollute in any given situation. The Bill is faulty in that it places the onus of control on local authorities. I am not suggesting that local authorities, if given this control, will act irresponsibly but, nevertheless, when local authorities are starved of funds to deal with the everyday problems of providing sewage control, water and all the types of services people need to place this additional burden on them without stating that they will have the financial resources to deal with the problems is a major flaw in the Bill. At present the control of water is within the ambit of the local authorities who, generally speaking, pass the monitoring on to An Foras Forbartha. The Bill suggests and the Minister has stated that the local authority can give the job of monitoring to an outside body such as An Foras Forbartha or an associated company. To do that the local authority would have to pay a fee. If the local authority decide to do the monitoring themselves, there will be a cost factor for the provision of extra staff. At a time when there are cutbacks in staffing levels, this is not practical. Therefore, the Bill <Col N="484" /> will not be satisfactory unless the Minister can give us some indication as to the funding which will be available to local authorities for the provision of the services which are needed to provide the controls mentioned in it. Most of the Bill is taken up with the responsibilities of the local authority and their methods of monitoring. There is very little in the Bill to give me any great hope that as a result of this Bill our atmosphere will be less polluted than at present.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill is welcome but it does not go far enough in telling us how the levels of dangerous emissions will be controlled. It does not go far enough as regards the provision of funds. In his speech, the Minister made much of the fact that apart from Dublin, certain areas of Wicklow and the midlands there is no real pollution problem in Ireland. In his speech he makes a comparison between the levels of pollution in London during the smog of 1952 and the levels of pollution in Dublin in 1984. He failed to say that the cause of the smog of 1952 has been totally eliminated. There has not been a smog in London since 1952, so there is no point in comparing the levels of 1952 with the levels of 1984 as far as Dublin is concerned. There is a pollution problem in Dublin associated with smoke. Senator McGuinness rightly said that people who have health problems associated with their lungs and chests would not agree with the attempted lobby of coal distributors. There is a problem in Dublin at present and anybody walking through the streets can see it: where buildings have been cleaned, within days you can see the build up of pollutants.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Bill we have to take into account the major problems associated with the nuclear industry and those they can cause for us. The nuclear industry is self-protective and narcissist in a sense. The experts all come from the nuclear industry and there is nobody outside the nuclear industry who can say what is going on and what damage can be caused by the proliferation of nuclear plants. We have been told that the effect of Chernobyl will not be of major consequence. In 1973, a study was done in <Col N="485" /> America on reactor safety by Professor Norman Rasmussen, Dean of Engineering at MIT, who with a staff of 50 poured $4 million into a research programme to find out what the likely problems arising from a nuclear accident would be. At present we are being told that there will not be any fall-out damage from the Chernobyl incident. In 1973, it was estimated that for every ten prompt deaths &mdash; this is about the level of death there was in the Chernobyl incident &mdash; there would eventually be 7,000 cancer deaths, 4,000 genetic defects and 60,000 thyroid abnormalities as well as the contamination of some 3,000 square miles of land. The contamination of 3,000 square miles of land is a fact. We know that ten people, approximately, died immediately as a result of Chernobyl and if the figures of Professor Rasmussen are correct we can expect over the next number of years to have major health problems throughout Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann in view of the partial access through private provision for the Arts that is available to children, calls on the Minister for Education and the Government to commit themselves to speedy implementation during the term of the present Government of the Benson report on the Arts in Education so as to enable the children of this country to have access to the Arts as part of their normal development through the curriculum of the school system with the inevitable result of there being a much more widespread enjoyment and appreciation of the Arts in Ireland and above all so much more opportunity for the increased development of the personality and that it further notes the Brinson report &mdash;<i>The Dancer and the Dance</i>&mdash; and the Herron report &mdash;<Col N="486" /><i>Deaf Ears</i>&mdash; which develop the proposals of the Benson report in the respective areas of theatre, dance and music.</P>
    <P>This motion in the name of Labour Party Senators, including myself, draws attention to the state of the arts in Ireland at present. That is its general purpose, but it has within that a more specific intent. It is to pose a series of questions as to what proposals there are to redress the present situation whereby the average child cannot look forward to having access to an introduction to the arts through the educational system. In its first sentence it makes reference to the situation that prevails which is one of private access to the arts &mdash; private provision for partial access. First, there is no apparent policy commitment to putting in place exposure to the arts in the full developmental sense as a major policy provision.</P>
    <P>Secondly, where partial access is involved, it is purchased privately. I have written elsewhere about this and I have drawn a distinction between the facilities which a child might have for exposure to the arts through education and what might be called child improvement. One has only to contrast the difference between an educational system which would accept that the arts were a normal part of development &mdash; that provision should be made for them in the curriculum; that buildings should be flexibly designed so as to make possible the practise of the arts; that teachers should be trained so as to be able to create access to the arts; that conditions should prevail in relation to sums of money for instruments and so forth &mdash; and that which prevails at weekends or evenings midweek in Ireland.</P>
    <P>What I think takes place is that well-meaning parents enrol their children in ballet, piano lessons, dance lessons, bouzouki lessons, violin lessons and so on, saying, as they often do to their neighbours, that the piano lessons will stand to her when she grows up or they thought the child should have dancing lessons. I call that child improvement &mdash; partial <Col N="487" /> access to the arts in a country that has not put a commitment to the arts firmly in place. It is not a substitute for an arts policy.</P>
    <P>This resolution makes reference to three reports, the Benson report of 1979 which drew attention to a whole series of reports which had preceded it and drew attention to the centrality of arts in the normal development of the child and in more recent times two further reports, one dealing with dance &mdash; the Brinson report &mdash; and the Herron report which dealt with provision for music education in Ireland. The third report was entitled Deaf Ears.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion, therefore, is to ask a series of questions initially. The one upon which the motion is built in the first place is the fundamental question: why the arts in the first place? Why an interest in the arts? I can provoke a question in a stronger way. Should we ask this question: why make provision for the arts? In terms of unemployment, is it a question that should be asked only in terms of economic growth? For example, can the list I have mentioned in the first model of provision for the arts in education be defeated by the simple statement that there is no money for all of this? Secondly, who should have access? Should there be general access to formation in the arts or should there be partial access? Thirdly, how should that access be provided?</P>
    <P>What are the implications for a society where one has to purchase the right to have an aural capacity to be able to listen to music, a visual capacity, a capacity to move, to have access to all the usual repertoire of creative development? What are the consequences for personality? What is the relationship between, for example, the total effect on the school and other subjects? It is said that we teach geography very creatively, that we even teach a little creativity in history. I do not doubt any of that, but in moving the motion I am interested in the answers to these fundamental questions. Finally, and the initial question: <Col N="488" /> who should pay? The entire society suffers in a system where only those who can pay privately have the kind of experiences I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I might answer these questions in the few words that I have to say but there are other more practical questions on which I would like to hear some answers. I thank the Minister for Education for his presence here this evening because he is probably in a position, more than anybody, to answer my questions. What is the present status of the Benson report published in 1979 on Arts in Education? I am not interested in the present state of development of the Curriculum of Examinations Board. I am interested in the broader proposals of the Benson report. Also, what general proposals exist in relation to an arts policy, because in fairness to the Department of Education, it would be difficult to have a policy for arts in the schools if there were not a clear arts policy relating to arts generally within society. Finally, which is the most mundane matter in so far as the third question has implications for the first two: what is the present thinking of the Cabinet in relation to the proportion of funds which will be provided in the normal provision next year for the arts in education or through the most exotic source of the proceeds from the national lottery?</P>
    <P>To return to the questions I posed for myself in the beginning, John Benson in his report prepared for the Arts Council in 1979, quoted Professor Bodkin's report of 1949 on the arts in Ireland as follows:</P>
    <P>In Irish schools, the subject of art, in either the historical or the practical aspect, is neglected. Few of the principal schools and colleges, for either boys or girls, employ trained teachers to deal with it, or possess the requisite accommodation and equipment for the purpose.</P>
    <P>It is now 1986 and I am encouraged to ask: how many inspectors within the Department of Education now deal specifically with the question of arts in <Col N="489" /> education? How many and to what purpose? How many schools do they deal with and so on? The introduction to the Benson report also quoted a report by a Scandinavian group on design in Ireland which noted:</P>
    <P>The Irish schoolchild is visually and artistically among the most under-educated in Europe...</P>
    <P>It quoted the Richards report of 1976 entitled &ldquo;Provision for the Arts&rdquo; which stated:</P>
    <P>More needs to be done to persuade boys' schools to provide music courses; their neglect of music is an affront to education standards.</P>
    <P>The report did not simply repeat other reports and draw pessimistic conclusions. It spoke about a number of initiatives that might be taken. A great debate then started about changing the curriculum.</P>
    <P>I am very worried, and it is one of the reasons this motion is down here, because there seems to be an absence of an explicit commitment to the proposals contained in the Benson Report. Even far less is there a commitment to a time scale in which it might be implemented. Are the fundamentals of the report accepted? Which sections of the proposals are not accepted? What is the time scale on the implementation of those that are accepted and how do they relate to other initiatives that might be taken in relation to the arts?</P>
    <P>The Brinson report, <i>The Dancer and the Dance,</i> in answering why we should be interested in the arts and have arts in the curriculum, listed six reasons that had been given in an earlier report of the Gulbenkian Foundation under the heading of Arts in Education. The six reasons it gave were:</P>
    <P>1. They are necessary to develop the <i>full</i> variety of human intelligence in all its different modes. We need all the modes and languages of communications.</P>
    <P>2. They enhance capability and adaptability. Thus, times of economic <Col N="490" /> depression are times for <i>more</i> not <i>less</i> expenditure on the Arts.</P>
    <P>3. They encourage the education of feeling and sensibility.</P>
    <P>That third reason draws attention to the false contract between reason and imagination in the school system &mdash; this deadly cancer so present in Irish education for so long, that it is only when one has order, rote learning and total authoritarian control, that one has true education taking place.</P>
    <P>The Gulbenkian report and other reports have suggested that it is in an atmosphere of relaxation when one has a flexible environment, more participation by the child, flexible movement by the teacher and facilities for using imagination, that learning can take place. These arguments are not defeated by suggesting that there has been such a change in the larger society, that our children are now not able to be educated except in conditions of greater control and so on. I am simply making the case without being contentious. To suggest that reason and imagination cannot be combined in the curriculum is a very false notion.</P>
    <P>The fourth point is that:</P>
    <P>The Arts in education facilitate a sense of discovery in relation to values. It is by exploring values that we extend our humanity in conditions of change.</P>
    <P>Values that are discovered within and through the application of the arts in education thus extend to other subjects, developing a curiosity. The fifth point indicates that the arts in education facilitate the true understanding of what constitutes culture and identity. One would imagine that at a time when we are living under a far more global version of communications than we had previously, there is a greater case for the arts in education, so that we might explore a modern identity, given the specifics of our environment in history, and equally that we might develop an openness and a tolerance to other cultures and be able to absorb what is best.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the arts in education facilitate <Col N="491" /> the development of physical and perceptual skills that are needed to function in the world of work and more importantly in a world of no work, a world in which one might have to define activity that is simply not rewarded for productive purposes. We might be tempted to say &ldquo;do we not all agree with that?&rdquo;. I must draw on some of my experience as chairman of the Galway-Mayo regional arts board for seven years. When a committee of which I was chairman applied for a grant to run a seminar on dance and physical education, we were told straightforwardly that dance had nothing to do with physical education. We went ahead and we were inundated with applications to attend the seminar and lo and behold an innovative genius decided to run a seminar on physical education that very weekend in the other corner of the country and it became quite difficult for physical education teachers to attend the seminar were were running. That kind of inflexibility is symptomatic of a total failure to understand what arts in education are all about.</P>
    <P>The failure to define creativity is what lies behind much of the failure to define an arts policy. The country is reeling along in an old bogus belief that all creativity is a matter of individual genius. Individual genius there is, but most creativity is something that is acquired and something that is established in a social transaction with others. Artists will tell us that, but reflected in the lay phrase &ldquo;she always had it in her or he had it in him,&rdquo; is the idea that one could say some magic words and what was inside would come out. It is not just a primitive view of creativity, it is a profoundly ignorant view and it is too prevalent. It justified the notion that only the best and the brightest chosen by God or somebody else could develop a sense of dance, theatre, music, writing or whatever, and it was responsible for asserting this private view of creativity rather than a social view of creativity. It helped put down the notion that all children could develop and that all children could develop wonderfully from exposure to the arts. It is <Col N="492" /> that that has led to having an inadequate and totally unsatisfactory provision within the school system and to having what exists as a supplement to that, an obsessional interest in child improvement rather than a general provision in the arts.</P>
    <P>I will give an example. Once in my capacity as chairman of that committee when a ballet teacher had ceased to provide ballet classes in Galway city, my wife and I set about finding a teacher and a venue in which ballet classes might continue and hundreds of children came. Then a dance company was coming from Wexford, and we handed out hand bills to invite parents to come, and about 11 came. They were delivering hundreds of these children for the child improvement dancing classes but, God bless them, they had had no opportunity of ever understanding the importance of dance in its own right.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, attitudes are changing and it is now common belief that those who had no opportunity of being exposed to the arts suffer for it. Exposure to the arts encourages people inevitably, to greater degrees of tolerance. I am not drawing a deliberately negative picture, I have to draw it, because if one waits seven years for a commitment on one report that I mention here, one is entitled to be as strong as I am in making the points that I am making. I do not accept that partial improvements on some of the proposals constitute a reply.</P>
    <P>In relation to music provision, if one looks at countries that have the same gross national product as Ireland, in which the average earnings are roughly the same, and in which the budget on education is the same and one compares like with like, one must immediately notice the underprovision there is for music in the Irish educational system. For example, if a child in the west of Ireland wants to develop his interest in music, the only provision in that regard is a university that has neither a department of drama, that has a one year course in music appreciation, and that has no department of art but which calls itself a university college. It would like to have <Col N="493" /> adequate facilities in this area. It has passed resolutions asking for them, but they are not there. What one can do is that one can have a collection among the neighbours and one can hope for a patron, some Medici from some village in the west of Ireland, or you can have your own private loot to transport your child to Dublin for music lessons. If you want evidence of all this you can take out the report, Deaf ears, and look at the percentage of pupils participating at primary and secondary level. The lack of provision in some community and comprehensive schools is most tragic.</P>
    <P>The story is told in the Herron report. The number of inhabitants in Norway is 3.8 million. The number of official schools of music is 193. The number of inhabitants per music school is 19,900. In Denmark there are 4.9 million people; there are 207 schools of music; and the number of inhabitants per music school is 23,700. In Finland there are 4.7 million people; there are 82 music schools, and the number of inhabitants per music school is 57,300. In Ireland the number of inhabitants is 3.4 million; there are four schools of music; and there are 850,000 inhabitants per music school. That tells a story. Either you believe that the right to have access to developed aural sense, to be able to listen to music, is something that belongs democratically to every family and every child in every area, or you do not. We have decided &mdash; whether it was official policy or not &mdash; that we would exclude the majority of children in a great part of the country from the opportunity to develop an aural sense.</P>
    <P>In relation to The Dancer and the Dance, the third report to which I referred, that simply repeats the general case for the arts in education but it goes on to look at the specific case in relation to dancers and to the whole treatment of dance. I have no doubt in my mind that dance, like everything else, is now rising in popularity, overcoming enormous prejudices based on sexism and based on definitions of what is appropriate male and female participation. It is probably the one area which has the least provision <Col N="494" /> made for it within the building section of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Here I want to make a statement which I would like to have refuted for the sake of my own edification. I am interested in the buildings that have been erected in the modern period. I notice how few flexible walls there are in them, so that, for example, you would have rooms that might be turned into theatres. I am interested in the kind of floors that have been put in so that you could, for example, practise dancing without breaking any bones, elbows, ankles or whatever, or doing yourself severe muscular damage. There are very few. In fact, the absence of a commitment or policy on the arts feeds into an absence of an explicit policy for curriculum inclusion. The failure to extend the curriculum inclusion and create access is reflected even in the physical setting of education. It is reflected equally, of course, in the professional training of teachers, the requirements that are there in relation to the release of people for in-service training and so forth.</P>
    <P>I put down this resolution to ask for unanimous support from Members of the Seanad and to indicate to the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for arts that they would have our support. Money must be provided in the Estimates for the arts in general and particularly for arts in education. I will conclude by mentioning what I feel are some of the missing elements of the arts policy in general. One of the problems is that it must begin by taking on some of the issues which the Benson review of previous reports dealt with. That is the definition of creativity itself in a social sense. It must accept that there is a developmental purpose in the arts which spills over into other areas and that the inter-school system will benefit from the placing of the arts at their centre. This will require co-operation from trade unions and from people who manage schools in releasing people to be retained, and so on, to develop competences in this area.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a comprehensive <Col N="495" /> philosophy of the arts. I am particularly worried that when private provision is made for the arts a number of things happen. For a start a certain aspect of the arts does not get developed. You may ask what are the public supporting at present. The answer is that they are supporting very much an extraordinary explosion in community arts, redefining the phrase &ldquo;access to the arts&rdquo;. They are not talking about access to a building. They are talking about being able to participate in the arts as a formative part of their own lives. That is what people are asking for. One needs a strategy and a policy in relation to provision for the arts.</P>
    <P>On 1 July 1986 the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, wrote to me about the provision of an arts centre and theatre in Galway city. He told me that the Director of the Arts Council had indicated that &ldquo;the Council is most actively considering this matter at present and that it is hopeful of concluding its deliberations before the end of the summer&rdquo;. He went on to point out that £897,000 had been expended by the Arts Council in the Galway area. I was grateful for that information but I would even be more enthusiastic if I knew there was an arts policy in place. As somebody involved in the arts for a good number of years, I think the very worst thing that could happen in relation to the arts would be the disbursement of sums outside the framework of a coherent policy. A coherent policy should take on board a number of responsibilities of a moral kind in relation to the place of the artist in Irish society. There is a great deal of guff about the position of the artist in Irish society. Among the common assumptions associated with that guff is that idea that artists can live on air.</P>
    <P>In 1980 a survey entitled &ldquo;Living and Working Conditions of Artists&rdquo; was initiated to their credit. It was a three volume report commissioned by the Arts Council and reported in 1980. It gave the living conditions of artists which were an indictment of Irish society. The number of them who were living on an income of several hundred pounds was a scandal. <Col N="496" /> In that regard the Association of Artists in Ireland in their report entitled &ldquo;Crisis in the Arts&rdquo; published in 1984 made many recommendations. I have time to deal with only one. It is their recommendation in relation to the living conditions of artists. In that report there was a very specific suggestion. It was that Ireland should take the example of the Federal Republic of Germany under the influence of suggestions from the European Commission that the living conditions of artists be improved. I believe we should follow that example.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about the fact that many artists provide a great stimulus to the arts all of their lives, but they have not the necessary social welfare contributions to give them the normal entitlements in times of sickness and old age. This is slightly extraneous to the motion, but it is something about which I feel very strongly and it is a human point. From attending different arts openings and so forth &mdash; and in my time I must have opened over 100 exhibitions &mdash; I am continually faced with young artists who are about to reach the peak of their career and who, if assisted, will turn out to be established artists of immense reputation. But more and more I am meeting people I met at the beginning of my own career who are past the high point of their career and who now look forward to penury. I have examined the provision made in the different artistic trusts and I find that even the trusts themselves, the wills and the bequests that have been made, are heavily geared towards the emerging artist. There is very little for the artist who is over the age of 50 or 60 years and who has not got adequate contributions. I would have liked if, for example, all the private trusts involved in the arts had set aside a portion of their funds to make provision for the retirement of people who had given their lives to the promotion of the arts.</P>
    <P>The social welfare code should be amended in the light of what I have suggested so that recognised artists would be regarded as State employees, their contributions could be accredited and <Col N="497" /> they could look forward to retirement with dignity.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the thrust of the motion. The motion is about the vacuum that is created in the absence of an arts policy and there being, apparently, no full response to the implications of the Benson report. All the later reports acknowledge that the Benson report is the base document from which you must depart. The other docuiments &mdash; Senators can add others in &mdash; dealt with music and dance. I am trying to develop in this resolution, and in initiating the debate, the case for implementing the Benson report. It is simply suggesting that the arts are general rather than specific, that the arts can be appreciated in a social context, drawing from a social theory of creativity rather than an individual one. A spiritual dimension to one's life is released through the arts. It is fascinating to note the consequences of regarding the spiritual as being circumscribed entirely by the religious and there being no other opportunities for the exercise of imagination and so forth.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question about curriculum reform. There should be provision, within the school system, within the new curriculum at all levels, for the arts. I know and welcome every single innovation that has been made. However, let me draw a distinction about innovations that have been introduced by individual teachers and the private collections that have taken place for instruments and so forth. I acknowledge those but I do not regard those as policy that has been supported by financial provision. If we make this commitment, it will pay us even better in times of depression and lack of employment because the people who will leave the school system will be far more balanced, far more flexible and far more sensitive, and will be gifted in intra-personal skills. Most important, we will have created a public who will go on to provide a far more appreciative audience for all of the arts in the decades to come. For those purposes I move the motion on behalf of the signatories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second the motion and to touch on some of the points that the mover, my colleague, Senator Michael D. Higgins, elaborated on in his discourse this evening.</P>
      <P>Traditionally the arts have had a peripheral role in the Irish educational system and, despite changes in the system over the last two decades in particular, that peripheral position has been perpetuated. From that perspective the Labour group tabled this motion to focus on a neglected area of the curriculum and to underline the importance in the whole personal development of people in the formation of the type of society we are going to hand on. Obviously, the key element in that will be the education of our young people. In recent times there has been an emphasis on the practical subjects to the detriment of the personal development of individuals. The arts in particular offer an opportunity and a system to develop the very fundamental qualities of humanity which are probably most needed in the society which will face young people into the next century.</P>
      <P>The access to the arts in education has largely been confined to those in a position to pay for private tuition. This is particularly true in the case of music. Only 39 per cent of students who took intermediate and leaving certificate examination in 1983 included art and/or music among their subjects. The breakdown of figures suggests that in addition to poor facilities and inadequate teaching provisions the arts also suffer from sex stereotyping, with fewer than 1 per cent of boys studying music in that year to leaving certificate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a part of the country that is well looked after, relatively speaking, in relation to the arts. Senator Michael D. Higgins has already referred to the dance company who undertake promotional work and the teaching of dance in primary and secondary schools in the environs of the town of Wexford. They do so living on a shoestring, on the acknowledgment of those schools that permit them to come in, and are paid for directly by the pupils who wish to <Col N="499" /> participate in the programme. Similarly, in Wexford we have the Riffraff Theatre Company who do street theatre and theatre in the schools. They are part of Wexford Theatre Co-Operative, whose very existence next week is threatened when there are no resources to pay the electricity and telephone bills. That is the level of funding and support the arts have. We are fortunate enough to have the Wexford School of Music. The Wexford Youth Orchestra will travel to Belfast next week to give a concert. Again, this is funded privately by collections and by the enthusiastic support of parents, but not by the State. A fundamental part of the entire debate is yet again money, resources and commitment.</P>
    <P>The argument for a radical improvement in arts provision at all levels of Irish education has been well documented. The mover of the motion referred in detail to this. <i>The Place of the Arts in Irish Education</i> by Benson was published in 1979, and <i>The Arts in Education,</i> a report of the Curriculum and Examinations Board was published last year. The Labour Party believe that the opportunities and benefits which flow from the development of creativity and artistic expression should be available to all children, not just to those whose parents can afford to pay or those from a privileged background who appreciate the benefits of being exposed to a sense of the aesthetic. That can be achieved only by giving music, the visual arts, drama and dance an integrated role in the curriculum itself. To this end I would call for the establishment in the Department of Education of a planning committee for the development of the arts at primary and post-primary levels. This committee would have responsibility for the development of an overall plan. That is what is lacking, that is what required &mdash; and was called for by the Curriculum and Examinations Board &mdash; as well as a complete review of the education of teachers for the various arts areas. I call for the appointment of specialist subject advisers in the three subject areas of <Col N="500" /> music, drama and dance, and arts and crafts, with responsibility for promoting and developing their particular art at primary and post primary levels. This should be done on a regional basis &mdash; not just in the cities &mdash; covering the the entire country.</P>
    <P>In terms of music I mentioned the Wexford School of Music, a small, low key affair, existing on goodwill, hard work and precious little resources or State commitment. There are schools of music in Dublin, in Cork and in Limerick. What of the rest of the country? Are they not entitled to have not only peripatetic reaching out from the major centres but also their own schools of music in their own area? There is no plan, no commitment, no co-ordination of the efforts to reach out in the arts to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Drama, although part of the primary school curriculum, should be introduced as a subject in its own right in the junior cycle, not merely as an adjunct to physical education or as an adjunct to the teaching of English but as a creative subject in itself. At senior cycle this should be developed into a practical course which could have its own assessment and certification and would be valuable for people who want to pursue a career at third level.</P>
    <P>The practical music syllabus at junior cycle should be broadened to include other areas of music from traditional, jazz to rock and modern music. I call for a five year development programme. Let us put parameters on what we are going to do. Let us put down in detail where we are going, what we want to achieve at the end of it and each year as we go along. There should be a development programme during which music teachers would be employed on an ex quota basis in post primary schools. The area of media studies is also much neglected and so vitally important in the age we live in. Media studies obviously should be developed as a subject at junior and senior cycle.</P>
    <P>In terms of theatre in education there are, I understand, two such companies in existence in the country now &mdash; Team in <Col N="501" /> Dublin and Graffiti in Cork. I have seen Team in operation in the schools. I know the value they can give to a school. I know the amount of work they do. I understand that through lack of resources they are reduced to two new productions per year. This is not a co-ordinated approach. This is not a committed approach to the development of theatre and dramatic arts in our schools. It is an indictment of us as a country with such a rich artistic and theatrical heritage that this should be the case. Resources must be provided to establish and maintain not only these companies but more companies on a regional basis with productions that can reach into every school in the country at some stage during the school year.</P>
    <P>Teacher training is a key to an enhanced role for the arts in our schools. Admission to teacher training colleges at the moment does not favour applicants with leaving certificate qualifications in arts and music. Anybody who has actually taught at primary level in particular knows how important those skills and subject areas are in communicating with children. Children learn through play, through movement, through music and through song. These are the areas which, if a teacher is strong in them, can be of most benefit and help to the developing child and promote in them a sense of the aesthetic and a depth of humanity, the qualities most vital to the creation of a human. Teacher courses should develop a system of electives and require every student to take a least one intensive elective in either music, art and crafts, drama or physical education which would include dance. Any programme of in-service courses for teachers should obviously have such an arts component.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Educational Awards could be asked to validate existing courses and new courses for music teachers. They could be asked to establish training boards for music and theatre in order to provide professional courses in these disciplines and these subject areas.</P>
    <P>That is a view of the committed programme we could undertake. No doubt <Col N="502" /> the response will eventually boil down to one of resources and money. Anybody with a responsibility for education obviously has at the end of the day, the responsibility to map out the type of education we want to provide for our children. Obviously it has to be of a quality that enriches not only the technical skills young people will require in the 21st century, but more especially the human skills of communication, of understanding which the arts most expecially impart. We commission reports and we leave them to gather dust. We have discussions, but we do not have a committed programme of action. This motion tonight asks us now to look again at where we are going, to decide on these as new priorities and to find the resources necessary to implement the recommendations contained therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate and to support this motion. In view of the limited amount of time available to me I will have to confine my remarks to a few aspects of the motion and a few areas covered in the reports in question.</P>
      <P>The motion, as the mover Senator M. Higgins said, recognises that some children have access to the arts outside the school system. These are children whose parents are in a position to pay for private lessons for them in music, art, drama and dancing. These are the privileged children in our society. The motion also recognises that the vast majority of children in this country have not access to the arts through the curriculum of the school system. These children are deprived of the enjoyment and appreciation of the arts through no fault of their own. This is further evidence that we are still a long way from equality of opportunity for all Irish children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls on the Minister for Education and the Government to commit themselves to the speedy implementation during the term of the present Government of the Benson report on the Arts in Education. It is probably a bit late in the day for that, but <Col N="503" /> I support the motion because I believe its implementation would give greater access, through the school curriculum, to all children as far as the arts are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Benson report on the place of the arts in Irish education was presented to the Arts Council in 1978 and accepted by them in December of that year. That is almost eight years ago. The report was regarded at that time as an excellent one. It contained a large number of highly commendable and very practical suggestions and recommendations which were warmly welcomed. The working party which complied the report consisted of very eminent and distinguished people. Submissions were received from a great number of interested groups and individuals. People involved in all areas of the arts were interviewed. In due course the excellent report to which the motion refers was produced and great credit is due to the members of the working party and to the author of the report, Mr. Benson.</P>
    <P>The report took a very comprehensive look at the role which the arts played in Irish education and how that role could be improved. It is regrettable that so few of the recommendations of the report have been implemented in the eight years which have elapsed since it was published. It is more regrettable still that there appears to be so little commitment to its implementation. Sadly there has been very little improvement in the situation as far as the arts are concerned since the report was published. They are still sadly neglected in Irish education. The Irish school child is still, as Senator Higgins said, visually and artistically among the most under-educated in Europe. Difficulties in the National College of Art and Design were referred to in the report. Many of these problems related to the validation of courses and the uncertainty which existed in relation to some courses particularly the four year art teachers' course. These difficulties are referred to in Chapter 4,3.1 and again in Chapter 6, 1.6 of the report. It is extraordinary that seven years after these difficulties were <Col N="504" /> identified I had occasion to raise them in this House on a motion on the Adjournment on 31 October 1985. I sincerely hope that the problems to which I referred on that occasion have now been satisfactorily resolved. I should like an assurance from the Minister that that is the case. I should like to express the sincere hope that present and future students of that college will never again be subjected to similar experiences.</P>
    <P>The Benson report identifies many of the problems facing the arts at primary school level. It makes the very valid point that if the arts could achieve a more central position in the life of the primary school them this would assist their position throughout the rest of the educational system. In 1971 a new curriculum was introduced in our primary schools. Arts and crafts and music formed two important components of this curriculum. In relation to arts and crafts the new Primary School Curriculum Teachers Handbook, Part 1 states:</P>
    <P>The child finds Art and Craft activities absorbing and satisfying; they are outlets for his creative and artistic ability; they enhance his sensitivity and develop his appreciation of design, pattern, texture and colour in the world around him. They are the basis of many traditional skills and occupations which have been beneficial and satisfying to men and women down through the ages and they are the foundation on which adaptability and enterprise rest. It is doubtful if any other aspect of the curriculum can do so much to foster simultaneously intellect, imagination observation and manipulative skill.</P>
    <P>It is for its intrinsic value, therefore, rather than for any specific training which it involves, that a place must be found for Art and Craft in all classes in the primary school.</P>
    <P>However, serious problems exist for the implementation of these aspects of the curriculum in our primary schools. Many of our larger primary schools have the difficulty of high pupil/teacher ratios. In the smaller primary school teachers are faced with the difficulty of coping with <Col N="505" /> multi class situations. All primary schools suffer to a greater or lesser extent from a lack of resources. The vast majority of teachers have no specific training in the arts. In addition to lacking the resources they lack the skill and the knowledge required for the successful implementation of an arts programme. Also in many primary schools there is inadequate and inferior accommodation which militates against the excellent and gallant effort which very many teachers make to implement this area of the curriculum. The report identifies as a significant fact that very little research or curriculum development has been done on the arts in Irish education. Because of the fact that the vast majority of teachers lack specific training in these areas of the arts there is a lack of confidence on the part of these teachers which results in the situation that has been identified very clearly in the case of music. In chapter 2, 2.5 of this report it is said:</P>
    <P>Music was another subject where the implementation of the curriculum was low, and where teachers felt that the objectives were not being well attained. Only half the teachers felt that they were teaching music satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The same applies to all areas of the arts and in the case of most teachers. A teacher who has not the specific training required for the teaching of a specific subject, in the vast majority of cases, inevitably will lack confidence in his or her ability to teach that subject well. Consequently the teaching of the subject in question will suffer.</P>
    <P>The same is true in the case of the teaching of music and drama. As Senator Howlin said, drama does not form a specific part of the curriculum. Although it has valuable possibilities for the teaching of many facets of the curriculum it is not widely used in Irish schools because of the lack of training and confidence amongst teachers in the area of drama. Creative dance is an integral part of the physical education curriculum. This is another subject which presents considerable difficulties for teachers partly because of lack of training and of suitable facilities. <Col N="506" /> The report identified all these problems eight years ago and went on to make very specific and worth-while recommendations as to how matters could be improved.</P>
    <P>In Chapter 2, 2.7 of the report it is said:</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, an urgent and immediate need for a systematic programme of inservice training in art and craft, music, dance and drama for primary teachers. Courses run during school time appear to have a higher rate of attendance than those run in the summer holidays. The inservice training programme might offer courses which are a blend of both the teacher's own time and of his worktime.</P>
    <P>The report then went on to deal in detail with the various types of inservice courses and training which should be made available. A very important recommendation contained in this section is that, in the case of block release for specialist arts courses the Department of Education should provide and pay substitute teachers for those attending the courses.</P>
    <P>Another very important recommendation made by the working party concerns the appointment of specialist inspectors and specialist subject advisers. There is also a suggestion that, in larger schools, specialist teachers should be employed and, in the case of smaller schools, such specialist teachers could be shared between a number of schools. However, the report concedes that without adequate resources in terms of grants, materials and facilities a satisfactory situation will not be achieved. It is purely a reflection on our commitment as a society and on the commitment of the Department of Education to the whole area of arts that so little progress has been made on all these recommendations since the report was published.</P>
    <P>Another relevant section of the report as far as the points which I have been making are concerned refers to the state of the arts in teacher training and in our colleges of education. In relation to the <Col N="507" /> training of primary teachers the report refers to the perception of the arts by students entering the colleges of education. This perception is confirmed by the low status of the arts in the colleges themselves. On page 69 the report states in relation to students entering colleges of education:</P>
    <P>Arriving in a college of education they observe that the arts are generally under-staffed, do not have degree status and are generally regarded unenthusiastically by practising teachers. This tends to confirm their views on the low status of the arts. The report indicates a number of ways in which this situation could be changed. Unfortunately very few of these recommendations have been implemented over the years since the report was published.</P>
    <P>At post primary level the situation in relation to the arts is even more unsatisfactory. In my view one of the biggest factors which militates against the arts at second level is the competitiveness of the system and the pressures on students. The fact that almost all our third-level educational institutions now operate selection procedures, based on a points system, has led to a situation of extraordinary pressure on students and a concentration on a range of subjects which does not embrace the arts to any significant degree. There is the further problem that the arts suffer from a lack of fully trained or qualified teachers in second level schools. This is particularly true in the case of music, art and drama. In the case of art the position is outlined in Chapter 3, 3.20 of the report and a comparison which was made with the situation in Northern Ireland at that time is very interesting. Time does not permit me to quote from that section, but I would be very interested to know the extent to which the position has improved since then.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to express my support for this motion and to express my regret once again that so little progress has been made in relation to the <Col N="508" /> recommendations of the Benson report since its publication eight years ago. I am not so optimistic as to believe there will be any further progress on it in the lifetime of the present Government whose days are numbered, but I do sincerely hope that, when the new Fianna Fáil Government take office after the general election an enlightened Minister for Education under an enlightened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All of us as legislators and as adults in the community have said what we would like to see done with regard to the provisions of arts in education, but I would like to refer Senators to the attitudes of young people to education and in particular to a survey undertaken by the MRBI in April 1985. In the context of what we are debating here tonight, something quite frightening is written on pages 4 and 5 regarding the importance students attach to particular subjects and I quote from the report:</P>
      <P>Of nine specific subjects assessed and rated on basic importance, Mathematics, English and Computers are positioned as particularly so, with majorities rating each as very important. To a slightly lesser extent, Modern Continental Languages and Physical Education are also positively classified in this regard.</P>
      <P>Irish and Politics are seen as much less important, while Art and Music are positioned at the bottom of the scale with approximately one in twenty rating each as very important.</P>

      <P>May I refer to Senator Mullooly's winding up comments? I have here before me a Fianna Fáil discussion document, <i>Education in the Early Years,</i> which he claims the new Fianna Fáil Government will put into action.

      <P>Senator Mullooly's final comments referred to the promises Fianna Fáil will implement if they are returned as a future Government. We all wish young people today could be helped to develop an appreciation of our artistic heritage. The development of the arts can contribute in many ways to the development of personality and to commercial life today which seems to dominate most aspects of education and activity. In commercial life the arts can contribute to the design and good presentation of new products. Young artists are all too often whipped up by commercial interests who use them in a selfish way to promote their own products. I suppose one could look at this in another way &mdash; that it is good to have an outlet for the work of good artists in any society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an understatement to say that the arts have been neglected in Irish education down the years. Despite the fact that we have had 30 years or more of reports, starting from the Bodkin report in 1949 right up to the present Benson report and more recent ones, there is one underlying feature common to all. There is a clear lack of support, a noticeable disinterest and a lack of policy in the area of arts and education within the Department of Education. Until such time as the Department's outlook towards these three very important aspects is changed, there is a danger the arts will disappear from the Irish education system. The Arts Council have long considered the development of the arts in Irish education <Col N="510" /> as a priority. While the Arts Council are performing very good works, I do not think the Department, through the educational process, will be allowed to forget their responsibilities. Senator Howlin and Senator Higgins emphasised the importance of making this report an action programme which will make the arts available to all students.</P>
    <P>My first recommendation is that we adopt this Benson report as an action programme. Previous reports merely investigated and made statements, but here we have an opportunity for action based on the recommendations of this report. It is my belief that if art is to have an importance in the Irish educational system, it will have to take root at national school level. We are all aware of the pressures in the national school system. There are bad facilities, bad buildings and overcrowding in many cases but thankfully, over the past few years a very conscious effort has been made to improve those conditions throughout the country, but in order to develop the arts in a positive way within the school curriculum we do not have the facility of, say, basic instruments in national schools.</P>
    <P>Very recently there was a great hubbub on the education scene when computers were provided to every second level school. At this stage we should demand as a matter of urgency that basic non-expensive instruments should be provided in a specialist room for music in particular, and art in another area in the educational system. This would be a first small step forward, and a positive step.</P>
    <P>It is hard to expect under the present conditions that the onus will fall on teachers to develop overnight a policy with regard to the arts in education. At present only the most enthusiastic and committed teachers follow through what might be classed as good students in particular areas of the arts. They take them not in the class or at school but, through their own initiative, outside school hours and give them tuition. I disagree with some of the comments of the proposer and the seconder of the motion who said that only those who can pay for study of <Col N="511" /> the arts and particularly for music can get tuition. I believe that outside among the community there is a wealth of goodwill that could be tapped, whereby tuition could be given to young pupils who show an interest, but unless that interest is created in the classroom that wealth of experience and the ability to tutor others cannot be tapped suitably.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins stated that formalities are too restrictive within the school system and I agree thoroughly with him. If we had a proposal by this Government today to encourage people who have the time and the expertise to come into the school system to offer tuition free gratis by way of goodwill and commitment in regard to the arts &mdash; music, art and dance &mdash; what would be the first reaction in the schools? Would it be turned down and for what reasons? I am certain that because of trade union rules and restrictive practices of one kind or another, that proposal would be turned down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished with that point. Problems about the availability of schools could be overcome. Throughout the country today we see schools that are supposed to be closed from 4 o'clock until 9 o'clock the following morning being utilised for further education, and for education in the arts. There has been a change in thinking by the managers and the management boards. I am glad to say that even in the last couple of months an experimental step was taken by the CEO in County Galway who purchased a piano for every vocational school in County Galway. Statistics may dismiss it as insignificant but allied to that he has given a commitment that if a student is prepared to come into any vocational school in County Galway he will provide a teacher, perhaps not a fully trained teacher, to give tuition to that student. It is a welcome step and a very important one and I wish it could be embraced not just in vocational schools in County Galway but <Col N="512" /> throughout the country and in all other schools, private schools as well as comprehensive and community schools.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of disadvantage was referred to in the debate. I come from the west, as do the proposer of the motion and the chair, and we realise the lack of facilities along the west coast from Donegal to Kerry, with the exception of Cork, particularly for music. I propose to the Minister that he should as a matter of urgency provide, in consultation with University College, Galway, and Galway and City Vocational Education Committees, a school of music or alternatively, or both, a department of music within University College, Galway. About 12 students from my own immediate area are at present studying music in Cork. I make that proposal and I hope the Minister will treat it as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the importance of the arts in education for the underprivileged and those with special needs. The good work that has been done by health boards and volunteer groups has been most valuable and must be of tremendous value to handicapped people who use the arts as a means of communication. In many instances it is their only form of communication with others. I hope the Department of Education will also see as a priority funding for people at risk, the handicapped people so that access to study of the arts be made readily available to them as it may be their only means of communication with the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one encouraging aspect in regard to the arts. It is referred to in paragraph 3, page 7 of the introduction of the Herron report. It states that at post primary level the good news is that in the leaving certificate examination there has been a consistent rise in the percentage of boys and girls sitting music examinations. However, it added that the reality is more sobering when it is realised that in 1983 this increase amounted to .73 per cent for boys and 3.68 per cent for girls. In 1985 some 2.9 per cent of the total number of candidates sitting the examinations took music examinations and that is encouraging. Despite what many speakers have <Col N="513" /> said, there is encouragement there and it is something we can build on, provided there is a change in the Department of Education, particularly among the policy makers who seem disinterested and unwilling to give direct commitments to the arts in education.</P>

      <P>The central theme of the motion is contained in the words,</P>
      <P>...calls on the Minister for Education and the Government to commit themselves to speedy implementation during the term of the present Government of the Benson report on the Arts in Education as to enable the children of this country to have access to the Arts as part of their normal development through the curriculum of the school system...</P>
      <P>That was the motivation in the minds of the Labour Senators who put down this motion. The motion also speaks of more opportunity for the increased development of the personality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any community or any society claiming to be civilised must be able to achieve a balance within the motivation of the entrepreneur, the almost overwhelming obsession about economics and the love of beauty. We live in a harsh economic world and I can readily forgive people who suffer from this obsession. We insist willy-nilly, not realising what we are doing, that we will become a more affluent society but we never realise we should be insisting that we become a more civilised and educated society, a society that appreciates beauty. On that point there is no forgiveness for the Irish people because we are surrounded by beauty in our land, our rivers, our mountains, our sea, even the soft rains. There is less excuse for the Irish not appreciating the value of all the art forms and the love of beauty contained in their expression. If a civilised society does not get to that balance by way of relieving the economic pressure or the harshness that comes from it, they finish with a Star Wars situation. There is an ideological conflict, one side saying it can make a better life for everyone, the other saying they can <Col N="514" /> beat them, thus leading to war. There is not much intelligence in that.</P>
    <P>One of the end results of an appreciation of beauty and the practising of art forms obviously must be a more sensitive mind, a love of literature, music, sculpture, crafts and design which must also result in more tolerance of the point of view of others. Senator Howlin referred to neglect of the appreciation of the arts because we do not teach it and do not think much about it. It was felt that people who developed this artistic mentality were wasters who did not want to work too hard at manual labour, engineering science and so on. This is nonsense &mdash; again a test of a civilised society, that is one making a claim to be civilised and tending to become more unbalanced with their conflict of class and ideology. The balance is not there and they are guilty. As Senator Howlin said, the educational system was not geared to the training and appreciation of the art forms. The great majority of teachers do not know anything about teaching art, because they were not trained; it is not their fault.</P>
    <P>We can be justly proud of our educational system, but not of the areas which we have neglected. We must get our priorities right. The Benson report should be implemented before the Government go out of office, say, in one year's time. That is the normal time for the Government in the Republic. When that time is up they should have some plans to push forward so that the educational institutions will accommodate the teaching, training and the whole impetus towards an appreciation of all the art forms. Senator Howlin asked why art forms remain inside our educational institutions in this peripheral area. And that is the question which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are three main areas involved &mdash; the State and its educational institutions inside which teachers should be trained in art. I will not ask how many are trained. I am simply saying that teachers should be trained in art as part of the educational system.</P>
    <P>The second element is parental influence. Because the parents have not been <Col N="515" /> trained they may not be sympathetic. If they are unsympathetic to their children they might hinder some appreciation of art forms in their children. There is a balancing influence in the third element, the community. Senator Burke said that there is a community consciousness which the Government will have to tap. The idea of community involvement is balancing exercise.</P>
    <P>I occupy a unique position in this debate, I dare not go home to Derry and say that I did not speak on it. I have five sons, four of whom are heads of the art department in the colleges where they teach, and the fifth is the director of the Municipal Art Centre in Derry which he built up. His father promoted the idea when he was a member of the Derry Development Commission along with the idea of a theatre for Derry. I was talking about getting sensitivity in the minds of people, and tolerance. My only daughter also teachers art. Do not ask me how it happened because the BBC asked that once and I said: &ldquo;It is a family quarrel you are looking for.&rdquo; My wife happens to be an artist and a good one. One of my sons said that I was a bit of an artist, I do not know what he meant by that but I have a good idea.</P>
    <P>The love of beauty must be seen to be embraced inside all art forms. We must adopt a civilised attitude to all the art forms in our educational system. That means funding, specialist operations, building and money. In the last analysis this means Government motivation, a resolution which I am glad to say will be unanimous. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very short because most of the points have already been adequately covered. I am glad that so many speakers are taking this matter so seriously because art is part of our heritage and upbringing. Government funding is needed. Many points have been put forward but the ones with which I was impressed were made by the speaker from Galway when he said that a piano was provided in every VEC <Col N="516" /> school in County Galway. We went one better in Westmeath where the VEC provided a piano and a harp free of charge in all their schools. We found to our sorrow, however, when we had all the expertise and teaching staff organised that we had to charge £70 for 15 lessons of a half-hour's duration in evening classes. In some schools we did not get the required numbers basically because of the terribly high cost charged for those lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also recommend that instruments should be purchased and grant aided or fully aided by the Government to promote music in the schools. One speaker advocated a special room for the teaching of music and art in schools; that is an excellent idea and should be investigated by the Minister and his officials. In other parts of the EC we are all well aware of the 100 per cent grant aid from the Government to member students. That is why most of the top musicians, ballad, folk, rock or pop on this island come from the North because from the age of six years they were able to get their instruments and to become professionals by the time they reached their mid teens, which is the peak for creating young artists, making them pop stars and airing their wares right across the world. Down here it is practically impossible to do anything unless you come from a family with means who are in a position to purchase instruments. No matter what kind of an instrument you purchase nowadays it will cost in the region of £300 plus. There should be a system whereby instruments would be purchased for a particular school and passed on from student to student. The Government can play a very important role in this area. We all know the temptations that exist today. There are the temptations of going out on the streets at night. No-one knows better than I. I come from very near the town of Mullingar. We have the biggest band in Ireland comprising both musicians and majorettes. They are all-Ireland champions and are rated second in Europe in the big band section. The band leader and his two assistants make an enormous <Col N="517" /> contribution and there are more than 390 people on the rolls. These are young boys and girls from the ages of seven to about 25. Not alone are they learning how to play Irish music but they are under strict supervision. They are a credit to the people of the area who have to run concerts and organise functions to buy instruments. When they meet their opponents from Northern Ireland and other European countries they soon find out that they are grant-aided and are given all the help and encouragement necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Minister for coming here for this important motion in which I am asking him to increase the speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and on carriageways and by-passes to 70 miles per hour. The speed limit we have is unique. It was brought into effect in 1974 by the then Minister because of a fuel shortage. At present there is a surplus of fuel and the sales of fuel have dropped. I would ask the Minister to harmonise our speed limits with those on the continent so that tourists, who are very valuable to this country, will not be confused. The Minister and his Department have done a great job on the by-passes, dual carriageways and roads in the past few years. We have by-passes which cost approximately £3 million per mile. In a country which has the most expensive cars in Europe and which has a considerable mileage of arterial roads second <Col N="518" /> to none in Europe, it is a nonsense to have the speed limit restricted to 55 miles per hour.</P>
      <P>At present many people are bringing the law into disrepute by breaking the speed limit. Many are doing it unconciously. It is a nonsense that on some of our roads on which a very high speed is feasible you have to drive at 55 miles per hour while you can still drive at 55 miles per hour on some of our secondary roads on which such speed is not feasible. For that reason I would look for harmonisation of speed limits. I would also like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the number of new roundabouts which have been provided. They are valuable and in towns they will do far more to restrict speed than anything else. The signs indicating speed limits as you approach a town are too small and should be made bigger. I would also like to refer to motorcyclists. As in all built-up areas there is a 30 miles per hour speed limit in Dublin city but motorcyclists drive around this city as if they were on a racetrack. There is a ward in the Richmond Hospital known as the Honda ward because not a day passes without one or two motorcyclists being admitted. They should be restricted because they drive recklessly. One often sees pedestrians jumping for their lives off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would take these matters into consideration and review the speed limit for the purposes I mentioned. It would be valuable for our tourism and for people buying very expensive cars who could then drive on suitable roads such as the by-passes and the dual carriageways at a higher speed. I drive regularly to Kerry. At one time I could drive to Limerick comfortably in three hours whereas it now takes me four-and-a-half hours to do the same journey. You drive along the dual carriageway out of Dublin and along the Naas by-pass. You have a clear run until you come into Newbridge where there is a bottleneck. From there to Portlaoise you would think it was the middle of the summer or a holiday weekend with the traffic jams that are on the road. <Col N="519" /> Many accidents are caused because of traffic jams. It would be in everybody's interest if the Minister would have a good look at this matter and review it as I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion on the Adjournment and I compliment my colleague, Senator Daly, on tabling it as it affects many people in all parts of the country. The speed limits in this country are unrealistic. As has been explained by Senator Daly that the relatively low limit of 55 miles per hour was introduced at a time when there was a great national effort to conserve fuel and when the importation of fuel was a major problem. I accept that motorists should always travel with care and show consideration for other persons using the road but the present regulations which have a blanket 55 miles per hour maximum right across the country do not differentiate between, on the one hand, dual-carriageways, arterial roads, national primary roads, national secondary roads, county roads, or indeed laneways or bog roads. On the other hand, neither do they differentiate between a 20 year old banger with drum brakes worth £50 and a new Mercedes or Jaguar with over 100 brake horsepower, costing £50,000 or more. Under Irish law both may travel at 55 miles per hour on the open road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly has made the case for recognising the fact that over the last number of years the Minister and his predecessor have provided a considerable amount of money &mdash; I think £500 million &mdash; in the present national road building programme to upgrade and greatly improve the arterial road network. It seems ridiculous, with the new high standard of roads &mdash; and we have a considerable mileage of very high standard on the arterial roads &mdash; that there should be a blanket speed limit of 55 miles per hour, which so many people are not over zealous about acknowledging or keeping within it. The time has come for the Minister to review the matter and perhaps categorise it, so that on new <Col N="520" /> arterial roads motorists would be allowed to travel at a higher speed, certainly, than 55 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>While it is desirable that people should be encouraged to keep within the law, it would seem that the gardaí are wasting their time pulling in motorists for exceeding 55 miles per hour travelling, say, from Laois to Dublin on the Naas dual carriageway late at night, or early in the morning, when there would be no other motorist in sight in either direction. There must surely be more important things for the gardaí to do. I would support the idea that, perhaps on arterial roads, the speed limit could be raised to 70 miles per hour. Also, the Minister might consider putting a blanket speed limit on county roads. If one stays within the law and does 55 miles per hour down a bog road, one certainly cannot be considered as having great consideration for other users of the road, but that is the law as it stands. The Minister in his programme has made a significant contribution to the development of our road network which is quite obvious in the number of major road building programmes on arterial roads in every county in the Republic. I hope he recognises the need to review the present speed limits and give motorists who want to get from one destination to another as quickly as possible some chance of doing their business and going about their day's work without making small infringements in the law as it stands. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion put forward by Senator Daly is a very modest one. He is not asking that speed limits be abolished although I am sure that, however modest Senator Daly's proposal is, there is some lobby somewhere waiting to oppose it. It seems that in Irish society at the moment no matter what is proposed somebody wants to stop it. Any law that is observed more in the breach than in the observance should at least be considered. The reality is that people simply do not obey this law. In many cases we should take political credit for <Col N="521" /> the excellent roads that are now in existence.</P>
      <P>It is natural for most people &mdash; and they are ordinary people, not criminals &mdash; travelling on an excellent road to want to exceed the 55 miles per hour limit. If I were to observe that law travelling up and down from Cork every day, I would probably be classified as some sort of road hog. There is no way one can do 55 miles per hour heading on to the Naas by-pass, unless one wants to be very unpopular. If there were a more reasonable upper limit perhaps it would be more easily acceptable.</P>
      <P>The massive investment in road infrastructure was supposed to have a spinoff in time saving, energy saving, etc. Certainly the British industrial authorities always stipulate that some journeys take two hours from London using the M4. They use that as a bait to attract foreign investment so that one can move one's truck from point A to point B rather rapidly with a tremendous saving in time, labour and so on. We do the opposite. We provide very good roads so that we can increase our competitiveness and then we insist on our drivers driving at 55 miles per hour or 40 miles per hour, as the case may be. It makes no sense to have this blanket speed limit, irrespective of road conditions.</P>
      <P>I am not ignoring the very important safety aspect of speed limit <i>per se</i> but, as Senator Daly said, the initial introduction of this limit was not to do with safety, it was to do with energy conservation in a crisis. I may be wrong. If I am, I am sure the Minister will correct me, but my understanding is that it was introduced as an energy conservation measure. That crisis has long passed and it is timely that this legislation in terms of the rules of the road was recognsidered. The gardaí have more important work on which to concentrate their efforts although, obviously, they have a vital role to play in traffic control, safety and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great contributors to accidents is that trucks, in particular, will insist on travelling in convoys. Truck drivers, sometimes from the same company, seem to have special places to stop to <Col N="522" /> have their lunch and tea and they insist, like husband and wife, on being together, irrespective of whether the truck is 90 feet long. This means there is a 180 foot monster in front that cannot be passed out because these drivers want to chat at 2.30 in the afternoon and put their feet up for a while. They simply have no regard for other road users.</P>
    <P>In the United States, company trucks have massive signs at the back saying that if people see a person doing anything wrong to please phone them. If he is causing an obstruction, if he is discourteous, or driving dangerously, road users are asked to telephone the company and complain. I am not advocating that, but certainly something should be done to ensure that people who drive huge juggernauts have more care and concern for other road users.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly's proposal is, in the main, for car transport. I do not think he was referring to 180 foot container trailers. I accept that trucks of the dimensions I have spoken about would possibly need different rules &mdash; different strokes for different folks &mdash; but in the main, given the fact that we have improved our road system beyond recognition in many areas, it is time this prohibition was lifted in the modest way Senator Daly proposes. I recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. I sympathise with the Members of the House, because from my observations here the Senators must be among the worst housed people in the country. Of course, my Department operate a very generous scheme of house improvement grants, and if the House wishes, they might perhaps consider an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the opportunity to be here and the fact that Senator Daly raised this matter. There is no gainsaying the fact that the general speed limits that theoretically operate here are not appropriate, especially for large stretches of newly imported roadways. The general speed limit was reduced from 60 miles an hour to 55 miles an hour as an energy <Col N="523" /> conservation measure in 1979. Following that reduction An Foras Forbartha conducted a review of traffic speeds and found that there had been no appreciable reduction in speeds. In a subsequent review, An Foras Forbartha came to the conclusion that the lowering of the speed limit did not have any particular beneficial effect from the point of view of road safety or the incidence of traffic accidents. However, the question of restoring the limit to 60 miles an hour or to some other limit has not up to this time been addressed publicly.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Department of the Environment initiated the possibility of changing and increasing the speed limits but events caught up on them in that the EC Commission proposed in 1984 that they would endeavour to introduce a harmonisation of speed limits throughout Europe. As 1986 is European Road Safety Year the Commission had hoped to have published proposals suggesting a harmonisation of limits during this year. So far that has not happened although there is still a possibility that the Commission may come up with proposals for European standards of speed limits before the end of 1986. Irrespective of that, I will in the next few weeks publish proposals regarding revisions of speed limits.</P>
    <P>A variety of questions need to be addressed and some of them were touched on by the three Senators who spoke. We have a small but growing mileage of motorway, as distinct from high standard dual carriageway and also a radically improved national primary road network. Whether it is any longer appropriate to impose a general limit which would apply or appear to apply to roads of the varying standard, from motorway to county roads and county lanes, is a question which needs to be addressed. On the other hand, if different regimes were to apply for county roads, national secondary roads, national primary single carriageways, national primary dual carriageways and finally the increasing length of motorway, there is some danger <Col N="524" /> that that would create an amount of confusion in people's minds as well as an extraordinarily extended signposting system to alert people to the changing limits from one area to another. It will have to be decided, as to whether there should be one speed limit standard for motorway, perhaps another for improved national primaries of which there is now a very high mileage, and perhaps a third for secondary roads, county roads and outside the urban areas where the 30 mile an hour and 40 mile an hour speed limits still apply. At that time we might also consider taking the opportunity to express the speed limits in kilometres rather than in miles per hour.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Senators did not dwell more on commercial traffic, because as Senator Magner said, one of the main objectives in the extraordinarily heavy Government outlay of money in the three year national road programme which involved spending £500 million over the three years from 1985 to 1987, was the objective of decreasing average journey times. Our industries, especially our exporting industries competing in Europe suffer very much from the fact that we are an island off mainland Europe and as well as long sea or air journeys, before their product can get to mainland Europe to compete with other produce, there is the journey time from wherever the industry is located to the ports of exit. An interesting comparison is that on average, the average miles per hour achieved by Irish commercial traffic is 25 miles an hour, whereas the comparative average for similar traffic moving on the mainland European road network is 45 miles an hour. That gives a fair indication of why so much money has been devoted to the upgrading of our national primary road network.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general 55 miles an hour speed limit for private cars, the speed limit for commercial traffic is 40 miles an hour and 45 miles an hour in respect of buses. As the Senators will know, with new technology and the improvement in design, modern commercial traffic can and does move at a much faster pace than that, once on a <Col N="525" /> road system capable of handling it. One of the things that will have to be looked at again is the question of overall speed limits for commercial traffic, bearing in mind as would have to be done in relation to any possible increase in speed limits, the question of road safety and the assertion which has been always put forward with great effect that speed kills. We have to try to balance the need and the aspiration for road safety. We have a commendable record in the improvement in road fatalities and injuries figures in recent years. Our objective is to allow people to travel on better designed and better built roads in vehicles which are better designed and built, and to achieve higher standards of speed in safety. I hope my remarks will satisfy the Senators that the questions which they have raised will be addressed in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator Magner as to <Col N="526" /> the ability of one to travel from Cork to Dublin at 55 miles an hour. It is possible. I did so myself about six weeks ago on the basis that I decided that of all the people who might feel embarrassed to be prosecuted for an infringement of the speed limit applying, the Minister for the Environment is probably the one to feel most embarrassed if he had infringed the limit set by himself or his predecessor. I assure the Senator that it is not a pleasant journey to travel at 55 miles an hour from Cork to Dublin. It was following that that I initiated the review of which I have spoken, and of which I hope the House and the general public will hear more in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 October 1986.</P>
