      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate his proposals to resolve the particular difficulties that have arisen at Scoil Iognáid in Galway City, where it would appear that the reasonable expectation of the appointment of a 13th assistant teacher to an all-Irish primary school with 450 pupils is being deferred.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 4 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1,2 and 3 in that order.  No. 1 deals with a number of amendments from the Dáil on a Bill the Seanad has already considered.  In the case of No. 2 it is hoped to take the remaining Stages as well as the Committee Stage today.  It is <Col N="292" /> proposed to rise for lunch, at a convenient time which will probably be somewhere around 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.  For the information of Senators I would like to indicate that it is likely that the Urban Renewal Bill, which appears as No. 14, which is well down on our Order Paper today, may be ordered for next week.  It will occupy a much higher position on the Order Paper next week.</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Road Transport Bill in this House Senators put considerable emphasis on the need for better enforcement of the laws relating to road transport vehicles in the areas of insurance, excess weights, speeding and other serious offences.  Senators will recall that this particular area featured very largely in the debate.  It was emphasised that under the new regime being introduced for road transport there would be enforcement of the laws as passed by the legislators.  In the meantime the Government agreed to proposals by the Minister for Communications for the establishment of a multi-purpose inspectorate in his Department with powers to undertake enforcement of a range of legislative measures relating to the haulage industry and to bus transport.</P>

      <P>There was a grey area in the past in the matter of the enforcement of the laws in this matter.  The Bill was amended by Dáil Éireann to include provisions for enforcement in accordance with the Government decision and also to provide for appeals against a decision to refuse to grant a carrier's licence or a proposal to revoke or suspend a licence. It is the intention that enforcement teams comprising gardaí and multi-purpose inspectors operating at roadside checkpoints will be the principal means of enforcement.  Technical experts from other Departments, for example, Department of Labour inspectors in relation to the carriage of dangerous substances, will also be able to participate in the enforcement teams.  Liaison with other Departments will form an integral part of the enforcement programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will note that the enforcement provisions apply to carriage of passengers in buses as well as to carriage of goods.  Inspectors of the Department already enforce the EC regulations on the tachograph and drivers hours which apply also to buses.  The laws relating to the licensing of road passenger transport, the Road Transport Act, 1932 and the EC regulations governing admission to the profession of road passenger transport operator are also administered by the Minister for Communications.  It is only logical that the transport officers should have enforcement powers as regards transport of passengers in buses as well as in regard to road freight transport. <Col N="294" /> It will eliminate unnecessary duplication which might arise.  Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 relate to the enforcement measures.  Amendment No. 1 inserts a definition for &ldquo;transport officer&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill.  The appointment and powers of transport officers are covered by amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3, section 15 of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann, provides the power to appoint transport officers. They are to be given warrants of appointment which must be produced on request to any person in relation to whom a transport officer exercises a power under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4, section 16 of Bill, defines the powers of transport officers and makes it an offence to obstruct such officers in the carrying out of their duties. The transport officers will have power to carry out inspections of vehicles and records to ensure compliance with the provisions of:</P>
    <P>(a)  Road Transport legislation (illegal haulage);</P>
    <P>(b)  relevant EEC Regulation e.g. Tachograph Regulations and regulations governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator;</P>
    <P>(c)  legislation in the area of responsibility of other Ministers relating to road haulage vehicles and buses &mdash; (vehicle weights, vehicle markings, lights, wipers, etc.) subject to such legislation being specified by order made by the Minister after consultation with the Minister responsible for such legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5, section 17 of Bill, empowers the Minister to take summary proceedings for offences detected by transport officers in the course of inspections under section 16.  This is only for minor offences.  We are thinking in this particular area of fines in the region of £20 or so.  The major offences would not be subject to on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6, section 18 of Bill empowers the Minister to make orders specifying the legislation, additional to road transport legislation, administered <Col N="295" /> by him and specified in section 17 (a) and (b) in relation to which the transport officers may exercise their powers and under which the Minister may bring prosecutions for summary offences.  It provides that the making of any such order will be subject to consultation with the Minister responsible for such legislation and with the Commissioner of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2, section 6 of Bill, gives an applicant who has been refused a carrier's licence or the holder of a licence which the Minister proposes to revoke or suspend a right to appeal against any such decision initially to the Minister himself and if that is not successful to the District Court.  It has been felt that as very wide powers are being given to the Minister, under section 5, in regard to suspension/revocation of licences, there should be some avenue of appeal for aggrieved persons.  I accepted the principle of an appeal procedure and this amendment provides it.  It will also apply in case of refusal of an application for a licence.  It was strongly stressed in the Dáil and also here in the Seanad that there should be some avenue of appeal for a person who was aggrieved or felt aggrieved.  An amendment was put down by the Opposition in the Dáil for the High Court but on consideration of all of these matters we decided that the District Court would be a more useful avenue, perhaps a cheaper avenue, more available, more accessible and would probably in the long run be the one most desired by people who might possibly consider that they might at some stage come in front of the court, in this respect. It covers both revocation and suspension and also the refusal of an application for a licence.  It is wide-ranging and there is an avenue of appeal for the person who would feel aggrieved.  As far as an appeal further on than the District Court is concerned, only on matters of law can it go past the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann was deleted on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann because the technical amendment of section 5 of the Road Transport Act, 1978, which it was <Col N="296" /> to have effected has already been made by section 29 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985, which is at present before Seanad Éireann.  This is really a technical matter.  It could be amended or deleted.  It could be amended in either of the Bills going through.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill was the first one to go through the Dáil and consequently it was not necessary to have the particular amendment in this Bill, therefore the deletion.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is to the Long Title: The original Long Title related only to amendment of the Road Transport Bill, 1933.  The new sections in the Bill confer powers for the enforcement of and the prosecution of offences under laws administered by other Ministers.  The Long Title had to be amended to provide for these powers.</P>

      <P>The return to the Seanad of this Bill bears out the broad consensus in all political parties concerning the implications of this Bill on its introduction here to the Seanad.  Most of the things that have been said by Members of both sides of the House have more or less been justified in the fact that the Minister has returned to the House with amendments.  There have been over the last week for example press statements concerning certain sections of this Bill. There are many sections of the community who are dealing in this business and who are rather frightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the change in the attitude of the Minister in the appeal to the court where a licence has been refused.  I welcome the move to allow an appeal allowed further than to the Minister. With regard to the dictatorial attitude that was adopted in the first instance, at least relief is given in that.  That is a major point that was made throughout the debate on road freight and road transport. That is a welcome decision because there are people who believed for numerous reasons that they were on the <Col N="297" /> wrong side of decisions made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There was a certain hope that in this Transport Bill we could, rather than slipping in the regulations concerning the omnibus transport section of it, have had legislation to deal with bussing, private bussing, omnibussing, express bussing or whatever technical name is given to it. Its service to this country today is of such importance that I felt it should have been given a separate entity with certain regulations applying for it.  I am sorry the Minister did not take the opportunity to tackle this legal problem because it is not a physical problem.  It seems to be operating well in the countryside and in the cities.  From the legalistic point of view the services are not to the satisfaction of those operating them.  We read propaganda daily by opposite sides in this field of the alleged breaking of the law, the non-payment of PRSI, cheap labour and all the other criticisms that have been made of it which are not true.</P>
    <P>Those services could not operate with the efficiency which they are operating if such nonsense was being tolerated within the work itself.  The Minister lost an opportunity here by not consolidating in this Bill certain rules, regulations and criteria for the operation of such services which are there and working satisfactorily. City people can see for themselves every Friday evening and indeed daily around the city the wonderful service that is being given by those people at a very reasonable cost.  It may be tied up with the CIE reorganisation legislation coming through the House which seems to have run into very muddy waters as between the Fine Gael and Labour members of the Government.  I have an idea what the problems are but by not doing something here and by not being able to do something in CIE, the whole thing has fallen down again.  I read an article in last Friday's <i>Irish Independent</i> which concerns section 14 of this Bill relating to the increase in penalties.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> (a)  Every person who carries merchandise in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under the section and shall be liable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £5,000.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states: The following subsection is hereby substituted for subsection (2) of section 32 of the Principal Act.  I want the Minister to confirm once and for all if it is true what was implied in the <i>Irish Independent</i> article of last Friday that in relation to any of those express services to this city from rural parts or <i>vice versa</i> or of the private bus companies operating throughout the country the penalties for the illegality of hauling passengers apply to anybody who is allegedly hauling illegal passengers.  I want that question finalised today once and for all.  I do not believe that it does. I feel that the old penalties under the original Act are still not removed in any other section of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel that the penalties are very excessive. I know that £1,000 and £5,000 are easily found figures but the tenacity and competition within business do not allow for people to have so much fluid cash. The Minister is giving an indication to the judicial system that this is the maximum penalty they are demanding.  I cannot agree with this figure.  It is far more important for us to know if those penalties apply to the people engaged in the express bus business, on daily routes throughout the country, bringing passengers at very competitive prices.  Would the Minister also confirm if there is any illegality in that passenger service, will the penalties under the old Act apply or will the new ones apply?  If that is finalised it will at least clarify that position.</P>
    <P>As regards the other amendments, they all speak for themselves.  I believe it is long past the time when legislation should have been introduced to legalise once and for all that express bus service business and the private bus service business operating throughout many counties around the country in many areas where <Col N="299" /> our public transport CIE are incapable or unable to put into operation services themselves.  It is not appropriate that certain things are allowed to happen and other obvious things are not allowed to happen.  The competition today speaks for itself.  The value for money offered by those people to workers going to work rurally, as we know justifies recognition by this Government or by any Government. I can safely state now that it will be Fianna Fáil policy in the future to regularise the situation so that those people can operate properly and not be hiding behind certain methods used to enable them to work within the law.  They are quite open and frank.  They are providing unique and fine services.  I want the Minister to clarify for me today clearly if section 14, the penalties section, applies to those services.  The impression given by the <i>Irish Independent</i> of last Friday certainly is a wrong one.  I hope the Minister can clarify it today.</P>
    <P>We are rather busy here in a confused state in this House in that there are several Bills before us.  We have the Road Transport Bill, the city services Bill and the reorganisation of CIE Bill.  After giving detailed time to all those Bills I feel that we have missed out on many opportunities whereby services could be rendered and where proper regulation could be brought in so that we could have a very fine service as a result of all three Bills.  Perhaps we could adjust the CIE Bill to put proper regulation into it. Obviously, the Bill was unsatisfactory in the first instance.  It has been returned to us amended.  It still is not very satisfactory when wrong interpretations can be taken from it.  The powers granted and the excess penalties included in it far outweigh the reality of the situation in the market-place today.  As regards section 14 and as regards other amendments that have been put in, I feel very strongly about them.  I await the clarification of the Minister before we make a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Killilea seems to be disappointed in relation to <Col N="300" /> certain transport proposals recently.  On the other hand, we have had a tremendous amount of progress on longstanding areas of reform in the transport and communications area such as the need to face the internal problems of CIE and put them on new competitive lines, together with the Bill we will be discussing in a few moments on Committee Stage, the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, which has been sought very much in the Dublin area over the last ten or 15 years.  It is tremendous to see such a comprehensive Bill dealing with that area and also dealing with so many other areas of traffic management that have become crucial to running the private and public transport system in this city and county.</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter of the amendments to the Road Transport Bill, as Senator Killilea has outlined, we had the opportunity of discussing this Bill in considerable detail on another Stage.  I welcome the amendments.  The amendments include the appointment of transport officers, as explained in the speech the Minister made this morning, gardaí and multi-purpose inspectors who will be around the country looking at the way in which vehicles and passenger buses responsible for the transport of goods are operating.  It is important that these particular officers be organised in the manner in which these amendments suggest and that they be very much alive to the importance of following up on vehicle weights, vehicle markings, lights and wipers, the whole standard of vehicles responsible for the transportation of people and goods throughout the State. I would like to know if these transport officers will have a role in relation to CIE and their own operation.  Will they be excluded to the area of monitoring private buses and, of course, vehicles in the freight area, or will they have the wider role in relation to controlling the way in which CIE run their own fleet?  I should like to have some clarification on that when the opportunity arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go over the remainder of the Bill which we have already discussed.  I will confine my <Col N="301" /> comments purely to the amendments proposed by the Minister.  They can be divided into two sections.  One deals with the appointment of a new group of officers called transport officers.  The Minister has devoted a considerable portion of his introductory remarks this morning to the consideration of the necessity for that proposal.  I do not like any proposal which gives additional powers to people to stop transport because the plethora of regulations at the moment which anybody utilising transport has to conform to and the number of documents, licences and other pieces of paper that he or she must have available at the request of the members of the Garda Síochána and now at the request of transport officers, are, indeed, bewildering in their variety.  Therefore, I am not very enthusiastic about the creation of the transport officers.  If the Minister considers they are necessary, I am certainly not going to stand in the way. It is only fair to say that I think there is one very positive introduction by the Minister where he proposes, before section 15 to introduce a new section, subsection (2) of which states:</P>
      <P>Every transport officer shall be furnished with a warrant of his appointment as a transport officer and, when exercising any power conferred by section 16 of this Act, shall, if requested by any person affected, produce the warrant to that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an excellent idea.  It is right and proper that the warrant should be available and should be capable of inspection before the very considerable powers which are given to the transport officer are exercised by him or her.  The second point to which I should like to refer concerns the other amendment which I consider to be quite inappropriate. It deals with the question of appeals. It was common cause of concern in this House and I am glad that the Minister has recognised it in response to representations in this House and the other House that appeals were a good thing.  We all agree with the concept that appeals are <Col N="302" /> good and that it should not be open only to the Minister to make a decision with regard to a matter as important as a merchandising licence in the road transport area.  That is right and proper and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House will recognise that it is proposed that the appeal procedure should operate in two areas, one, in the area where a person makes an original application and is refused or is dissatisfied with the outcome; the other, where the person is for some reason or other being punished by the Minister and the licence is being revoked.  They are two totally different situations.  I should like to remind the House that the original application for a merchandise licence is dealt with by section 2 of the Bill as now before us.  It lays out the criteria which the Minister is to consider in determining whether an application would succeed. Section 2 of the Bill substitutes for subsection (1) of section 11 of the Principal Act and states that every applicant shall state whether he previously had a licence, the registration number of the vehicle, the vehicle plate issuing station at which the applicant proposes to operate from and, lastly:</P>
    <P>...every application shall contain such information as will satisfy the Minister that the applicant complies with the requirements as to good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence...</P>
    <P>They appear to be the three external criteria, the three judgmental things which the Minister will have to consider in deciding whether to give a merchandising licence to somebody.  He will obviously have to see whether the person already has a licence, whether he has a vehicle with the right registration number and all what I would call their factual things.  But there are three judgmental things which he will have to do.  He will have to decide whether a person has a good reputation, whether they have a sound financial standing and whether they have professional competence.</P>
    <P>I recognise that that is the game and that is the way it has to be played.  I <Col N="303" /> recognise that the Minister is in a position to make those judgments.  The reason we were in favour of the new procedures is that the Minister would not always make the right decision.  He might make a flawed decision for some reason or other. He has to make three decisions on good reputation, sound financial standing and professional competence.  If the Minister decides in a particular case not to grant a licence and that licence is appealed to an appeal officer, then apparently, that appeal procedure will have to adopt the same criteria, will have to examine the application on the same basis as the Minister originally examined it and see whether the Minister made a good decision.</P>
    <P>The appeal tribunal which we have decided to insert is the District Court. How is a district justice in a position to judge?  He might be in a unique position to judge whether a person has a good reputation or not.  He is hardly competent to judge there and then at a hearing whether the person has sound financial standing on the basis of information presumably presented during the course of an appeal hearing in the District Court which, the courts being what they are, will be ten minute jobs.  Thirdly, he certainly is in no position to judge the professional competence of the person making the application.  How could a district justice make those decisions?  I am in favour of an appeal procedure.  I want an appeal procedure.  I agree with Senator Killilea that we asked for an appeal procedure.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the other House the High Court was the forum proposed by the Opposition.  I think there might be something in that, that it would be a better forum, even though it would be more expensive.  It would be a better forum than the District Court.  Also it would suffer from the same problem. How is a judge, who has no experience in these matters, to judge the professional competence of somebody in the area of road transport?  We have experience in this court of appeal procedures &mdash; the planning appeal board is an example.  We <Col N="304" /> have had our problems with the planning appeal board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had our problems with them.  Having said that, we would have had more problems in my opinion &mdash; not if it was left to the Minister because that was the old system, but in comparison with the situation as to what it would be if it was left to a district justice.  How would a district justice be able to judge a planning decision?  Similarly, how could a district justice with a busy list, which includes everything from returning people for trial for the most hideous of offences to road traffic offences to civil processes, find the time and educate himself with the expertise necessary in order to make a decision as to the professional competence of the applicant for a merchandising licence? The situation is daft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great respect for district justices. They are the jewel in the crown of the legal system in this country for the amount of work they get through on a very fair basis.  But with the best will in the world they certainly have no expertise in the area of road transport and of professional competence for a merchandising licence.  The only thing a district justice may be able to pick up is the person who has been refused the licence. I am speaking now of a person who has been refused a licence, not the person who has got into trouble, where the person has been refused a licence for personal reasons, reasons of personal spite with the Minister.  I am not suggesting that that would be something which would happen often but it is obviously something we must guard against.  The district justice would be quite competent to pick up that kind of vibration, shall we say.  As to be able to pick up a judgment which the Minister would make with regard to a person's professional competence, is in my opinion, not realistic. When the Minister decides, because somebody is not professionally competent or because they do not have a good reputation or because they are not sound <Col N="305" /> financially, he makes that fine judgment on the basis of presumably the person's application and the information which has been given to them.  How in the name of goodness is a district justice to arrive at a sensible decision on these matters of judgment about which he is uniquely incompetent to express an opinion.</P>
    <P>I think Minister I do not like setting up new quangos.  I do not like setting up new appeal procedures.  For goodness sake to have an appeal procedure based on the District Court is in my opinion to make a laugh of the appeal procedure because one of two things will happen, either an individual district justice will adopt the attitude that he is going to refuse everything that a Minister refuses or he is going to under no circumstances refuse anybody. We find that the whole process will become devalued as a result of this inadequate appeal procedure.  Either the appeal procedure will be completely restrictive or, alternatively, it will leave the matter so open that the Minister will lose total control of ensuring that only people of good reputation, sound financial standing and professional competence are granted a mechandising licence under the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the District Court with its skill in judging people's reputation might be better able to fulfil the function of assessing whether or not the decision of the Minister to revoke a licence is a proper one.  That may be more within the actual area of competence of a District Court.  But at the same time presumably from time to time the Minister will for reasons that the applicant no longer has a sound financial standing or that the professional competence has been shown to be not capable of implementation, will also make a decision to revoke a licence.  In those circumstances the doubts which I have expressed earlier with regard to the suitability of the District Court as a forum for adjudicating on these matters must also apply to the question of the revocation or appeals in respect of revocation of licence.</P>
    <P>We can take it that every decision to <Col N="306" /> revoke a licence will go on appeal.  That is the way these things happen.  Nobody will be satisfied that the Minister said I am going to revoke the licence.  You will have a situation where the District Courts and not a particular district justice but scattered all over the country District Courts are going to have to make these decisions.  I congratulate the Minister on deciding to have an appeals procedure.  I cannot congratulate him on the forum that he has picked.  It is not as good a forum as was suggested by the Opposition in the other House.  Even that forum in my opinion was quite unsuitable as well. If recognising that there always remains a residual power to apply to the High Court on a point of law &mdash; and that must, of course, always remain &mdash; recognising that, I think that an appeal procedure which would be external to the Minister, that is very important and independent of the Minister but at the same time would not be a legal adjudication.  Legal forums do not, in my opinion, possess a competence to make a decision in an area like this when you are dealing with the question of professional competence or of good reputation or of sound financial standing.  That is not the scene they are into and to expect a District Court justice to make such a decision is, in my opinion, imposing on him a responsibility to which he will respond in one of two ways, either by withdrawing the appeal procedure and rejecting everything or alternatively, allowing all the appeals.</P>
    <P>I think it would be very hard and difficult for him during the course of the amount of time he is likely to have available to make the kind of judgmental decision which the Minister will make as a result of having received so much professional advice and help before he makes that decision.  None of that professional advice will be available to the District Court except in an adversarial fashion.  In those circumstances I would request the Minister would give some further consideration, not to the question of the appeal, but to the question of the forum in which it is proposed to grant the jurisdiction to hear the <Col N="307" /> appeal procedure about which we are all unanimous.</P>

      <P>When Senator Killilea referred to the number of Bills that the Minister for Communications has before this House and the Dáil at the moment, I naturally assumed that he was about to pay a very well deserved tribute and compliment to the Minister on the vigorous manner in which he had tackled the problems which lay there for many years without any activity or were growing in dimension, but I was surprised when I found otherwise that it was a rather critical note that Senator Killilea was sounding rather than a complimentary note.</P>

      <P>As regards the very substantive point being made by Senator Killilea concerning the penalties, I can assure him that they have nothing to do with the buses.  As far as the penalties for illegal bus operations are concerned they are governed by the Act of 1932 and the maximum penalties in that area are £50 and a further fine of £5 for every day <Col N="308" /> during which the offence continues. These ones deal solely with the haulage issue which is the substance of this Bill in the main.  There is a penalty which is the maximum on summary conviction allowed in the District Court of a £1,000 but, in fact, previously we had a penalty of £250 for a first offence for illegal haulage and a second or subsequent penalty of £500 and these exist since 1978.  Considering the disastrous inflationary situation we had for many of the years in the intervening period, I think the rise to £1,000 is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>As regards the Road Transport Act, 1932 which deals with the licensing of road passenger transport operation a review of that Act is, in fact, in progress and an amending Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The EC have expressed concern about the number of accidents involving coaches.  I think all of us have been horrified by some of these accidents which we have read about and have specifically asked member states to increase inspection of buses under the Tachograph Drivers Hours Regulation.  A new enforcement organisation is being established and as the Minister already enforces the tachograph regulation in regard to buses, it was logical to include buses in the enforcement provision of this Act. I can confirm for Senator Killilea that as far as offences in regard to buses are concerned this does not impinge in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary has been aggrieved about the system of appeal that we have introduced.  It is a very good thing to have an appeal from the Minister so it is a question of where do we go from there. Everything was considered, including the High Court.  We considered a whole variety of things but we finally came down in favour of the District Court for a variety of reasons some of which I outlined at the beginning.  While Senator O'Leary was complimentary to district justices on their wisdom and knowledge of the law on the one hand, on the other hand, the whole import of his contribution would <Col N="309" /> be seen by the district justices themselves, I am sure when they read it, as critical of their overall abilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when, in fact, he would not consider that they are a useful or a good forum from which to appeal for an aggrieved person in this respect.  As far as good repute is concerned, I do not think there is any great difficulty there. As the Senator said, there might be no better person to have a knowledge of a good repute or otherwise but, generally speaking, this good repute governs the area covered by the Bill and as far as offences might be concerned under this legislation or previous legislation, these are matters that could be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As far as financial standing is concerned, that is a very simple matter.  To qualify under financial standing a person has to have a truck registered in his name or a letter from a bank or a financial institution indicating that he is of good financial standing.  Overall, I do not think that there are going to be great difficulties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where competence is concerned, we must rely on examination.  It is a question of whether the man passed the examination or not or was he wrongly done by where the examination was concerned. There is an examination as such which people undergo, so I do not think there are going to be great difficulties in that area.  No matter what area of appeal we have, there could be objections.  Indeed, Senator O'Leary himself referred to the costs that could arise in the High Court where the aggrieved haulier or potential haulier would be surrounded with very expensive lawyers, senior counsel, junior counsel and, naturally, this would arise in the High Court as each person was seeking to make his case to the best possible advantage.  Large expenses would be involved and this would involve travel also.  Remember we may be dealing with a man who may only have one truck.  He may be very small in this area and we <Col N="310" /> may not be dealing with the very big companies.  I think that the District Court is a very suitable area as far as appeals are concerned and I think it will work satisfactorily in that respect.</P>

      <P>With regard to the district justice who operates in the area with which I am familiar, there is no question of that.  The district justices will, according to the regulations and the laws under which he is operating, give a very balanced judgment, tempered, of course, with mercy as he does on all occasions.  We have considered all aspects and, indeed, the aspect which Senator O'Leary has brought up and we do not foresee any difficulties in that area.</P>
      <P>This is a Seanad Bill and I have no doubt that the Senators will say all the better for it.  I would also point out that I had the privilege of introducing this Bill myself and four other Bills and all of them have been introduced in the Seanad.  For a Bill of this nature, which needs a lot of teasing out, it is very good approach, and likewise for the Archives Bill and the Canals Bill.  The contributions made by the Senators earlier were very constructive. The Bill, as amended, is a better Bill and it meets at least the more important points raised in this House.  Obviously, it does not satisfy everyone entirely but I do not know of any Bill that has ever gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas which would fully meet that criterion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the new enforcement measures will supplement the independent enforcement activities of the Garda.  Regarding transport officers the reason for the development of this area is the widespread demand that existed <Col N="311" /> that, when we had new legislation, this new legislation should be enforced and that we should not have a repeat of what everyone knows happened in the past. We intend to enforce the law vigorously and we believe it will have the desired result of achieving a satisfactory level of compliance with the relevant laws as far as road freight and bus transport operators are concerned.  I thank the Seanad for the manner in which they initially received the Bill and now on this occasion as it returns from the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 19 and 20, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) (a)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), a vehicle shall not be parked on the part of a roadway immediately adjacent to either side of a median strip for the purpose of enabling goods to be loaded in or on to it or unloaded from it or for the purpose in enabling a passenger to enter or leave it provided that the Authority gives notice of its intention to restrict the parking referred to in at least one newspaper circulating in the area proposed and shall apply for such period as may be specified in the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Except as otherwise indicated by means of a traffic sign a vehicle shall not during such period as may be specified in an appropriate notice under this subsection be parked on a public <Col N="312" /> road in an area to which this subsection applies or on a public road to which this subsection applies, if the unladen weight of the vehicle exceeds that specified for the purposes of this paragraph in that notice.</P>
    <P>(c) This subsection shall come into operation in relation to a particular area of public road specified in a notice under this subsection on such date (not earlier than one month after the date of publication of the notice) as may be specified in the notice.</P>
    <P>(d)  In this subsection &lsquo;vehicle&rsquo; includes a vehicle attached to a mechanically propelled vehicle (or to another vehicle attached to a mechanically propelled vehicle) a vehicle constructed or adapted for the purpose of being drawn by a mechanically propelled vehicle the drawn component of an articulated vehicle and a vehicle constructed or adapted for use as such drawn component.</P>
    <P>(e)  This subsection will not apply to any vehicle which is being used in connection with:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the removal of any obstruction to traffic,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the maintenance, improvement or reconstruction of a street or portion of a street to which this applies,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the provision, alteration or repair of a sewer, or of any main, drain, pipe or apparatus for the supply of gas, water or electricity or any telegraph or telephone line,</P>
    <P>(iv)  a fire engine, an ambulance or any vehicle in the service of the Garda Síochána while being used in pursuance of statutory powers or duties.</P>
    <P>I gave notice yesterday in the course of my contribution on Second Stage of this Bill of my concern about the parking of articulated trucks and other commercial <Col N="313" /> vehicles in cities like Dublin.  This Bill deals with many important environmental improvements by way of the introduction of road humps, bollards and a series of other measures that I welcomed yesterday.  My concern is that Dublin City Council passed a series of improvements of by-laws in 1980 which were then dispatched to the Minister for the Environment for his seal of approval.  He declined to give his approval to a set of by-laws which would have the effect of designating residential areas as created by the Dublin city development plan, and which could be applied in the Dublin county area also, as areas where the parking of articulated trucks and commercial vehicles would be prohibited.  He declined to assent to this by-law and despite many approaches by Dublin Corporation, of which I have been a member for a considerable time, we have not been able to even arrange a delegation with the Minister for the Environment.  This goes back further than this Government as we have been trying to make progress in this area for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it is not possible to approve of an amendment of this kind which would have the effect of designating areas, identifying the vehicles which would be prohibited to park in certain areas around the city and county of Dublin and giving the necessary release to public service vehicles who have a reason to operate in these areas due to roadworks, ambulances, fire brigades, etc.  It is not just a question of handling the environmental advantages which could be dealt with by this amendment but there has been a spate of fatal accidents involving articulated trucks and commercial vehicles that have been badly lit or the roads on which the vehicles are parked are badly lit.  This makes the matter all the more urgent.  I hope that the Minister, in the course of this debate, can report some progress in relation to what is a very constructive and important point.  If there is provision under section 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, I do not see why there has been no progress in this area.  This is the reason I have sought the inclusion of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this amendment can be covered by by-laws or temporary rules of one year's duration under section 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  Following submission of the amendment we examined the situation and that is the position confirmed by the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>Under the 1985 Dublin Temporary Rules, Rule 6 (i) prohibits any parking on a median strip or any part of it.  Rule 9 excludes goods and passenger vehicles from parking on that part of the roadway immediately adjacent to either side of a median strip but allows any vehicles to park temporarily for loading or unloading purposes in other restricted places but not on a median strip or any part of it.</P>
      <P>The problem referred to by the Senator about the 1980 draft by-laws which prohibit the parking of commercial vehicles in residential and other areas, for example overnight, centred on the adequacy of the notification of the operation of such prohibition.  A notice in the newspapers on a particular day would not suffice as all persons might not read it. No further proposals for revised by-laws in this matter have been submitted to the Minister for the Environment for approval since then.  He will favourably consider any such proposals provided the notification aspect is properly dealt with. On legal advice he has indicated his attitude on this to the Garda Commissioner. This area is adequately covered and the procedures are there for attaining all the desired results that the Senator seeks in his amendment.  It is a question of pressing into operation the various regulations under the 1985 Temporary Rules so that the same results as he outlines in his extensive amendment to this section can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the relevance of Senator FitzGerald's point but I will refer to the original report of Dr. MacCormac on the Dublin Transport Authority. What the Minister has said here today has added more confusion to an already confused area.  He is passing it off by <Col N="315" /> saying that the Minister for the Environment would, if submissions were made to him, consider them.  It runs right down the line to a whole series of ifs and buts.</P>
      <P>The original report clearly pinpointed this matter but the consequences of that report are borne out by the Minister saying that this authority should be an authority in their own right and not subservient to the Minister for the Environment or to the Department of the Environment.  It is obvious from what the Minister has said that since 1980 the Department of the Environment have fought a ferocious battle to hold on to their own powers and, as I said on Second Stage, in winning that battle they have consistently and persistently fought to maintain their own rights.  Because of that this Bill is weak and washy.  Had the Minister been more powerful in his attitude to remain within the framework of the suggestion in the MacCormac report, Senator FitzGerald would have no need whatsoever to put down this amendment.  It was a power struggle which has been won by the Department of the Environment and the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>We are opposing this Bill because of its shabbiness, and weakness and because it is only an authority in a nominal sense. It has no real powers when it comes to basics, for example, in this instance in the parking of vehicles on public roads which is a major problem throughout this city, the Minister for the Environment has all the power.  What I said before still stands.  It has been proven conclusively by the remarks made by the Minister that if the Minister for the Environment receives certain submissions, then certain things will be done.  That is not the way this matter is going to be dealt with. When business resumes in this city and when the thoroughfares become busy again we are going to have a situation far worse than it was prior to 1980, and that was bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the beginning that the whole framework of this Bill is weak.  We could not accept it in principle because the principal part if it was an integral plan for the <Col N="316" /> whole of this city comprising every single particle, be it of the Department of the Environment, Dublin Corporation, or be it implicated in CIE, which come within the ambit of the Department of Communications. All of that was being brought into one central administrative unit.  That has not been done.</P>
    <P>I did not put any amendment down to this Bill because I think it is useless.  It is a pointless exercise.  The Minister finds himself in the misfortunate situation that the Bill is weak and that this situation is going to continue, because, as we know from history, nobody is going to make submissions.  There will be a big wrangle in Dublin Corporation and in Dublin County Council.  Everybody is going to go on different roads to suit themselves and at the end of the day there will be total and absolute confusion like before. I will illustrate that further in certain sections of this Bill as they come up.</P>
    <P>In fairness, Senator Alexis FitzGerald highlighted the point that the grapples of the Department of the Environment are stuck in here.  Nobody has broken them. The Minister for Communications was not capable of breaking them when he set out this Bill on day one.  If he had tucked the MacCormac Report under his arm and said this is what we have to do, this is what we must do after the magnificent performance so far as the report was concerned, if he had stuck by it, no Minister or Department could have won against him.  Sad to say, the whole thing is weak.  It is shabby.  This section of the Bill, as was highlighted by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, proves the point.  The response given by the Minister confirms that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say in response to the Minister's report on this amendment a few minutes ago, that we have in this Bill, setting up the Dublin Transport Authority, a large area dealing with the parking of vehicles on public roads and how that can be controlled. We go into some finite detail in relation to the traffic warden service, the whole question of parking meters and other possible alternatives to parking meters and <Col N="317" /> so on, yet the area which is causing the most disturbance to a large section of the population in the greater Dublin area is parking of commercial vehicles and articulated trucks in points of great danger which have caused traffic accidents during weekends and every night of the week where the Garda authorities are unable to deal with them: I say that with a certain knowledge of the situation. Unless a commercial vehicle or articulated truck parks on a pavement or on an already designated area where parking is prohibited, the Garda authorities are not in a position to intervene.</P>
      <P>This Bill has gone a long distance to deal with the needs for environmental improvement to protect many areas which are being sought publically for a considerable time.  I mentioned them earlier.  Why can we not seek progress in this area?  What is the resistance to it?  I do not accept that we have anything like enough reassurance from the Department of the Environment that there will be progress in this area, when all we appear to be getting so far is that if proposals come up that are a bit better than the proposals made the last time they will be considered.  That appears to be allowing this matter to go along its merry way for another period of five or six years.  We have had five or six years already.  It is an area which I am convinced needs to be dealt with.  There will be another period of many years before this matter is adequately dealt with.  We do not seem to be getting enough stir from the Department of the Environment. They appear to be sitting on this area, quite unconcerned about making progress on it.  The value of including an amendment like this in the Bill would be that we would have the opportunity of highlighting this area to the Authority once it is in operation.  That Authority would see to it that one of the primary concerns of the Bill, from an environmental point of view and from the point of view of dealing with road safety, would get priority once the Authority are set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very least, I hope we will be able to get more progress on this matter <Col N="318" /> between this Committee Stage and Report Stage and, if necessary, that Report Stage be held over to another day in order to see some definite indication from the Department of the Environment that they are going to move on the constant requests which have been received from Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council in relation to this matter.  I do not see why one cannot expect a little more than: &ldquo;If you come up with the suggestions and if they are a bit better than the ones you had the last time, we will consider them.&rdquo;  The Department should be in a position now to come forth with proposals similar to the ones I suggested earlier on approved designation of areas under the city development plan, areas zoned for one purpose or another, including some zoned as residential areas.  I do not see why it would not be possible to give public notice that in residential areas from X date, or in certain residential areas from X date, the parking of these vehicles will be prohibited.  I do not understand the Department of the Environment reservation that some fellow who happens to park his vehicle in a particular area will not know about the notice.  Notices are put in the newspapers about all sorts of matters.  We will be doing it very soon in relation to the creation of these smoke free zones under the Air Polution Bill, 1986.  I do not see why it is not necessary for the Department of the Environment to go along the road a bit further than what their response is to date and come up with some serious proposals on which this matter can be seen to be addressed and dealt with and that we will see some progress in the area.  I hope we can have over a matter of days a more serious response than we are getting this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully realise the difficulties which arise so far as parking is concerned in the Dublin area.  These have been articulated by Senator FitzGerald. As I already pointed out there is sufficient power, through the by-laws and temporary rules, if they are activated and followed up by the local authorities.  What <Col N="319" /> happens here is the transfer to the Dublin Transport Authority, in respect of its functional area, of the powers of the Garda Commissioner to make by-laws under section 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  That means that the Dublin Transport Authority can take the initiative in this respect.  They are the people who can be the motivators in ensuring that proper use is made of the by-laws and of the temporary routes in order to attain the desired effect.  There was national application of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and when I say the DTA, naturally that is for their own functional area.  The Garda Commissioner will continue to make the by-laws for the rest of the country.  The precise flow, if one can describe it as such, that emerged in the 1980 draft by-laws was notified to the Garda Commissioner, who is the person who makes these by-laws with the consent of the Minister for the Environment after consulting the local authority.</P>
      <P>The lack of progress since 1980 raises the question of the local authorities concerned in this matter, why it has not been followed up since and the flaw remedied? They should reactivate the matter now. Section 33 has the advantage of transferring to the Dublin Transport Authority, for its own functional area, the power of the Garda Commissioner to make these by-laws.  Therefore, I expect that there would be much greater initiative taken in this respect.  If the Garda Commissioner deals with the entire country, the Dublin Transport Authority would be concerned with its own functional area where the parking problem is very acute, as outlined by both Senator FitzGerald and Senator Killilea.  The necessary power is there, although to a certain extent it may be cumbersome.  The transfer now to the Dublin Transport Authority will introduce a new dynamic into that so far as parking is concerned.  It will be adequate to get round the difficulties that Senator Fitzgerald has outlined in his amendment and which have been pointed out also by Senator Killilea in this debate.</P>

    <P>If we have not seen progress by way of the proposal that was made in 1980 and if there has been a constant stream of requests for discussions as to the manner in which this matter might be tackled and how the technical difficulties could be resolved, would it not be possible for us to have a report back on Report Stage of this Bill &mdash; which could be taken on a separate occasion or a different day &mdash; which would indicate the alternatives the Department of the Environment would suggest in relation to bringing a by-law of this kind into force?  The alternative I suggested was that the whole matter of notice could be related to the city development plan, the zoning of residential <Col N="321" /> areas and the indication that these residential zones could, bit by bit, affect the parts of the city most vulnerable to this problem.  Perhaps we could get from the Department of the Environment, since we do not seem to be able to get it any other way, some serious response in relation to how this matter could be tackled.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to withdraw this amendment on the understanding that on Report Stage, which would be taken on a separate occasion, there would be a report back from the Department of the Environment with a much more detailed response.  I do not understand why it has to be all a one-way track.  Traffic officials in the city of Dublin have got to come up with proposals all the time.  Why can we not hear now something from the Department of the Environment in relation to how this matter could be tackled in a reasoned way, overcoming the technical difficulties as they see them at this time?</P>

      <P>I agree with the suggestions expressed by Senator FitzGerald. While Report Stage is important and probably the Minister expected the Report Stage today, it might be tactically good to do exactly what Senator FitzGerald says, to see if we can extract something more from the Department now. They have put their backs to the wall. Sections 37, 38, 40 and 49 will show that the whole exercise is a waste of time unless something positive is put into this Bill, some teeth are given to this section and many other sections also.  Unless the Dublin Transport Authority get some teeth we are wasting our time here and I do not intend to waste any more of it. The Minister has the opportunity to have a rethink and he should arm himself with the MacCormac report again and leave it down on the table in front of those in the Department of the Environment so that they can digest it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment, on the advice of the Attorney General, did not approve the by-laws we are talking about because of the doubts that existed in regard to bringing <Col N="322" /> cases arising out of them to the courts. They would not stand up in court for the reason I mentioned.  This was the subject of a fairly extensive submission by the Minister for the Environment to the Garda Commissioner pointing out that there is no question of the Minister for the Environment having refused as such. He simply outlined the situation to the Garda Commissioner who is the person responsible in this area.  Since that, nothing has been submitted.  So far as he is concerned there have been no proposals submitted to him since that time.  He has said he will favourably consider any such proposals that come along.  Naturally, we are all anxious to see that there is an appropriate solution for what is unquestionably a problem.  With the regulations as they are, with the transfer to the DTA of responsibility for making the by-laws and the temporary rules for Dublin and the new initiative that that will give &mdash; they will be taking the place of the Garda Commissioner in this respect as far as their functional area is concerned &mdash; we have the necessary requirements here.</P>
      <P>The discussion here in the Seanad and the contributions by Senator FitzGerald and Senator Killilea will draw attention to this matter and introduce a new dynamic and urgency into it.  I will be very pleased to bring this discussion and the points arising out of it to the attention of the Minister for the Environment immediately.</P>

      <P>At this stage, six years after the original by-laws were introduced, and were despatched to the Minister for his signature, there has been little communication on this matter despite requests for deputations from both the County Council and the Corporation of Dublin who are affected by this Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  I ask that we get a more serious and considered response than just that the proposals were not technically suitable, that the Attorney General did not approve of the particular drafting of the proposals in relation to notice.  Could we not get from the Department a more substantial reply which would indicate the kind of format <Col N="323" /> that controls on these vehicles which have caused accidents will take.  I know of a number of fatal accidents which have resulted from the parking of these vehicles, quite apart from the stress it causes to widespread areas of this city where these vehicles park in an uncontrolled fashion and where nobody can do anything about it.  The incentive to use the commercial lorry parks that are available is not there because the parking of these vehicles can be done so freely.</P>
      <P>I would hope that we could see on Report Stage some substantial response from the Department of the Environment indicating the form that controls could take and indicating perhaps also when a deputation could be received from the relevant local authorities who have an interest in this matter and who have been unable to make progress for a considerable time.  I am not convinced that the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority will mean progress on this matter for a number of years.  I feel at this point we could, even before the Transport Authority is set up, perhaps see some useful development on this matter, which is a cause of great concern in the Dublin area.  The single most universal complaint received by the traffic authority in Dublin is in relation to this matter.  I insist on it for this reason.</P>

      <P>The obtaining of the report will obviously take some time.  It is something that we had not been able to get working on until the amendment came in.  What surprises me is that the corporation have not been very active on this area over the past number of years since the difficulty arose.  Equally the initiative could have come from the Garda Commissioner.  No further proposals for revised by-laws in this matter have been submitted to the Minister for the Environment since this difficulty arose. He would look on it very favourably.  The position is that there has been agreement that all stages of the Bill will be taken today.  I certainly will do all I can to obtain this report and find all the details <Col N="324" /> regarding it.  That would involve the corporation as well as the Garda Commissioner and the Department of the Environment.  I would be glad to have that report circulated to the Senators who are expressing concern in this debate.  I was anxious that we would get the Report Stage today.</P>

      <P>Therein lies a problem. The Minister again has compounded the problem.  He wondered why Dublin Corporation did not do certain things.  He wondered why the Garda Commissioner did not do certain things.  He wondered why the Department of the Environment did not do certain things.  The MacCormac report concluded that the major problem as regards the chaotic situation throughout the city was that too many cooks were spoiling the broth.  The purpose of the Dublin Transport Authority was to put everything together into one central administrative body.  If you take as an example the work done by the task force in the matter of the bus lanes.  Look at the significant difference that has been brought about in this city by the implementation of the bus lanes.  The bus lanes have created a free flow of traffic in the city in so far as that is possible.  They took on board that part of the MacCormac report.  They went out and they applied it.  They got their act together and the result of it was that at least the buses of this city are running and are not jammed or clogged up like we used to see them in 1979 and 1980.  That is an acknowledged fact.  This is a reasonable request by Senator FitzGerald with which I agree.</P>
      <P>The powers for this should rest clearly and unequivocally with the new Dublin Transport Authority.  The power of implementation of regulations made by other bodies is what the authority has, not of making them themselves.  That is the basic weakness in this Bill.  It is throughout it.  That is a reasonable request and we can deal with it next week or the following week.</P>

They will be the people and it is a matter for them to take the initiative in this respect. The Minister for the Environment being the person responsible for road traffic, has to give the final sanction.</P>

As an ordinary citizen travelling around Dublin, I can see the difficulties that arise.  However, I believe the framework is there.  It will be greatly strengthened with the Dublin Transport Authority replacing the Garda Commissioner.  The law will now give the Dublin Transport Authority the right to make these by-laws.  They will be much more vigorous as far as making these by-laws <Col N="326" /> are concerned.  They will not have a nationwide brief.  They will have the brief for their own area.  They can meet all of the requirements in this section and I hope the Senator will be in a position to withdraw the amendment.  I have a difficulty as regards Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give me any reason to expect progress before the Dublin Transport Authority is set up and operational?  Obviously, there will be very many preoccupations in the initial stages of its development.  Can we expect that in the early stages of the formation of the Authority we will see some progress in this area and that it will be given priority?  We have seen six years pass.  Are we likely to see another three or four before there will be a development on this matter?  Would it not be possible for the Minister to at least use his good offices with the Minister for the Environment to arrange at a very early date a meeting between the corporation, the county council and the Garda Síochána, as Senator Killilea suggests, that would not be a meeting expecting progress from one side only but from the other side also.  We would have on the table the format of the various ways of getting over the technical difficulties of introducing a prohibition in relation to the parking of these offending vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make a song and dance about this matter.  But if you are living in a pleasant little Victorian street and every night in front of your house somebody who lives three or four doors from you parks a vast vehicle, as happens everywhere in the built-up areas of this city, the environment is offended in a very serious way and it becomes a major <Col N="327" /> hazard to road users.  I was at a funeral only three months ago of two girls who worked in the housing department of the city and who were killed outright when they drove into an unlit vehicle of this kind in Cork street.  These vehicles are often parked in most unsuitable places. The Garda authorities have as of now no control whatsoever on these vehicles provided they are not parked in a place that is prohibited or controlled in some other way.  The least I might expect from this amendment is that we would have some assurance that soon the Minister &mdash; perhaps this side of the summer would be a reasonable request &mdash; will get a meeting held that would take on this matter in a much more serious fashion than we have had to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In making the order bringing various sections of this Bill into operation and effect, the Minister for Communications will, I can assure the House, take into consideration all the various points raised and in particular this serious matter that has been the subject of discussion over the past while.  I will pass along the request to the Minister for the Environment and will also ensure that the Minister for Communications passes it along so that such a meeting as the Senator has outlined will take place.  We have the Minister's guarantee that he will consider favourably any such proposals brought to him.  The proposals can in the future be brought to him by the Dublin Transport Authority, and he will obviously be prepared for a meeting as the Senator visualises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am naturally extremely keen because I have some personal experience of precisely the difficulty that Senator FitzGerald has just alluded to as far as the parking of huge articulated trucks in the Dublin area is concerned.  Before returning to live in my own constituency of Sligo-Leitrim I lived in the city centre area where this was becoming a continuous problem and was of enormous visual offence, but that is another matter.  It created a major traffic hazard as far as the children in particular in the area were <Col N="328" /> concerned.  Efforts were made &mdash; but it had to be on a totally voluntary basis &mdash; to have these trucks removed from the area, not always with a successful outcome. All residential areas are unsuited for this use of the street space.  I am very sympathetic to the intent and import of the contents of the Senator's amendment and all that has been said here by Senators Killilea and FitzGerald on that matter.  I will certainly press extremely strongly for the meeting that he has spoken of.  I have no doubt that with that and the Dublin Transport Authority, if the various orders have been made bringing it into operation at that time, results will be achieved in this area.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; is a very broad word.  Does it include an articulated truck?  Does it include a four-wheeled propelled motor car or van?  Does it include a closed-in propelled vehicle of <Col N="329" /> any size or nature?  Does it include caravans and mobile homes?  They are all vehicles because under the Act when you are insuring your car you are insured for trailers of all types and descriptions.  I would like to know if trailers are included in the definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; has to be more clear.  We have major problems around this city and around every city in the country as regards vehicles. We have the eternal problem of all the different authorities responsible for the different things done to those vehicles. There are the Garda, the corporation, the county councils, and by-laws.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister please tell me what &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; means?  More importantly, what about the disused immobile vehicles we see scattered all over the city, parts taken out of them, dumps made of them? Are they included under &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;, because if they are one could see it having a bit of teeth &mdash; if they could go out and take away and compound or do what they wished with them if they were causing an obstruction on property owned by the county council or corporation.  It is about time we faced up to the reality of this situation.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would tell me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proper for an ombibus of any description to stop at an ombibus sign or a bus sign as we know it?  Who has the right to stop at a bus stop?  Have all omnibuses the right to stop at a bus stop in Dublin city or is it just selectively for CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the nature of the bus stop.  These stops are erected as such by CIE and they are their particular stops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>So we have selectivity now as regards bus stops.  A bus stop says &ldquo;bus stop&rdquo;.  It should now, under the law, say it is an &ldquo;omnibus stop&rdquo;.  It is stopping on property which is under the regulation of either Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council or, if it ever reaches it, the Dublin Transport Authority.  I cannot see under the law how CIE can control certain areas for themselves.  If an omnibus stop is erected would it not include all buses?  I am not saying that all buses might use it but selectivity in this field cannot be given to anybody under the European regulations.  Under the regulations there cannot be a monopoly situation created by a local authority and here we are creating one.  It is a simple question.  The Minister rightly said omnibus means all.  It means CIE and all types of transport carriers on the one hand under section 37.  Then we are talking about stopping places and stands and go on to say: &ldquo;But CIE have a special place to stop for themselves, no one else can stop there.&rdquo; That cannot be.  I would like a further explanation from the Minister because I do not think he is acting legally in this field.  Just because CIE erect a stop it does not mean it belongs to them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not be more definitive about this matter?  This is a very important area.  Selectivity cannot be allowed and the Minister, I am sure, would not allow it himself.  I think there is an omission here.  He should have time to go back.  The original request by Senator Alexis Fitzgerald would give him breathing space to bring in an amendment here next week to clearly state that the Dublin Transport Authority under the EC regulations have no right or legal standing to define a certain place for a single public utility.  After all, many of those omnibuses are licensed omnibuses. I know several of the operators who come to town on Saturday.  They are all licensed by the Minister's Department to come into this town.  They have the same licences as CIE have.  I cannot understand why they cannot stop at a bus stop.  I think what CIE have put on their bus stops is actually illegal &mdash; CIE bus stop. It is a facility created to allow people to get on or off a licensed omnibus.  It was never given as a licence to get on or off <Col N="332" /> a CIE bus.  It was an omnibus licence. They have the same licence as the operators have to bring people to this city on Saturday.  If the Minister wants to give further details I will even instance the licence number that allows an omnibus from my part of the world to come up to this city every Saturday of the month. They have the same licence that CIE have.  We must be more specific.  I plead with the Minister at this particular stage to put an amendment in here to clarify this situation so that we will be, as the Constitution states, cherishing our people equally.  The EC regulations also state that you cannot have a monopoly. We are in an open competitive world and competition is the spice of the trade.  I am not one bit afraid of it and I do not think CIE are either.  I think they have improved immensely since they were woken up from their deep slumbers.  They have improved their services and this will improve them further.  If an omnibus pulls in at a bus stop, which it is entitled to do, to let a person embark or disembark from the propelled vehicle, can that vehicle have claws put on it and be swept off to the compound because it pulled in at a bus stop?</P>

As far as the Dublin area is concerned that function will be transferred to the Dublin Transport Authority.  It is the Road Traffic Act, 1961, section 85.  We are not making any changes as far as the legislation is concerned.  What we are doing under section 37 is transferring the power that existed for the Garda to the Dublin Transport Authority.  As far as the buses coming from a provincial area or otherwise are concerned, what they <Col N="333" /> can do is make a request to the Dublin Transport Authority as far as stops in the Dublin city area or its functional area are concerned.  Naturally the Dublin Transport Authority will have to take into consideration the traffic situation and volume of traffic.  There is no prohibition other than those considerations on giving stops. It will now be a matter, as it formerly was for the Garda, for the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>

Naturally enough Parnell Square is not capable of handling the situation on a Friday evening.  It is illogical that people should be forced to go into such a situation and rush right around that Square to find their local bus to bring them home for the weekend.  I take that as an exam ple.  The Dublin people would probably know more about this better than I would and I would like to hear a few comments from them.  Would it not be far better if the west-bound traffic were based along the quays, the south-bound traffic based along Dame Street and the north-bound traffic based on the north outlets rather than having the whole of the travelling public assemble in one point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly believe that the Minister is quite wrong.  I do not think that CIE have an exclusive right to claim a CIE bus stop. I have not seen that section of the Act, section 85 of the 1961 Act.  They have applied for permission to stop but I do not think they have applied for permission to put their sign up to say that this is a CIE stop.  I do not see any reason why some of those stops could not be used, for example &mdash; and it should be enshrined in this Act &mdash; by omnibus operators of all descriptions, including CIE.  I do not think they have a sole right and I do not think they have any right whatsoever to claim it as a CIE bus stop.  It is an omnibus stop under the Act because; that is what is written down here.  I think &ldquo;stops&rdquo; and &ldquo;stands&rdquo; are the same thing but perhaps the &ldquo;stand&rdquo; is where there is an end to the route on either side.  Some of those rural buses coming in here on a Sunday <Col N="334" /> night around 10 or 11 o'clock or whatever time they arrive in the city should have the right to distribute their passengers around the city at certain centre points. I do not see any reason why the existing bus stops which are, after all, only bus stops should not be used for this purpose. I think that is fair comment and I would like a response from the Minister on that point.  I would like to know if CIE have a right to put their name up on these bus stops.</P>

      <P>I presume a difficulty would arise if other private omnibus concerns were to seek permission to put up bus stops on streets in which CIE already have their own provision by way of bus stops.  Are we not in a ludicrous situation here where we could have a number of omnibus concerns competing for stops?  I take the point made by Senator Killilea in relation to the congestion these buses could cause in Parnell Square on a Friday evening and at other times over the weekends.  Surely there must be a way of facilitating other omnibus operators at CIE bus stops.  He makes a very real point which deserves a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to have two kinds of stops.  I accept that.  It depends very much on the circumstances of the bus, the needs that it is serving, where it is going, and ensuring easy access and easy departure.  I think what Senator Killilea has said about the different locations of buses of private operators heading for the provincial areas is something that obviously is going to have to be considered in the interest of traffic and easy movement.  As far as the stops are concerned, it is a fact that CIE have paid for the various stops; they are the people who erected these signs.  I think that if anyone else was using them it would be reasonable to ask that they should contribute towards the cost also.  I do not think it should be at the expense of the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the bus going out to Wicklow is that they do not have actual signs, but they have established a <Col N="335" /> location at which they traditionally stop. As far as Dublin city is concerned it is the Green on one side and as far as Bray is concerned it is the Town Hall.  People know down the years that that is the particular location as far as these buses are concerned so that they do not use the stops.  The number of stops in any particular street was governed by traffic considerations.  These are all matters that will come under the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>I agree about the difficulties &mdash; I experienced difficulty myself &mdash; that are arising in the congestion taking place at the point of origin for all of the provincial buses particularly on a weekend, or on a Friday evening.  This is something that would have to be considered and a system would have to be developed by the Dublin Transport Authority in the interest of the free flow of traffic into and out of the city and for the convenience of the people operating these buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I feel that those omnibuses using this facility would be far better stopping at an existing bus stop than stopping at points that may cause traffic hazards.  There is harassment going on at the moment of the major bus companies that I know of, particularly those serving the westward routes.  The police are actually chasing them because they cannot stop where there is no official bus stop sign.  They should actually be allowed to stop and should have allowed designated bus stops, not CIE bus stops necessarily, but certain bus stops with a sign saying &ldquo;Bus stop&rdquo; or &ldquo;Omnibus stop&rdquo;.  You have a choice.  This should be done quite quickly.</P>

Naturally we want to get rid of that particular circumstance.  The power exists for orderly operation.  There should not be any reason why preferential treatment should be given to anyone in this particular respect.  All we should seek is the best <Col N="336" /> possible flow of traffic and the easiest entrance and departure for the buses.</P>

We have under section 40, subsection (5), &ldquo;a person who contravenes a direction or by-laws under this section shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  Are we not talking about statutory undertakers here rather than individuals?  The whole question here relates to advance notice on proposed roadworks and reinstatement of roadways following works by those involved.  It would seem to me that the likelihood of individuals seeking permission to open up a section of roadway is rather remote.  We really are speaking here of the statutory undertakers and perhaps they should be so named.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> Bye-laws under subsection (8) of this section shall not be made in relation to the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority without the prior approval of that Authority.</P>
    <P>We have not gone half far enough here. If one travels out of any of the main thoroughfares from this city one can see the flouting of commercial trading practice, which is not given the real bite that it should be given in this Bill which should have been used to get its teeth into this major problem of roadside traders around the city.  It is very lacking as regards machinery to bring this matter up to the proper standards required today. It gets a couple of lines in the whole of the Bill when it should have got a full page defining strong, firm action.  It is very lacking in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section requires the approval of the Dublin Transport Authority for the designation by the relevant local authority under the Casual Trading Act of the casual trading areas in the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority or for the making of by-laws in relation to casual trading.  Casual trading means areas where goods can be sold by retail or off stands to which the public have access as of right.  Public roads, squares etc. are designated for casual trading by the relevant local authorities. This could have very serious consequences for the traffic flows or for parking arrangements.  Very often we find this casual trading takes place on the main arteries or in the areas where people are inclined to congregate.  This could have an effect on matters within the general remit of the Dublin Transport Authority. It is, of course, for the local authorities to licence casual traders and the roadside traders to whom Deputy Killilea has referred come under this.  It is within the local authorities' remit to prosecute those who operate without the necessary licence. This section requires the approval of the Dublin Transport Authority for the designation by the relevant local authority of the particular areas in which casual trading can take place.  This is a <Col N="338" /> necessary requirement.  Deputy Killilea has said that it does not go far enough but it gives considerable powers in this respect to the Dublin Transport Authority for its own area.  Of course, the rest of the country is not covered by this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>To give power is one thing but when you go to court it is a matter of interpretation.  I think the interpretation should have been written into this Bill and not be left to people who can play around with phraseology and words.  That is where it is lacking.  Again we have missed the opportunity to put a bit of bite into this Bill and say what is meant clearly and unequivocally.  I take offence when I compare that section of the Bill and section 53.  It is outrageous to think that a man would be fined £50,000 or 12 months in jail &mdash; this is clearly and unequivocally printed into the Bill &mdash; for an offence under sections 17, 18 or 19 of the Bill and here we have roadside traders foisting inferior commodities without any sense of responsibility on gullible people who might think that they are going to get value.  The Minister has gone off the beam here altogether when he did not include in the Bill a specific interpretation so that the courts and lawyers will not spend days wrangling over interpretation. It should have been far more specific.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would reconsider that situation.</P>
      <P>This nonsense is allowed to go on year after year.  It is causing traffic problems on arterial roads.  If one wanted planning permission from any of the county councils for a house or an entrance to bring out stock along any of these roads, one would have the greatest problems and might not get it.  Yet these traders can pull up wherever they like and trade in inferior commodities.  Not to have put in a specific penalty here shows that the Minister has slipped up again by not grasping this problem.</P>

      <P>That is more of it.  This is the point I am trying to make.  All through this the buck is being passed to somebody else.  That is why this Bill will not and cannot work and why it is inferior.  The Minister did not take the MacCormac report and use it to get proper legislation through this House where you can take this authority away from those people who are not complying with the law and give it to the Dublin Transport Authority. This Bill should be the weapon to use for all of this.  Control of casual trading should be included in this Bill.  This is legislation that has been proven over the years to be necessary.  What we are doing here is passing the buck.  When the question gets hot we pass the buck instead of taking this opportunity to enshrine these necessary provisions in the Bill and make it a proper Bill.  It will not be a proper Bill.  Nobody will hear about this in 20 years time other than permission to stop or not to stop in some place around town. It is a shame that the whole effort is being wasted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <P>I do not think it is reasonable to expect that the Dublin Transport Authority Bill should be used as a vehicle for the total revamping of the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill specifically gives the power to the Dublin Transport Authority as regards the designation by the relevant local authority of an area for casual trading. In other words, the local authority cannot act in this respect without the approval of the Dublin Transport Authority and that is as a result of the transport considerations involved.  Under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, unlicensed casual trading or casual trading outside the casual trading area is an offence subject to a maximum penalty of £5,000 and/or six months in prison.  Similar penalties apply to breaches of the relevant by-laws of the local authority.  While I know of the difficulty that exists as regards casual trading and enforcement of the law and the penalties arising out of breaches of that law I do not believe this measure could have gone any further than the section which requires the <Col N="340" /> approval of the Dublin Transport Authority for the designation of casual trading areas.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 50 to 52, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 53 (1) (i) and (ii) could the Minister explain where he got the figure of £50,000 for sections 18, 19 and 40?  How can the Minister expect this House to impose such penalties when he has let go the major obstacles?  Surely the Minister does not consider that this House would be so tolerant as to accept such nonsensical figures?  It is like looking for penalties in telephone numbers.  A fine of £50,000 is unreasonable and I have to oppose this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point is that while the maximum penalties are on summary conviction a fine not exceeding £1,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, on conviction on indictment of a fine not exceeding £50,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, the actual penalty will be for the courts to decide. Section 18 deals with unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Authority: section 19 deals with failure by a member of the Authority to disclose a beneficial interest in matters being dealt with by the Authority and section 40 deals with unauthorised roadworks.  All of these matters can have major implications. Obviously, any breach of these laws could have serious consequences for the work being carried out and the efficient running &mdash; or the running at all &mdash; of the activities of the Dublin Transport Authority.  In the circumstances the penalties should be severe enough to deter from any breach of these sections. The maximum penalty provided in <Col N="341" /> section 53 takes due account of the gravity of the offence by enabling the bringing of indictment proceedings if warranted rather than summary proceedings involving a much lower penalty on conviction. On a summary conviction the fine will not exceed £1,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.</P>
      <P>The actual penalty imposed will, as I said, be a matter for the courts to decide. Section 53 (1) states the maximum penalty. The maximum penalties we have outlined for the disclosure of unauthorised information by a member of the Authority which would be relevant to the Authority's activities, failure to disclose beneficial interest and unauthorised roadworks, are not unreasonable.  In any case, the penalties will be decided by the courts and they, no doubt, will take into consideration all of the relevant factors and any ameliorating circumstances that may arise when a penalty is being imposed and the gravity or otherwise of an offence.  There is a whole range of penalties, even on conviction, that can be applied by the court and the judges will use their own discretion in deciding on the gravity of the offence.  It is intended, because of the potential damage that could be done and the necessity to prevent repetition of the offences and to deter people who have committed offences that in addition to the punishment for these breaches there should be the scope for a £50,000 fine.  But again it is a matter for the courts who will take all the relevant factors into consideration.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a long way from <Col N="342" /> what was enshrined in the MacCormac report.  The Minister for Communications has failed totally to grasp the intention of that report and this is tragic.  The need for the MacCormac report was obvious to any commuter in the Dublin area.  The report was unanimously adopted within three weeks of its publication by the then Government.  Two months later the task force, which was proposed in the MacCormac report, were on the streets and working headed by a Mr. Fitzpatrick, if my memory serves me correctly. A tremendous change was brought about by the commitment of the task force to do the work set out in the MacCormac report.  The main thrust of the report was to be the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and six years later we have a Bill before us which lacks the initiative, drive or effort to grasp the situation.  Of course the same problems do not prevail in the city today as did then.  The thrust of business has dropped quite significantly from the thrust of business of those days, when this city was absolutely snarled up by traffic, the worst in the world.  If business resumes in this city to the same extent as in 1977, 1979 and 1980, then we will see exactly the same thing again. Section 33, the section to which Senator Alexis Fitzgerald put down an amendment which he withdrew, and sections 37, 38, 40 and 49 are the parts of the Bill which should have put the bite into this authority.  There is no doubt in my mind now that the Minister for the Environment and the Department of the Environment, as they did in 1980 when that report came out, dug their heels in deep and held on firmly to their powers. Hence the reason that we get this garbled version.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of the issues that were brought up then as the hot potato of the snarling up of traffic have been bypassed today.  We had the Minister here on an issue concerning street trading, which was pushed off to some other old Bill that was passed a couple of years ago.  This has not been implemented and will not be implemented now by this new Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  We had the <Col N="343" /> same situation in sections 38, 40 and 49. The whole plan of this city was at that time envisaged within this Bill.  I do not see much of it now.  Under sections 17, 18 and 40 I see penalties for digging up the road, running to figures of £50,000 and five years in jail, when other far more serious, and far more costly matters are being passed by.  I do not know if the Minister will be able to do something at this late stage.  Obviously he could not do it before this, and he will not be able to do it now because the Department and the Minister for the Environment dug his heels in.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be assured by the Minister that the bus stop signs around this city are not the sole possession of CIE.  I have asked a very pertinent question. I believe there is a Bill coming in soon according to what the Minister said earlier on, concerning the omnibus situation in general.  I hope those matters will be brought out and that we will get a Bill where regulations will be brought in so that all people will have the right to function within this area equally, competitively and honourably and that the sneaking allegations made will stop and that competition will be seen as a good thing for society.  I am very disappointed with the Bill.  It is not what it should be. Professor MacCormac and his team must feel very shocked now at what has evolved from what they thought were very pertinent questions at that time.</P>

      <P>I would like to contrast somewhat with Senator Killilea in that I do not think this Bill has been a Bill of missed opportunity.  We have seen quite a bit of progress in dealing with the long-standing objective of getting a Transport Authority on its way.  The Bill deals with the important matter of planning the operation of road and rail transport in the future.  I hope that the bias contained in this Bill towards the greater use of public transport will be seen to operate.  We will not be able to plan the future of the city and county of Dublin purely on the basis of reacting to the need of vehicles, be they private or public. <Col N="344" /> We will have to see what can be done to develop the public transport system in such a way as to retain the character and attraction of Dublin as a city.  I made some points yesterday in my Second Stage speech about the unfortunate decision of the Minister for the Environment relating to the Patrick's Street-Nicholas Street compulsory purchase order and I will not repeat them now.  We have in this Bill very many important environmental improvements, areas of progress with the Department of the Environment, which have been achieved.  I hope that when the Dublin Transport Authority is formed &mdash; I presume the Minister will be able to indicate when this body is likely to be functioning &mdash; we will see many of these proposals improving the environment of the city and county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one point.  Listening to Senator Killilea an impression might be got that the Bill only speaks for the Transport Authority but looking at it from the point of view of Cork city, development plans have been set up over the last few years, and I know that the Dublin city development plan has been implemented within the last few years.  This Bill ties in with the relevant plans that are being made in other cities like Cork city.  An impression would not want to go out that they are thinking alone.  It is part of a general plan and it is also part of a structure that has been built up.  I would like to emphasise very strongly that for far too long we did not recognise that long term planning in our cities was needed.  A marvellous example of that is the de-luxe plan that has been implemented in Cork city.  We brought that out in 1978.  May I say that in funding we only went from strength to strength. We are planning on a long term basis. Many people who have visited us have said that it is only proper that we should plan on a long term basis.  People should be talking to each other regarding their plans.  I hope the Department have in mind that the Dublin City Development Plan is part of the whole general structure. That should be emphasised more.</P>

He did not oppose the Bill because of long term planning for the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.

      <P>I thought when Senator Cregan got to his feet that we were about to have a last minute effort to extend the Dublin Transport Authority Bill to the Cork area but that did not materialise.  I want to thank very much all the Senators for their contributions throughout this debate.  I must say they were stimulating contributions and were obviously expressing deep felt concerns and difficulties which they had experienced as well as difficulties that have been experienced by the public and been brought to their attention.  It would be a very useful exercise &mdash; I am sure it will take place &mdash; for the Dublin Transport Authority to read through all of this debate in the Seanad today, find the strongly held views of the Senators who contributed and examine the matters which are of concern to them and how they can act on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very confident, despite the reservations expressed, that excellent results will flow from the Dublin Transport Authority Bill we are now concluding here. The important point is that we now have legislation which will enable the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority to take place and, in response to Senator FitzGerald's question, the target date for that is 1 July, 1986.  It is hoped that we will be in a position to meet that. <Col N="346" /> I know there were reservations expressed about this Bill and the powers that it contains, but despite that, I believe that it has a major contribution to make, and also, for the people who will be charged with the responsibility of bringing the various regulations made here onto the ground it is a very exciting prospect as well as tackling the traffic problem of the capital city.  I wish them every success with that.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Senators are aware, was substantially amended in the Dáil.  The key contributions made today in the Seanad will guide the Minister in assigning functions to the DTA and also stimulate the DTA to meet the traffic and parking needs of Dublin in the overall interest.

While I realise the points he was making very strenuously, it would be wrong &mdash; I do not believe he really expected it &mdash; that the Dublin Transport Authority Bill should be expanded into a revision of the Casual Trading Act.</P>
      <P>On the road traffic by-laws, brought forward in the amendment by Senator FitzGerald, to prohibit juggernauts and such trucks parking in residential areas, I will, as I have promised, pursue this very vigorously with the Minister for the Environment.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Second Report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries: The Bilateral Aid Programme.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Dooge.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make my contribution regarding this report.  It is very important and very comprehensive.  I would like to pay tribute to the committee comprised of nine TDs and seven Senators.  In particular I would like to pay tribute to the Chairperson, Deputy Nora Owen.</P>
      <P>The fact that this is the second report of the committee indicates the high priority in which bilateral aid is regarded. I listened with great interest to the contributions from Senator Dooge and Senator Bulbulia.  I was particularly moved by Senator Dooge's contribution because he is involved in this area personally.  He told us that he was concerned in his provessional capacity with the key problem of water and the Third World.  He is taking a special interest in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me in this regard that the report, being so important and so interesting, in order to get the maximum benefit a good case could be made to have it printed, to include some pictures which would influence readers and to include some diagrams of Professor Dooge's schemes to show the work he is doing, and to show the benefit which <Col N="348" /> results from that work.  That would give emphasis to the help that is given in this area.  Perhaps that report could be distributed, on a countrywide basis, in schools, to influence the children who, in later life when they gain experience, might be able to make some contribution by going as volunteers to those countries.  A good case could be made for that.  The cost would be very small.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge raised many interesting points.  He stated, for example, that there are on this planet 1,000 million people who do not have access to safe water. That is an extraordinary number and very difficult to envisage.  He said we are in the middle of a United Nations decade of water and sanitation and despite all the efforts, at the end of that decade the problem will remain as huge.  He stated that it may be dented.  In some sense we could throw up our hands and cry failure. I would like to pay tribute to all the people who are working so hard.  When we look at the amount of money that is spent on Star Wars, on experimentation, sending human beings to the moon &mdash; I suppose in their own way those schemes are very important &mdash; when we consider how some of that money would affect the lives of so many millions in those countries man's inhumanity to man is underlined.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge told us about the waterborne disease and that in every year there are 500 million cases of this disease, 250 million cases of elephantiasis and 200 mil lion cases of schistosomiosis.  We read in periodicals like <i>Trocaire</i> the extent of the horror, that as many as 494 million people in the developing countries are suffering from crippling malnutrition.  This year more people will die of hunger than ever before and most of them will not be victims of famine.  In an average day 40,000 children die of malnutrition and related diseases.  In an average year at least 29 million people starve to death or die because of their health has been undermined by hunger.  The toll is rising all the time.</P>
    <P>I see a certain amount of despair that this problem is getting out of hand instead of being controlled and that the countries <Col N="349" /> which could provide sufficient funds to dent that problem, as Senator Dooge said, do not seem to be inclined to do that.  Those under-developed countries have been exploited over the centuries. The strong countries should make some amends for that exploitation but still there is a reluctance to to that.  In face of that and of a refusal to make a commitment to cope with that problem even though the part Ireland plays is very small in relation to what those countries could play, it underlines the importance of the smaller countries doing what they can to cope with the problem.  In my short contribution I will take a few instances and deal with them.  In a report of 59 pages where nothing is superfluous and where everything is so tightly composed it would be impossible to eliminate anything and quite clearly it would be impossible to deal with every aspect of the report.</P>
    <P>The bilateral aid programme we are told in the report is Ireland's centre-piece of development, co-operation and effort. For that reason and for its success in the areas where it has been involved it gives us a sense of pride that we have, in a small way and in a way that can be measured, succeeded in playing our part, maybe not to the full extent we should but, as Senator Dooge has rightly pointed out, with regard to our income and position, we can hold our heads high in relation to the funds that we provide <i>vis-a-vis</i> the more wealthy countries.</P>
    <P>The committee have concentrated their examination on the bilateral aid programme in the four priority countries, Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and the Sudan, and the non-priority countries which are funded directly by the Government. More emphasis in the report is placed on the conduct of programmes in the former two countries, Lesotho and Tanzania, because members of the committee visited both countries and viewed projects at first hand in early 1985.  The question which comes to mind in this regard is why were those two countries picked out as priority targets.  I know that there is criticism when public representatives <Col N="350" /> attend conferences and projects of this kind in other countries, but it would seem that here is a very worthy area where it would have been well worth while to provide finances so that members of the committee could have visited all countries.  There should be some sound reason for making a choice with regard to visitations.  It does not seem that this was spelt out in the report.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this problem the report says that the committee has addressed itself only to the questions of education, training, research for agricultural development and development in general. Education and training are the most important aspects particularly for natives of those countries and for those who have got sufficient training to be able to carry on with the schemes that have been initiated by the volunteers and the experts who are provided by this country.</P>
    <P>The committee's discussion of the bilateral aid programme and its recommendations, the report says, should be seen in the light of its unanimous opinion that the bilateral aid programme and its activities should have a clear poverty orientation, that each programme should tackle the basic needs of the most poverty stricken people of a particular area in a manner directly beneficial to them.</P>
    <P>The committee goes on to tell us:</P>
    <P>In the light of this principle it is the committee's view that, apart from the most exceptional circumstances, aid should be given without regard to the political complexion of the receiving countries.</P>
    <P>This is expanded in a few places further on in the report.  It is a point of view with which we would all agree.  Nevertheless, it seems that the political situation in a country is of paramount importance.  I realise that this is an area in which it might be better not to get involved in any great depth.  I can see the spirit of what is behind this recommendation.  Nevertheless, the political set-up is important with regard to the implementation and carrying on of these programmes which have started.  I agree that the particular ideology of a Government should not be <Col N="351" /> taken into consideration but the political sense which I take to mean the science of government in general, is important. While it would be wrong to try to influence political thought I feel some effort should be made to implement long term policies and the work done in the bilateral aid programme should be the foundation of a longer term programme.</P>
    <P>The report says that in considering the bilateral aid programme the committee drew attention to the overall context, both political and economic, within which the programme is pursued.  The committee view the programme as an expression of Ireland's commitment to longer term development in the developing countries.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of the committee that direct bilateral aid, no matter how well co-ordinated at an international level, will not of itself resolve the problem of underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>In a sense it puts a question mark after the bilateral aid programme.  It is obviously a short term solution and nobody expects that it would resolve the problem of underdevelopment.  The fact that it is spelled out here in that way lessens the impact of the bilateral scheme.  The report says:</P>
    <P>The Committee feels that in the context of the efforts of the developing countries to establish a new international economic order great care needs to be exercised by Ireland not to allow its natural affinity with and sympathy for the newly independent nations to be subjugated to the interests of some of our more economically powerful EC partners.</P>
    <P>I see a difficulty in this area.  There will always be a difficulty of choice.  It will be impossible to please everybody but the effort of the Government at all times I hope will be to steer a middle course.  If there is to be any deviation from that line it should be in the interest of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The committee drew particular attention to the problem of the debt burden <Col N="352" /> on developing countries.  The committee feel it is possible that very soon the cost of servicing their debts will outweigh the net inflow of aid to them.  This means that the developing countries could become net contributors to the economies of the developed world.  This would be an intolerable situation.  Senator Bulbulia in her lengthy contribution referred also to this.</P>
    <P>The committee believe that development programmes, worthy of themselves, will inevitably be defeated in their purpose unless the fundamental problem of debt is tackled.  They suggest the possibility of satisfactorily rescheduling or temporarily suspending the servicing of Third World debt and consider that this country should be vigorously involved in pursuing, in international fora, this course.  I wonder if any effort has been made in that regard?  Will the Government take a definite line?  I am sure it is an area that would be of great benefit to the developing countries.  I wonder what hope there is of getting that done?  When the Minister is replying perhaps he would refer to that matter.  It is an area of great importance.  It is extraordinary to envisage a situation where those countries would become net contributors to the economies of the developed world.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 deals with the general policy and the principles and states:</P>
    <P>A comprehensive policy document outlining the principles on which the Irish development policy is based, its aims and general characteristics has never been issued and it is clear that the lack of such a policy document is keenly felt among many of the organisations dedicated to the process of development cooperation.</P>
    <P>The committee are satisfied that a White Paper will be published shortly and that it will redress this situation.  Senator Bulbulia has also referred to the White Paper which I hope will be published in the near future.  Clearly, people involved in this area consider it important that a White Paper should be published.  While the committee have undertaken to be a <Col N="353" /> forum with regard to the implementation and suggestions the work they can do is limited.  We all look forward to the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The policy in relation to development aid changed over the seventies when Ireland crossed from being a developing country to what was regarded as a developed country.  We have a particular sympathy and affinity with those people because we have been also a colonised country, having suffered and undergone great deprivation and poverty.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>At a broad policy level Ireland took a positive stance in relation to the demand of the Third World for a new international economic order which it was hoped would establish more just and equitable economic relations between the developed and developing countries and, in the long run, a more stable and peaceful world.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge has gone into this in great detail and has reminded us that we are dealing with people and individuals. This is the aspect that we should concentrate on.  These considerations are included in this report and so also is the Government's aid programme embodying certain principles.  I do not want to take time to go into those in detail.  One of the principles is as follows:</P>
    <P>There was to be balanced growth in various sectors but particularly where Ireland has a special interest or competence (e.g. rural development and education).</P>
    <P>We would have much to contribute in this regard, being an agricultural country. Muintir na Tíre are one organisation who have contributed much to this country, from the point of view, for example, of adult education which is perhaps not as developed in this country as many people would wish.  Nevertheless, the involvement and the experience we have in those areas could be a tremendous help in the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The committee accept the principles <Col N="354" /> outlined as the major priority areas of the Government.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The committee recommends that programmes and projects flow from policy and not be established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and stresses that the need to tackle poverty should always be the basic criterion according to which decisions on the disbursement of Irish aid should be made.</P>
    <P>Money spent on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis would be money wasted.  Any money spent should be spent within the terms of an overall plan.  Occasions might arise when it would be necessary to have a considerable amount of flexibility.  This is dealt with also in the report.  The flexibility should be within the overall projections and aspirations of the plan and not a flexibility which would result in <i>ad hoc</i> schemes and situations of that kind.  If possible, projects should be capable of replication.  Senator Bulbulia emphasised that point.  I agree with her that in carrying out schemes by volunteers, certain expertise is required and mistakes can be corrected.  Therefore, replication is something with which I would agree.  If we acquire an ability in certain areas and we find out that these areas are of special importance we should endeavour to concentrate on those areas because the results are measurable.  In that way, too, I am sure that the experts in those countries and the local students in time would become proficient in carrying out those programmes.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>In drawing up programmes resources should be defined and the needs of a country or region should be studied to establish the best possible way to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is always essential to carry out a proper survey.  It is important to achieve the best results, to study the situation and to decide on achievable targets.  Therefore clear guidelines, as the report suggests, are needed for a future evaluation.</P>
    <P>A general aim should be to demonstrate to the taxpayer, who is ultimately the provider of aid funds, that his <Col N="355" /> money is being put to the best possible use for the best possible reasons.</P>
    <P>This is very important.  People who donate funds, small as they may be, like to think that all or most of the contributions will be spent in the actual provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred in passing to former schemes which were perhaps of a simple nature, for example, a penny for the black babies, which would be frowned on now.  Nevertheless at that time when money was not so plentiful people and, particularly schoolgoing children, felt they were making a contribution and a little sacrifice.  Therefore, in this way they were identifying with the problem.</P>
    <P>I was very glad that Senator Bulbulia did not denigrate that method of trying to be helpful by the missionaries who gave their lives and their time to those projects.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would like to pay a particular tribute to the missionaries of all religions who give their time and their lives for the rest of mankind.  Indeed, what greater sacrifice could anyone make than to lay down his life for his friends?</P>
    <P>I would like also to pay tribute to the volunteers who do marvellous work. Apparently there is some general rule regarding a maximum period of four years.  The committee feel that there should be some flexibility here.  There has been some improvement regarding leave granted to civil servants going abroad but perhaps more headway could be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>In terms of the full report, it seems to me that this is a very involved area.  I find it impossible to memorise the organisations involved from the initials given. Like Senator Bulbulia I am grateful that there is a list of those organisations with details at the back of the report.  It seems a terribly involved area.  It is an area where there is a certain amount of overlap between the different organisations. What clearly comes through from the report is that the work of the Government is of paramount importance in regard to co-ordinating the work, determining <Col N="356" /> what has to be done, selecting priorities, determining targets and carrying out reviews.  In that respect I want to pay tribute to the Government, to the concern of the people and to the Minister who was involved in this regard.  I wish him well.  I also welcome the report.</P>

      <P>First of all I thank those Senators who have already contributed to the debate. Of course, it is not over yet and I know there are other Senators who want to contribute.  To date, notwithstanding that it has been a somewhat punctuated debate with a gap of several weeks between the occasions on which we addressed the subject, it has been a most thoughtful and worthwhile exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more or less the practice on these occasions for Ministers coming in to speak to express appreciation of the work of the committee that has brought forward the report.  Because it is the practice it has become more or less a matter of form.  On this occasion I would like to express very generously, very deeply, and very warmly my appreciation for the work of the joint committee.  By any standards this committee has to be seen as being among the real successes of the committee system in this House and in <Col N="357" /> the other House.  I was pleased, too, that a number of the contributors from both sides of the House have singled out for mention the chairman of that joint committee, Deputy Nora Owen, who has undoubtedly brought an extraordinary degree of commitment to her task.</P>
    <P>While I am on the procedural aspects I will take up two issues that were raised before coming to the substance of my remarks.  These issues that were raised by Senator Fitzsimons.  He suggested that it would be appropriate to publish the report.  I got the impression that by publishing he meant publishing in a more permanent and glossier form than is now the case.  He suggested that its presentation could be improved by the insertion of a number of photographs of projects in action and that it would be possible to include diagrams, graphs and so on.  In response to that, it is a very worthwhile suggestion and what motivates him is very worthwhile.  I think it is achieved by the publication every year by the Department of their annual report which follows very closely the form suggested by Senator Fitzsimons.  It is distributed very much along the lines he has suggested to the interested bodies and, through them, to schools and so on and indeed directly by the Department to schools.</P>
    <P>The other question he raised was the fact that the report has been heavily influenced by the travel of a number of members of the committee to two of the four priority countries.  He said why only two?  Why not visit the other two?  It is a very reasonable question.  He seemed to suggest that the reason was lack of funds or lack of commitment to the exercise of bringing the committee members in contact with the scene on the ground. That certainly is not the case.  Since the report was prepared there has been a second visit by members of the committee to our priority countries.  In the course of that second visit members of the committee, though not the same members who made the original visit to Lesotho and Tanzania, completed the quartet as it were.  Those introductory <Col N="358" /> remarks made, I come to the body of the report.</P>
    <P>The Second Report of the Joint Committee, which considers in detail the official bilateral aid programme, begins by saying that development aid should be viewed in the wider context of international economic relations generally. This is an important and accurate observation and it seems to me to be an appropriate point of departure.</P>
    <P>The tragic famine in Africa in 1984-85 caused great concern and distress in this country and in other developed countries. The basic reaction of people generally was to give expression to their concern by contributing personally to relief programmes; and donations were provided on an impressively generous scale.  But there may also have been a certain pessimistic fatalism about the prospects of Africa and other parts of the Third World.  There may have been a feeling that just as the poor will always be with us so too the Third World will always be with us and will always be poor.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period, the immediate famine crisis has abated.  In addition, the commencement of recovery in the world economy has offered the developing countries some respite from the unfavourable external circumstances that have beset them for so long and, of equal significance, the developing countries themselves have shown signs of being ready to grasp the nettle of the internal economic reform that is essential to their recovery.</P>
    <P>These developments have understandably led to a reduction in the level of distress about the situation of developing countries in this and other developed countries, but there are encouraging signs that the public's concern is still engaged. The time may therefore be opportune for a more considered examination of the situation of the Third World, and for an approach which attempts to find lasting solutions in addition to providing emergency relief.</P>
    <P>Indeed it may well transpire that the most significant development of the past 18 months is that encouragement may <Col N="359" /> have been provided to the public in rich countries to think about and understand the way in which economic decisions and activities in which they themselves are involved can impinge on the lives of people in the Third World.  Economic linkages between developed and developing countries are extensive and growing. Such linkages arise in obvious ways, such as in the provision of relief and development aid by rich countries to poor ones, and in less obvious ways, such as in the crippling effects of high international interest rates on the Third World debt burden.</P>
    <P>They sometimes make themselves felt positively, such as when increased trade in favourable circumstances brings benefits to all countries, and at other times negatively, such as when a surge of low cost imports from developing countries puts jobs at risk in developed countries, or when subsidised exports from developed countries cause similar problems in the Third World.  Although the transmission of economic influences is still mainly from rich countries to poor ones, the reverse flow is not insignificant, as was demonstrated by the oil crisis of the seventies and the indebtedness crisis of the eighties.  More generally, developed countries have a stake in stability in the Third World as instability &mdash; in which poverty is often a potent ingredient &mdash; can harm developed countries as well, for example, by jeopardising supplies of vital raw materials for their industries.</P>
    <P>My own conviction is that there is a clear obligation on people in rich countries, based on humanitarian considerations, to do what they can to help their beleagured fellowman in the poor countries. But an interesting and important point that comes out of an examination of the economic linkages that exist is that it can also be in the broadly defined interests of the developed countries to help to promote growth in the Third World; realisation of this fact should reinforce our resolve to contribute to the fight against Third World poverty, even though the humanitarian considerations would be sufficient in themselves to underpin our commitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Examination of the economic linkages also helps to identify the particular areas in which there are mutual interests which permit co-operation from which both developed and developing countries can benefit; and it shows how &mdash; and at what cost &mdash; developed countries can in other respects reduce the harmful side effects of some of their policies for developing countries.  These are the insights associated with the concept of interdependence.</P>
    <P>The development of a better informed and more balanced attitude towards the situation of developing countries is important at this time because the fact is that, in so far as the prospects of those countries are concerned, matters are delicately balanced between the promise of improvement on the one hand and the threat of further deterioration on the other.  In this connection, it is interesting to note that the annual report for 1985 of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was published late last year, makes two separate sets of calculations in relation to the prospects of developing countries.</P>
    <P>The first calculation is based on pessimistic assumptions about the external environment, involving a continuation of the interest rates, exchange rates, growth rates in developed countries and commodity prices that have been experienced in recent years.  It projects virtual stagnation overall in terms of income per head and a continuing deterioration in the position of the poorest countries.</P>
    <P>The second calculation is based on consistent &mdash; but, the report argues, plausible &mdash; improvement in the relevant factors. It projects that the rate of growth would increase to about 7 per cent per year by 1995 in all the main regions while interest payments and outstanding debt would decline progressively relative to national income.  In the latter case, developed countries would also benefit to a significant degree as a result of being able to increase their exports to developing countries.  Whatever about these particular calculations, and they clearly have shades of the benign and malign scenarios <Col N="361" /> much favoured by distinguished former Members of this House, there is no reason to doubt the general proposition that improvement in the situation of developing countries is possible as well as being necessary, and that such improvement, if it can be achieved, would benefit all countries.</P>
    <P>Having sketched out the background in this way it is clear that development aid is only a small part of the picture and that significant improvement in the situation of developing countries requires crucially favourable changes in the international environment as well as internal policy reform.  I know Senator Fitzimons raised the question of indebtedness and I am sure he will have followed with interest the developments that have taken place, even in the last few days, with the announcement of moratoria by the Canadians, the Dutch and by the Nordics.  That is a move we applaud.  We are not directly involved ourselves because we do not have any debts since all of our aid programme is on the basis of grant rather than loan, but it is certainly something to which we give our enthusiastic support just as we do to the principle that we abhor the prospect of countries finding themselves paying back more than they are receiving.  The reverse of that is that we would look with disfavour on any country that found itself the recipient of such inflows.  This is the picture, but only part of the picture.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is true that aid is at best a contribution to the efforts of the developing countries to promote their own development, and that it is less important than the trace and other external factors affecting their economics.  Nevertheless it is important and particularly so for the poorest countries: in Africa, ODA accounts for 10 per cent of gross domestic investment, and the figure rises to 80 per cent in the poorest, semi-arid countries.</P>
    <P>The joint committee perform an important service and contribute to the elaboration of official policy in this area by examining these questions in a careful and positive way.  I am in complete agreement with the committee that the objective of aid &mdash; and, indeed, of <Col N="362" /> development itself &mdash; is to reduce poverty.  It is, therefore, important that the effects of aid &mdash; whether they arise directly or indirectly &mdash; should be carefully analysed.  We must try to reach a thorough understanding of the development requirements of the countries we are trying to help with a view to organising our aid in the most effective way possible.</P>
    <P>An important point which arises in this connection is that a poverty-oriented development strategy in any developing country must necessarily be broad.  There will obviously be a need for measures &mdash; such as primary health care &mdash; which directly alleviate the effects of poverty. At the same time there will be a need for measures &mdash; such as mining and other forms of exploitation of physical natural resources &mdash; which influence poverty only indirectly but which are directly productive in an economic sense, so that the overall programme can be financed and the strategy that lies behind it thus sustained. And there will also be a need for measures to improve the efficiency of Government administration so that the quality of economic management will be adequate to permit opportunities to be exploited and pitfalls avoided.</P>
    <P>The point of basic importance which emerges from this analysis is that since all of these measures can be essential to the anti-poverty strategy, assistance with any one of them can be equally effective even though some of them impinge on poverty directly whereas others do so only indirectly.  This is, of course, an analysis which finds ready acceptance in so far as the management of our own economy is concerned.  In the case of economic development in Ireland, nobody would argue, for example, that the production of high-technology computer parts for export is inappropriate because less well-off people generally do not benefit directly from the process.  On the contrary, it is universally accepted that activities of this kind can contribute to general economic improvement with significant and worthwhile indirect benefits for less well-off people.  The point of relevance for present purposes <Col N="363" /> is that similar considerations arise in the case of Third World development.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is important that donors of aid to developing countries should be prepared to be sensible and should be ready to assist across the whole range of measures essential to a poverty-oriented development strategy.  Donors should, moreover, be prepared to focus their aid in those areas in which they are best equipped to assist, in terms of the expertise and resources available to them; and they should be prepared to agree a sensible division of labour between donors in the interests of effective co-ordination.  The general point here is that the main consideration when allocating aid must be the actual requirements of the particular recipient country. If we accept that then donors must be prepared to set aside any preconceived ideas they may have about the superiority of aid in a particular sector or of a particular form of aid; and they must be prepared to operate in relatively unfashionable sectors if this is what is required to support an overall povery-orientated strategy. In short, aid must be recipient-oriented, not donor-oriented.</P>
    <P>In practice, any sizeable aid programme is likely to be involved in projects across the whole range of measures required to support a development strategy.  The Irish bilateral programme, for example, assists a wide range of projects:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;village water supplies are supported in Zambia while assistance is provided to the budget office on the Ministry of Finance in Lesotho;</P>
    <P>&mdash;village housing units are produced in Kenya involving many other groups, the Irish scouting movement, while cement is manufactured in Zambia and carpets in Tanzania;</P>
    <P>&mdash;basic primary education is assisted in Kenya while high-level technological training is provided in Tanzanians;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" />&mdash;In Tanzania, community and preventive health services in remote areas are assisted while in Lesotho architectural expertise has been made available for design work at the national hospital;</P>
    <P>&mdash;rudimentary rural transport infrastructure &mdash; in the form of mountain pathways capable of being traversed on horseback &mdash; has been supported in Lesotho while the development of an international airline was assisted in the same country;</P>
    <P>&mdash;village level technology based on wind power is being supported in India while advice was provided to Sudan on the organisation of its national power services.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that I am satisfied, on the basis of rigorous evaluation, and while accepting that it is always necessary to search for further improvements, that the Irish programme &mdash; in all the sectors in which it operates &mdash; is contributing to the reduction of poverty in the Third World.  Certainly that is the perception of the people with whom we are co-operating in the developing countries.  In the course of the last week I had an opportunity to meet with the Foreign Ministers of each of the four countries with which we have a priority relationship and I was enormously buoyed up by their appreciation of the value of our efforts and impressed by the depth of knowledge they showed about the details of our programme.  In one case a foreign Minister was able to mention the names of the individual Irish volunteers who are active in his country and he was able to allocate them to the individual programmes.</P>
    <P>The point made earlier that what is now happening in our development programme builds on a much longer Irish tradition of support for the Third World arose in my bilaterial discussions with those four Ministers.  Those discussions took place in the context of the UN special session on Africa.  In the course of my remarks to the General Assembly I referred to the proud Irish missionary <Col N="365" /> tradition and the fact that long before it became fashionable to talk in terms of development many thousands of Irish men and women had given their lives in service to the people of Africa.  If I had any doubts about that &mdash; and I had none &mdash; that was reinforced for me in my meeting with the Zambian Foreign Minister. When I started to review the history of Irish aid to Zambia and referred to the fact that it originated long before we had an official aid programme which was inaugurated by Dr. FitzGerald, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the mid-seventies that there had been a pre-existing relationship with Zambia involving the IPA which traces its origins back to when Mr. Frank Aiken was Minister for External Affairs.  He pointed out to me that Irish-Zambian links go back a great deal further.  He referred to the enormous contribution, to the human resources, to the development of a human infrastructure that had been made, in particular, by Irish Jesuit Fathers in Zambia.</P>
    <P>Development assistance provided by Ireland directly to individual developing countries is, of course, small in overall terms.  It is nevertheless important for the recipient countries concerned and highly regarded by them.  It is also important for us because it gives us a direct involvement in the development process.  This is helpful in terms of understanding the issues concerned.</P>
    <P>The existence of a directly organised bilateral programme also facilitates the utilisation of Irish skills and resources in development projects in the Third World.  This is something the Government encourage not only in our own bilateral projects but also in the case of projects funded by international agencies and by developing countries themselves. Of course the fundamental objective is to promote the development of the recipient country concerned but there need not be any conflict involved in utilising Irish skills and resources as far as possible in the pursuit of that objective.</P>
    <P>Our programme of official development assistance has grown substantially in recent years.  In the early seventies the <Col N="366" /> programme was very small indeed.  In 1974 it was £1.5 million or 0.5 per cent of GNP.  But a new impetus was given to the programme at that time and this has resulted in very substantial growth in the interim.  This year ODA will be about £44 million or 0.265 per cent of GNP. Irish ODA have also grown relative to other donors.  In 1974, Irish ODA was equivalent to only about 15 per cent of the OECD average; by last year it had grown to 60 per cent &mdash; a four fold increase.  Moreover, this increasing trend is set to be maintained in accordance with the provisions of the national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i>  On this basis, ODA will reach £50 million or 0.275 per cent of GNP next year.  This is the first time funding for ODA has been guaranteed for a number of years into the future.  This is a great help in terms of the planning and development of the programme.  In ideal circumstances, an even larger increase of ODA would have been provided for.  However, it is a fact that ODA was given very favourable treatment as compared with public spending generally in the course of the fundamental reappraisal of the economy and of the public finances which was the basis of the preparation of <i>Building on Reality.</i>  In fact, the rate of increase of ODA is planned to be three and a half times faster than that of public expenditure overall.  Of course, there are no grounds for complacency in this regard: we must always endeavour to do more and to improve the quality of what we do.</P>
    <P>Insofar as the execution of our aid is concerned, the joint committee's arguments about the need for appropriate expertise for aid implementation and about the role of returned development workers are well-taken.  In this connection the House will be aware that the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation, whose membership for the period 1986-88 I announced recently, benefits from the participation both of returned development workers and of persons with relevant expertise.  The House may also be interested to know in <Col N="367" /> this connection that the specialist evaluation staff of my Department has recently been augmented by the recruitment of a rural development adviser who formerly served as a volunteer in Africa with an Irish NGO who has relevant qualifications in agricultural science and economics.</P>
    <P>I also share the committee's concern that the rights of returned development workers in matters such as social welfare entitlements should be protected. Indeed, this was an area that agitated me and caused me concern in my previous role in the Department of Labour.  It was an area that Deputy Rory Quinn, Minister for Labour, and myself highlighted during the Irish Presidency of the Community.  I am glad to say that together we were successful and those efforts did meet with a very fair degree of success.  The House can be assured that efforts will continue to bring about further improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee's comments regarding the geographical distribution of Irish aid are also of interest.  I fully accept the committee's argument that the need for assistance is evident in all parts of the Third World and I agree that it is desirable that Irish assistance should not be excessively concentrated in any one area. The House will be aware in this connection that about 60 per cent of Irish aid is distributed through multilateral organisations and so is made available, in effect, to all developing countries.  Moreover, bilateral assistance through NGOs and the Agency for Personal Service Overseas is made available to a wide range of recipient countries.  In the case of project aid under the Bilateral Aid Programme, however, it is desirable, for reasons of efficiency and impact, to concentrate it in a limited number of countries.</P>
    <P>Although this approach has been pursued for a number of years now the country programmes concerned are still very small by international standards and could benefit from considerable further development.  Accordingly, although this matter should and will be kept under continuous review, there appears to be <Col N="368" /> merit in continuing for the time being with the present approach with a view to discharging adequately our obligations to the existing priority countries.</P>
    <P>I have, at my meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee, as a number of Members of the House will be aware, contemplated the fact that over the next 12 to 18 months we may achieve a situation where there will be some room for manoeuvre within our aid programme. At that time it would appear appropriate to consider the question of adding to the list of our priority countries.  When that point is reached then the views of the committee, and in particular their suggestion that our aid programme should not be seen as being unduly concentrated in any one geographic area, can be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>I should like finally to say that the committee's more specific and detailed comments about various aspects of the aid programme are of interest and will be given close consideration.  In general, the analysis provided by the committee is interesting and thought-provoking and represents a valuable contribution to the development of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I should like to express again my appreciation of the fine work of the committee in a good cause.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into a non-stop session of praise for everybody who has been involved in this, but there are times when we regard ourselves as a nation of knockers.  We are inclined to criticise right, left and centre.  I found, by being on this Oireachtas committee, it was almost the equivalent of doing a thesis for a doctorate.  It was an education that I will appreciate for the rest of my life.  It meant a lot to me personally.  It gave me much more contact with what was going on, and what was theory before this turned out to have a lot of practical connotations. I found that, even in relation to children in school, I was able to talk about the Third World with much more <Col N="370" /> feeling.  I was delighted to see the children's own response.  On one occasion they ran a sale of work and we sent money to Haiti &mdash; which I suppose does not come under our care.  That happened because I knew there was a nun home in the parish.  I invited her to talk to the children. Her description of going by mule across the hillside is something that means much more to children when they hear it from somebody who has been involved.</P>
    <P>Last year two of our parishioners set off for Bangladesh with two children &mdash; the baby was only six months old.  He was an engineer and she a teacher.  We have been in contact since.  The children have run another sale of work and sent money to them.  It has been an education for me. The committee has meant a lot to me.  I appreciate the opportunity I had to be on it.</P>
    <P>Having said it was an education and it was like doing a thesis for a doctorate, I do not think I would get my doctorate because I find the more that goes on the more seems to be there.  I regret that I have not visited any of these countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is recorded officially &mdash; that is only a joke, of course, in case it is.  If it comes true, that is fine. It is difficult to listen to people who have come back from these countries and to follow their descriptions without knowing exactly what the ground rules are like.  I would not regard a trip to these places as being a holiday trip or what is referred to as a junket.  Indeed, some of the descriptions I have heard of the travel arrangements and the schedules over there were more indicative of an ordeal than a holiday. But it would add a lot to know what you are dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began by saying that we are a nation of knockers; we are inclined to knock ourselves.  I felt very proud of the fact that so many people were doing so much good on this committee.  I do not think I would be prejudiced by complimenting the Government as a Government for <Col N="371" /> officially taking the line it has by providing the back-up service it has given.  I compliment the Department of Foreign Affairs because it was regarded very highly by different groups we met, for, first of all, its flexibility.  They were able to go in almost on a personal basis, sit down and talk to these people.  They felt very happy about this.  They felt the Department were there to help them and that they were quite willing to help them.</P>
    <P>Many of these organisations have received a lot of money, apart from what has been given in an official capacity. Organisations such as Trocaire and Concern hold collections; they get money from the people all over the countryside. I think the Irish people deserve a pat on the back for continuing the great traditions we have, to which the Minister referred, of missionaries going out helping over the years.  That spirit is still very much alive; it can be seen regularly despite our own problems.  Many people are in difficulties themselves, but as an Irish nation we seem to have a great sense of caring for other people.  That report gives us an opportunity to compliment the Irish people on being so generous.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment in particular all of those volunteers who leave comfort and head off into places where they have no comfort.  They are living in climates which are often not suitable &mdash; they may be warm but they are not suitable.  They are generally dealing with people who are ill or hungry or in difficulties.  I could not sufficiently express my admiration for them.  They are prepared to leave comfort.  The couple I spoke about from my own parish had a lovely new house with all modern conveniences.  They headed out to Bangladesh, he to build bridges as an engineer and she to set up a school.  I read a letter only two days ago which she sent to the children in which she described the monsoons battering the bamboo walls of the school and affecting it.  This does a lot to help the Irish children to understand that perhaps what they might regard as not being a very polished school is in fact OK; they can realise that <Col N="372" /> they could be in much worse conditions. It helps to put things in their proper perspective.</P>
    <P>I have been arguing on committees that these people who go abroad should get every chance of being appreciated in full. I have made the point several times that, while they get leave of absence, often the difference between paying their &ldquo;subs&rdquo; and paying them their salaries and they paying &ldquo;subs&rdquo; would be very little, because generally people who go abroad are at the lower level of the scale &mdash; they have three or four years experience. Generally you do not get people at the top of a scale going off.  I have always maintained that as a gesture &mdash; it would cost very little &mdash; if we paid them their salaries and let them pay their subs they would have a few hundred pounds left over.  That is all it would be but it would be a gesture of appreciation for what they are doing rather than simply giving them leave of absence, paying their &ldquo;subs&rdquo; and cutting them off.  It is a very small amount but at the same time it could be done.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister mentioned in his speech that he has taken on somebody who has been out working in the Third World.  I think we are not using these people enough.  It is fine to talk about calling them in as advisers every so often, but these are the people who have been out there.  Although I have served on this committee since it was founded I would hate to think that I could give advice to people who are going out there. The people who are coming back should be drafted in.  I was going to suggest that they should be given work specifically in foreign affairs, to deal with this sort of problem.  I am glad the Minister has done that.  I hope that he does not appoint only one, that he might draft in a few more who will know exactly what they are talking about.  Even visitors out there do not get, and could not in a short space of time, a proper grasp of the situation.  If there is any red tape that would prevent the Minister for appointing people like that, let him call on us and we will back him to the hilt.  We let their expertise disappear.  They come back into parishes and perhaps they organise funds and such <Col N="373" /> things, but in the long run we do not sufficiently use their expertise.  I would like to see them used fully in a very direct way.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the idea of poverty being the main aim and politics not entering the situation.  This is very important because hunger knows no politics and starvation is not impressed by either socialism or conservatism.  It is very important that, as a small nation which can take a genuinely neutral stand, we should be prepared to ignore a certain political climate that may exist and that we would really look after those who are in difficulty.  While we cannot be so liberal as to let money be abused, we should not let doctrinaire political jargon affect us as to whom we will support.  I am glad we are supporting the idea that we go after poverty.</P>
    <P>I have always asked, when we met delegations, if they can help to provide food, provide resources rather than just sending out food.  I have always been impressed by details of what is going on in Third World countries.  We should never be afraid that some of the ventures we go into may fail.  Like love, it is better to have tried and lost than never to have tried at all.  We would not want to assess at the end of the year that £20,000 was spent here or there and it did not work out.  In countries in difficulty, we should be prepared to take a certain risk, if it does not work out, certainly I would not go rapping anybody on the knuckles for it.</P>
    <P>The report says that pre-departure training is important.  Having spoken to people who were there, language can be a difficult problem for people who go over there and it is not so easy to pick it up and get used to the customs.  In our report it has been mentioned that often in the fuss of getting ready to go over people have not time to deal with these things.  I hope this will be well looked after in future.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying I am delighted to have served on the committee.  I did not fully realise that so many of our Irish people were helping so many and in so many places and doing such marvellous <Col N="374" /> work and so genuinely concerned.  The people who run all the organisations and came to the committee knew what they were talking about and were able to argue their case.  Perhaps they would differ at times from us and maybe among themselves, but not to any serious extent.  It is a tribute to the Irish nation that we have people like them doing so much.  I hope this work will continue and I hope that, as a committee, we will be able to help them for many more years whether or not there is an election in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to speak to this, the Second Report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries and to express my personal satisfaction at the continued Government commitment to our bilateral aid programme right through a period when even the Government themselves have admitted they are going through a difficult economic period when funds are difficult to come by; when the taxpayers themselves are experiencing difficulty in meeting their taxation demands. Through the entire period of this Government their record in continuing to move upwards towards the United Nations contribution target is, indeed, very admirable. I would like to pay a very sincere and special tribute to the section of the Department of Foreign Affairs who do such tremendous work in this area and whose work has been so efficient and, more important still, effective on the ground in the under-developed areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that I am not a member of the joint committee.  I am almost envious of Senator Browne who has a seat on this committee.  During my period in the European Parliament I worked on the commission for the development association.  I was an executive member of the ACP for a number of years.  I was vice-president of that body for one term which enabled me to visit many countries in two continents that we were specifically trying to help.  I am on record in the House as advocating to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that more colleagues from the House should have <Col N="375" /> the opportunity to move out to see for themselves on the ground the problems the populations in developing countries have to face and live with.  Even a short visit would enable people to get a feel for the task in hand.  Perhaps by association or by visiting the workplaces in the parishes or the districts of Irish missionaries they would be able to get a feeling for themselves of the amount of work that remains to be done.  I would like to join with the previous speaker in paying my tribute to the great Irish missionary tradition.</P>
    <P>If one were to look at the work and the improvements that these people, apart from their religious commitment have achieved, one finds that those missionaries with very little material resources by introducing more modern techniques and perhaps introducing some educational facilities in no uncertain way have opened up a new era and a new life for very many of those rural tribes in many countries in Africa.  I am very glad that our Government, through their non-governmental aid programme, are very willing to help individual mission projects, especially the co-operative projects in many of the countries where they are working.  Even though it accounts for a very small percentage of the total funds provided &mdash; which the Minister told us this year was in excess of £44 million &mdash; in small parochial areas or very small community areas that process would give a great lift to these people who have not very many of the material goods most of us take for granted.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will continue to endeavour to work towards the United Nations target for development aid.  It is necessary that the free world should do that.  The population of this country last year, in its response to the Bob Geldof effort, showed itself to be charitably disposed towards people in developing countries.  Perhaps that is not surprising because 20 years ago &mdash; and a bit &mdash; when I was going to school we had a great movement for the missions.  In every national school in the country I think you have a box for &ldquo;black babies&rdquo;, and all <Col N="376" /> sorts of aids for the mission societies.  The ordinary man in the street, irrespective of his religion, has been acclimatised to that: it is nothing new.  When the famine in Ethiopia was highlighted a little more than a year ago, people showed that they cared.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of visiting Turkey earlier this year.  One of the things which amazed me and has amazed me for many years is that the Sultan in 1848 and 1849 was one of the few heads of State who sent Government aid for the famine situation in Ireland.  Only one or two countries responded to the need.  It was not as well advertised or publicised as the situation in Ethiopia has been in this decade.</P>
    <P>On my very first visit to Africa in 1973 I had the opportunity of visiting Ethiopia. They were in a famine situation at that time.  Those people have experienced a fairly long period of denigration and suffering. When one looks at the Government's priorities out there and find that such a huge percentage of the national budget is spent on armaments or defence, or whatever heading one likes to put it under, one wonders whether in those kinds of feudal states in the developing countries the ordinary people rate very highly in the priorities of their Governments.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has clearly identified countries where Irish aid can be more easily fed into the system and can be of greatest assistance.  But there is one Francophobe country that I feel is still the very poorest and is one that is getting very little aid.  That is Chad.  I always feel extremely sorry for the people of that country.  Even on the ACP ten years ago the neighbouring countries who were perhaps very much more powerful, could not care less and they very often were not willing to allow goods to be transported across their own countries into Chad.  I would ask the Minister, who has a great future in Foreign Affairs &mdash; and I wish him success &mdash; that irrespective of whether he is in the United Nations or the EC, even if our Government do not decide to give direct aid, to put a greater emphasis on the very many problems that <Col N="377" /> the Republic of Chad are experiencing. The fact that most of the information coming out comes through the French publications should not deter us.  I know that we do not have Irish nationals to any great extent there.  Still, the case needs to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to say a special word of appreciation of the great work that organisations such as Gorta, a semi-State or Governmental organisation are doing in assisting people, as their own slogan says, to assist themselves. Mr. Smiley, the chief executive and his chairman and governing council are continuing to play a most significant role, as indeed are our voluntary organisations like Concern, the Cheshire Foundation or the Ryder Foundation or Oxfam.  All in their own way are doing tremendous work.  They are working in a voluntary capacity with the people who really are in the greatest need.  I would hope that the ordinary members of the public would continue to respond to the charitable appeals of those organisations.</P>
    <P>I have been saddened of late to find that Trócaire are departing from the charitable role and perhaps would appear to be embarking on the murky waters of international politics.  Perhaps it is this liberation theology that prompts them to advocate strikes, lockouts, or embargos or whatever.  My only thing against that is that in any of those situations where sanctions are imposed, the people who are calling the shots or creating the policies are not being got at.  In those situations the poor people at the bottom of the ladder are walked on, no matter which way the traffic is going, whether it is going up or down the ladder.  It is the unfortunate poor of those countries who are going to be left in their continuing misery.  I would prefer if the desirable changes could be brought about through assisting the people themselves, through education perhaps, or changing archaic or outdated systems.</P>
    <P>Last night's debate in the House on the Philippines on which we will have an opportunity of speaking next week is a great case in point where it was possible to see a ray of hope.  Let us hope that <Col N="378" /> some other regimes can be changed for the benefit of the public themselves.  If one is the underdog in any of these countries it does not really matter to the guy who is at the butt end of a jackboot, whether it is a left jackboot or a right jackboot.  We here in what we would hope is a civilised Christian society &mdash; obviously the population in this country have demonstrated in a tremendous way that we are a caring society &mdash; would all be concerned to see equality and justice being the order of the day right around the world.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is a great pleasure to be able to say to our colleagues who have served on the Joint Committee on Developing Countries, the report of which we have before the House today that the work is one that must be ongoing.  We must find ways of being able to have aid reach increasing numbers of people. There is still great scope for expanding our voluntary services overseas.  I know that it is a great contribution for any young woman or young man to give a year or two years of their early professional lives in the service of others.  But I would appeal to the organisations at home and to the other Departments, apart from the Department of Foreign Affairs for greater and more practical recognition of voluntary service overseas, irrespective of which country it is given in or whether the service is under an ODA, a BAP or an APSO or Governmental or a non-Governmental organisation.  If people are prepared to go and work for little or nothing, or work for their maintenance in the Third World, as so many excellent people are doing, the paths should be smoothed out for them at home to slip back into employment. More important still, their service and their work abroad should be reckoned for incremental purposes here. My recollection is that the Department of Education allowed that a couple of years ago.  But I am not too sure whether it is universally implemented.  It is something we should look at again.</P>
    <P>It is valuable experience for a professional <Col N="379" /> person whether he is a teacher, a medical person or an engineer. If people are working in a different terrain in a different country, it is important experience and it should qualify for whatever incremental scales are available.  A person who works in a voluntary capacity in a developing country is a fuller person when he or she comes back because that person has lived through a great humanitarian experience.  It would certainly have a beneficial effect on the personality of those young people.  I have no doubt whatever, after such a period abroad in the service of such a poor country, that those people would be able to make an enhanced contribution to their chosen professions at home.</P>

      <P>Ar bhealach ní thugann sé aon áthas dom an rud seo a phlé os comhair an tSeanaid, an crúachás ina bhfuil cúrsaí teagaisc i gColáiste Iognáid i gcathair na Gaillimhe faoi láthair agus na deacrachtaí atá ann i leith an mhúinteora a shíl siad go mbeadh ceapaithe ag an am seo is a thuig siad a cheapachán a bheith glactha leis ag an Roinn agus ag an Aire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It give me no pleasure to have to raise this matter in the Seanad.  It falls into two sections with, perhaps, a third dimension. The first of these is in relation to the difficulties that have arisen in the case of Coláiste Iognáid in Galway city.  I would <Col N="380" /> like at the outset to apologise for any confusion I may have caused in my notice of motion in this regard as to whether it was a thirteenth, fourteenth or a sixteenth each.  We understand perfectly what is at stake.  It is, in fact, approval of an assistant teacher for which application has been made.</P>
    <P>The issues involved, as I understand them, fall into two clearly defined categories. The first of these is the circumstances of Coláiste Iognáid which is a scoil lán-Ghaelach, primary school.  May I confess a personal interest in this regard in so far as three of my sons are attending this school which makes me familiar with and perhaps additionally interested in the circumstances of its difficulties.  Coláiste Iognáid is a school with 450 pupils.  It is an all Irish primary school.  It reflects the interests of the parents of Galway city and their commitment to the Irish language that so many of them send their children to this school.</P>
    <P>The second issue that arises is the more general one of the function of the patron in relation to the primary school system. It is something about which I am not clear having looked at the basic manual for the administration of the primary school system which makes reference to the role of the parent and the possible assumption of the role of patron by a board of management and so forth.  In general, it is unclear and, in this instance, it has occasioned difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would like to flesh out the case a little more clearly.  Scoil Iognáid, an all Irish school, was presented with a development plan in July 1985.  This plan was drafted and submitted, I understand, by officials of the Department of Education, was submitted to the board of management of Scoil Iognáid and was approved by them.  At discussions which took place then and later, it was clearly understood that it was a normal development that the additional teacher would be appointed when the numbers warranted it and that the arrangements for the school would be similar to those for an urban school of its size.  It is my view that the development of Scoil Iognáid should not be open-ended. It should be limited to a particular <Col N="381" /> size.  Its development by now justifies the appointment of an additional assistant teacher on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>In September 1985, when the numbers justified it, an application was made to the Department of Education for the additional post.  As I understand it, the number on the roll having risen the normal expectation of the board of management, the principal and the parents was that the post would be filled.  A couple of issues arise immediately here. The post was seen as the completion of a phase of a planned development to which the Department not only assented but in many ways had initiated and which has been agreed by all the parties concerned. We are all interested in the development of the issue in the best interest of parents, teachers and pupils.</P>
    <P>The issue of the patron arises in so far as a meeting took place which was attended by representatives of the other schools under the joint patronage of the patron in question.  It was at this stage that concern was expressed at the development of Scoil Iognáid, that such development might well be seen as in some way affecting the overall development of other schools.  I emphasise at this stage that my consultation with the principal teacher, with the staff and the parents, and being a parent myself, showed that we did not want an enormous school with an open-ended set of plans for development but we saw the appointment, application for which had been made, as the conclusion of an existing phase of development.</P>
    <P>After the meeting of the other school heads, to which the head of the all Irish school was not invited, it appeared that correspondence ensued between the principal of the school, an tUasal Niall Ó Morchú on behalf of the board of management and the Department.  In some of these pieces of correspondence reference was made to the effect that such proposals for development, as had been agreed and had been reasonably expected, were now conditional on approval by the patron.  In some places the reference is: <Col N="382" />&ldquo;This, of course, presumes the agreement of the patron&rdquo;.  On other occasions it was put in another way but it is the same thing: &ldquo;It is assumed that the agreement of the Bishop will be forthcoming&rdquo;. I am very anxious not to particularise this.  Obviously this meant that the expected development, the expected permanent appointment, had now become conditional.</P>
    <P>It is in this sense then that the issue spills over into the more general issue, an issue of fundamental administration in education as far as I am concerned.  A meeting took place between the board of management of Scoil Iognáid and the Bishop.  The outcome of that meeting &mdash; here I am relying on the <i>Galway Observer</i> of Wednesday, 14 May 1986 in an interview given by an tUasal Ó Morchú to representatives of that newspaper &mdash; was:</P>
    <P>It was understood on the basis of the meeting that the Bishop would write to the Department of Education to say that his belief was that there should be orderly development of primary education and that Scoil Iognáid should not develop very much in an additional way and should not be taken as constituting a veto on the post for which application had been made.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, there was a series of meetings in the Department of Education between the board of management's representatives and the officials of the Department of Education.  The factual position is, of course, that we are without the teacher.</P>
    <P>At different times in this story different suggestions have been made about the possibility of a temporary appointment. I understand that we are talking about a normal set of expectancies justified in terms of roll numbers, justified in terms of a development plan being agreed, justified with all the procedures of consultation having taken place between the management, parents, representatives and so forth suddenly encountering difficulties and those difficulties being specifically related to the perceived impact of development by the particular school involved on the development plans for the school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> I worry about this particular case.  I ask the Minister of State, whom I am very glad to welcome to this House and I wish him every success in his duties, for a reply to the particular question.  What is happening, what is going to happen in relation to the approval of the teacher in Scoil Iognáid?  The more general question that I am very interested in is this.  If there be a plan agreed between the Department and the head of a school, the head of a school and board of management and the Department, at what stage can it be put off the rails by decisions taken at meetings which are chaired by the patron of a school or set of schools?  How does the patron execute functions in balancing one set of expectancies of one school from another?  Are they over and above the Department's regulation?  Are they over and above the normal expectancies that come from an agreed plan of development?  Where does it all lead to in the end if you can say that the regular expectations of one particular school must now be judged anew?  What is the new circumstances?  Is there a case, for example, that a person should be patron of only one school?  Why have a patron at all?  What enables a patron to know not only the reasonable requirements of one school but the reasonable requirements of several schools and be able to change the expectancies of one school and set them off against the notional expectancies of another school?</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be something that does not, at least as I encounter it, to fit with the norm of accountability.  I know who the Minister for Education is and who the Minister of State is.  I know who elects myself, I know who elects people on to different committees but I cannot find how patrons came to be, how patrons functions are specified, where they begin, where they end, where they cut across administrative decisions, where they cut across ministerial direction, where they cut across, for example, the discussions of parents, teachers, pupils and so forth. It was with that purpose in mind that I decided to raise this.  The Minister of State will note that I have not personalised <Col N="384" /> the discussion in any way and I have tried as much as possible to defuse the entire situation.  An animus could be created between the heads of schools, between parents in different schools and different boards of management that can be avoided.  I suggest that these are principles by which the matter can be resolved. Approval for the permenant post should be issued forthwith.  It should be clearly understood that the development of Scoil Iognaid is in fact within the context of the plan as agreed with the Department that, we should go back to that position and that we should fill out the module as it is in fact in every other place and at present it is a teacher short. That finishes the issue as it arises in relation to that particular school.</P>
    <P>If you accept that that is the overall development of that school, that enables the rest of the school heads to look forward, given normal demographic developments, to what will be the natural expectancies in relation to enrolment and so forth.  If it is not resolved in this way other issues will arise.  There is, for example, the overwhelming case that can be made for this school.  It is an all Irish school with enormous involvement of parents, many of whom are Irish speaking who came originally from Teaghlaigh Gaeilge, people who wanted Irish in their homes and in their schools which led to the establishment of this school.  All of this could be added in as an additional factor.  I feel, quite frankly, that not only will it be seen to be a national school that is being treated differently but it will be seen to an all Irish primary school that is being treated differently because of the unique principle of attraction it has, that it was attracting the children of parents who wanted their children taught through Irish at primary level and that somehow or another it is being discriminated against on that particular basis.</P>
    <P>I urge that what we want in Galway city &mdash; I say this as a parent &mdash; is the orderly development of primary school provision and we want to see as much openness as possible.  We have not been assisted by meetings which were semiclosed. We are not assisted by the appearance <Col N="385" /> that has been given of promises broken.  I say for all of these reasons that the particular principle might be perhaps used by the Minister of State that he might give his answer perhaps in two ways.  There would be a direct reply to the particular instance that I have given, which is the appointment of the permanent teacher for which application has been made by Scoil Iognaid, and the more general issue, as to the confusion that may arise in relation to the exercise of the role of patron, his views in this matter and perhaps where I might go for clarification as to where the role of patrons begin and end and indeed, whether they are necessary, which is a more general issue to which we can return on another date.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an Seanadóir Ó hUiginn as ucht é seo a chur ar an clár.</P>
      <P>Recent publicity about this case and the terms of Senator Higgins's motion suggest that there is a need for me to clarify two relevant aspects of our system of primary education.  These are the patronship of national schools and our policy in regard to education through Irish.</P>
      <P>National schools are not State schools. With very few exceptions, they are neither financed nor administered directly by the Minister for Education but are subject to local ownership and control through the agency of the various religious denominations.  On certain conditions, they receive financial support from the State for specified purposes including grants for building, extending premises and for teachers' salaries.  We are all aware of the system whereby a board of management is the immediate external government of most national schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What proportion of that would be the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get that for the Senator. While these boards are responsible for the routine management of their schools within the authority of the Rules <Col N="386" /> for National Schools, they do not own the school premises, nor have they any function in regard to capital expenditure, nor are they parties to school leases. These matters are the concern of the school patron, to whom a board of management is subordinate and from whom it derives its authority.  I do not have details of how the patrons came to be appointed in the first instance.  It is a more general question which can be returned to later.</P>
      <P>The Rules for National Schools empower the patron to manage a school personally or to delegate the management. While his authority is not absolute, ownership and control of national schools are effectively vested in the office of the patron and he is liable ultimately for the financial and managerial obligations of the board.</P>
      <P>In the vast majority of schools, the Ordinary of the diocese is patron.  The fact that he has many schools in his charge confers a co-ordinating role on a patron who has to have regard to the overall situation in an area.  Of particular significance is the responsibility of the patron for providing the local contribution towards capital expenses of a school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the patron at the moment.  It follows that the initiative for new school buildings must come from the patron or his agent acting at his behest; it certainly cannot come from any other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins has adverted to the fact that Scoil Iognáid is classified as an All-Irish school.  Schools in this category enjoy special advantages which were introduced to encourage demand for education through Irish in accordance with the Government's commitment, expressed in the Programme for Action in Education 1984-87, to the greater use of the Irish language and the continued strengthening of its position within the educational system.  Among these special advantages is the willingness of the State to purchase sites for and to fully finance the provision of All-Irish schools.  An <Col N="387" /> additional teacher, over and above the number which would normally be warranted by the number of pupils, is sanctioned for these schools.  Their teachers receive a special allowance for teaching through Irish.  The schools attract an additional 50 per cent of the capitation grant.  Free transport is provided on certain conditions to the nearest All-Irish school for children who wish to go there.</P>
    <P>The success of these incentives, which have been policy of successive Governments, can be seen in the establishment of 37 All-Irish primary schools since 1971.  There are now 47 such schools in fifteen counties outside the Gaeltacht area.  An objective of the Bord na Gaeilge Action Plan for Irish, which was published in 1983, was the foundation of two of these schools per year.  The House will be interested to hear that eight such schools were set up in 1984 and seven in 1985, which is an indication of the increasing demand for education through Irish.  While the incentives which I have enumerated undoubtedly played their part, I would like to believe that they were not the sole motivators of this demand, that education through Irish is in itself proving an attractive proposition and that the momentum of recent years will be sustained.</P>
    <P>To turn from the general to the particular, Scoil Iognáid was part of this recent growth and came into being as an all-Irish school in 1971.  A new school building was completed in 1983 which was to provide accommodation for 380 pupils in 12 classrooms.  The area of site available restricted the building to this size.  Such has been the demand for education through Irish that the enrolment figure of 380 has been exceeded and I have been given to understand that the potential pupil numbers are sufficient to support a 16-room school.</P>
    <P>There are 14 teachers on the staff, and prefabricated rooms that were on the site before the new school was built have been pressed into service.  The board of management now wish to appoint a fifteenth teacher and the school has had the necessary enrolment of 450 pupils <Col N="388" /> for some time.  However, the patron has expressed reservations on the questions of increasing the enrolment and expanding the premises of the school beyond its present capacity because of the likely adverse effect this would have on other schools in the city where pupil numbers are declining and teachers losing posts. At present there are a number of such schools with vacant classrooms and there is expectation of the situation worsening.</P>
    <P>Although grants of 100 per cent are available towards capital costs, and premises that are grant-aided to that extent come into State ownership, the administrative structure for the provision or expansion of accommodation for all-Irish schools is the same as it is for ordinary schools.  An application must be on the initiative of the patron or, at least, enjoy his support The plan suggested for the school was subject to the patron's approval. There can be no question of my Department entertaining an application for a building grant that was not fully endorsed by the patron for the reasons I have sought to clarify in my description of the place of the patron.</P>
    <P>The position has been fully explained to both the board of management and to the patron.  The suggestion has been made by representatives of the board of management that the appointment of extra teachers proceed and that they be housed in the prefabricated buildings which are available to the school and to which I have already referred.  It is not that simple.  Prefabricated buildings are for temporary short-term use.  Therefore, approval for the further development of Scoil Iognáid in temporary buildings implies a commitment on my part to grant aid their replacement by permanent buildings in due course.  This would place me in a very invidious position in relation to all parties.</P>
    <P>To sum up, in the terms in which Senator Higgins has put his motion, while I am of course anxious that they be resolved, the particular difficulties that have arisen are not amenable to ulilateral resolution by me.  Pending a settlement on the lines I have indicated, I regret I am not in a position to authorise the appointment <Col N="389" /> of extra permanent staff at Scoil Iognáid or the enlargement of the school premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister, but I would ask him if he would perhaps have sent to me a statement as to the constitutionality of what he has described.  The patron does not exist in the Constitution.  It seems to me that the <Col N="390" /> ministerial responsibility has been seriously affected by the answer.  I am saying this so that we will be able to examine other cases.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 11 June 1986.</P>
