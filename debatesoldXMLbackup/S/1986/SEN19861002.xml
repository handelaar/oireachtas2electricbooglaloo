      <P>The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a statutory system of controlling clinical trials which involve the testing on individuals of drugs or other substances to establish whether they may have a medical or harmful effect.</P>
      <P>I accept that most people agree with the concept and the principle of statutory control in this area. However, it would appear that many eminent people in the medical field have grave reservations about the scope and content of the Bill. The view has been expressed that if enacted it will have a serious detrimental effect on medical care and research. I believe that in the preparation of the Bill the Minister should have had greater regard to the submissions made to him by the Royal College of Physicians and by the Medical Research Council. I would be interested to hear how much consultation the Minister had with the National Drugs Advisory Board during the course of the preparation of the Bill or what was the input of that board into the Bill.</P>
      <P>In regard to the section dealing with insurance, had the Minister any consultation with the insurance industry regarding the availability and the cost of the insurance cover which is specified in that section?</P>
      <P>The objective of any Bill to provide statutory control of clinical trials should be to safeguard to the maximum extent the health and rights of those participating in such trials without at the same time limiting the opportunities for medical research and the development of the pharmaceutical industry here. That is the criterion on which we must examine this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of medical research has always been, and will always be, to develop and to provide more effective <Col N="102" /> and safer drugs and medicines. The need for the involvement of human volunteers in biomedical research is sometimes questioned but the vast majority of people accept unreservedly that trials involving humans are an integral and essential part of any such research. This is the case irrespective of whether the development involves new drugs or drugs which have been on the market for many years. In Ireland, as in most other countries, detailed information in relation to results obtained from clinical trials must be submitted for assessment and evaluation before any drug or medicine can be placed on the market. In Ireland this assessment and evaluation is carried out by the National Drugs Advisory Board. Those who say that clinical trials involving human volunteers should not be allowed in Ireland are, in effect, opposing the development of biomedical research here and are, indeed, opposing the development of the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>Although there is no statutory control of clinical trials in Ireland at present I understand that voluntary procedures are followed which are in line with internationally accepted principles. The two main clinical pharmacology units which are in operation here have independent ethics committees which are constituted in accordance with internationally accepted guidelines and consist of eminent and distinguished personnel. All studies and trials undertaken in these units are approved by these ethics committees and also by the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in future all clinical trials whether involving new or existing drugs will henceforth have to have the prior approval of the Minister for Health. The Minister, when introducing the Bill in the House before the summer recess stated:</P>
    <P>While formal approval will be a matter for the Minister, he will rely on the expert advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board in arriving at his decisions. It is the intention that all applications will be referred to the <Col N="103" /> board for assessment and for recommendations as to any conditions which should be attached to his approval.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to point out that the board had been operating an informal scheme of this nature on its own initiative for almost 20 years. However, there is no reference to the board in the Bill. In fact, so far as the bill is concerned, the role of the National Drugs Advisory board is completely ignored. Section 3 provides for the granting of permission by the Minister to a person to undertake the proposed clinical trial in accordance with whatever conditions he, the Minister, may specify. There is no obligation whatever on the Minister to refer the application to the National Drugs Advisory Board. The section outlines the three conditions which must be satisfied and then goes on to state that the Minister shall, as soon as practicable, grant or refuse permission for the proposed clinical trials. &ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; could be several months, or even years, after the application is made.</P>
    <P>In view of the new procedures laid down in sections 2 and 3 in relation to the submission and processing of applications for clinical trials, and because of the provision which enables the Minister to request additional information, it is inevitable that there will be delays and, in some cases, very long delays before decisions are issued. Such delays &mdash; I believe they are inevitable &mdash; will undoubtedly result in a considerable reduction in clinical research involving drugs in Ireland. If we are to ensure that the length of such delays is reduced it is essential to have in the section a fixed period during which the Minister will have to make a decision in relation to applications submitted to him.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 would be more satisfactory if they provided that the Minister would act on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board, if the authority of the board was increased and if all applications to undertake clinical trials were to be submitted directly to the board rather than to the Minister. This course <Col N="104" /> would involve providing the board with more resources and more personnel but it would be much more satisfactory than the procedure which is outlined in the sections concerned. It would also be a more sensible approach than the procedure outlined in the Bill because it would appear that the Department of Health do not have the necessary expertise to judge complicated research protocols and the various aspects of medical research. I understand that the position at the moment is that the National Drugs Advisory Board are the only competent independent body in this country who have such expertise.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, since the members of the National Drugs Advisory Board are appointed by the Minister on the basis of their specialist knowledge and expertise it is regrettable that the Minister has not sufficient confidence in the board to give them a statutory role in relation to the decision-making procedures contained in the Bill. It is generally felt also that the scope of this Bill should be restricted to clinical trials involving new or unlicensed drugs but, as published, the Bill encompasses all aspects of medical research including nutritional studies, investigation of new drugs and any further studies on drugs already licensed for clinical use in Ireland. In my view it would be reasonable to have some distinction drawn between trials involving new drugs and trials involving existing drugs. Perhaps in the case of new drugs it is desirable that the Minister should be the final arbiter of whether a particular trial should be permitted but in the case of trials involving established drugs it is nothing more than a bureaucratic procedure which will result in unnecessary expense and avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unclear as regards the conduct of clinical pharmacology practical classes on medical and dental students. It is possible that such practical classes will in future have to be approved by a local ethics committee and permitted by the Minister. It has been stated that practical classes will be exempt but this point needs to be clarified even further. I should also have mentioned that under <Col N="105" /> section 3 there is no obligation on the Minister to give the reasons for a refusal of permission for a proposed clinical trial and there is no provision for an appeal against the Minister's decision. In every case where a trial is approved by the ethics committee and where the Minister refuses to grant permission for the proposed trial the reasons for the refusal should be stated. Furthermore, some appeal mechanism should have been devised and incorporated in the Bill. There should be a right of appeal also against a decision of the Minister taken under section 6 of the Bill. This section enables the Minister to revoke at any time a permission granted to undertake a clinical trial if he is of the opinion that:</P>
    <P>(a) the trial or any part thereof is being conducted in a manner which is not in accordance with the permission, or</P>
    <P>(b) for any other reason, the trial should not continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be obliged to state the reason for every decision taken to revoke a permission under this section and the appeal mechanism which I have already suggested should be available for appeals under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill requires that there shall be an ethics committee to consider and report on the justification for each clinical trial before it commences. The Minister, referring to the role of ethics committees when introducing the Bill stated that ethics committees have a key role to play in deciding on the legitimacy of proposals for clinical trials and in the supervision of the manner in which such trials are carried out. The Minister went on to state that he was sure that all involved in the conduct of clinical trials would accept that the public have a right to feel satisfied, not only in regard to competence but also the independence of these committees.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill stipulates that it is the person who wishes to perform the trial who will be required to nominate the members of the ethics committee. Furthermore, the Minister may at any <Col N="106" /> time approve of a change in the composition of the ethics committee at the request of the applicant. I wonder will the public accept the independence of an ethics committee constituted in this manner. Would it not be more acceptable if the members of the ethics committee were to be nominated by the health board, the hospital board or the university within whose jurisdiction the trial is being carried out? I understand that the position at the moment is that there are internationally accepted guidelines governing ethics committees and that these guidelines cover the objectives, membership, responsibilities, operation and role of ethics committees. It is also desirable that such committees should be representative of community as well as medical interests, if they are to command public confidence. They will not command public confidence irrespective of the standing or competence of the members unless they are seen to be independent of the person carrying out the trial. Before the Minister makes his decision in relation to an application to undertake a clinical trial it is a condition that the ethics committee for the proposed clinical trial must have given their approval. Even though the ethics committee approval has been given, the Minister may still refuse permission for the trial without giving his reasons for doing so. If this were to happen with any degree of frequency, public confidence in ethics committees constituted and operating in accordance with the provisions of the Bill would be very quickly undermined.</P>
    <P>In considering the circumstances under which a proposed clinical trial is to be conducted the ethics committee are obliged under section 7 to have regard to a variety of matters, including the criteria to be used for the selection of participants, the nature and extent of the medical examinations which the participants will be required to undergo before, during and after the trial and the payments which will be made to the participants for taking part in the trial.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that each participant's <Col N="107" /> written consent must be obtained and that this consent may be withdrawn at any time. These two sections provide comprehensive safeguards for the rights and welfare of participants. However, participants, in addition to being given a comprehensive verbal outline of what is involved in the trial should also be provided with a written summary of the same information, together with the consent form which is to be signed. This written summary of the information and the consent form is to be provided to the participants at least 24 hours before the commencement of the trial. This would eliminate the possibility of an allegation afterwards that some material matter in relation to the trial was not revealed to the participant or that adequate opportunity was not given to the participant to study the wording of the consent form.</P>
    <P>The question of volunteer selection and payment will always be controversial and it is not possible to frame legislation which would eliminate controversy in these areas. At the moment it is alleged that the majority of clinical trial participants come from groups who could be said to be either socially or economically disadvantaged, such as students or the unemployed. I accept that this is the case and that it will continue to be the position, since I know of few other categories of people whose lifestyles or work arrangements would enable them to make themselves available for clinical trials which in some cases last for anything up to five or six weeks. As regards payment to participants, it is sometimes alleged that payments are so low that the volunteers involved are being exploited and that advantage is being taken of their economic circumstances. On the other hand, there are those who argue that the payments involved are so high as to represent an unfair inducement and that vulnerable individuals are influenced to participate in clinical trials by the level of the payments offered.</P>
    <P>There will always be those who will argue that there should not be any payments at all on the basis that volunteers <Col N="108" /> should take part in clinical trials in the interest of medical science and not for financial gain. We have to be realistic and acknowledge that this simply does not happen and that volunteers are entitled to receive a reasonable level of recompense for their participation in and co-operation in the trials in which they participate.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (1) of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>A person shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial, or</P>
    <P>(b) conduct a clinical trial, or</P>
    <P>(c) administer any substance or preparation for the purpose of a clinical trial,</P>
    <P>unless there is in force a policy of insurance, issued by an authorised insurer, sufficient to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of the trial, and a copy of the policy of insurance has been supplied to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is most unlikely that many insurance companies will be interested in offering the type of insurance cover envisaged in the Bill. Where such cover is available the cost is very likely to be most prohibitive and will undoubtedly be a dis-incentive to the carrying out of clinical research in the country. The likelihood is that the requirements of this section will put an end to the clinical research which is carried out in many small units throughout the country. I would not have any objection to this section if it provided that product liability insurance and insurance covering negligence in relation to the conduct of clinical trials should be in force. However, the section provides for no-fault insurance. If the product being tested conforms to all required standards and there is no negligence on the part of those conducting the trial, it is unreasonable to suggest that there is any liability on the part of such persons if something completely unforeseen happens. I understand that in other EC countries a no-fault system of <i>ex gratia</i> payments operates in the event of an accident. This <Col N="109" /> would be a more satisfactory arrangement as far as Ireland is concerned that that provided for in the Bill. It would not put medical research in this country at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> similar research elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the wording &ldquo;adequate funds&rdquo; is used in the subsection. Who will determine what are adequate funds for the purpose of this Bill? Sections 13 and 14 deal with offences under the Bill and the penalties for such offences. From reading these sections it appears to me that persons charged with such offences will be presumed guilty until they prove themselves innocent. I would be much happier with these sections if they were based on the principle of being innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the fees payable in respect of applications made under the proposed Act as well as other charges considered appropriate by the Minister for Health. The explanatory memorandum states that it is intended that the level of fees and charges will be such as to cover the costs of the scheme. However, there is nothing to prevent the Minister from using this section as a revenue raising mechanism in order to extract revenue from the pharmaceutical industry. This could have detrimental implications for the development of the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I see this Bill in its present form as one which will result in unnecessary bureaucratic delays and restrictions. I believe it will impede medical research and medical progress and will hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, it will not provide any greater safeguards for the volunteers who participate in clinical trials than those which exist at the moment or which could be provided on a statutory basis by means of a Bill which would make obligatory the procedures which are being voluntarily followed at present. There could also be a licensing mechanism incorporated in such a Bill for all units whether industrial or nonindustrial <Col N="110" /> in which clinical trials are carried out. This would be a more acceptable and a more satisfactory approach towards dealing with this matter. It would provide for greater flexibility than this Bill will allow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to welcome the Minister's initiative in introducing this Bill which will give effective control to clinical trials. I also want to thank him for initiating it in this House where I am quite sure&mdash;and I know the Minister will be convinced&mdash;that the legislation will be debated thoroughly between now and on all stages. The Minister will agree that any legislation brought in here will not alone benefit from being brought in here but is also subject to improvement. That is the purpose of this House. Judging by the Minister's past record in this House I know he will be receptive to ideas and, indeed, willing to accept amendments where he is satisfied they will improve the Bill and achieve what all of us want to achieve in the area of drug testing.</P>
      <P>At the outside I accept that there may be defects in sections of the Bill which can be tidied up on Committee Stage and other stages. Like Senator Robinson I want to be positive about it. I want to have a positive view of the Bill because I understand and accept the need for such legislation. That is the proper way to approach it rather than to be negative like Senator Fallon or, indeed, Senator Burke who suggested that the Bill should be scrapped or withdrawn. The vast majority of the people accept this legislation as absolutely vital, having regard to the tragedies which have occurred in this area because of the lack of proper control whether by the industry or by those involved in coaxing people to subject themselves to drug testing. Reflecting on the Bill in this light I have to have regard to the Minister's opening speech last April on the Second Stage of this Bill. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in Ireland, there is no provision in existing legislation for a statutory scheme to control the conducting <Col N="111" /> of clinical trials and there has, for some time, been grave public disquiet about the absence of such statutory controls. The current arrangements for the clearance of submissions for trials through the National Drugs Advisory Board have been in existence for a number of years and are in line with internationally accepted principles. However, they fall short of those required by virtue of the fact that they are carried out on a voluntary and informal basis.</P>
    <P>That shows that we realise there is an existing procedure which is dealt with by the National Drugs Advisory Board. At this juncture I want to pay tribute to them for the work they have been doing in this field. It is done on a voluntary and informal basis. This subject is so serious that no Minister with responsibility for the health of the nation and the health of people who subject themselves for trials in drug testing can ignore the fact that anything done on a voluntary or informal basis is not sufficient. I want to see legislation which will cover all the aspects outlined in this Bill and in the whole area of new drugs, existing drugs which have had a change of use and the people who subject themselves to trials. In the Minister's opening statement he set down the need for legislation in this area. I will balance that with a submission I have received from one of the vested interests in this area, an existing company involved in drug testing. I quote from a submission they made to me under the heading &ldquo;General Observations on Clinical Trials&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It is accepted that clinical trials involving existing or proposed new drugs should be controlled in a manner designed to ensure the highest standards of clinical practice and the maximum safety and welfare of participating subjects. The purpose of the proposed Act is apparently to guarantee comprehensive control of such trials by a statutory scheme. While many of the safeguards embodied in the proposed new legislation must be <Col N="112" /> endorsed by all responsible centres and individuals involved in such studies, it is arguable that a system of control other than an Act of the Oireachtas could achieve the same results more effectively and more economically.</P>
    <P>That is from one of the companies directly involved in this field every day. They admit it is necessary to have the kind of controls the Minister has outlined in the Bill. The only reservation they have is that they feel it should not be done by legislation. As a legislator I want to defend the right of democratically elected people to legislate in an area where the common good is at stake. Any vested interest which does not accept that legislation is the correct way to do it must be ignoring our statutory obligation. Having regard to all the views I have received on this matter, the area is so serious and the Minister's responsibilities are so great that legislation must control it. Otherwise, when something goes wrong where does one turn to? Where does anybody turn to except to the law? You can talk about common law and anything else you like, but in the area of common law there are many grey areas particularly in regard to people subjecting themselves for testing, the end result of which is a drug being patented and marketed.</P>
    <P>Some time ago drugs which were internationally accepted, patented and tested later created problems for unborn infants and had devastating effects on families throughout the western world. The tests were carried out in accordance with internationally accepted standards at that time. Some governments abdictated their responsibility in that area because there was no law to govern it. It was then left to independent inquiries and <i>ex gratia</i> payments were made in tragic circumstances throughout the world. I do not think that is the way to go forward. Any responsible pharmaceutical company will recognise that it is necessary to have some control over the area of testing of their drugs.</P>
    <P>The company I quoted went on to say that, despite the wealth of preliminary <Col N="113" /> data that may be generated from laboratory, animal and cell receptive studies, there is no alternative to final evaluation in human volunteers of the efficacy and safety of a new drug or any improved method for administering existing medications. Indeed, it is a virtually worldwide regulatory requirement that such confirmatory human studies should be performed before any new drug or improved dosage form of an existing medication is made available to the medical or dental professions for routine therapy. It is furthermore becoming evident that standard studies in Ireland in the healthy adult male volunteers may not always be sufficient to establish the safety and efficacy of certain medications in special patient groups. The known variations of response to therapy in geriatric patients, for example, indicate the need for validation of such therapy in carefully controlled studies in elderly volunteers. That is the industry's response to the Minister's Bill. They recognise that it needs to be done. They suggest that the law may not be the way to do it &mdash; I contend it is the correct way&mdash;but they also recognise that humans will have to subject themselves to drug testing and that as of now they need older people&mdash; they even refer to them as geriatrics&mdash; who will have to subject themselves to various levels of testing before we can move further in the whole area of drug testing.</P>
    <P>I have to balance what the industry said and what the Minister said regarding his concern in this area with the submission made to me by the Social Policy Action Group. Let us be absolutely clear that the Minister has a vested interest on behalf of the public at large, on behalf of the consumer, on behalf of the patients' care and on behalf of the people who submit themselves for tests. The industry have a vested interest in making a profit, in good drugs, in getting on the marketplace with them and being able to satisfy themselves, their laboratory technicians and all the experts that the drugs they market are of benefit to the nation. That is a vested interest. But the Social Policy Action Group who have made a submission <Col N="114" /> to me have no vested interest whatsoever. Their sole concern is for the genuine well-being of volunteers. It has been said and confirmed by Senator Mullooly that some of these volunteers are in the socially deprived areas. They are subject to demands made on them by society. They may be dependent on some substance or other, whether it is alcohol or other drugs. Their dependency on that drug allows them to be coaxed into offering themselves for drug testing.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the whole area of the provision and marketing of new drugs it is important and acceptable that we must have the human factor. We cannot always depend on drug testing which has been carried out on animals no matter how close the species of animal might be to the human. The only way we and the industry can be satisfied that the drug is safe is to use it in a limited form on human beings. I accept that that is a necessary part of the process of drug testing. I am not condemning it in one way or another. I know that people who are socially deprived can be coaxed into allowing themselves to be used for monetary gain with ulterior motives on their part. We could be into an area that does not create an awareness that some people have been subjected to trials which they may not necessarily have gone into with a free and open mind.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I put on the record of this House some of the experiences the Social Policy Action Group have had in their research. In commenting on the Bill as a whole, they believe some sections are deficient. I am sure the Minister will comment on these in his reply to the Second Stage debate. They say section 7 does not require ethics committees to be independent of those conducting the clinical trials. Senator Mullooly gave his opinion on that. My opinion is that ethics committees must be seen by everybody to be independent. Nobody is casting any reflections on the professional expertise of people on ethics committees, but those who nominate them can at least be questioned. If I have a drug I want subjected to a test and I nominate professional people to sit on an ethics <Col N="115" /> committee to filter through the application for drug testing, certainly that leaves a question mark. I have complete and utter confidence in professional people who are on ethics committees at present. I have no qualms or conscience whatsoever about the Minister appointing ethics committees because the only vested interest the Minister has is to ensure that they are truly independent and not subjected to pressures from any quarter. If there is any doubt whatsoever about their independence, and the Minister needs to convince the Social Policy Action Group of their independence, section 7 should be strengthened to ensure that any committees that are formed are truly independent of both the industry and all other sections with a vested interest.</P>
    <P>They feel that section 8, the informed consent section, is crucial. It is crucial. As I will outline with some of the case histories submitted to me, it is questionable whether some of these people at present being subjected to drug testing are capable of giving an informed consent. On what grounds are they asked to sign something? If it is read to them quickly, do they understand the consequences? That is why the independence of the ethics committee and the regularisation of the type of people who subject themselves to drug testing are so crucial. They are of absolute cardinal importance for people who, for monetary compensation or in the interests of the advancement of medicine are prepared to subject themselves to drug testing. Many medical students do that in the belief that what they are doing is right. I have no doubt that they are quite capable of making that decision, but people in a socially deprived class probably would not be able to make a judgment about the safety or otherwise of the procedures to be followed.</P>
    <P>It is said in that section that groups who are particularly vulnerable, such as illiterate people, old people, geriatric patients and psychiatric patients, need additional safeguards which they feel that this Bill does not currently give. If that is <Col N="116" /> true &mdash; and the Minister will in his reply outline whether it is true &mdash; this is a case to be looked at. It behoves all of us as legislators to ensure that sections are strong enough to give the kind of control that we need in these areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, they say that the question of financial or material inducements in relation to clinical trials is not dealt with in the Bill. I quote: &ldquo;Because of difficult circumstances many people who would not otherwise be involved are either recruiting for or participating in clinical trials. We believe the Bill should take account of these socially disadvantaged people and their situation for disallowing inducements.&rdquo; Any of us who knows anything at all about drug testing &mdash; and some of us have more of an interest in that area than others &mdash; realise that there would have to be some level of compensation and that it would have to be balanced in such a way that will not persuade genuine people from being involved and will not take advantage of socially deprived sections who will do it for ulterior motives.</P>
    <P>The Social Policy Action Group produced a couple of case histories which I think are worth putting on the record of the House because by way of building in our minds a picture of case histories of the socially deprived people who are vulnerable to the industry and without whom at the moment the industry admit they could not carry on. It would be questionable whether people who are dependent on other drugs are suitable to be involved in ordinary drug testing for a whole different purpose. Surely anybody who knows anything about the industry will know that if people are already addicted to a particular drug and allow themselves to be subjected to drug testing for another drug, antibiotic or otherwise, the results could not be depended on. In one of their profiles&mdash;they are using pseudonyms here &mdash; they refer to a man called Tony who for 12 years has been, they say, &ldquo;a person whose experience of life is typical of many people who are repeatedly involved in the drug testing industry&rdquo;. They say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> His life has been a passage from one institution to another&mdash;orphanage, foster home, orphanage again, the Army, St. Patrick's Prison, Mountjoy Prison and hostels in Ireland and Britain. He is now living in a hostel for homeless men in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Tony was recruited for drug testing by a fellow resident in a Dublin hostel. (The person who recruited him has been paid a fee for successfully finding another &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo;). Tony is paid £32.80 per week unemployment assistance by the Department of Social Welfare. Clearly this is insufficient to provide for his needs. The money he receives for submitting himself for drug testing is the only way he can provide for himself.</P>
    <P>He is regarded as unemployable by employers. His choices are to beg, to rob, or to give himself for drug testing. Society does not tolerate begging and along with robbing it is an offence. The only option is drug testing for which he is paid slightly more than the average wage, or four times as much as he receives on unemployment assistance. His job is testing drugs, but he does not choose this job. By depriving him of the means whereby he can live a healthy life we force him into this situation ...</P>
    <P>They question whether he is a volunteer.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>While partaking in drug trials Tony meets other people known to us&mdash; alcoholics, addicts, psychiatric patients, people living in fear of money lenders, social welfare recipients, young people from broken homes who need money for rent and clothing. None of these people are in any sense volunteers.</P>
    <P>That is why they are the concern of the social action group.</P>
    <P>They are desperate for money. Many of them could not possibly understand the complexities of consent forms.</P>
    <P>As a person whose relationship with <Col N="118" /> society has been almost totally through the medium of authoritarian institutions and marginalised peer groups, Tony's life has been determined by society's totally inadequate response to people who do not get a fair start in life. Our society now has a responsibility, at this late stage, to rescue Tony, and people like him from a highly dangerous and uncontrolled medical industry.</P>
    <P>I am quoting this because it could be a subject of discussion and argument in this House as to whether the industry as we know it is uncontrolled. Certainly, there are areas in the drug testing industry which we would question, but I am satisfied that with the National Drugs Advisory Board there is some control but it is on a voluntary basis, as the Minister said, and quite informal. The Social Policy Action Group go on to outline various other case histories like that but that is typical of the area we are worried about, people in the socially deprived area who find themselves being asked to submit themselves for drug testing and acquiesce because they need money for other reasons, with no commitment whatsoever to the advancement of science or otherwise.</P>
    <P>One of the final submissions I got was a headline from the <i>Irish Medical Times,</i> Volume 20, No. 20 of 16 May. The headline reads: &ldquo;RCPI says Clinical Trials Bill goes too far.&rdquo; The report continues:</P>
    <P>The new Clinical Trials Bill goes too far and is likely to impede medical progress in this country, according to the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The College issued its reaction to the Bill this week and is of the view that the legislation introduces many unnecessary obstacles to research. Despite the scope of the Bill, it does not provide any greater safeguards for participants than the proposals contained in the College's own report on clinical trials.</P>
    <P>The College is critical of the fact that the Bill encompasses more than just drug trials.</P>
    <P>In a statement it states that the Bill &ldquo;is seriously out of line with legislation <Col N="119" /> in Europe and North America and will severely impede medical progress in Ireland. As recommended in our report we feel that the Bill should only apply to studies involving the use of drugs which do not have a product licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ministerial approval will have to be sought for studies involving the administration of any &ldquo;substance&rdquo; or &ldquo;preparation&rdquo;, this could include studies of diet.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland did not read the Minister's speech because in his Second Stage Speech he referred to section 5, stating:</P>
    <P>In fact, the definition of clinical trial in section 5 excludes substances which are deemed not to have a medical or deleterious effect and under our current medicines licensing system we do not regard as a medicine, a vitamin or similar dietary constituent which is given at levels within the recommended daily allowance.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always an optimist. The Senator is not short of optimism himself. I am amazed that a group of professionals like the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland would tend to ignore a specific section which does, in fact, exclude drug testing on items like vitamins or other dietary constituents. It is specifically in the section. You can scare people. I presume general practitioners down the country who are very busy men read headlines like that and certainly do not go back and read the Bill. I have had many submissions made to me by the generic industry in particular. In Ireland, fortunately, we have a very live and active generic drug business with many Irish firms involved in the production of generic drugs, having done so successfully. Indeed they have proved by their success that they have saved the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Health, and health boards throughout the <Col N="120" /> country many millions of pounds because of the advancement of the generic drug industry.</P>
      <P>Generic drugs are drugs that have already been patented elsewhere by multinationals under patent names where patents have expired and the drug can be manufactured without the patent name applying to it. It is the same drug and is used for the same purpose. Anybody in the business of drugs and pharmaceuticals knows that antibiotics and all other drugs of that nature are commonly known by their generic drug name. Because of that the industry has blossomed and has saved the economy many millions of pounds. I do not want to decry the multinational drug patenting companies because they do excellent research in issuing new drugs on to the market and they put them through a system of drug testing which is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the problems created in this country in the drug industry are because of the reservations of people in the generic trade who felt when they first read the Bill that generic drugs already on the market would now be subjected to drug testing. I read the Bill in detail. My understanding is that generics already recognised and patented initially and accepted at certain dosage levels can continue to be used without further drug testing. It is only if the recommendations of their dosage level or their application were changed from the original accepted levels when the drug was patented that they are to be subjected to further drug testing. It is clear from the submission made to me by the industry that they accept that if a new recommendation is given of the dosage level or in regard to its use in other diseases in which it is not known to be effective they will be subjected to further trials. The industry accept that that is necessary and those involved in the generic business in my constituency also accept it. The Bill does not require drug testing in existing generic drugs if they are being used in the way for which they were originally designed and tested. I see nothing wrong with subjecting a drug to further testing <Col N="121" /> if its recommendations are changed because we have to balance all interests.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the industry should make submissions to us. They have made economic submissions because they employ so many people. They resent outside interference in their industry but when anything goes wrong or a life is lost who is responsible? Is it the Minister? Is it the Government? Have we a responsibility to society? Have we a a responsibility to underprivileged people? Should we ignore it and leave it to the drug industry? They have taken on to themselves certain responsibilities as well but this whole area is so complex that it needs legislation to control it and that is why I welcome the Minister's initiative. We all recognise that it is a Government Bill but if it suddenly becomes an unpopular or controversial Bill then it will be a Barry Desmond Bill. The Minister is used to that from previous experience. A Government decision which becomes unpopular becomes the Minister's decision. I know the Minister never shirks from his responsibilities and in this area he is confident enough to be able to convince the public that it is necessary to have legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I accept that we must have drug testing and new drugs. I noted Senator Burke's contribution last night when he said that a member of his family would have died if a new drug had not been administered. This legislation will not stop drugs because before a drug is administered to an acutely ill patient in hospital it must have already achieved a certain status of having passed certain safety tests. I do not know of any general practitioner who is involved in drug testing. They all use tested drugs. They may slightly increase the dosage but a general practitioner, particularly a medical professional person in hospital dealing with patients who were acutely ill would not be involved in the area of experimenting with drugs.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke said that the life of a member of his family was saved because there were no such restrictions on testing as those proposed in this Bill. I advance the argument that the opposite is probably <Col N="122" /> true. I unfortunately lost a member of my family because there was no drug to treat the disease and that is still the case in spite of millions being poured into research. We all have views on issues like this complicated by relating them to our own personal experiences. I accept that new drugs are vital and thank God there are people prepared to invest millions of pounds in new drugs where they know there is a need. I know there may be a profit motive but there is nothing wrong with that if society as a whole benefits. I am certain that society benefits from the continued issuing and testing of new drugs. We know how expensive this whole process can be but we are not talking about a pauper industry or an industry that cannot look after itself. We are talking about one of the financially biggest industries in the world, the pharmaceuticals. I am not unduly worried that restrictions like this might put additional costs on the multinational pharmaceutical drug industry as they can write them off against taxes. Patients are becoming immune to existing drugs, particularly antibiotics and it is imperative that drug testing should continue and that we should assist the process of new drugs in every way possible in a controlled way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned resistances to antibiotics &mdash; who can I blame in this area? I certainly cannot blame the patient because the patient benefits from professional advice. Who prescribes the drugs for a patient? Who over-prescribes drugs for a patient? Who prescribes drugs when they are unnecessary for patients, particularly in the area of antibiotics? What incentive is there under the GMS system to do that? The responsibility in the area of antibiotic immunities lies fairly and squarely with the medical or the veterinary professions because antibiotics have been pumped into animals and humans over the past 20 years with complete and utter disregard for the whole problem of immunity and the building of immunities in the use of drugs.</P>
    <P>I agree that common bacteria are <Col N="123" /> becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment simply because they were being used in animals initially which later became used as foodstuffs or in patients without proper bacteriological and sensitivity testing in laboratories. That is where the fault lies, not with the patients. We must depend on professional people's advice at all stages but it is important that the professions would know that those of us who have an interest in this area put a certain amount of responsibility on them also, not because the drugs are toxic in any way but if they are used without proper testing facilities in certain cases there will be immunities.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the principle of new drugs and drug testing and I am also in favour of the need for statutory control. I have a very broad view about how people should be compensated. But the whole area of ethics committees is vital to this legislation. We must ensure that participants know the implications of their role in drug testing and the risks involved. I refer to what has been suggested by Senators Fallon and Mullooly in the area of insurance for the industry. They seem to be concerned that this responsible industry in whose hands we put our lives and the lives of volunteers, is unable to indemnify itself against future claims. What are we talking about? Are we talking about an industry that can insure itself and is capable of it or an industry that is doing something which cannot be insured against?</P>
    <P>If that is what they are doing it is time we took effective legislative control because there is no way we can allow any group to carry on testing or experimenting at a level at which the normal insurance factor is taken out. Senator Fallon is an expert on insurance and I respect his views, but I hope he is not suggesting for one moment that because the industry would have difficulty in proving that what they are at is a risk, people should subject themselves to that risk with no cover with the attitude that they will get something if something goes wrong. This <i>ad-hoc ex-gratia</i> payment is not good enough for people who allow <Col N="124" /> themselves to be subjected to drug testing. I want to make sure that if somebody genuinely subjects themselves to drug testing and anything goes wrong it does not have to be negligence. If somebody administering the drug can be proved to have given it in the wrong manner, for example, given it subcutaneously instead of intravenously, that would be negligence and it would be easy enough to prove it. But we are talking about a substance which at the time the test is going on has not been cleared for safe use. Nobody is suggesting then that the Minister should say that he would not bother having cover for people in that area. This is what the whole thing is about. The industry must be able to satisfy an insurance company that some safety standards have been achieved by the drug and that they have not killed a whole lot of animals before they get to the human factor.</P>
    <P>I cannot see a problem about insurance cover unless what they are doing is uninsurable, and if that is the case they should not be doing it at all. One cannot wear four hats in this House and try to bend and weave around. One can if one is not going to be honest with oneself. Either what is being done is legitimate and there is a reasonable risk factor which is insurable to protect the underprivileged and the people who are subjecting themselves to testing, or it is not. Unless they can be protected and somebody will meet the case if something goes wrong, not by negligence or lack of knowledge or otherwise, but by the very fact that it is in an untested state with humans, then nobody should be subjecting themselves to drug testing because they are likely to lose their lives and have nobody to give them anything except an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment. Life is not like that. There is no <i>ex-gratia</i> payment for people knocked down on the road except where somebody is not insured and then the industry gets together to cover them.</P>
    <P>I am not worried about the insurance factor at all. If it is a risk it can be insured because insurance people are in the business of insuring for risks. I accept that drug testing must go on and that humans <Col N="125" /> will have to be available. I do not accept the submission that nobody should get anything because no testing would go on but there has to be a balance which has to be taken on board by the Minister. I do not accept that he will abdicate his responsibilities in this area. I know his commitments to this area and he has referred to the inducements that are being offered by way of payments to participants and he admits that it is a contentious one. We have all had representations about it.</P>
    <P>There are people who are in a category where they can be exploited. Nobody is suggesting that the industry is exploiting them. The industry is looking for volunteers. They use methods that can be interpreted as being close to exploitation. That is an area of argument. However, I am satisfied that the whole area of drug testing needs to be tidied up. Usually the drugs that are being tested in this country are already generic drugs which are being used for other purposes and whose dosage levels or prescription area has been widened. The industry go through the National Drugs Advisory Board on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis. That is good enough. I do not think the industry accepts that it is good enough. In a way they welcome the fact that we are doing it in a proper statutory way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the National Drugs Advisory Board feel that they were slighted in not being mentioned in the Bill. I would envisage that the new formula the Minister will set up may encompass some of the existing members of the National Drugs Advisory Board but they will be put together in a regular statutory recognised formal way and not an <i>ad-hoc</i>, informal way as it is at the moment. I have to pay tribute to their contribution in this area in the past. They only come into play when they are asked to by the industry. The industry submits to them certain data, certain facts and figures, blood levels and blood counts and then they take action. If the industry did not do that the National Drugs Advisory Board would never hear of a new recommendation for a drug, but they cannot be marketed without having gone through <Col N="126" /> that process.</P>
    <P>We are tidying up the area, and it is high time we did it. It is a pity that we had to have a loss of life before somebody took action but I am glad that the Government have seen fit to take action. I look forward to the Minister's response to this Second Stage debate. He will have a useful debate in this House and he will be able to make a judgment that in spite of the reservations many people have about sections of it, by the time we are finished debating it it will have been a useful piece of legislation that will benefit society as a whole and benefit people who take the drugs that will be tested and perfected. We will ensure that the underprivileged are not exploited in the process. We will ensure that the industry can survive and go on to greater things and have more approval for what they are doing and more acceptability for their product by consumers. At the end of the day what we have to protect is not the vested interests of any side, but the consumer, each one of us and our children and our children's children in the future and our relatives and friends who are subjecting themselves, in the interests of medical science, to drug testing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to the amendments which will overcome some of the problems that have been brought to our attention by various interest groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent we are circumscribed in our discussions in this area by the mystique with which the medical profession has cloaked itself and which all the professions wrap around themselves. My good friend, Senator Robb, has many times threatened to put down a series of motions to the effect that the legal profession is a conspiracy against the laity, that the medical profession is a conspiracy against the laity and that all professions are conspiracies against the laity. If one listens to the considerable amount of public debate about any area where &ldquo;experts&rdquo; are supposed to be involved one will find quite a remarkable degree of denigration of the whole idea of democratic accountability <Col N="127" /> because some will say after all, they are only TDs, Senators and so on, and what does the Minister know about medicine, he was never a doctor. That is the sort of thinking which at its core has a streak of something close to fascism, the idea that the public, society and the democratic process is somehow incompetent to deal with things because there are experts to deal with them. The worst thing we could have would be a society where people's professional expertise gave them the authority <i>per se,</i> without any accountability, to decide what was good for us in many areas. There is a lot to be said for democracy, there are a lot of deficiencies built into democracy but the process whereby ordinary people, to a greater or lesser extent, must be satisfied that a particular profession or a particular practice is operated in the interests of society and in a way which does not damage society is a very fundamental one and we should not apologise for it. When we are dealing with complex legislation I do not think Members should feel obliged to stand up and almost apologise for the fact that they are not lawyers, doctors or scientists.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of those who have professional expertise, and in my view it is a measure of their expertise, that they be able to make what they do comprehensible, understandable and, therefore, accountable to ordinary people. If they cannot make it comprehensible and intelligible to ordinary people they are not competent to do their job. It is part of the job of any professional to be accountable to ordinary people for what he does and to express himself or herself in language which is comprehensible to other people. It is the very nature of democracy. I am suspicious of any area of expertise in society being withdrawn because it is too complex, too difficult, or too technical and implicitly, therefore, the ordinary Joe Soap could not comprehend it. That effectively means that democracy cannot apply in all sorts of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in our society &mdash; Senator Ferris, the Minister and I at least agree <Col N="128" /> on this &mdash; a view that the whole area of the way the market and economics operate is too difficult and complex to be democratically accountable and, therefore, we will leave it to primitive brute market forces to determine how certain things are organised. That is the most widespread derogation of democracy in many of our societies and it goes through all of the professions. In a particular way the medical profession has cloaked itself in this mystique. Anybody who has been in hospital and witnessed the arrival of the consultant with a ritual and an obeisance that an Archbishop would not now expect will know the way in which this mystique is generated and preserved. We should not apologise to the medical profession for the fact that we, as Members of the democratically elected Houses of the Oireachtas, want to know, and to regulate, and insist on our right to regulate, the way any of these professions operate in their dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>However, there is no question but that drug testing is a necessary part of the development of medicine. There is no question either but that proper drug testing must incorporate tests which involve human beings. In the area where I have some professional competence there is too much evidence at this stage that, for instance, substances that are determined to be entirely non-toxic in animal tests turn out to have quite severe toxic affects on humans. There are substances, for instance, which have never been shown to be carcinogenic in animal tests which do turn out to be carcinogenic for humans. Consequently when one is talking about therapeutic drugs which are going to be used on people who are unwell one is, therefore, obviously going to have to do tests on humans. We do not have any disagreement in principle with that. On the other hand it is part of the mystique of medicine to pretend that it is the development of drugs and of medical science which has produced huge declines in things like infant mortality rates and declines in mortality rates generally.</P>
    <P>No less a person than the medical correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> a few years <Col N="129" /> ago pointed out that it was in fact a combination of good hygiene, good sanitation and clean water which was the major contributor to the extension of good health. In other words, it was recognition of the fact that hygiene, clean water and good sanitation did far more to improve the health of our community than medicine. That is not to denigrate the successes of medicine but it is to put it in perspective. In fact it was the decisions of society to actually invest large sums of the resources of each society in things like clean water, good sanitation and education in basic hygiene which contributed most to this. The medical profession had a part to play but they are not God nor are they substitutes for God nor have they any right to give the impression to a society that they have some sort of God given role in determining how a society conducts itself.</P>
    <P>Drugs testing is a necessary part of medicine. It was recognised in all the submissions we received that it is a necessary part of medical research but it is a difficult and dangerous part. When one adds in the inherent risks involved, and the inherent difficulties involved, the fact that drug testing on a large scale here is conducted by private profit-orientated organisations one has an extra dimension of the questionability involved. When one sees that at least in one case this development has resulted in the enrichment to multiple-millionaire status of the proprietor of one of these clinics, society has every reason to be concerned and every reason to feel that we have a right to know and to know in detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister is perfectly right in introducing the Bill. I have qualms and questions about various aspects of the Bill but I have no doubt but that I will unequivocally vote in favour of it on Second Stage and I look forward to a very interesting Committee Stage debate on the meanings of various phrases within the Bill.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator Ferris refer to that part of the Minister's speech where the Minister appeared to dismiss one of the major reservations of the medical professions, <Col N="130" /> that the Bill as it stands is all-embracing. I am in the position where I have vigorous domestic representations made to me about matters to do with the medical profession and therefore, I must be diplomatic in whom I choose to believe, in public at least, about these things. I will either have my wife or my brother descending upon me if I say that I believe the Minister and not them. I will simply say that I will suspend judgment but I do think that if the Bill is as the medical profession identified it, the point was well made. I do not think that there is any intention of extending a provision to deal with new untested drugs into other areas but there may be a case for rewriting some of the sections, regardless of whether the Minister believes it to be justified, to make perfectly clear what is intended, if for no other reason than to calm down what are, perhaps, unjustified fears.</P>
    <P>I remember in the course of the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill the then Minister for Justice felt obliged in order to allay fears on a number of occasions to add in phrases which he felt were unnecessary. I suggest to the Minister that, perhaps, in order to calm down some of the fears among the medical profession on this area, it might be worthwhile considering rewriting some of the phrases, even if he is satisfied that the fears are unjustified. It is a good idea and I do not need to give a professional politician lectures about what are good ideas to calm down people. It might be nice for the Minister on one occasion to calm down the medical profession for a while. By and large I think he is perfectly right not to calm them down but on this issue it might be no harm. I must point out that unlike most Members I need votes from the medical profession so I will have to be careful in what I say about them. Many of them are constituents of mine but they usually forgive me my excesses.</P>
    <P>I missed the Minister's introduction and I apologise to him for that; it was not through any disinterest, I just could not be here, but I would be interested to know why the National Drugs Advisory <Col N="131" /> Board is not referred to in the Bill? Anybody I talked to could not tell me why the NDAB is somehow separate from this.</P>
    <P>My sympathies for the fears of the medical profession are not held without severe qualification, particularly having read the leaflet produced by the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology. Under the heading, Medical Committee ICP, paragraph 3 they say:</P>
    <P>In addition, a large number of other doctors, consultants and general practitioners, assist ICP in the conduct of clinical studies in Ireland, Western Europe and the USA.</P>
    <P>That extends the area of clinical studies well beyond two premises and two places into the activities of large numbers, to quote themselves &ldquo;general practitioners and consultants&rdquo;. This apparent distinction that some people present to us between the buildings where things are done and the consultant or GP doing his ordinary GP practice is clearly not nearly as definite as some people in the medical profession would have us believe. There is clearly a case for regulating this sort of activity.</P>
    <P>Another area that I am familiar with in the area of psychiatry is the well advertised drug company functions where representatives of various pharmaceutical firms entertain virtually the entire medical staff of many psychiatric hospitals to quite extraordinarily expensive meals in the most extraordinarily expensive restaurants in most cities and towns, and then expect them to make dispassionate decisions about which drugs they should or should not prescribe when there are a range of drugs available. I do not attribute sanctity to myself or to the medical profession, and while they may feel it is unfair to suggest that there should be some regulation about how they use various drugs, it would be much easier to accept that it was only dispassionate professional judgment that was being exercised, if all of the medical profession as a group decided that these <Col N="132" /> drug company functions were an unacceptable attempt to influence professional decisions. I am not saying that good meals can actually influence doctors, I am simply saying that it would be far more difficult for the medical profession to convince the public that they take all these decisions entirely dispassionately, if there was any form of cosy relationship between themselves and those who are going to make a lot of money from the sale of the drugs.</P>
    <P>The principle of testing new drugs on human subjects is not in dispute. The question is how this should be done, by whom it should be done, on whom it should be done and how all of that should be regulated. There is justified public concern which came spectacularily to public attention with the regrettable death of Niall Rush. Following that, the public became aware of the fact that there were two multi-million pound drug testing units in operation here and many people including the people who &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo; for these tests began to wonder about the actual basis for these tests, the motivation for them and the way in which these tests were being carried out. There is a certain irony in the phraseology of section 7 (3) of the Bill in terms of ethics committees:</P>
    <P>The ethics committee shall not consider the proposed clinical trial justified unless they are satisfied that the risks to be incurred by participants would be commensurate with the objectives of the trial.</P>
    <P>That is perfectly correct phraseology, but when one considers the extent to which a large part of medical research today is devoted to devising drugs to counteract the diseases of affluence &mdash; heart disease, blood pressure and indeed the diseases of western society, particularly cancer &mdash; and when one considers the spectacle presented to the public, that most of the people who are being subjected to these tests are manifestly not part of affluent western society, there is a certain irony in assessing that &ldquo;the risks are commensurate with the objectives of the trial&rdquo;. Those who take the <Col N="133" /> risks are not those who benefit from the society which is creating the problem and probably will not benefit from the research. Therefore, society became justifiably concerned.</P>
    <P>Up to now society's concern has been allayed through the device of ethic committees. It would be preferable to have a national ethics committee dealing with this whole area than an ethics committee related to specific projects. We are a small country, we will have a limited amount of clinical testing going on and therefore it would be preferable to have national standards and an independent ethics committee appointed presumably by the Minister with absolutely no direct or indirect connection with the clinics. When one considers the risks involved, the area involved, and the additional problem of these clinics being profit-orientated, privately owned places which have identified a way of doing something which makes a lot of money, they must be carefully supervised and a detachment and lack of any overlap of interest must be clear to the public.</P>
    <P>This Bill and any amendments to it will have to be considered carefully to ensure that the ethics committees are not only independent but are clearly seen to be independent and my preference would be for a national ethics committee.</P>
    <P>We all accept that there is a need for these tests but a large part of the debate has centred on who should be subjected to the tests and on the concept of informed consent, that the people who accept the risks of taking these tests should be clearly seen to consent freely. We must not address this matter in terms of &ldquo;what would one do, if...&rdquo; What has been said to us over and over again is that if the unemployed or students were not allowed to have these tests done, then who would have them done? By &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; I presume we mean consent being freely given. I can have an informed consent, if I am to be executed tomorrow morning. I can be informed and give my consent because there is little else I can do about it. Real consent, implies a reasonable choice between reasonably acceptable alternatives. It is difficult to argue that <Col N="134" /> anybody on £34 a week is really in a position to give free, informed consent if they are offered&mdash;different people quote different figures and talk about it so differently it is almost impossible to know what is going on &mdash; somewhere in the region of £20 a day to submit themselves to tests. To my mind, people's freedom to choose is severely inhibited if that is the case. If people on limited incomes are those who are doing these tests, are we really in a position to say that they ever give free, informed consent?</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it is only relatively recently that one of these clinics got around to saying that people who could not read would not be accepted for tests. I have here a consent form for one of those clinics. It seems extremely impressive but there is the possibility that a person who is given this form is unemployed, poorly educated and cannot read and may find complicating such phraseology as that the drug was previously given to human volunteers and well tolerated, that it acts by blocking the change of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II, both of which occur naturally in the body and that to establish this it is necessary to give Angiotensin I and Angiotensin II by way of a catheter placed in an arm vein. I think I understand what that means but I am not deluded into believing that half the world understands what it means. I am even less prepared to believe that the average guest in a night shelter or hostel in Dublin or a large proportion of our unemployed&mdash;given their inadequate education &mdash; are in a position to understand what that means. I am even more convinced that if somebody cannot read it is very difficult for them to sign a form saying, &ldquo;I have read this and I understand what it means&rdquo;. I am satisfied that it is only recently that one of these clinics came to the view that if a person could not read, they could not have sufficient information to make a prejudgment about something like this. That leads me back to the conclusion that I have come to. I do not believe it is possible to give free consent if you are going to become a lot better off by virtue of becoming a <Col N="135" /> subject for these tests.</P>
    <P>That leads us on to the whole question of payment. I understand that the World Health Organisation specifically said in 1982&mdash;for this information I am quoting from a document supplied to me by the Social Policy Action Group, an extract from a contribution from Mary Banotti, MEP that the volunteers should be reimbursed for any loss of earning and for expenses, but that the amount of money should not be used as an incentive, since this would detract from the validity of the &ldquo;consent&rdquo; given. That is a perfectly reasonable view. The money should not be an incentive. If the person is living on £30 a week, £5 a day is an incentive. Even £1 a day is an incentive. The actual disposable income that somebody who is unemployed and living on his own has cannot be more than £5 or £6 a week when you take rent, electricity and basic food out of it. The actual spare cash that people have to do something with other than live on is very limited. Even £1 a day becomes an incentive.</P>
    <P>We also had denials that people were being paid to recruit people. This was a saga in itself. But apparently the clinic which was in the news has now accepted that people are paid to recruit people. I quote from the ICP's leaflet which was supplied to most Members of the Oireachtas. It states under the heading, Volunteer Recruitment:</P>
    <P>1. Recruitment in undertaken on a word-of-mouth basis, as it appears to be impossible to advertise for volunteers in this country.</P>
    <P>2. To enlarge the volunteer pool, a system of finders fees is undertaken intermittently.</P>
    <P>Given the fairly vigorous denials which emanated from that source for a long time that people were paid to recruit, it is interesting that they now mention in a publicity leaflet that finders' fees are undertaken intermittently. They try to blame society for this because they say if they were allowed to advertise they would not need to get involved in finders' <Col N="136" /> fees. But the consequences of advertising for something like this would be quite horrific.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation tells us that there should be no question of incentive involved, that people's reasonable expenses should be reimbursed. That, presumably, is the standard we all aspire to. Imagine my dismay when I got a letter from the other company in the country who are involved in clinical testing. Apart from a fairly vulgar threat that their plant would be closed down if this Bill in its present form is implemented they say:</P>
    <P>In addition, the approved recompense to subjects volunteering for essential studies in...</P>
    <P>this company's</P>
    <P>...Clinical Pharmacology Unit stimulates the local economy by increasing the disposable income of these individuals.</P>
    <P>In the course of the same letter, the company says that their guidelines for the conduct of these investigations not only conform to those proposed in the Bill but also fulfil the requirements of the most demanding regulatory authorities in the world.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I have evidence that the World Health Organisation says that there should not be incentives involved. But a company which is involved in this practice on a large scale tells us that the money they are paying their volunteers is enough to stimulate the local economy. If you are reimbursing expenses there is no net contribution to the local economy. That is quite clear because you are simply recompensing people for money they have lost and therefore there is no stimulation. One of the companies involved now tells us that they are actually paying people to do these tests to the extent that they are stimulating the local economy. In the next paragraph they tell us that they are working to the highest international standards. All of that increases my suspicion. That would be bad enough if they were simply taking in people and persuading <Col N="137" /> them to take time of work. But nobody is under any illusion any more&mdash;it was denied for a long time&mdash;that the vast majority of those who are subjected to these tests are unemployed people.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris said that nobody was suggesting that these companies are exploiting people. It all depends on your definition of exploitation. I am reminded of the European Court's decision that there was no torture being practised in Northern Ireland because those involved did not set out to torture people. It was something which escaped me at the time but they suggested something like that. You do not have to decide somewhere in your heart that you are going to exploit people in order to do so. You could be the most kind, charitable person in the world in your daily life, but if you choose to pay buttons to people who are working for you, you are exploiting them whether or not you realise it. Similarly, if companies base their drug testing regimes on the presumption that they can get large numbers of unemployed people to do their tests, working on the fact that these are the people who (a) are available and (b) need the money, that is exploitation. Those companies are exploiting people whether they have a guilty or a clear conscience about the matter. Given what the World Health Organisation has clearly said, that there should be no incentives of a cash kind to people to undergo these tests, then quite clearly&mdash; if we continue to tolerate the fact that most of those who undergo these tests do so because they need the money&mdash; exploitation is going on.</P>
    <P>The story is that you will not get anybody to do these tests if you do not pay them. At least that is logical, but it flies in the face of international guidelines about how these tests should be done. If people believe that we should pay people to do these tests then let us either say to the World Health Organisation that we are not going to operate or else let us accept that the tests cannot be done. But you cannot claim on the one hand that all these companies are operating to the highest international standards and at the same time say that people will have to be <Col N="138" /> given incentives of a cash kind to undergo these tests. There is a contradiction there and at the centre of the contradiction is the exploitation of people on very low incomes in Irish society.</P>
    <P>That exploitation must end. We will have to decide whether we are eliminating exploitation or simply trying to regulate it. Like violence, exploitation and slavery cannot be regulated. You either have them or you do not have them. There is no regulation of exploitation. The South Africans are trying to do it at present with spectacular failure on a large scale. We should not kid ourselves. We will either get rid of exploitation of people by eliminating any sort of inducements or payments which would induce people to do something they would not otherwise do or else we will get used to the fact that we are tolerating the exploitation of the poorest in our society in order to provide drugs which many of us, but not all, will benefit from. I accept that those Members of this House who have reason to be particularly grateful for the development of new drugs would feel particularly sensitive about that. It is not just those of us who have spectacular illnesses who have reason to be grateful. All of us in this House who have children, for instance, have seen the benefits of antibiotics where relatively minor ailments which 50 years ago would have been life threatening can be taken for granted and dealt with quite calmly. There is no fear and panic. I accept that we all benefit to some extent from these developments.</P>
    <P>What has surfaced in this whole issue as it has become public over the last number of years is that there is a sordid background to it. There is evidence of recruitment in hostels and night shelters. There is evidence of people recognising this as a source of easy money. I would like to quote from a long article in <i>The Sunday Press</i> dated 2 December 1984. It is about a murder case in Athlone. The gentleman does not deserve to have his name mentioned. He is guilty of no crime in the eyes of the law. The article states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;he heard of the &ldquo;soft money&rdquo; to be <Col N="139" /> made drug testing at the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology in Dublin... By mid-1983, he had completed around 12 separate courses at the Institute, earning fees ranging from £150 to £1,200 per course.</P>
    <P>He then heard about the other clinic, he went there and made more money. There is sufficient documented evidence at this stage that whatever the normal aspirations of these clinics, whatever good they have done, whatever the value they are to medical science and to the medical profession, whatever you want to say about all of that, they have been involved in dubious practises which are effectively, whatever their intent, exploitation of the poorest in our society.</P>
    <P>In many countries they will tell you, for instance, that you cannot run a blood transfusion service unless you pay people to give blood because they would say who would give blood if they were not getting paid for it. We have demonstrated in this country and many countries in Europe have done so that it is perfectly feasible to run a blood transfusion service on a free donation basis. It is equally possible if the same sort of public will, goodwill, understanding and belief that this is in the interests of the community and people's health generally can be got across to people, to run clinical tests on a true volunteer basis where people's legitimate expenses are recompensed. As long as the public are suspicious of what these clinics do and suspicious of their motives, you are going to have people wide open for exploitation. With 250,000 people unemployed the opportunities for exploitation are enormous. I would be interested to hear &mdash; perhaps, the Minister can tell me &mdash; what is done about drug trials in countries such as Switzerland, Austria and Sweden who have very low levels of unemployment. Switzerland has a well developed pharmaceutical industry. I would be interested to know if there is any clinical testing going on in Switzerland, for instance, which has a huge involvement in the international pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> In conclusion, we should not be too circumspect in our language. It is important to remember that international pharmaceutical companies who have contributed considerably to medical research have also made an enormous amount of money out of that contribution. They do not show the highest of ethical standards when drugs are identified as being of unacceptably high risk content in western society. They promptly shift those same drugs off to Third World countries to sell them there &mdash; drugs which are known to be too risky to be sold on the western market. There are many well documented cases of this taking place. While I do not want to get involved in a diatribe against the international pharmaceutical industry, we need to recognise that their own ethical record is not such as to suggest that they always meet the highest of standards. When you get involved in this interface between research and people and when you find people at that interface who desperately need money, who are poorly educated, whose comprehension is obviously going to be less than complete, you have the risk and the practice of exploitation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope we can talk at length on Committee Stage on the question of inducements and their abolition or, at least, their reduction to the level where they are no more than genuine expenses. By way of a query, if unemployed people are actually undergoing clinical tests for three or four weeks, as is suggested, have the Department of Social Welfare ever told one of those people that they were not available for work and, therefore, not entitled to their dole? People in much more innocent circumstances with far more innocent activities including working for voluntary organisations have suffered at the hands of the Department of Social Welfare because they were not &ldquo;available for work&rdquo;. How many of the vast number of unemployed people who go through these tests have ever been ruled to be non-available for work? Is it that the Department of Social Welfare do not <Col N="141" /> know or is it because of the level of lobbying and effectiveness and, perhaps, importance to the economy of these organisations that they do not say so? I welcome the Bill. I congratulate the Minister for it and look forward to an interesting debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, I would like to say that I am very pleased to be able to make a contribution on this Bill. Seldom have I received such an extent of apprehension in the medical world and the community to the contents of a Bill. That is not to suggest that there is not a great deal of need to get some statutory control into the area of clinical trials. That is appreciated by everybody. I share the need to move into the area of introducing statutory controls into clinical trials, not just clinical trials that have preoccupied some of the contributors to this debate, those which take place by drug companies, but even into clinical trials that take place quite regularly in hospitals as part of the treatment of patients.</P>
      <P>The need for this area of control arose in 1984 because of the sad death of Niall Rush in Dublin. I am quite satisfied that one death is enough to move on the need to bring in a statutory control of a suitable variety that will not cause apprehension to the medical world and the public. In other words, it is not the introduction of the controls that is on people's minds, it is the kind of introduction proposed in the Bill that has people so disturbed at present.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with a fairly sizeable inconsistency which exists between the published Bill and the explanatory memorandum. I have read the Bill. Section 3 states that where in relation to a proposal to arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial ... then the Minister shall as soon as practical</P>
      <P>(i) grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken in accordance with the application, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken in accordance with the application subject <Col N="142" /> to such modifications or conditions as he may specify, or</P>
    <P>(iii) refuse to grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>That seems to vest the decision in relation to an application for a clinical trial in the Minister. On the other hand, page 11 of the published report of the Minister's speech of 27 May 1986 &mdash; for which unfortunately I was not present as I was out of the country &mdash; says:</P>
    <P>While formal approval would be a matter for the Minister, he will rely on the expert advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board in arriving at his decisions. It is the intention that all applications will be referred to the board for assessment and for recommendations as to any conditions which would be attached to his approval.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board were set up, as I understand, about 25 years ago. I have a list here showing the eminence of the people who are members of that board at present, with Professor Kevin O'Malley as chairman. I do not understand why that body could not be given statutory control. They are the experts in this area. With all due respect to the Department of Health, even they must concede that the level of expertise in that Department &mdash; I am talking particularly about the professional staff of the Department of Health &mdash; and the experience of any of the professional staff in that Department in the area of clinical trials would be minuscule. I suggest that what is required here is for the Minister at the conclusion of this debate &mdash; and I among others will be awaiting that response &mdash; to undertake to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to change the whole structure of this Bill and give statutory control to the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the necessity for statutory controls. I say that not just because of the untimely death of Niall Rush two years ago but because of the concern I have &mdash; one that I am sure is shared by the Minister and a number of the contributors to this debate &mdash; for the <Col N="143" /> vulnerable in our society, people living in hostels and shelters of one kind or another who have been persuaded in the recent past to make themselves available as participants in clinical trials. People living like that are vulnerable because their income is small. They are vulnerable because they are persuaded that there is a great deal of safety in the trial that is taking place but perhaps there is less safety than they are able to understand. We need an assurance on their behalf. People who are vulnerable and in difficulties in our society should be protected and these trials should be conducted with attention paid to the most minuscule detail of how they give their consent and the extent to which the ethics committee monitor what is going on. The conduct of the whole trial must be up to a very high standard of efficiency and a caring attitude must be seen to emanate from the Department of Health and from the Oireachtas in relation to the protection of the participants.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the Eastern Health Board for 12 years and was Chairman of that board from 1978 to 1980 &mdash; not that long ago. I am currently a member and also a member of a number of voluntary hospitals in this city. Rather than getting involved in the details of the Bill, with which I might preoccupy myself with the Cathaoirleach's co-operation a little later in this debate, I kept to one central concern of mine. That is my concern as to why the National Drugs Advisory Board &mdash; although mentioned in his Second Stage speech by the Minister as being the referral agency he would use in approving clinical trials &mdash; are not made part and parcel of the Bill, included in the text of the Bill and given the statutory role of deciding on clinical trials. That, to me, is not much of a surprise.</P>
    <P>To be frank &mdash; and I hope the Minister will not take this in any personal way because it is not intended personally; it goes back to long before the Minister arrived in the Department of Health &mdash; there is an obsession in the Department of Health which is not to be seen in many other Departments. Certainly, in the <Col N="144" /> sister Department that runs from the Custom House &mdash; The Department of the Environment &mdash; quite a different attitude is taken to decentralising activity in the area of the environment. In regard to the health services there has been a grasping attitude in the Department and, presumably, the permanent Civil Service. They have taken an interest in regulating and controlling every possible activity of every possible subordinate agency involved in a hospital of any kind in this State in recent years. That has been happening over a period going back before this administration to the administration of Fianna Fáil Governments. It is a serious development which requires very serious examination by way of public debate.</P>
    <P>I do not say those words lightly. I am not saying them with a lack of knowledge of what I am talking about. I can instance reasons for mentioning them. My concern is not just about the centralising of all decision making in what must be a small Aireacht in the Department of Health, but about the dispiriting of staffs, medical and paramedical and other staffs, and those interested in the health services and the hospital system. Without public debate, in a most undemocratic way the Department have taken on far too much of a role in relation to the running of the health services.</P>
    <P>It is no great surprise to me that the National Drugs Advisory Board &mdash; who are the expert people in this area &mdash; were not mentioned in the Bill. They have been specifically excluded. We have in their place the Minister for Health or the permanent Civil Service who will deal with these things as they see fit, accept or not accept the recommendations of the National Drugs Advisory Board who, we understand from the Minister's Second Stage speech, will be asked in every case for their view. It is worth pointing out that in the drafting of the Bill there is no limit on how long the Minister can take to decide. There is no appeal procedure. There is a timeless zone which, when you think about it, is quite a worry because we are dealing with the need to produce drugs urgently for <Col N="145" /> the treatment of patients. If we require a time limit in relation to the processing of planning applications, I do not see why we cannot have a time limit in relation to the processing of applications for clinical trials.</P>
    <P>I said hard things a few minutes ago in relation to the Department of Health. Last year I approached the Taoiseach about the need for the establishment of a joint committee on health and social welfare which would do something about the absence of debate at a level of decision making that seems to be the case in relation to the health services. I am sure the Minister will tell me that he has eight statutory health boards. I know he has eight statutory health boards, I have been a member of one for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Unlike the intention in the 1970 Health Act, bit by bit every possible sanction since 1980, including minor capital works, must get the approval of the Department of Health insted of allocating a certain sum to the respective health boards, bearing in mind their needs and the size and extent of the activities for which they are responsible. We should leave it to them to disburse the money. I have some apprehension about what kind of restructuring is going on in the Department of Health as I heard that there will be a reduction from eight health boards to three. Perhaps that restructuring might involve the health boards having some role in relation to the voluntary hospitals, which is a very necessary step. The role at the moment is a direct role between the Department of Health and the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am also apprehensive about what may be going on in discussions with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. A lot of this movement has to do with cash and control of the financial purse of the Department of Health. We are living in a society where other people should be responsible besides the Minister and those who happen to be senior in the Department of Health. Those people could be encouraged by feeling that they are involved in decision making and that all decisions are not made for them which <Col N="146" /> seem to be the case at present, to an extent which is worrying.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this Bill that concern me and apprehension about the Bill is quite widespread. I have been told in the past couple of weeks that a study which was to take place in this country has gone to Belgium. There is apprehension at the level of the World Health Organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>There is no question about it. I can name my sources and am willing to do so but I had better get approval first. I will certainly be able to contribute that at a later stage in this debate. That is the information I have been given. The Minister went to some trouble towards the end of his Second Stage speech to mention a series of organisations who were consulted in relation to the Bill. I quote from column 16 of the Official Report, of 27 May 1986:</P>
      <P>Bodies consulted prior to the publication of the Bill included the National Drugs Advisory Board, the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, the Medical Research Council, the Irish Medical Organisation, the National Health Council and the Social Policy Action Group. I also considered carefully the statement published after the Bill was circulated by the Royal College of Physicians on the text of the Bill and I hope I will have reassured them in relation to a number of aspects on which they expressed concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that these organisations or many of them were written to by the Department of Health and asked for their views. Their views <Col N="147" /> were then looked at by way of the compilation of the Bill as published. I wonder to what extent the Minister or his officials from the Department saw fit to meet the principal organisations that might have a role in this area such as the National Drugs Advisory Board or the College of Physicians to get their views in advance of the publication of the Bill rather than going through an unnecessary and labourious debate which this obviously has to be, although I accept their reasons for the need for statutory control. We might have tested these areas a little bit more minutely than we did prior to the Bill being published.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that to add to the area of consultations I mentioned, a number of Fine Gael Senators who have been interested in this Bill asked the Leader of the House whether it was possible to meet the Minister in advance of today's debate &mdash; just in case he thinks we are saying things to him today because we are irritated with the Bill. The response we got from the Department of Health was zero. There was not a single response from the call from the secretary to the Leader of the House to the Department asking for a meeting with the Minister. I look forward to the Minister's response to the debate. I, with my colleagues, will reserve opposition on this Bill until we know where we are going and to what degree the Minister is prepared to amend a Bill which in principle is a very worthwhile and important step but which seems to have struck the wrong note in a number of areas and caused unnecessary apprehension to those involved in the area of medical research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I am very pleased that an attempt is being made to see that the ethics committee proposed in the Bill are given sufficient scope to be vigilant in ensuring that risks to the people partaking in the trials do not outweigh the objective of the trials. I know it is very tempting for any unfortunate down on his luck to take advantage of these trials, especially somebody who is <Col N="148" /> suffering from the disease involved in the trials, but they must be given every possible protection. The Minister has gone quite a distance in this regard. I do not believe that the ethics committee will be able to monitor the behaviour of all the drug companies. We have only to look back over the years to see some terrible abuses of drugs, not only in Germany but in the USA and other places. Because of this the ethics committee will be more on their guard than ever before to make sure that the public get the protection to which they are entitled. The Minister and his advisers have made a genuine attempt to protect this area.</P>
      <P>It is also encouraging to see the guidelines that will be drawn up for the information of applicants. This is very important because I would not like to see the Minister interfering too much. This matter is so delicate that one would not quibble with the Minister intervening. This is an area that is of vital importance to the health of the nation and it is necessary to show the public that everything is being done to protect people who might offer themselves for drug tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has control over the composition of these committees does not guarantee that one is not going to get a bum steer somewhere. There is no committee that does not have one or two duds or awkward people. That risk is there. Having said that, the guidelines in the Bill will give that measure of protection to people. Human beings are human beings. If a tyrant is emptying a bin and is shifted and made a director he will still be a tyrant. One can get caught in committees the same as everything else. If one brings a guy in he might go to great lengths to get his own way. To a great extent we must admit that the guidelines help to circumvent the effects of anything that might go wrong in the ethics committees. I am confident that everything possible will be done in this area and it is good to see that because the public have a right to make sure that these committees are not only independent but competent as well. There is no point in having them independent if they are not competent. Consequently, <Col N="149" /> this is a vital aspect to the Bill. The way the Bill is framed will help it to work towards the question of both the independence and the competence of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not relevant at this stage but it is very important because of the very nature of the Bill that we are not going ahead with Committee Stage today. This gives an opportunity to anybody who has any misgivings about this very delicate area to put down amendments and to have much more detailed discussion on Committee Stage. That is essential and for that reason I am pleased we are not rushing into Committee Stage today. We could be in serious trouble if we did so. In fairness to the Opposition, whether we agree or disagree it is of public interest. We are talking about the health of the nation and the drugs that can wreck our children. In the final analysis we have only to think back to the thalidomide problem to realise the gravity of this area. Consequently, every possible opportunity should be afforded to the Opposition or anybody else to put down an amendment. I am sure the Minister would welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way in regard to giving information to applicants for drug testing. I feel it will be comprehensive enough for them to be able to form a judgment for themselves as to whether the trial will be conducted properly. This can be of assistance not only to the public in general but also to the applicant.</P>
    <P>In section 8 the written consent of the applicant and his right to withdraw are important. Prior to this they had to give written consent. I am not quite sure about that, but I imagine that would be normal. But it is now written into the Bill that he would have to give written consent and would also have the right to withdraw from tests at any stage and that is a very good clause to have inserted. The Bill will give people who are unable to give written consent or do not understand the nature of consent a measure of protection. It is interesting to note that they will not always be used. If somebody cannot give written consent and does not <Col N="150" /> understand what is going on there would be a reluctance on the part of the people doing the trials to take those people in and that is a very desirable thing because many old people who left school at a very early age, while they may be able to read the <i>Evening Herald</i> or the <i>Evening Press</i> would not understand the full implications of what they were being asked to enter into. There is plenty of illiteracy even in this modern day of so-called free education. It is wonderful to see that somebody has looked at that and is making sure that nobody enters into something he is not fully competent to understand. I know the analogy is not great, but it is a pity a clause like that was not in some of the hire purchase Acts many years ago when people were taken to the wall.</P>
    <P>The question of the declaring of submissions is an interesting one. That has been in existence for years. I think what the Minister meant in his Second Reading speech was that the submissions fell short and that something much more effective will have to be done in regard to the question of submissions when we are talking about comprehensive control over the trials. I hope I have read that correctly.</P>
    <P>We have had media attention given to the death of that poor, unfortunate person. Even though it was a drastic thing to happen I do not believe the people who were conducting the trials at the time were incompetent. I believe it was just one of those things that happen. But we have to think in terms of the fact that we are talking about the involvement of humans. No matter how we go about it, it must prompt action and it has prompted action not only here but on the international scene. There is the question of principles. Once there is a death like that, one has to think seriously about the principles involved and whether in fact we were wrong all along not to have legislation to control the conducting of clinical drug trials. It was wrong because we had enough information about the disasters that happened years ago not only here but in other countries with regard to drugs clashing with other drugs. That is a very <Col N="151" /> serious area. The Council of Europe have ben working on formulating principles on medical research in man. This is interesting and I would like to see more research not only into drugs but into the motives of people who are subjecting themselves to these trials. I do not want to keep referring to the thalidomide tragedy. It was a quarter of a century ago. It is distressing to look at the people who are victims, those who are caught up in the scene. It is upsetting to look at a child who has lost limbs or is disfigured in some way. This whole messy thing has gone on for many years and the victims did not get what I would consider to be adequate compensation, justice or anything else. Of course no money would compensate a person if something went wrong.</P>
    <P>It is tremendously important that all aspects of clinical trials are covered in the legislation. I have no doubt that any reasonable amendments put forward by Members will be accepted by the Minister because he realises the gravity of the situation. Had time permitted I would have quoted an extract from a book I read some years ago about the abuse of drugs in the US. According to that book such abuse took place in institutions. It was frightening to read the disclosures in it. I do not know if the author was on the ball but he was not sued and I found that very interesting. This is a serious issue particularly when one considers the evidence of the harm that can be caused to people.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the year ended 31st December, 1985.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of making a speech on this topic but there are just a few comments I would make. This report of the Ombudsmen is welcome. I hope many Senators will comment on it. There are a couple of features of it that we should note. For example, the manner in which the report is written reflects at times a degree of colloquialism that one does not often find in a report such as this which is formally laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is an excellent thing. Perhaps it should not be carried too far, but it does recommend both the common sense of the individual who is the Ombudsman, whom we all knew for many years around this House, and it also reflects his aproach to his task. On that account, we have in the report a very clear reflection not only of what has been done but the manner in which the work has been carried out. In general, we can express satisfaction and I have pleasure in moving that we take note of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State for the Public Service I welcome the opportunity of discussing the second annual report of the Ombudsman. The report was presented to the Oireachtas on 25 March last. As Senators are all very well aware, the intervening period has been an extremely busy one for the House with the result that it has not, unfortunately, been possible to have the report discussed in the House until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> The existence of the Ombudsman helps to boost the confidence of the public in the institutions of the State. It puts a human face on bureaucracy and lets the ordinary individual know that he or she counts and that they are not just another statistic in the working of a large, faceless and uncaring machine. The public can be assured that there is an independent and impartial referee to whom they can refer complaints of unfair treatment and have them thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>By the same token, public servants have nothing to fear from the Ombudsman. His job is not to witch-hunt but to investigate and report on complaints to the Oireachtas. Later I will touch on the improvements that have occurred in the co-operation between public servants and the Ombudsman's office but at this point I see as my duty to continually remind public servants that I expect nothing short of willing, wholehearted co-operation with the Ombudsman. I direct these comments particularly to senior management who must at all times give to their staff the clear example of unequivocal co-operation with the Ombudsman and his staff.</P>
    <P>There was a considerable increase in the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman in his second year of operation; over 5,000 complaints were received compared with a little over 2,000 in 1984. The increase in the total number of complaints in 1985 was mainly due to the extension of his remit but I am glad that it also reflects an increasing awareness on the part of the general public of the usefulness of the service provided by the Ombudsman. If we compare the situation here with countries abroad, including Britain and France we can see that the Ombudsman function is used much more in Ireland than elsewhere. All of these factors clearly underline the need for the office in this country.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the remit of the Ombudsman was extended on 1 April 1985 to include health boards, local authorities, Telecom Éireann and An <Col N="154" /> Post. This increased the number of people employed in the bodies subject to investigation by the Ombudsman from 30,000 to 130,000 &mdash; an increase of over 300 per cent. Indeed, nearly half of all complaints under examination by the Ombudsman in 1985 were against the new bodies. I was interested to note that a fraction less than one-third of all complaints concerned the Department of Social Welfare; 10 per cent were received in respect of the Revenue Commissioners while all of the other Civil Service Departments attracted only 13 per cent of the total number of complaints on hands.</P>
    <P>The report identifies a number of major policy issues for consideration by Government and the Oireachtas. Some of these issues were originally highlighted in the Ombudsman's Report for 1984. Members of the House may recall that in his 1984 Report the Ombudsman indicated areas where he considered reviews of legislation were necessary. I am happy to report that some of these issues have since been resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>One of those resolved was the law of domicile which affected claims for widows' pensions under the Social Welfare Acts. Following recommendations of the Law Reform Commission the Minister for Justice introduced legislation to abolish the domicile of dependency of married women.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, has ensured that this anomaly no longer exists. Remedial action has also been taken in the tax anomaly which deprived some single parents of the single parent tax allowances. This problem has been removed by section 4 of the Finance Act 1985. Recommendations for changes in certain statutory dates affecting the valuation of property have been implemented and arrangements have been made to inform all persons affected by the proposed revisions.</P>
    <P>In his current report the Ombudsman <Col N="155" /> again raises the matter of &ldquo;antiquated law&rdquo;. The Minister for the Environment has informed me that provision is being made in legislation relating to local government re-organisation to enable all local authorities to assume responsibility for branch water and sewerage pipes up to the boundary of private property. I understand that a Bill which will include such a provision is expected to be published before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>One of the problems mentioned in the last report and referred to again is in the area of social insurance and entitlement to old age contributory pensions. This issue was examined by the Commission on Social Welfare in the context of their review of the contribution conditions for pensions generally. The commission in their report issued earlier this year, considered that it was inequitable that a person who became a social insurance contributor for the first time in 1974 could qualify for a pension while a person with a similar post-1974 insurance record might not qualify by reason of having made earlier social insurance contributions before 1974. To redress this situation the commission recommended that <i>pro-rata</i> pensions be paid to the persons concerned. They tentatively estimated that the cost of this proposal at July, 1986 rates over the period 1986 to 2017 would be £24 million. This proposal, along with the others of the commission, are currently under examination in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised by the Ombudsman which concerns the Department of Social Welfare is the question of the payment of unemployment benefit during trade disputes. The general rule that unemployment benefit should not be paid to persons involved in a trade dispute is based on the internationally accepted principle that the funds of the unemployment insurance system should not be used to support one side or the other in such a dispute. The Ombudsman, however, considers that the system can operate <Col N="156" /> unfairly against workers in certain instances, in particular against workers not directly involved in a dispute. Proposals for amendment of the trade disputes provisions to resolve the issue are now to be considered by the Department of Social Welfare in the context of the 1987 Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>In his first report in 1984 the Ombudsman referred to the apparent inequity of not compensating citizens for delays in payments made by the State. He reiterated his concerns in this regard in his 1985 report with particular reference to the claim by a widow for compensation for the reduced purchasing power of social welfare pension arrears &mdash; a claim which I am glad to say has since been resolved satisfactorily on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>While it may seem relatively straightforward to formulate principles for compensating welfare recipients for excessive delays in payments, any such principles might not be so readily applicable in the case of other Departments dealing with the public, for example, in relation to housing on agricultural grants or subsidies. In short, circumstances can vary widely and may not be susceptible to standard treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has informed me that the issue of delayed payments, in general, is at present under active consideration in his Department. I am happy to say that in the case of social welfare payments, however, the principle of compensation for exceptional delays is acknowledged and claimants who are affected by such delays in the future can expect sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>In his 1985 report the Ombudsman suggests two areas where existing legislation should be reviewed. The Ombudsman suggests a revision of the social welfare regulations so that the period of retrospective payment of disability benefit be further extended. He also highlights an inconsistency in the method of means assessment for old age non-contributory pension. I am assured by my colleague, <Col N="157" /> the Minister for Social Welfare, that these issues are both receiving urgent attention by her department.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the other general issues in the report which arose from specific complaints and which were the subject of comment by the Ombudsman. These were mainly problems of an administrative nature which can be resolved through improved practices and procedures. The issues which were of particular concern to me were, first, the delays in the hearing of oral appeals by appeals officers in the Department of Social Welfare. The Ombudsman draws attention to the public dissatisfaction with delays in the appeals system in the Department of Social Welfare. He wishes to record, however, that he is satisfied at the same time that the staff of the appeals branch are doing their best in a very difficult situation within the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>Second, there is the problem of late applications for contributory pensions. The Ombudsman recommends that people approaching pension age should be informed in advance of their contributory pension entitlements and they should be invited to claim. Alternatively, he suggests the law might be amended to relax the time limits applying to contributory pension claims. The Department of Social Welfare have pointed out that every effort is made through leaflets and other sources of information to ensure that people are aware of their entitlements and of the necessity to claim within the required time limits. They have also indicated that the question of amending the time limits for contributory pension claims is under examination in that Department.</P>
    <P>A third issue which caught my attention in the report was the public dissatisfaction and confusion with the existence of two distinct fuel schemes, with differing eligibility criteria. The Ombudsman suggests that in the interest of equity and sound administration there should be only one winter fuel scheme covering the whole country. I am glad to <Col N="158" /> say that the Department of Social Welfare are currently considering proposals for rationalising both fuel schemes.</P>
    <P>A particular case in the report which came to my notice concerned the Housing Finance Agency loan scheme, where a local authority's valuation was much lower than the agreed sale price. The loan available on foot of this valuation was not sufficient and the sale fell through. While the conditions applicable to house purchase loans under the Housing Finance Agency scheme are matters for the board of the agency in the first instance, I have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment who in turn has referred it to the board. However housing authorities have recently been given more direct responsibility for the administration of income-related loans, formerly administered by them as agents for the Housing Finance Agency. It is anticipated that, in this new context, the conditions in relation to appeals on valuation will be extended to cover all loans advanced by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have taken note of the issue of complaints from students at a particular university who had been refused scholarships under the higher education scholarship scheme. I have drawn the Ombudsman's comments on the matter to the attention of the Minister for Education who has informed me that following a meeting with the Ombudsman the problem will be examined in the context of the specimen scholarship scheme which is to issue to vocational education committees for the 1986-87 academic year.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the remit of the Ombudsman was extended on 1 April 1985 to include health boards, local authorities, Telecom Éireann and An Post. Almost 400 complaints were received against the health boards. The majority of these complaints related to the community care programme. Most of these concerned entitlement under the Health Acts, i.e. medical cards, disabled person's maintenance allowance, domiciliary care allowance, rent allowance, <Col N="159" /> free fuel allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman states that he received wholehearted support and co-operation from the chief executive offcers of the health boards. He did, however, receive a number of challenges from medical officers regarding his right to examine medical records. This, of course, is a particularly delicate issue and requires to be handled with great care and sensitivity. I am pleased to note that a <i>modus vivendi</i> has been worked out between the Ombudsman's office and the relevant medical organisations whereby they recognised the Ombudsman's unconditional right to all records, medical or otherwise. Notwithstanding this, the Ombudsman was happy to assure them that he would request medical records only when he considered it absolutely necessary and that, in all such cases, he would secure that permission of complainants before examining these records.</P>
    <P>Over 500 complaints concerning local authorities were received; most of these were on an informal basis. Over half of the complaints related to housing, planning, rates, charges and sanitation. Although the Ombudsman reports that he received an encourging degree of co-operation from the local authorities a number of difficulties were encountered. Some managers considered that the Ombudsman was interfering with the traditional role of public representatives.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the office of the Ombudsman is not involved in making representations. Its statutory function is to investigate complaints concerning the administrative actions of public bodies, which now include local authorities and, where appropriate, to secure redress for those adversely affected. Following discussions between the Ombudsman and a sub-committee of the County and City Managers' Association, procedures for processing complaints have now been established.</P>
    <P>I also noted the relatively high number of complaints against Telecom Éireann. Over 1,400 complaints were on hands <Col N="160" /> of which over 1,200 concerned disputed telephone accounts. I was disappointed, however, that only 200 of these complaints had been finalised by the end of the year. I understand that the reason for this was that the Ombudsman was having difficulty in receiving completed reports and recommendations from Bord Telecom. I anticipate considerable improvements in this area following special measures to clear the arrears which have been taken by Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to learn that no difficulties were reported by the Ombudsman in his dealings with the other State body under his remit namely, An Post, bearing in mind the size of the company and the extent of its operations. About 60 complaints concerning the postal service were received, most of which were completed satisfactorily. These complaints mainly concerned compensation for losses and delivery of correspondence.</P>
    <P>The large number of complaints received from the new bodies certainly provides ample justification for the extension of the remit. This is particularly so in the case of Telecom Éireann. I have no plans at present to include other State bodies in the Ombudsman's remit. I intend, however, to keep the legislation under review and I certainly have an open mind about the question of possible future extensions of the Ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>Turning then to other aspects of the report, in 1985 staff of the Ombudsman's office began a series of visits to towns in various parts of Ireland. In all they visited ten centres in 1985 and I understand already this year they have visited additional centres which covered the counties Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Wicklow and Wexford. Plans have been made for further such visits, paying particular attention to those areas not yet visited. Experience to date has shown that these visits are well worthwhile and of benefit to all concerned. I regard this as an essential feature of the service provided by the Ombudsman. It ensures that he is constantly in touch with the real and sometimes complex problems encountered <Col N="161" /> by people in their dealings with the public service.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the Ombudsman requires the fullest degree of co-operation if he is to discharge his functions to the Oireachtas. I would be most concerned if public officials were to impede the Ombudsman in carrying out his duties. Members of the House will recall that in his first report the Ombudsman complained that some senior civil servants resented his intrusion, particularly when their decisions were under scrutiny. He also reported that there were legal challenges to his authority which seemed to be more concerned with preventing an investigation into particular complaints than the question of whether the complaints were justified. The Ombudsman pays tribute in his latest report to the very large number of civil servants in all Departments who co-operated fully with his office during the year. He does however draw attention to the residue of suspicion about his office which still exists in some areas of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>While I have been particularly heartened by the significant improvements recorded in the level of co-operation with the Ombudsman's office, I shall not be totally satisfied until this residue of suspicion &mdash; which only exists among a small number of civil servants &mdash; is swept away. As I said at the start of this speech I expect from civil servants nothing short of willing, wholehearted co-operation with the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Members of the House may be aware of the Government's continuing programme of reform in the public service. The White Paper on the public service entitled &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo; published last year outlines the Government's plans for greater efficiency, better service to the public and improved management methods within the Civil Service. That programme aims to make civil servants more accountable for their actions by improving systems and methods of management. I expect to publish legislation shortly which will give an added impetus to the programme of reform and, in particular, will provide the <Col N="162" /> statutory framework for the formulation and discharge of Government policy. As these new systems and arrangements are put in place, the role of the Ombudsman in investigating the effects of policy decisions and actions of civil servants will become an even more important indicator of the performance of both Civil Service managers themselves and of the quality of the services they manage.</P>
    <P>As the office of the Ombudsman completes another year of operation I am satisfied that it continues to perform a vital role in Irish public administration. The Ombudsman is making a major contribution towards solving the problems of the ordinary citizen who at times feels frustrated and disillusioned with the way he is treated by the bureaucracy. He is also successfully contributing to our efforts to reform the public service by ensuring that Departments and other State agencies give the people the service they deserve.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by also complimenting the staff of an Ombudsman's office. We knew the Ombudsman here in the past and we recognise and respect his talent and commitment but his staff also deserve a word of compliment and praise for the dedication they bring to the job they are performing so effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the second annual report of the Ombudsman for the year ended 31 December 1985. I want to confine myself to some points that interested me particularly in the course of reading the report. The first point to note is the very substantial increase in the number of cases coming to the Ombudsman, moving to a figure of 5,496 which is more than double the number of complaints for the previous year. By any standards, this is a very substantial increase and it naturally raises the question as to whether such an increase is justified. The record of completed cases during the year under consideration at 3,411 suggests that for the most part complaints were justified. The Ombudsman's office resolved approximately one-third of the cases completed and provided <Col N="163" /> assistance for approximately a further one-third while the remaining cases were either not upheld, discontinued or withdrawn. Clearly, the office is doing a very good job in lifting the level of public awareness which the Minister of State has already referred to. To an extent, that has contributed to the number of cases coming before the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>I, too would like to welcome the regional visits that were undertaken during 1985. Not alone have these visits also lifted the level of awareness but they have brought this important service to the people outside the Dublin area in particular. As the Ombudsman pointed out in the course of this report, many of these complaints would be difficult to describe or articulate by letter or by phone. It was so much easier to process and discuss them by meeting the Ombudsman and his officers in various parts of the country. I am very glad to note that these regional visits dealing with local issues on the spot will be continued in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has referred, generally speaking, to the very good response to the office of the Ombudsman but there is this lingering suspicion and residual lack of co-operation in a minority of cases. The view had been expressed that the Ombudsman's office is seen as something of a nuisance in some quarters. There is also a viewpoint that much of the work referred to him is rather pointless. The statutory reality, however, and the record of the Ombudsman to date disprove these criticisms. It must be clearly understood by all public servants, including that minority at a senior level who come under the remit of the office, that the Ombudsman was established under an Act of the Oireachtas with the same powers as a High Court judge. It is important that all public servants realise that since the establishment and operation of this office things have changed and it must be seen to have changed. The Ombudsman and his officials are empowered under law to investigate disputes by individuals against acts of public servants in designated areas. There needs to be a <Col N="164" /> more widespread understanding of the statutory requirement for the Ombudsman to conduct a preliminary examination of what he deems to be valid cases. In other words, that is an integral requirement of the office itself. All public servants must understand that fact.</P>
    <P>It is true that some of the complaints which have been made are trivial. They may be trivial to the civil servants concerned and, perhaps, even trivial to the Ombudsman but it should be remembered that the typical case is viewed as anything but trivial by the complainant. So long as the Ombudsman considers a case within his remit he is then, as I have said, required to conduct a preliminary examination of the case and that reality must be understood by all. Indeed, the case work of the Ombudsman to date shows evidence of the fact that on the face of it a seemingly trivial case can, following investigation, turn into a serious one requiring a substantial and urgent remedy.</P>
    <P>The very existence of the office may invite invitations. If I could draw a parallel from the industrial relations field with which I am particularly familiar, it is well known that the existence of third party disputes settling machinery can lead to a situation where problems are not always resolved between the parties directly in negotiation and, therefore, there is probably the temptation to jump the gun and go to the third party machinery. However &mdash; and this is an important point in relation to the Ombudsman experience in Ireland &mdash; it is very well worth nothing that only about one in six of the complaints made to the Ombudsman were deemed to be invalid. In other countries about one-third of all complaints made to the Ombudsman are deemed invalid. On the basis therefore of international comparision the Irish experience shows that the public are more discriminating between valid and invalid complaints. A further point I would like to make, and it is really to pick up a point the Minister of State made, is that it seems that the existence and operation of the office is leading to some very worthwhile and necessary amendments <Col N="165" /> to the law and practices. To the extent that antiquated law or other irregularities are highlighted, this is a very important service in its own way.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of the complaints within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman shows that social welfare is top of the list with 1,677 complaints and this is followed rather closely by Telecom Éireann with 1,419 complaints of which, as the Minister of State has pointed out, 1,200 had to do with telephone accounts. It seems that the flood of these complaints the Ombudsman receives leads to a very time consuming process. I wonder whether the Ombudsman's office might not be more usefully used in correcting problems in other areas rather than in telephone accounts. While the complaints made in respect of telephone bills are usually genuine there is some evidence that the Ombudsman's office is being misused for this purpose. The number of complaints from telephone customers will continue to be high unless another reform takes place, that is, within Telecom Éireann itself. The time is overdue when telephone customers should receive a print out of all long distance direct dial calls.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable progress in relation to Telecom Éireann as evidenced by their most recent report which states that they have reached a breakeven situation. We can feel reasonably optimistic about the future of our telecommunications service. In relation to print outs, which would greatly cut down on the number of cases coming to the Ombudsman, the projected date for the availability and distribution of such print outs is 1988-89 according to their most recent report, but it would be of considerable help all round if they could bring that date forward in relation to long distance direct dial calls.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to commend the Ombudsman, Mr. Mills, and his staff for a job well done. The report is comprehensive and lucid and quite easy to follow. This is only the second annual report and clearly, the office and staff have made great progress in dealing with genuine complaints made by individual <Col N="166" /> citizens against acts of public servants. Again, I echo what the Minister has said, that their contribution is an important step forward in the context of public service reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to Mr. Mills and his staff for a remarkable job done in the second year of the existence of the Ombudsman's office. I am interested from two points of view, one as a Senator and therefore a legislator and, secondly, as a former Ombudsman having some experience in this field. Before I go on to the report, I would like to refer to some points made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman is a just man; he is a fair man. He has to set up just rules and regulations and deal with those which deviate from the norms of justice. He was bound to come across the problem in the industrial relations field about unemployment benefit not being paid to people actively involved in a trade dispute. He did come across it; he has pointed it out and I welcome the Minister saying that proposals for the amendment of trade disputes provisions to resolve the issue are now being considered. That is a good thing and that is due to the work, observation and scrutiny of the Ombudsman and I congratulate the people who are going to amend the trades dispute provisions.</P>
      <P>The last time I was speaking here the Minister referred to the delayed payments for social welfare beneficiaries. he said:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has informed me that the issue of delayed payments in general is at present under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased about that. I raised this matter at the time of the 1984 report. I was very concerned that no compensatory financial adjustments were made to the people who had suffered such substantial arrears in the payment of their benefits. The Minister said here today that he is happy to say that in the case of social welfare payments the principle of compensation for exceptional <Col N="167" /> delays is acknowledged and claimants who are affected by such delays in the future can expect sympathetic consideration. There was a reservation prior to that would have an effect of a serious nature on other Departments faced with this kind of precedent.</P>
    <P>I am bound to ask as a result of that vague language: what does this mean? Does it mean that each case will be viewed on its merits? Does it mean that the Department will use their discretionary powers, or does it mean that they will insist that the law as they say, prohibits the payment of such moneys. I thought last year that they were afraid of establishing a dangerous precedent. They may well be, but they are offering against justice if they do not compensate people who are three, four, five, six and seven years in arrears for benefits. I am not interested in arithmetic. It may well be an equivalent sum of money totted up on the basis of interest or inflation. I am not concerned about this, but there has to be an admitted principle of compensation. The question of interest on money overdue and not paid is a business principle. Apparently, it does not apply to old age pensioners; it applies to big business. That will have to be changed. I want that matter clarified.</P>
    <P>I want to make an observation on the medical position. I am delighted that Mr. Mills has resolved the situation relative to the relationship with the medical people. There was confusion in the North for some time. The Ombudsman cannot do or say anything about clinical records or clinical matters, but he is entitled to see records. Some of the medical people in the North did not understand when I insisted that I had to see them. We eventually resolved that. I am pleased that Mr. Mills had got a <i>modus vivendi</i> and will be able to operate in that field.</P>
    <P>On the report itself, the 5,500 complaints made in 1985 were bound to have been made for two reasons, one being the extension of the remit to four bodies, with particular emphasis on Telecom Éireann. The difficulty I saw with Telecom Éireann was that they are outside <Col N="168" /> the normal scope of the Ombudsman's office. It is very difficult. All the Ombudsman can do and hope to do in the Telecom context and on the question of the accounts is to seek some kind of a compromise arrangement. The nature of the complaints inside the Telecom concept was such that it is very difficult to point precisely at evidence that a person was over-charged. So compromise is the lesson of the day in the Telecom remit. As Senator Hillery has said, obviously this problem will disappear. My information is the same as his, that the Telecom people will introduce efficiency measures and the numbers complaining about Telecom will gradually be reduced. That will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>There is a terrific amount of work, research and investigation to be carried out. The number of complaints is higher on a <i>pro rata</i> basis than in any of the Ombudsmen's reports which I get from anywhere. It may well be that numbers will go back to normal when the Telecom problems are resolved. I want to compliment Mr. Mills and his staff on the speed and efficiency with which they approached the increase in the number of complaints. I am talking now about the informal method. It is fast, efficient and time-saving. It is not time-consuming and that is good. Even on a casual reading of the report you will find that the language is informal and not stilted or technical. The average person can read that report. The average person cannot read some other reports. He or she puts it away when about one-third of the way through it. Even I do that. This report is readable. It gets to the point quickly. You know the kind of case he was handling and there is a human element all the time in the use of language.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman said in his report that he cannot find in favour of everybody. We understand that but he should not be unduly concerned in that regard. There are bound to be situations where he cannot, on the evidence, find in favour of a number of complainants. This is not to say that all the people for whom the Ombudsman cannot find in their favour are dissatisfied. That is not true. The <Col N="169" /> great proportion of the number for whom the Ombudsman cannot find in favour are satisfied that their complaint was thoroughly investigated by an independent mind. He cannot satisfy all the people all the time but the greater proportion are satisfied that their complaint is ventilated and examined by an independent mind. That is my experience and I think Michael Mills will find that to be his experience also.</P>
    <P>It is very pleasing to note that the complaints outside the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman reduced from 32 per cent to 14 per cent. That is the lowest and this means, as Senator Hillary said, that the people are aware of what the Ombudsman can do and what he cannot do. This is because of the promotional efforts of the Ombudsman's office and staff. It is also due to the regional visits in ten centres which is a good thing. That brings the Ombudsman's operations close to the public and that is the essence of his operations. In that context the Ombudsman does not usurp the function of public representations. The Ombudsman is an officer of Parliament. He supplements the work of public representatives and he saves a lot of their time. He does not make representations, as the Minister said. The time he saves for public representatives means they can devote their efforts to other constructive and positive work and operations in Parliament. I confess that initially, especially in New Zealand and to a greater extent in Britain, the members of the Parliament were afraid of the office of Ombudsman and they stopped it. I was very concerned to find out that the Labour Party there stopped it for many years and I am sure the Minister can understand my concern in this regard. However, that does not really matter. The Ombudsman does not usurp the function of public representatives, he supplements their work because he operates in a grey area, the law and the courts on the one side and on the other, the Ministers' Departments and the public representatives asking questions but not doing as through a job as the Ombudsman. Therefore, inside the grey area it was felt in civilised communities that this <Col N="170" /> office had to be established. It was established and is working very successfully.</P>
    <P>I want to introduce a little jarring note; co-operation by civil servants. In reading this report one finds that the Ombudsman has reservations about the co-operation at certain levels by civil servants. He will have to do his best to overcome these inhibitions and despite the jaundiced views of some people in relation to his operations I wish him every success. Nevertheless, there are reservations in his report and we must try to change these views in regard to the Ombudsman's job. In Northern Ireland in the years 1974 to 1979 not one civil servant and not one single department in the North &mdash; and that includes the local authorities &mdash; obstructed the Ombudsman in his work. My message to the civil servants in the Republic is &ldquo;please co-operate with the Ombudsman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the North and in Britain all the bodies against whom the complaints were made advised the complainants to go to the Ombudsman. They did not want to discontent at their front door every day with people knocking with complaints, they wanted to have the situation relieved. There was a method for doing this and they told people to go to the Ombudsman if they had complaints. That is intelligent and positive, not negative. I want the civil servants here to welcome the idea that an Ombudsman's investigation is right because people think they are being unfairly treated. These complaints can seem very small to some people but to the person involved they are very large. Therefore, I trust that the Minister might do more for us in that respect. There surely must be some discretion inside any Department in regard to certain cases. The Minister has said that these cases will be dealt with sympathetically and there is the danger of the precedent that he has quoted. Are they bound by legislation? Is the Minister fully aware of the facts or is a civil servant at a certain level insisting that the law is there or that the Ministers have no discretionary powers? This will have to be clarified and if it is not I advise the Ombudsman &mdash; and this is within his authority &mdash; to take out the cases where <Col N="171" /> the compensation was not paid and to make a special approach to both Houses. He is entitled to do that. The matter then must be discussed openly and publicly. The Minister and the Department must make their minds up at that stage either to support the Civil Service or to agree to pay. If they agree to pay, obviously it will not be discussed in the Dáil or the Seanad. Michael Mills says he has no alternative but to carry on making recommendations in favour of the complainant. He has another alternative, special reports to both Houses of Parliament, opening a public debate and letting the Minister defend the reason for these old age pensioners not getting their compensatory sums of money. I realise that this does establish a precedent but in the face of justice the balance is on the side of the old age pensioner and compensation to him.</P>

      <P>There is very little I can add to the remarks of the Minister. Senators Hillery and McGonagle because they have fleshed out in considerable detail the minutiae of the report, its merits etc. Seldom, however, has a report or indeed any other item come before the Houses of the Oireachtas that has drawn such favourable, unanimous and unambiguous praise from all sides of the House. It reiterates and consolidates the impression that if ever there was a worthy institution established it was that of the office of Ombudsman. Recently on looking through some documents I found an article written as a preliminary to the establishment of the office of Ombudsman in 1984 by Dermot Curran in the Department of the Public Service, who I understand has found his way into the office of Ombudsman as a very senior official. In it he sets out the background, the purpose, the hopes and the aspirations for the office of Ombudsman. In his introduction he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The apparent helplessness of the individual in the face of the remote and powerful institutions which to a large extent govern his destiny, and the resultant experience of alienation, has <Col N="172" /> been a classic theme of art and literature in our time.</P>
    <P>If ever an office has discharged its functions, it has been the office of the Ombudsman in undertaking the role of providing a service which one might equate to providing a referee service between John Citizen and the awesome institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>A number of reservations were expressed by the Ombudsman last year in relation to suspicions about members of the public service, particularly people in the Department of Social Welfare who were singled our last year for special mention. I am delighted that these have been eliminated. As has been referred to by the Minister and by Senator McGonagle and Senator Hillery, this residue seems to have been transferred to Telecom Éireann. I concur entirely with the sentiments expressed by the Minister that public servants will have to give maximum co-operation and that it is in their interest, as has been said by Senator McGonagle, to give maximum and full co-operation to the Ombudsman and his officials in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>The number of complaints has escalated &mdash; in fact it has doubled. Looking at the figures for individual countries I notice that in my county the number has actually trebled, from something in the region of 75 to 170. I can take a certain amount of credit or blame for some of the statistics which relate to Mayo. It is recorded in the Ombudsman's report, which is now before us, that increasingly public representatives have had to have recourse to the Ombudsman in order to disentangle some of the problems which they have failed to resolve through the normal channels. I want to record my satisfaction and my gratitude to the Ombudsman and to the members of his staff for the courteous and highly efficient manner in which they have dealt with the problems of the citizery of Mayo and public representatives such as myself. We do not like having to use the office of the Ombudsman. As a public representative I think it is, to an extent, a reflection on our own inability to convince the powers-that-be of the rectitude or the merits of <Col N="173" /> a particular case we have been pursuing. But it has been incumbent on us from time to time to ask the Ombudsman to intervene. I have in front of me a random sample of ten items which have been successfully resolved by the Ombudsman in relation to medical cards, in relation to disabled persons maintenance allowance and so on, all in a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>I believe that the office of the Ombudsman is a very worthwhile institution. As Senator Dooge has said, it is a refreshing change from the normal type of report to which we have become used. The colloquial language and the manner in which the report has been presented reflect the freshness of approach which has been adopted by the Ombudsman and his staff.</P>
    <P>The problem I have had greatest difficulty with &mdash; which I understand is virtually at the stage of resolution thanks to the intervention of the Ombudsman &mdash; has been the application of the guidelines set down by the Western Health Board for medical cards. Time and time again I have asked the Minister and the health board to try to get their relative acts together in this regard. If ever a system was destined to leave the citizen bewildered and sometimes sullen and disgruntled, it is the total contradiction of the method of assessment used by the Western Health Board in determining people's eligibility (a) for medical cards and (b) for disabled persons' maintenance allowances. We recall that in 1982 the Department of Social Welfare changed the regulations in relation to the guidelines for eligibility for small farmers' dole. As a result of a High Court action taken by farmers in County Wexford, the system of determining people's eligibility for smallholders' assistance was deemed to be unconstitutional and it was replaced by a method called factual assessment.</P>
    <P>We then had a ludicrous situation whereby a farmer was deemed eligible for small farmers' assistance one week on the basis that his means were X, Y or Z. The following week an official from the health board determined his eligibility for a medical card on a notional system of rounding up the amount of income which accrued from X amount of cows, Y <Col N="174" /> amount of bullocks and Z amount of sheep, and arrived at a totally different conclusion, the result being that in two consecutive weeks the farmer can be told different things. One week he is told that the Department of Social Welfare have assessed his means at £80 a week and the following week the community welfare officer of the superintendent community welfare officer informs the same farmer that his income is £140 a week. I have discovered disparities of £60, £70 and £80 per week. I understand that as a result of a number of classic cross-samples and examples submitted to the Ombudsman, we can look forward to a successful and favourable resolution to this problem and a synchronisation of the methods used. Furthermore, apart from the obvious logic behind it, it will prove cost saving to the Exchequer, the health boards and the various Departments involved in the long term.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has done invaluable work in relation to the speeding up of oral appeals, something referred to in his report. There is no question about it. While it is a cumbersome, tedious and painstaking business which requires meticulous application to detail, there has been gross tardiness on the part of the Department of Social Welfare in relation to the speeding up and efficiency of the oral appeals system. The oral appeals system was greeted with a lot of relief by people in that it brought the applicant face to face with the appeals officer who actually makes the decision. At the same time it is intolerable and it is inexplicable that delays of six, seven and eight months are still being encountered by people in relation to the determination of their eligibility.</P>
    <P>I found the Ombudsman and his office particularly helpful in the grey area of the floor specifications for new house grants. There is a maximum limit of 1,346 square feet as the threshold, beyond which somebody does not qualify for a new house grant; there is the whole area of whether or not an attic space is convertible from the point of view of providing further domestic space. Again we have the problem that if somebody is <Col N="175" /> caught by the virtue of the fact that the plans were not carried out in detail and the space is two, three or four square feet over the limit, he loses the entire entitlement. I would like to see the legislators taking on board some of the recommendations which have been made whereby if somebody is a minuscule amount over the statutory limit, rather than penalising the person so that they lose their £2,000 new house grant and their £3,000 mortgage subsidy, there would be a <i>pro rata</i> reduction for the amount of offending space.</P>
    <P>One area where the Ombudsman could usefully intervene &mdash; I know that I, as a legislator have failed to impress upon my colleagues in the Department of Social Welfare that they should do so &mdash; is in the area of disability benefit re-examinations. None of us holds any brief for people who rip off the system or people who find themselves on disability benefit by the virtue of the fact that they are sending in weekly medical certificates for years. We endorse the right of the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister for Social Welfare to ask people to have themselves subjected to regular medical examinations in order to determine the merits of their case. At the same time there seems to be victimisation of some people whose medical evidence is quite strong, quite irrefutable and who have gone to eminent specialists in order to prove that their ailment is one which confines them to their homes and leaves them unable to carry out their employment. It is inexcusable that people who have been restored to benefit are being called within a matter of months before a medical referee in order to determine their entitlement. Once a person is determined as being unfit for work on medical grounds, and once the medical evidence is sufficiently strong and has come from a reputable medical source, there should be some moratorium or some period within which the Department of Social Welfare will not call that person back and subject him or her to medical examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> I endorse the report, the sentiments of my fellow Senators and the remarks of the Minister about it. I wish the Ombudsman and his staff well in their work in the coming year. As public representatives we appreciate the daunting task with which they are confronted. In our daily, routine of dealing with constituents' problems we get to understand the nature of their complaints but the Ombudsman deals with problems that others have failed to solve. It may be a citizen or a public representative. The case may require a major thrust, a lot of meticulous detail, a lot of analytical work or an enormous amount of backroom work. The degree of success of the Ombudsman has made the office a unique and worthwhile establishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I make some comments on the report, I should like to refer to the renovations that were carried out here during the summer recess. Yesterday when this matter was raised &mdash; I trust that I am not out of order in making these passing comments &mdash; I had not had the time to look over the place. Since then I have inspected, in a superficial way, the works carried out and I want to express my total admiration of the Office of Public Works, the architect and the skilled craftsmen who carried out the renovations. I would award 100 per cent marks to all involved. The fact that this Chamber is rather small is something over which they had no control but otherwise the work is perfect.</P>
      <P>I should like to join the other Senators, and the Minister, in paying a tribute to the Ombudsman and his staff. When the office of Ombudsman was being created Members of this House spoke in very high and glowing terms about Mr. Mills. As Dickens said in one of his novels, adjectives are used in the superlative degree of comparison only. I recalled at that time the words of Christ to Mathias, &ldquo;a man in whom there is no guile&rdquo;. That is the way Mr. Mills had come across to me from meeting him around this House and seeing him on television. Everything that has happened since then has enhanced his reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> Senator Dooge referred to the colloquial style in which the report was written and in a sense I felt he was implying that, perhaps, future reports should withdraw somewhat into a more formal presentation. However, like Senator McGonagle, and the other Members who spoke about the style, I must say that it impressed me very much. It is a headline in the way reports should be written as, indeed, one would expect from a journalist of the calibre of Mr. Mills. I must confess that when reading the report I did not have enough time to concentrate on its contents in the way I would have liked but the colloquial style did not strike me. The document was easily understood, lucid and well presented.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in a sense coming after a person like Senator McGonagle, who was Ombudsman in the Six Counties, and who has such a reputation. The points I want to raise will not be in the same class as those raised by Senator McGonagle. In the introduction to the report of the Ombudsman points out, as he has in the past two years, that only the Oireachtas has the power to change the law. For that reason it is most important that these reports are considered and debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas. From that point of view I am somewhat disappointed that more Members were not prepared to come in here and make a contribution which in every instance could only be helpful with regard to the work of the Ombudsman, the direction he should go and the way he should carry out his investigations.</P>
    <P>In his introduction to the report the Ombudsman expresses confidence that the office appears to have been recognised by a wide section of the community. The large increase in the number of complaints during the past year is an obvious sign of that. The total number of complaints now surpasses the level of most other countries of similar population. In one sense this is very satisfactory but in another we should ask ourselves what is the reason for all these complaints. Looking back further I would ask myself the question, what about all those who suffered and had complaints before the <Col N="178" /> office of the Ombudsman was created? Obviously, there was a miscarriage of justice in instances. There was some essential justice lost out by many people over these years. That is a logical conclusion to come to. When we look at the people who make the complaints, at least in the social welfare area, they are the poorest section of the community, the people who can least afford to suffer, but, evidently, up to last year a considerable number of people suffered.</P>
    <P>As the Minister and the other Members said, the main cause of the rise in the volume of complaints was the extension of the jurisdiction to the local authorities, the health boards, Telecom Éireann and An Post from 1 April 1985. An additional source was the initiation of visits to regional centres by members of the Ombudsman's staff. I too pay tribute to the decision to go through out the country to the different towns. Unfortunately, large areas have not been visited by the Ombudsman and his staff. On the last occasion I said some arrangement should be made, at least in the larger centres, so that the people could call to some key individual who would contact the Ombudsman. There should at least be an annual visit to most of the large centres and people should know the dates and times when they could call to those centres to contact the staff of the Ombudsman's office. This could easily be done, and perhaps not on as widespread a scale as would be necessary in the early stages. We should at least make a start by deciding on centres that could be visited annually. Perhaps other areas could be looked at which might help people in remote rural sections to contact the Ombudsman's office easily.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues involving the Ombudsman are very complex but the organisation has proved that they are well able to deal with those problems in a short space of time. That is another tribute to the whole set up of the office. The number of complaints the office can handle properly in a year is limited and jone of us would like to see a large number of complaints left in abeyance over a long period. In time the staff in <Col N="179" /> the Ombudsman's office will have to be increased to deal with complaints. Perhaps too, some dexterity will be built up through experience in dealing more expeditiously with these problems.</P>
    <P>Complaints about telephone bills have been referred to. I made the point on the last occasion that all telephone accounts should be monitored. It should be possible to break down an account and identify when calls were made, their duration and their cost. I was told then by Senator Daly that it is possible to get a meter at a small nominal charge. Unfortunately, I did not follow up that suggestion, but if it is possible to provide meters at a nominal cost, this should be done and there is no excuse for not doing it. The duration of time to deal with complaints varied from three to nine months. The point was made that it would be very unfair if, in the interest of speeding up the process, an injustice were done. Thorough as the Ombudsman may be, quite possibly there might be the very odd occasion when, perhaps, through disclosure of further information, or through some other process, something might come to light which would change the decision. Unlike the system with the planning appeals board, nothing further can be done when a decision is made. That seems to be the end of the road. That might be looked at.</P>
    <P>The report states that the number of complaints submitted by Members of the Dáil and Seanad were dealt with expeditiously. I had occasion to make one complaint to the Ombudsman in relation to a lady who had been refused a disabled person's allowance. That was about nine months ago and in the meantime. I have had no further communication from the Ombudsman's office. Perhaps that is the procedure. I am not sure if the lady in question has been kept in touch with the procedures. If that is not done I suggest that it should be done. People who make complaints should be informed of whatever progress is made. I do not say that in any critical sense. People living in remote areas might get impatient and they should be <Col N="180" /> entitled to get periodic reports on the processing of a complaint.</P>
    <P>One letter of the many letters received thanking the Ombudsman is included in this report. It relates to an invalidity pension. It starts off:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This week I received my first payment of Invalidity Pension and became entitled to free travel and other benefits which are entailed. To many this would seem to be an insignificant thing. To me it is the end of over three years of worry and the conviction of being unfairly treated, without hope of redress.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to refer to the disability benefit, unemployment assistance, and supplementary welfare allowances. The writer was paid in full the difference between the disability benefit and unemployment assistance and awarded an invalidity pension. Of course it is a letter of gratitude.</P>

      <P>It is on page 4. I am sure the Ombudsman does not look for gratitude. He and his office have the satisfaction of a job well done. That is sufficient. However, that highlights the point I made earlier that up to the recent past many would have been deprived for three years of their invalidity pensions. There was no justification for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of those who approached the Ombudsman expecting a recommendation in their favour have been disappointed. This is to be expected. While they may be disappointed in the process of the investigation, many people might very well be satisfied that their case was not as it seemed to them initially. Even in those cases, while the Ombudsman might quite rightly feel happier if more people were satisfied, the fact that their grievances were fully investigated would be enough for many people. It is underlined in the report that in particular cases the law operates unfairly against individuals. This is referred to subsequently in different areas in the report. I would <Col N="181" /> like to see that case developed. I am quite sure with the experience of the Ombudsman that he could very well produce a report on that item alone. It would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general issues raised in the 1984 report there is reference to one of the greatest anomalies which the Ombudsman dealt with. This is the legal requirement which prevents people who have many years of social insurance contributions from qualifying for contributory old age pensions. We are told that the office got scores of complaints about the problem during 1985. Many of us in public life are aware of the great problem in this area. The contributory old age pension is not means tested. This is the greatest bone of contention. I would make a plea in passing that the non-contributory old age pension should not be means tested because when people get to that age in life they try to retain the little savings they have built up for a proper burial. Many of us know people who are simply concerned about having enough money to bury themselves. I am glad that the Ombudsman highlights that problem. He admits that it is a complex problem, one which has been with us for quite a long time and which has engaged the attention of many other organisations in the social welfare area. The report expresses disappointment that there appears to have been no movement towards a solution to the anomaly.</P>
    <P>The cost per annum has been mentioned. It is pointed out that from 1987 onwards people claiming should have sufficient stamps. The cost up to then has been estimated at between £35 million and £50 million. That is not a very considerable sum in the context of the whole social welfare system. In any event with regard to the case which the Ombudsman makes here, clearly this is something which is highlighted and which should get immediate priority. The report tells us the impression has been created by the Department of Social Welfare that all of those people could have become voluntary contributors when they ceased to be compulsorily insured between 1953 and 1974. It is pointed out that this is not <Col N="182" /> so. I think this is something which is well worthwhile highlighting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the situation with regard to trade disputes and social welfare entitlements. I am glad that that is being taken care of. This is an anomaly whereby people who are out of work because of a trade dispute at their place of employment may be, and invariably are, being refused unemployment payments, even though they are not directly involved in the dispute and do not stand to benefit materially from the outcome. The report clearly states that when the particular provision was included in legislation in 1967 it had been agreed that its operation would be reviewed lest it operate unfairly against certain workers. It seems strange when it has clearly operated unfairly against certain workers that it has not been reviewed. I am not sure what pressures were applied or what representations were made at Government level all along but it seems rather strange that when this was the spirit of the 1967 legislation it was lost sight of. I am glad the Minister has taken a positive approach with regard to this matter. The report tells us that in the course of this year the Ombudsman received a complaint on behalf of a group of workers who had been refused unemployment payment and supplementary welfare allowance even though they were not supporting the strike action and indeed were actively opposing it. Everybody would agree that this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has again referred in some detail to the antiquated law situation. The report highlights the inequitable situation whereby some householders are liable for the cost of repairing water services pipes outside their homes. This comes under the 1898 Local Government Act which clearly is out of touch with modern technology, materials used and developments. The report tells us that the law stands, certain local authorities can and do accept responsibility for service pipes. Another local authority concerned with complaints would be prepared to accept responsibility for maintenance of these pipes but <Col N="183" /> it is not permitted to do so under the law as it stands. I am glad of the Minister's positive approach in this area. It is only proper that the local authority should take responsibility with regard to service pipes as far as the boundary fence. It seems difficult to understand how some local authorities at present can take responsibility right out to the water mains and others are precluded from doing so. It is an area which creates many problems for the reason that in many instances the service pipes are old and there is a buildup of lime and so on in the pipework. It is the responsibility of the local authority. I cannot see any great problem, even with the law as it stands, for any local authority in accepting responsibility, except in a situation where a householder might inadvertently or otherwise, through excavation works or the like, be responsible for damage to a pipe. In the ordinary course of events I think it might be possible to look at the situation. Perhaps it would not be necessary to bring in new legislation to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>Interest on late payments has been referred to by the Minister and by Senator McGonagle. The report refers to a case where a widow's pension was not granted over a period of seven years. There was difficulty with regard to the interest. It states that the lady should be entitled to the money at current rates. The last report also dealt with the unfairness of paying long time arrears or benefits at anything other than current values. It suggested that remedial steps might be taken on the general issue of compensation in cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's reassurance and very positive response in this area is welcomed. The report stated that no change in the procedures has taken place. The Ombudsman proceeded towards finalising his investigation and making a recommendation in favour of this lady. It is not clear to me&mdash;perhaps, it should be &mdash; whether he made a recommendation in favour of paying the interest on the money over that length of time. That would be the proper procedure. I am not sure if the Ombudsman was <Col N="184" /> inhibited in doing so. In any event the Minister of State has said that it will receive sympathetic consideration. This seems to be rather ambiguous. Clearly a decision should be made one way or the other. This sympathetic consideration I am sure is being administered at present but what people really want is the interest they are entitled to. Again, I do not want to bandy words with the Minister of State but I would be more satisfied if he stated quite clearly and categorically that in future back payments of this kind will include interest rates or some means of making up for the loss in the value of money over the time that it was denied. Again, in these cases, I am sure with regard to social welfare payments and with regard to old age pensions, great hardship has been endured by these people. While I welcome the Minister of State's approach I would be much happier when he is replying at the end of the debate if he took the course I stated.</P>
    <P>The year's work is given in great detail, statistically and otherwise, in the report. It has been referred to already so I am not going to spend any time going into details. In one brief paragraph it sets out the important statistic that 5,496 complaints were made, which was more than double the total of 2,267 for the previous year. Five hundred and thirty-one complaints were carried over from 1984 making a grant total of 6,027 to be dealt with in 1985. Out of this total, 5,277 cases came within the remit of the Ombudsman and 3,411 of these were finalised. A successful outcome was achieved for the complainant in 1,086 cases. About one in six people were completely satisfied which, I think, is quite a high number. Advice was given in a further 1,161 cases. Complainants were helped in the direction of other courses of action that were open to them and from which they were likely to benefit. Those statistics would be most encouraging for any individual, not alone the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The greatest number of complaints were in the area of social welfare&mdash; 1,677. I mentioned yesterday evening in my brief contribution on the legal aid scheme that I felt this scheme was not <Col N="185" /> geared towards social welfare, and it should be, with the result that people who have serious grievances in that area have recourse only to the Ombudsman. It seems that if people had that facility with regard to free legal aid that not alone would it reduce the workload of the Ombudsman but those cases could possibly be dealt with more expeditiously because many of them would not go as far as court and they would be settled at an early stage. This is an area that could be looked at. An extension of the free legal aid system would very positively in my estimation reduce the number of complaints to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The next highest number of complaints was 1,419 with regard to Telecom Éireann. Over 1,200 of these were in relation to telephone bills. I have referred to that already. It is a rather unsatisfactory situation. Perhaps it might be possible to have a system of metering telephone calls.</P>
    <P>There is a section dealing with comments and general issues arising from specific complaints. I do not intend to deal with them. They cover the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Education, the Department of the Environment, Land Registry, Revenue Commissioners, health boards, Telecom Éireann and An Post. Some of these have already been referred to. I do not intend to repeat them but they cover quite a comprehensive area.</P>
    <P>With regard to suggestions for a review of existing legislation, this has been referred to by the Minister of State. This is a very important section. Two important matters are referred to. One is retrospection of disability benefit. The case is given of where a man who had worked for over 30 years in insurable employment without ever making a claim against the Department of Social Welfare became seriously ill and treatment of his illness required hospitalisation and major surgery. Due to the serious nature of the illness it took the man just over a year to recover. Because of this and his lack of knowledge of the social welfare system he did not make an application for payment of disability benefit until over 12 <Col N="186" /> months after his illness. His application was refused by the Department. One would expect that where a man had a serious illness requiring hospitalisation and major surgery, and where it is a situation of life and death, the last thing that would be on his mind would be to complete a form for disability benefit. The report quite rightly states that the intention must have been that any seriously ill person who was otherwise eligible would be entitled to disability benefit from the date of commencement of his illness and should not lose out as a consequence of that very illness. That is a statement with which I think everybody would agree. Surely the legislation was intended for that specific purpose and it seems a bureaucratic way of preventing somebody from benefiting in that situation. Again, clearly this does not need any particular legislation. Regulations or statutory instruments could be provided by the Minister to cater for this problem.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the regional visits which are covered in one page. Senator Higgins spoke at some length about the importance of these visits. It is very important that as many as possible with grievances would meet the staff of the Ombudsman and convey their problems directly to them because, in many instances, it is not easy to convey the problem on paper. In any event, people would be far more satisfied if they had an opportunity &mdash; Dickens wrote &mdash; of ocularly perusing the lineaments now familiar to the imagination of a considerable portion of the civilised world, in other words, of actually seeing the individual and speaking to him.</P>
    <P>Staff resources are an important area. The report states on page 40:</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised to learn during the year that the Office is not immune to the effects of the Government's embargo on civil service recruitment. In November 1985, a Receptionist, who had been specially trained for the job, left the Office to take a position in the private sector. Her post could not be filled because of the embargo. Due to the fact that we have only a small number of clerical <Col N="187" /> staff and because of the particular grading requirements of the post, it has not yet been possible to fill the Receptionist post on a permanent basis. With the significant extension of the remit in April 1985 and the ever increasing workload of the Office the effects of the embargo could create very special difficulties for this Office. In my view the staff numbers so recently sanctioned are the very minimum that could satisfactorily deal with the volume of complaints we are now receiving. We simply could not manage if we were to lose posts to the embargo.</P>
    <P>It would be most unfortunate if that were to continue. Yesterday evening, in my brief contribution with regard to free legal aid, I mentioned that the Minister had gone out of his way to deal with the question of the embargo in that area, and some concessions were made. This area is just as important. I recall a couple of years ago calling into the Ordnance Survey Office and speaking to the chief place names officer who was held up because he had not a secretary. There you had a unique individual with unique training in a specialised area who could not do his work simply because the State for one reason or another would not provide a typist. The same applies here. The same applies all over and, while being very conscious of the present situation, I do think that in a sense it is a case of losing the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar. I do not think anybody could justify that. The Ombudsman has made a plea here with regard to the embargo. He mentioned the receptionist specifically to underline his point. Again, I would like the Minister to respond very positively in that area.</P>
    <P>Let me refer very briefly to one or two of the special cases selected, the first regarding accountants acting as professional representatives for farmers. When the Ombudsman took up the matter with the Department they explained to him that the normal policy was to deal directly with farmers or their legal representatives. An accountant acting for a farmer's widow complained to the <Col N="188" /> Ombudsman that the Department of Agriculture had refused to deal with him as her professional representative. It seems extraordinary that the Department would not deal with somebody who was professionally representing this widow. Apparently, they have agreed to extend this recognition to accountants provided the accountants are formally authorised by the farmers to act as their professional representatives. I am sure they would not act if they were not so authorised.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to the matter of the telephone bills. I will not give all the details because there is no need to do so. In one case a credit of £2,184.25 was subsequently allowed to the subscriber. A man wrote to the Ombudsman about three telephone accounts which were completely out of line with all his previous accounts; his average had been in the region of £30 for meter call charges. The three accounts in disute were for £1,549, £213 and £505. Telecom Éireann examined his case but refused to reduce the charges. That sum of £2,184.25 was subsequently refunded &mdash; an enormous sum in my estimation. In another instance a company complained to the Ombudsman in June 1985 about a bill received in mid-1984 for one of their telephone lines. The disputed bill was five times the average bill on that line. The company's managing director had been disputing the bill with Telecom Éireann for over a year. The outcome was that Telecom Éireann agreed to reduce the disputed charge to the average and a rebate of almost £1,800 was granted to the company in November 1985 &mdash; again a very considerable sum.</P>
    <P>In another instance, a telephone subscriber complained to the Ombudsman following his failure, and that of his solicitor, to obtain any satisfactory response from Telecom Éireann about a query on his telephone account. Following the intervention of the Ombudsman, Telecom completed their investigations and discovered that an incorrect meter reading had been recorded following the changeover of the subscriber's line from manual to automatic working. This resulted in an overcharge of £1,303.55 on <Col N="189" /> the account. This overcharge was subsequently credited to the subscriber's account and, as a further gesture of goodwill, Telecom agreed to waive all charges for a ten-week period. I am sure we do not hear of any undercharges. The question comes to mind; with so many overcharges, are there undercharges in many instances? In any event, it is not necessary to go into that aspect.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this report in very broad outline. It is a credit to the Ombudsman and his staff. Again, I pay tribute to the way the report is presented. It is legible, lucid and easy to read. It is informative as any report should be and sets out the basic facts. I am sure it is available from the Government Publications Office. This book should be available to secondary schools and third level educational establishments. Would it be possible to have it circulated on a national basis as that would highlight the work being done? It would be an advertisement for the office and an encouragement to people who would feel that they had some place to turn to. I am apprehensive about the growing number of cases coming before the Ombudsman. What is the reason? Clearly there is a breakdown in many areas and perhaps in a future report the Ombudsman might make suggestions as to ways in which problems could be dealt with without having to go through this lengthy process.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister and the other Members who contributed, I pay tribute to the Ombudsman and his staff and again express some disappointment that more Members of the House were not prepared to make a contribution in relation to such an important report.</P>

      <P>I will not delay unduly but a few points were raised in the debate that perhaps I should reply to if given the opportunity. I express my thanks to the Senators present for the interest they have shown in this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery and others referred to the very substantial increase in the number of complaints to the Ombudsman but in comparing the figures for 1984 with 1985 we should put them in perspective. The increase in numbers is largely due to an increase in the remit of the Ombudsman. There are of course other factors, public awareness and a considerable degree attributable to the regional trips of the Ombudsman and his staff. From that point of view I am not at all alarmed by the increasing numbers; they were a natural consequence of the matters I mentioned. Senator Hillery and others referred to the lingering residual lack of co-operation on the part of some public servants. I referred to this in my opening speech and I made it clear &mdash; and take the opportunity of doing so again &mdash; that I expect absolute wholehearted co-operation from all civil and public servants with the Ombudsman and his staff.</P>
      <P>On the question of recommendations from the Ombudsman leading to reforms it is quite clear that the Ombudsman has rightly used his position to focus attention on certain anomalies and has made various recommendations. I am glad to report that a number of these recommendations have been taken on board by colleagues in introducing changes. I can further confirm that in respect of all the recommendations received from the Ombudsman, very serious consideration will be given by all members of the Government to such recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the <Col N="191" /> very big number of complaints against Bord Telecom and I touched on it in my opening remarks. I am not sure that I agree with the views expressed by Senator Hillery when he suggested that there was evidence that the Ombudsman's office was being misused by telephone customers. In the course of the debate the position became clear. Bord Telecom propose to change the procedures and establish printouts for long distance direct dial calls in a couple of years' time and the probability is that when that is in place many of these complaints will fade away. In the meantime it is likely that the level of complaints will be maintained if not increased and I expect Bord Telecom to co-operate fully with the Ombudsman and his staff in investigating and clearing up these complaints. After initial problems became apparent there, I am glad to say that an improved system of dealing with the inquiries from the Ombudsman is now in place.</P>
    <P>Senator McGonagle and others highlighted the question of late payments and asked what an Ombudsman meant in this regard. The problem is complex and is not capable of a simple solution. We were reminded on that score by a colleague on one occasion when he said that for every complex problem there is a simple solution which does not work and that sums up the situation here. The problem of late payments affects quite a number of areas and while Senator McGonagle dwelt on social welfare recipients, one has also to consider the question of housing grants, grants payable in the agricultural area, farm modernisation grants and so on. We need to develop a common set of principles to govern payment of the various benefits involved. That is highly complex because of the nature of such benefits.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Department of Finance are attempting to solve this riddle with a view to establishing such principles and I have asked that this work be completed urgently. In the meantime changes have taken place in the Department of Social Welfare. It is important <Col N="192" /> to bear this in mind. Senator McGonagle referred to the specific case highlighted by the Ombudsman in his report. It is important to record that that particular case has been resolved and payment made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. In addition the Department of Social Welfare, pending the establishment of broad principle applicable to all Departments, have acknowledged that in exceptional cases interest can be paid and have indicated that in such cases claims will be dealt with sympathetically. That is as far as I can go pending the completion of the overall review. It is a considerable advance in the situation as it was when I was reporting to the House last year.</P>
    <P>There is another point in particular that I am anxious to reply to and that is the reference to the staffing of the Ombudsman's office. It is correct that the Ombudsman did lose one junior post as a result of staffing restrictions. It has to be borne in mind however that this was out of a total complement of 41. It therefore represents a drop of 2½ per cent which is very significantly lower than the average Civil Service reduction which in fact is about 10 per cent. Nobody in this House will suggest to me that we are not on the right track in attempting to reduce numbers in the public service generally. At the same time the case has been made in relation to the Ombudsman's office. Again it has to be borne in mind that there was a substantial increase in the numbers in the Ombudsman's office between 1984 and 1985 when the numbers increased from 15 to 41. That coincided with a very substantial extension of the remit of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>That is the position we are in. That increase from 15 to 41 was made possible despite the severe overall constraints in the Civil Service numbers. It does indicate the very high priority which the Government accord to the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to the Civil Service the embargo no longer applies for 1986. I have replaced that by recommendations in relation to each office and Department which I put before the Government and <Col N="193" /> which were accepted by Government. The embargo referred to by many as a crude instrument does not apply any longer. It has been replaced by a system of staffing target levels to apply at the end of 1986 and within those target levels each Department and office are entitled to make whatever appointments they consider most appropriate to their needs. Even that is academic in so far as the Ombudsman's office is concerned because it is an indication of the priority which I accord to that particular office. The staffing target levels which gave rise to reductions in many Departments and offices does not give rise to any reduction whatever in the Ombudsman's office and the full complement will continue in that office until the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to thank Senators who have shown interest in this debate.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise on the Adjournment the question of extending the disadvantaged areas of west Limerick. I do not know whether it is Mr. Connaughton's brief or that of Mr. Hegarty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Hegarty, Minister of State, visited these areas and saw how bad they are. He visited an area in the vicinity of Kantoher creamery which is very bad. I understand that some of the disadvantaged areas were extended some time ago and we are surprised that some townlands in the Kantoher area, namely Cloncon, Kantoher, Darrira and Ballagh, where there is extremely bad land were not included. Areas in the townlands of Glin, Ballyhahill and Loughill should be classified as disadvantaged areas. The Minister of State, Mr. Hegarty, visited the Cloncon, Kantoher and Darrira areas about three or four <Col N="194" /> months ago and he told the people that in the next review of the disadvantaged areas they would be included. That is what has been conveyed to me. He selected the public representatives who accompanied him because I was not informed nor were the two local Fianna Fáil TDs. However, he considered the farm land in those areas as disadvantaged and was surprised that they were not included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture said on the television programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; that the IFA were equal to the GAA and the Church as a pressure group. He appeared on the programme with Deputy Joe Walsh when the question of the disadvantaged areas also came up. He said that it was the third time the Government requested a review and he could not see much hope of a review by the EC in regard to the disadvantaged areas in Ireland. I was surprised at that after hearing from the people in west Limerick that Mr. Hegarty told them that there would be a review and that he could see no reason for the areas of Cloncon, Kantoher, Darrira and Ballagh not being included in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>My Dáil colleagues in West Limerick had questions down in the Dáil and the Minister in reply to one of those questions said that:</P>
      <P>The most recent review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas was the most extensive and comprehensive examination of the boundaries carried out in this country. It involved the surveying of 10,000 townlands in 600 district electoral divisions covering approximately 4 million acres of lands. The adjustments resulting from this examination represent the maximum possible area that can be included consistent with the criteria laid down in the EC Directive for designating areas as disadvantaged. In this situation, there is no possibility at present of adding still further to the list of areas that are included in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That question was raised about 2 February <Col N="195" /> 1986. Subsequent to that Mr. Hegarty conveyed to people in west Limerick that there was a possibility of the disadvantaged areas being extended so as to include the townlands mentioned and the Minister stated on television that he could not see much hope of an extension. I do not know if he gave some commitment but I am sure the Minister of State present will be able to inform me if he got some commitment as regards extending the disadvantaged areas. I know he got some commitment with regard to increasing the money from Brussels to Ireland. At present the money put up for the disadvantaged areas by the EC has to be matched pound for pound by the Government. Will the EC in the future put up 75 per cent and the Irish Government 25 per cent? That would be an advantage to us and would help the Government in their efforts to get the areas extended.</P>
    <P>I did not like the way the areas were designated initially. The criteria was that they should be done by district electoral divisions. That was very unfair to some farmers. I know of a farmer whose neighbouring farmers on all sides were in the disadvantaged areas scheme because of the district electoral areas but although his land was as bad as the land in the adjacent townlands he could not be included because he was not in a certain district electoral division. That has been remedied and it will now be on the basis of townlands. Whoever designates the disadvantaged areas must include the land that should be in the disadvantaged areas. The areas I was contacted about are Cloncon, Kantoher, Darrira and Ballagh but there is another area that should be included, the area by the Shannon on the Clare-Kerry border. I am referring to the townlands of Kinard, Ballyguiltenane Lower, Ballyguiltenane Upper, Ballynacaul, Tullyglass, Ballyguiltenane North, Killeany More, Killeany Beg, Clonaoughter, Killacolla, Tinnakilla, Flean Beg, Flean More, Kilteery, Curra Beg, Curramore, Ballyahill, Lisready (Clare) Lisready (Cripps), Farrahmiller, Ballynamuddagh and Knocknaboola in <Col N="196" /> the parishes of Glin, Ballyhahill and Loughill and they should be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the area and I know that the land is very bad. Other areas in Cloncon are on the borderline but the townlands I mentioned should be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme. I do not know if Deputy Hegarty, the Minister of State, visited the Glin, Ballyhahill or Loughill areas. He visited the Cloncon and Kantoher areas and assured the people they would be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, aware of whether his colleague was in the Cloncon area? They would not be 20 miles apart and we should have visited both areas and any other area that should be considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas. Because of the last two very bad years for farmers the disadvantaged areas scheme is important for people living in these areas, as this is the sole source of income for many farmers. In order to ensure that they would have a decent standard of living on a par with other sections of the community it is important that disadvantaged areas should include the townlands I have mentioned. There is not much sheep farming in those areas but their inclusion as disadvantaged areas would be a great help to the dairy and beef farmers by way of supplementing their low incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Mr. Hegarty, has seen the area and I am sure he has conveyed to the Minister of State, Mr. Connaughton, who has responsibility for disadvantaged areas the desirability of putting a case to the Commission for the extension of the disadvantaged areas to include the townlands I have mentioned. It was brought to my notice that previous submissions were totally lacking in adequate back-up details. When that happens, it means sending back the submissions and this causes further delay. It is vital that a review of the disadvantaged areas take place soon. It is very important that any submission made by the Minister's Department should have adequate back-up details to ensure a speedy <Col N="197" /> decision. A speedy positive decision would be very beneficial to these farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Kiely for raising this matter. The problem is one that is common to many counties. In the short time at my disposal I will give the House details of the current position and try to outline what we hope and expect will happen in the future. The most recent review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas was the most extensive and comprehensive examination of the boundaries carried out in this country. It involved the surveying of 10,000 townlands in approximately 600 district electoral divisions, covering around four million acres of land. Following completion by the EC Commission of its examination of the submission made by Government on the adjustments to the boundaries, the proposals were finally approved by the EC Council of Ministers last summer and these areas are now included in the headage payments schemes for the current year.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Government's negotiations on this issue, 415,000 acres were included in the disadvantaged areas scheme for the first time and some 870,000 acres which were already included were reclassified. This represented the maximum possible area that could be included or reclassified at the time, consistent with the criteria laid down in the EC directive for designating areas as disadvantaged. It is estimated that some 14,000 farmers will benefit directly as a result of these adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the large number of areas that were very carefully considered in the recent review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas was the position in west Limerick. As a result of the detailed examination of the areas and the subsequent negotiations in Brussels, an additional 29,000 acres was brought in for the first time as a more severely handicapped area in west Limerick. In addition, 15,000 acres in east Limerick were also included for the first time and 17,000 acres of mountain sheep grazing <Col N="198" /> lands in south-east Limerick were reclassified as less severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>As a result of these adjustments, about one quarter or over 150,000 acres of Limerick is now designated as disadvantaged. The bulk of this area is situated in west Limerick where some 120,000 acres are now designated as more severely handicapped. As a result, it qualifies for both cattle and sheep headage payments under the cattle headage scheme, which operates in all more severely handicapped areas and applies to all types of cattle over 6 months and the sheep headage scheme, which is operated in all disadvantaged areas with payment on mountain type ewes and lowland hogget ewes.</P>
    <P>The grant rates under the cattle headage scheme have been increased substantially this year. Beef cow grants have been increased from £32 to £70 on the first 8 cows and from £28 to £66 on the next 22. In addition headage grants on dairy cows have been increased by a quarter. Also, because of the adverse weather conditions this year, the EC Commission have agreed to provide a special increase in the rate of FEOGA funding for the current scheme of headage payments. The detailed arrangements for this increase are being worked out with the Commission and particulars will be announced as soon as possible. However, the important point is that the improved FEOGA funding will enable payments under this year's scheme to be raised and this will be of considerable benefit to Irish farmers both in west Limerick and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the light of the serious problems that have arisen in farming over the past two years with the adverse weather conditions and with increasing pressure on the Common Agricultural Policy, the Government have decided to initiate a further review of the disadvantaged areas for the purpose of extending the boundaries and reclassifying existing areas. The House can rest assured that the position in west Limerick will be among those that will be most carefully considered in this review.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out, however, that <Col N="199" /> a further review of the disadvantaged areas is not just a pure formality. We have already had three reviews of the original boundaries, and a very substantial area has been added to the regions classified as disadvantaged when the scheme was first introduced in 1975. Over 60 per cent of the country now benefits from the various headage schemes operated in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Any widespread further extensions to the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas will of course have to satisfy the EC Commission and will also require the approval of the EC Council of Ministers. Various possibilities are at present being examined which could provide the basis for a submission to the Commission on changes to the boundaries.</P>
    <P>The more extensive and comprehensive the review of the boundaries, the longer it is bound to take to bring to fruition. The Government are most anxious to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible and will do everything within their powers to achieve this. We recognise the difficulties that face farmers on poorer land, particularly in the light of the unfavourable weather conditions that have prevailed in the past year or two.</P>
    <P>We are pursuing this matter as one of priority and some preliminary discussions have already taken place with officials of the European Commission. Obviously, this question of extending the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas has to be dealt with as a whole; we cannot give priority to some areas while disregarding the claims of others. I am sure the farmers in west Limerick would not be willing to see other areas given a priority which did not apply to their own area. We are pressing ahead with the comprehensive work that is entailed and the Seanad can be assured that we aim to bring it to a successful conclusion as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>In reply to one of the points raised by Senator Kiely we changed the method of the unit of calculation from the DED's which caused untold trouble and in the last review we brought it down to the <Col N="200" /> townland area. That was a good development, and many areas of the 1.2 million acres that were brought in would not have been eligible had it not been broken down to the townlands.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the 75 per cent recoupment. As he quite correctly pointed out it is on a 50-50 basis that this is funded. We have put a very special case to the EC that we should be entitled to more. But with the problems they have in Europe at the moment, we are likely to have an up-hill fight on that.</P>

      <P>That is a very difficult question to answer. There are two different types of problems involved. It involves reclassifying some areas that are already less severely handicapped. You do not have to go through the same process to get the ultimate service which everybody wants, that is with regard to the severely handicapped areas. Then there are the existing areas which are not classified under any particular service at the moment. A review of that would probably take a long time. Since we joined the EC we have had three such reviews. A fair amount of data has to be collected, and written into our particular staffing systems. One has to be extremely well prepared when going to the Commission with something like that because you have to meet certain very strict criteria. Against that background it is difficult to know how the cookie will crumble. We are taking both sides of it very seriously.</P>
