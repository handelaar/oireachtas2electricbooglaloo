      <P>I have a report from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>When the then Minister of State to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Joe Bermingham, spoke in this Chamber in December last he indicated that a job which started out to repair cracks in the plasterwork of the ceiling led to the discovery of dry rot in the rafters and to the necessity to replace a large timber beam which had sagged considerably in the middle and which supports the upstand at the front of the recess.  As a result of the preparatory work undertaken in the replacement of this beam by a steel girder structural weaknesses have come to light in the form of extensive cracks in the wall which supports the beam.  So far these cracks have only been investigated above the level of the false, ceiling.  It will now, however, be necessary to strip the wall of the Chamber itself and possibly continue down through the Library and into the foundations.  What was originally a job of plaster repair work, slow and labour-intensive but largely cosmetic, has now escalated into a major structural operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing working arrangement these structural repairs could involve some risk to the Members of the Seanad and would take an inordinate <Col N="794" /> amount of time.  Consequently, the Commissioners of Public Works are submitting to me for our consideration detailed proposals for the completion of the work. These proposals will be with me within three weeks from today.  Once I receive them I will bring them to your attention without delay.</P>

      <P>Is it intended that the House should give more formal consideration to this document or to the report in three weeks time?  It appears to me that dry rot has extended far beyond the ceiling into certain Government Departments. An epidemic of dry rot has broken out in the Office of Public Works.  The thing is a bit farcical to say the least of it. There is no point in discussing it now, but we should take the opportunity of the report in three weeks time to have a discussion either in private or a formal one in public &mdash; I do not really mind.  We should decide what we are going to do. It may well mean that the House would have to meet elsewhere or do something else like that.  It is very important that we should give the matter consideration.  I suggest that the matter would be considered by the Leader of the House and the Whips and the leaders of the other groups and parties in the House and that a set of proposals would be laid before the House shortly after this report is received in three weeks' time.  The House should be given the opportunity of expressing their views on those proposals.</P>

      <P>I can do nothing more than concur with your suggestion, which is the most appropriate action.  All groups in this House are represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. <Col N="795" /> The committee have discussed this matter on a number of occasions.  We should take notice of what Senator O'Leary has said and we should accept the position that this House does expect, as soon as that report is available and that once there has been a reasonable amount of time for the committee to consider it, a substantial report and recommendation from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be made to this House.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator John Browne, that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matters:</P>
      <P>The proposed closure of St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan of the following matters:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make provision for the Cappanalea outdoor centre in Killorglin, County Kerry, which is threatened with closure.</P>
      <P>I also received notice of another matter from Senator Deenihan as follows:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to sanction proposals for (i) the new School, Scoil Mhiceasmainn, Tralee, County Kerry and (ii) the extension of Coolard National School, Listowel, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jim Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to drain the Holymount River and thereby alleviate the hardship caused to farmers by the flooding of 430 acres of excellent land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator <Col N="796" /> Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The growing crisis in the Philippines and the urgent need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use every available means to promote peace and political stability in that country.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Howlin of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister of State for the Arts to direct the Arts Council to continue their support for the Wexford Festival Opera.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Browne, Deenihan and Higgins as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Howlin is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of official responsibility.  I have also to disallow the matter raised by Senator Bulbulia as not now being appropriate to be raised on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Browne's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senators Deenihan and Higgins may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a misuse being made of this House.  There has been enough misuse of this House by various elements in the media over the last number of weeks.  I raised the matter of the closure of two hospitals here.  I asked for an Adjournment debate in the Seanad so that we could have a proper discussion on the closure of the hospital in Carlow and the hospital in Castlerea and we were ruled out of order on one occasion and we were voted out.  I had an arrangement made with the Whip that we would have a three-hour debate on the hospitals and because of some problem that arose in Government circles we were not allowed that three-hour debate.  Now we are going to be fobbed off with a half-hour debate on the closure. It is disgraceful that this ruling has been made.  I am not blaming the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> I want the closure of St. Dympna's Hospital to be raised in this House.  I want it to be properly debated but we are frustrated in this House because a vote was taken.  The Cathaoirleach would not, on advice, allow that this House be adjourned to discuss these closures.  Last week there was a vote taken and the debate on the closure was turned down by vote.  Now we have a half-hour debate on a matter of extreme urgency.  I would ask the Chair that if this debate takes place this evening it be an open-ended debate and that it not be confined or else we will not agreee at all to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Senator's point certainly but he raised the question under Standing Order 29.  I had no alternative according to the Standing Order but to rule it out of order.  It is in order for a debate on the Adjournment but not in order under&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I do not want to dispute the point, but can you read out Standing Order 29 and tell me where under No. 29 you should have ruled it out of order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make the observation that Item No. 41 on the Order Paper states precisely what is going to be discussed in this matter.  Something on an Order Paper should get precedence over something being taken on the Adjournment. It does not seem right that something that appears legitimately on the Order Paper should be interfered with, upstaged &mdash; call it what you like &mdash; by something for the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no control over what debates will take place or when motions will be taken.  That is a matter for the machinery of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that Senator Fallon has made, that just <Col N="798" /> because their motion No. 41 is on the Order Paper this gives it some sort of precedence: No. 41 can be taken on the next occasion when Fianna Fáil are entitled to put toward a motion in Private Members' time.  That is the position.  I want as Leader of the House to say that during the currency of this Seanad the Opposition have had far more opportunity than on previous occasions to bring forward motions of this type.  Merely putting a motion down on the Order Paper does not give any entitlement other than that it will be taken in its turn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>In the matter of the motion that I submitted on the Philippines &mdash; of course I do not want to quarrel with your ruling &mdash; I would like to make the point that I consider it was a proper use of parliamentary time in that this was an event of international significance.  It has not been debated in either House of the Oireachtas.  So I used the mechanism open to me to raise it on the Adjournment. Happily that matter is resolved.  It has certainly proved to all here that a week is a long time in politics.</P>

      <P>I cannot help wondering about the state of relations in the Government parties when all the issues on the Adjournment are being raised by supporters of the Government.  Have they no means of communication with the Minister other than to raise matters on the Adjournment in the Seanad?</P>

      <P>I would like to seek your <Col N="799" /> guidance on a matter.  Of course I accept your ruling on my motion on the removal of funding for Wexford Festival Opera. What I want is your guidance on how I can bring up this matter.  It is of extreme urgency.  The decision was announced arbitrarily a fortnight ago.  The festival must have funding within the next six weeks if it is going to take place in 1986. This particular festival has been built up with the hard work of Wexford people over 30 years.  It would be appalling if this showcase of Ireland were destroyed by the action of the Arts Council.  I seek your guidance on how to have a proper debate on it.</P>

      <P>Senator Howlin is talking about how important the arts are.  The Leader of the House has told us it will be our turn next &mdash; in a month's time.  At the rate the Minister for Health is going, he will have all the hospitals closed down in a month's time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear unreasonable but we are not going to accept that you turn down a debate.  A three-hour debate on the closure of hospitals was turned down.  What will happen this evening is that Senator Browne will come in and make his suggestion about Carlow and tell another few fables &mdash; I am surprised he is not here since it is his motion &mdash; and the Minister for Health will get a chance to reply that it is Government policy, which is rubbish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in regard to your ruling under Standing Order 29, most of us understand how impartial you are in these matters.  We should accept that.  With regard to the question of the motion, there is some danger when we talk about motions on the Adjournment and also in the way the Fianna Fáil motion is put down &mdash; I agree that there should be a full debate as soon as possible <Col N="800" />&mdash; that other things that happen in the health area, such as buildings being opened would be ignored by just dealing with closures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senators on the other side of the House are serious in the desire to have a proper discussion on the closure of both St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow and St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea, then the way to do it is not by a half-hour motion on the Adjournment.  I would suggest that rather than have the half-hour motion on the Adjournment that we should have one-and-half-hours this evening and one-and-a-half hours on next Wednesday evening on the motion that is there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>But Senator Connor was allowed in on the Adjournment on the closure of Castlerea hospital and Senator Browne is allowed in this evening on the closure of St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow.  I was just as anxious about Castlerea as Senator Connor was and yet on the evening that Senator Connor raised the matter on the Adjournment I did not manage to be allowed to make any contribution that evening, except to support the sentiments expressed by Senator Connor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed today to take Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 as they appear on the Order Paper.  As there are two hours remaining for debate on item No. 6 it is proposed that this should take place from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. to be preceded by a suspension of the sitting from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Between now and 5 p.m. we will take as much of Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 as can be covered.  It is proposed that if any of those Bills has been commenced but not concluded at 5 p.m. for the sake of avoiding the strangling of business from week, to week it will in fact be completed tomorrow morning.  Also, I understand that there is a small amending Courts Bill which it is necessary to pass into law very quickly.  It is consequential arising from the extension of the County Borough of Galway and has to be passed urgently in order to allow the courts to operate in the city and county of Galway under the new dispensation.  That Bill will, I understand, be received from the Dáil today.  It is proposed also to take that tomorrow morning.  The Seanad is sitting tomorrow morning at 10.30, going on until 5 p.m.  The legislation having being disposed of it is proposed to take tomorrow items Nos. 7 and 8.</P>

      <P>This is about the seventh or eighth time over the last 12 months that I have asked the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take No. 26.  Over the last week we have seen some strong criticism from Bishop Comiskey in relation to this matter.  We have also seen <Col N="803" /> the ridiculous situation where family-run competitions on RTE television had to be withdrawn.  These were being run for the pleasure of paid-up TV licence holders while we have, on the other hand, people who run unlicensed radio stations in competition with everyone and paying nobody.  I know the Leader is genuine in all his replies but I must start questioning the reasons behind the Government decision in not bringing the matter into the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before Senator Dooge continues, anything I have said here is not a criticism of the Cathaoirleach, but the fact is that what we asked to put as a matter of urgency on the Adjournment was turned down.  We asked for a debate on the closure of the hospitals; it was turned down.  Last week and this week the two items taken on the Adjournment were single items from two Senators on the Government side and related to the same problem.  You, a Chathaoirleach, by your decision have eliminated us from discussing the closures of these hospitals.  In half an hour the Minister and the Member on the Adjournment dictates the amount of time to be taken.  In future, if a decision is being made on the Adjournment, I ask that the Government side will not get the same opportunity to discuss matters of urgency as happened in the last fortnight. It is a disgrace.</P>

You had to decide on the matter to be discussed on an order of priority and you <Col N="804" /> picked two motions, one last week and one this week, from the Government side which relate to the same matter and which gives the Minister the opportunity to come in and fool the public on what is happening in St. Dympna's in Carlow and St. Patrick's in Castlerea.  We are not getting a chance to express our opinions on these matters and that is disgraceful. I am not talking politics on this one.  In essence, I am talking about the ruling of the Chair, which has dictated over the past two weeks that we were not allowed to bring up the matter.  We were voted out by the other side on a three-hour debate and then it comes up on the Adjournment.  Next week again it may come up on a Government motion on the Adjournment.  There is no opportunity for the Opposition to raise the matter at all.</P>

      <P>In replying to the relevant points that we made on the Order of Business I would like to say the following: firstly, I want to be quite clear about the business proposed for tomorrow morning.  The first item taken will be the Second Stage of the Courts Bill and it is hoped to take the remaining stages immediately afterwards.  Following that it will be necessary to have a Motion for Early Signature by the President in order that this Bill can become law as soon as possible.  Following the disposal of the matter of the Courts Bill, if there is any legislation, the discussion of any Stage of which has commenced this evening but was not concluded by 5 p.m., it is proposed that that would then be taken tomorrow and either concluded by 5 p.m. or run through until 5 p.m.  If that discussion does not run through until 5 p.m. the motions that are next on the Order Paper, Motion No. 7 regarding the Joint Committee on Women's Rights in relation to social welfare and the report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC on the crisis in farming will be taken.  There are other agricultural motions which will be taken in their turn although it is doubtful if there will be time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the query about the Air Pollution Bill, this is an extremely important piece of legislation.  We are all very glad that we have got it introduced in the Seanad as a Bill so that we can have a thorough debate on it.  It has not been ordered today because we wish to dispose of the National Development Corporation Bill and the Air Transport Bill before we deal with it.  Unfortunately, the Minister himself will not be available next week.  Otherwise, we would have hoped to debate the Air Pollution Bill, but I have every hope that the Minister will be available this day fortnight for the discussion of the Air Pollution Bill.</P>

    <P>In regard to the query by Senator Cassidy about Item No. 26, which is the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, the Senator knows that I have been making inquiries about this.  It is bound <Col N="807" /> up with a Bill in the Dáil.  The wish of the Minister is that they should both move at the same time.  I have been continuing to press him on that point.  As I only returned from the United States overnight, I have not pressed him this week on it, but I will be in touch with him before the week is out.  I think I have dealt with the point.</P>

I hope the Minister got the Ministry he wanted.  He now is Minister for Industry and Commerce only.  Last week, on Second Stage, when we put this Bill through we had a Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. Whether he was too pleased about it or not I do not know, but Deputy John Bruton put a lot of this Bill through, and fair play to him.  Have we now two <Col N="808" /> Ministers involved in this legislation?  In the contributions on the Second Stage much emphasis was placed on how this Bill could benefit tourism, or where it might give more jobs.  Now we find that tourism is gone away from you, Minister Noonan.  Just to clear the lines, I appreciate that this is because of the change of Ministries and the change of titles.  Is tourism gone now to another Minister, or where has it gone?  Does that mean, then, that the parts of this Bill that might have something to do with tourism would not be under the control of your Department?  I suppose your reply will be that it does not make any difference. Many contributions referred to tourism. Will they be covered at all when this board is set up, because tourism has gone from this Minister's portfolio?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Honan's concern in this regard and I just want to clarify in my mind too.  The reason, first of all, that we have an amendment is that with the restructuring of the Cabinet, portfolios and responsibilities, the Ministry responsible for the legislation and for ensuring that it functions is, in fact, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We consider that, irrespective of which Department has responsibility for implementing the legislation or whether it is the Department in charge of forestry, tourism, fisheries, energy or anything else, the National Development Corporation could and should be involved in developments in such areas.  I would take it that because the legislation is in one Department there is no embargo or any other Department or, indeed, any other Minister being involved.  As I understand it, the function of the NDC is to stimulate equity investment from the private and public sector, and that could, and should, involve all the Departments, particularly those involved in the national resources of our country and their development. That would of course, include anything connected with tourism, fisheries, forestry and any other resource that we have.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): What we have here is section 2, which is the definition section of the Bill.  We have the agency, the Companies Acts, the corporation and so on down along the line until you come to the Minister.  The Minister as defined, before the changes in ministerial title in my Department, means the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  So, wherever the Minister is mentioned in the Bill, up to now it meant Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, because the title of my Department is now changed to its more traditional name, Industry and Commerce.  Anywhere the Minister is referred to in the Bill as a matter of definition, it will now mean the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That is all that is involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Senator Ferris is concerned, under the Bill it is the corporation, not the Minister or any individual Minister, who will evaluate investment decisions. All initiatives will be in the hands of the corporation, not in the hands of any individual Minister.  While there are certain powers which are within the remit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; and there are certain powers within the remit of the Minister for Finance and certain powers within the remit of the Minister for the Public Service in the Bill &mdash; none of those involve the decisionmaking process of what particular enterprise is aided by the provisions of this Bill.  Those decisions are in the hands of the corporation.  It will operate in that way.  This is a technical change simply to allow for the fact that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is now called the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The House is aware that the Minister of State who has been in charge of tourism in the past is still in <Col N="810" /> charge of tourism, but now he is reporting directly to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry rather than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan might be glad to know that in so far as SFADCo are concerned, all their functions including their tourist functions, and travel functions are within my remit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want just a little bit of clarification.  In section 3 (3) it states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order amend the First or Second Schedule to this Act by adding the name of any body to either Schedule or deleting the name of any body there from.</P>
      <P>It is a little bit difficult for me to try to get this point across.  For example, would it be within the powers of the Minister, rather than the National Development Corporation in this case, to add something of a new nature, such as the construction industry or a construction federation or some body that might reform the construction industry?  Is it within the capacity of the Minister to do a thing like that, or would it be within the capacity of the National Development Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It was difficult to draft precisely a definition of what a State-sponsored body actually was.  Also, there was difficulty in actually defining a State-sponsored commercial enterprise.  Rather than attempting a definition which would contain all of the bodies we are so familiar with in the first instance, like Córas Tráchtála, the IDA and so on, and in the second instance the State-sponsored commercial enterprises like CIE, Bord Na Móna, the ESB and so on, the advice on drafting was to have <Col N="811" /> two schedules, so that there would be absolutely no doubt.  Rather than approaching the matter by an attempt to define, it was better to list all the companies involved.  They have to be State-sponsored bodies to be in the list, either on the commercial enterprise side or on the State-sponsored side.  The idea of adding a private construction company would not arise within the terms of the Bill at all.  What is open to the Minister is this: if a new State enterprise or a new State body is set up, then the Minister, by Order before the Houses of the Oireachtas can make an addition; or if one of the bodies listed in the schedule discontinues its activities, and there is no point in having it there any more because it is no longer operational, the Minister can remove that from the list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply is very adequate.  I would ask the Minister now about the question of the power of the Minister to remove, by ministerial order, anybody from the First and Second Schedule.  It would be a very serious step, for example, for a Minister by ministerial order to decide that he would take one or two things off the list, or one from either side of the list.  Certainly in the nature of business if it was seen to be removed by ministerial order rather than an open debate, it could jeopardise &mdash; whether it was a private enterprise or a public enterprise &mdash; the functioning of that service or industry, or whatever it might be.</P>

Does this provision on page 17 mean that a Minister, by a ministerial order, without coming to the Houses of the Oireachtas, could remove the Shannon Free Airport Development Company from the list?

With reference to section 3, I have a horror of Ministers giving this power to themselves and not bringing it back.  We are the ones who must answer the questions. The Minister, I appreciate, is an elected person, as I am &mdash; but the people outside the House do not understand, and they accept very little now from politicians. They will not understand or accept this power which the Minister has taken to himself to remove any of the bodies mentioned on page 17.

There was specific reference to bodies such as the IDA, CTT and Bord Fáilte. I would like to know how that will affect the performance of those particular bodies, as they now operate?  Will it be expected to improve their performance or curtail it?  At the present time the IDA or the other bodies I have mentioned are not able to cope with the ever-increasing spate of closures of factories across the <Col N="813" /> country at the present time.  It has reached very serious proportions.  As I said on Second Stage, I would prefer &mdash; and I would hope &mdash; that this House would debate some emergency legislation to add more power to those bodies as they now operate, to try to halt the slide to industrial chaos which we are on at present.</P>

It is best that they be put down in the two Schedules.  When I was reading subsection (3) there was a question of considerable power in the Minister's hands.  Then I came to the conclusion that one has to read section 4 with section 3.  Would I be right in saying that the power is qualified?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGonagle has dealt with some of the points.  The first <Col N="814" /> question by Senator Harte was a very relevant one.  The Minister answered it on the basis of the number of State-sponsored bodies and State-sponsored commercial enterprises which we have now in the country.  Under this section the Government are empowered at any time to include a new semi-State body.  If it was not provided for in this Schedule it would mean that we would have to relegislate in order to include it.  This enabling section allows the Minister to add to it or take from it, as Senator Hillery said, if it ceases.  The only way that can be done is under section 4, by debating it in the House whereby agreement would be reached.  I do not want to intermingle sections 3 and 4, but it is quite clear to us what exactly the Minister wants to do.  Either we legislate for what we know now with the power to add if the occasion arises, or we will be tying ourselves up, as we were originally, to the particular names, and if any technical change happened we would have to legislate again.  It is difficult for the House to comprehend it, but when trying to deal with legislation it is the only way.  Provided that the Minister's order, adding to or taking from the Schedules, is debated publicly here and the reasons given publicly and a vote taken, only then can that power be given to the Minister.  It is confined.  It is not a positive but a negative way to do it.  I would prefer it to be more positive, so that before the Minister's order was confirmed a positive affirmation would be needed in the House rather than it should be dealt with under section 4.  We will probably deal with it better when discussing section 4.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think the major proposals in this Bill are in section 10.  If I could refer the Senators to section 10 (1) (b), one of the powers that the new corporation will have will be &ldquo;to invest, in consultation, where appropriate, with State-sponsored bodies&rdquo;, etc. to the end of the section. <Col N="815" /> Rather than trying to define a State-sponsored body, they are listed in two schedules. We are talking about the power of the NDC to act under the mandate given in section 10 (1) (b).  Where it refers to State-sponsored bodies that is spelt out in the two Schedules.  That is all that is involved.  The power of the Minister to add or substract from that list simply refers to the list of State-sponsored bodies that it would be appropriate for the NDC to enter into arrangements with.  If a new State-sponsored body was created, you can see the need for addition. The need for substraction would only occur when a State-sponsored body would cease completely to act in a particular way.  There might be a case for deleting it then, or there might be a case for just leaving it in the Schedule, if it did not do anybody any harm.</P>
      <P>I could envisage a situation where the functions of a State-sponsored body could be subsumed in a new State-sponsored body.  If one was adding a new State-sponsored body, it might be appropriate to delete a State-sponsored body that was no longer active and whose functions had been subsumed in a new one.  That is all that is in question here. The mechanism for addition or substraction is in section 4, which is coming up. It does require to be placed before both Houses.  The possibility is there, in both Houses, to reject that.  If one looks at section 4 (2), it states that if either House rejects the proposition, then the Minister cannot act.  The power of the Minister is curbed by the Dáil and by the Seanad, as is appropriate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 6, I wonder if the Minister is satisfied with the whole procedure that has been implemented.  He seems to be doing two contradictory things.  On the one hand he seems to be establishing what is, in effect, a State company with certain criteria and, indeed, part of the memorandum and articles of association being laid down by an Act of the Oireachtas. On the other hand the Minister is establishing the company under the Companies Act.  There seems to be a certain contradiction there.  As the Minister will be aware, under the Companies Act the registrar has certain powers and duties with regard to the question of refusing to register or not refusing to <Col N="817" /> register a company of a particular name. What we are effectively doing is putting on top of that situation a duty on the Minister to register and presumably by implication a duty on the registrar to accept the registration of a particular company of a particular name by statutory authority of the Oireachtas.  It appears to me that that could in certain circumstances be in conflict with the registrar's other duties.</P>
    <P>We have examples of that recently.  As we go through this Bill there are one or two cases where this will show up to be extremely difficult.  I raise it under section 6 because under section 6 we say: that &ldquo;a limited company (in this Act referred to as &lsquo;the Corporation&rsquo;) conforming to the conditions laid down in this act shall be formed and registered under the Companies Acts&rdquo;.  What is the position if the Minister went to the registrar and said, &ldquo;I want to establish a company called the National Development Corporation Limited.  It conforms with the conditions laid down in the National Development Corporation Act, 1986&rdquo; and the registrar says: &ldquo;Well, unfortunately it does not conform with my interpretation of my duties under the Companies Act&rdquo;?  We could have a situation where we had two things in conflict.  I do not think we adequately covered that.  There may be some section in the Bill that covers it.  I do not see it.  I have a similar comment to make with regard to the question of ceasing the operation or dissolving the previous agency.  The Minister might like to prepare to answer queries about this point, which I will be raising again.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The National Enterprise Agency and all its powers, responsibilities, liabilities, and so on, will be subsumed in the new company. The Government attached great importance to the National Development Corporation and decided to give it legislative backing.  Theoretically it could have been instructed me, or somebody in my Department, to register a private company and proceed from there, but it decided in the first instance to bring it before the Houses of the Oireachtas, <Col N="818" /> because of the importance attached to it, and give it the legislative framework. Because the corporation will be in the commercial world, it will be a commercial body and it will be dealing with companies in a commercial manner.  For that reason the corporation is being registered as a private limited company.  Most of its activity will be involved in dealing with other private limited companies.  On the question of the Houses of the Oireachtas imposing a duty on the registrar to register, that is not so.  Discussions have taken place with the registrar but the registrar retains his powers and the limited company which will be set up here will have to comply in full company law and will have to operate like any other private company.</P>
      <P>We are very interested that from the start it would be known publicly that the NDC is to operate on commercial criteria like any other private company in the commercial world.  For that reason this mechanism has been devised.  There are steps taken to enable the company to be formed and registered under the Companies Act and to have its memorandum and articles of association drafted.  A firm of solicitors have been engaged to carry out the necessary drafting.  Already, there is a draft of the memo, and articles have been prepared.  These are the subject of discussions between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the solicitors I have mentioned.  They cannot be finalised until the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas.  However, by having the drafting at an advanced stage it will enable the company to be formed at the earliest possible date.  I take the points made by Senators in dealing with previous sections.  It is important that a new initiative and a new dynamic should enter the body politic and enter the commercial life of the economy of the country in order to create jobs but the criteria here are commercial and will continue to be commercial.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's determination to bring this matter into the public arena.  That is the correct way of doing it.  The Minister is right.  For a <Col N="819" /> company and the National Development Corporation of this size and significance it is right and proper that the establishment of the company should be discussed by the Oireachtas and decided on by the Oireachtas.  I am not arguing with the Minister on that point.  I support the Minister in that regard.  I am not arguing with the Minister with regard to the question that it is also worthwhile that it should be registered as a limited liability company under the Companies Act.  I am merely seeking to suggest that there are certain parts of this Bill, for example, which state that the name of the company shall be the National Development Corporation. I will not even attempt to pronounce the name in the first official language.  That is a duty which has been imposed on the Minister in establishing this company.  Therefore, to that extent alone we are pre-empting the right of the Registrar of Companies to say &ldquo;I do not consider that name suitable.&rdquo;  I am not suggesting with regard to a matter like the name that he is going to adopt that attitude.  I use it only as an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, I am sure, within this Bill many other cases where a duty is being imposed on the Minister and on those who are establishing the company which might at some time in the future conflict with the duty of the Registrar and, therefore, I would have thought that consideration would be given to some kind of a saving clause which would enable the Minister or the Registrar not to have this potential for conflict in the future.  It is not the first time that this has been used in the establishment of State-sponsored bodies.  Some State-sponsored bodies have been established by Acts of the Oireachtas directly; others have been established by limited liability companies under the Companies Act.  Different systems have been used.  It strikes me that there is a potential for conflict, which I think the Minister obviously recognises. I am not suggesting that it exists as it is in this Bill, but the potential for conflict does exist.  I wonder whether it should be addressed in the Bill and the position clarified that there would not be any <Col N="820" /> problem in the future regarding this type of legislation.  I am not pressing the Minister any further than that, but I just want to make that point.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Registrar of Companies is an officer of my Department.  He is aware of what we are doing and he is aware of the legislation. Some discussions have taken place with him.  While it is theoretically possible that the difficulties pointed out by Senator O'Leary concerning the name of the company and the registration of the company might arise, in the practical situation, with discussions taking place and having taken place for some time, I do not envisage any problem with this.  It would be difficult to proceed without a name on the company.  If we were to say that the National Development Corporation title gives a particular difficulty, any other title one could dream up could also potentially give a difficulty.  It would be difficult to proceed without putting a name on what we are doing.  I do not envisage any practical difficulty.  Once the company is registered it will have to comply with the full <i>corpus</i> of company law the same as any other private company.</P>

      <P>This section refers to the vesting day.  I should like to ask the Minister what his best estimate is, as of now, for vesting day.  It will be evident from what I said on Second Stage that I felt that the enactment of this legislation was a step in the wrong direction.  I have no difficulty with the idea of an investment agency in principle but rather I think the emphasis should be on creating a climate where investment would be possible. I argued that on Second Stage.  That having been said, this legislation will for sure pass through the Seanad, be signed by the President and duly become law. Given that its primary objective is to <Col N="821" /> assist in relieving the grave unemployment problem facing the country and, in addition to that, given the forecast today by the ESRI that by 1990 we will still have 250,000 people on the dole, it seems to me that the vesting day is vital if this body is to work out in practice at all in meeting its primary objective.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister to give his best estimate of vesting day so that the corporation can get down to business at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not accept that the objectives of an enterprise agency, as Senator Hillery refers to the NDC, and the establishing of an investment climate in a country are exclusive, or need be exclusive, and certainly the Government do not see them as exclusive. Obviously, we are interested in and will continue to be interested in taking steps to establish the proper investment. environment and atmosphere in this country.  It is also fair to say that an investment agency can play a very important role.  For many years now we seem to lack the sense of entrepreneurial skill and spirit that is in other countries. There is a vacuum which the NDC will fill, and will fill successfully, provided everybody is clear that the Bill is only allowing the company to operate on commercial criteria.  It has to operate on commercial criteria.  That is spelt out in every subsection of section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the vesting date, I would like the company to be vested as quickly as possible.  There are a number of considerations, the primary one is how soon the legislation can pass through this House and be signed into law by the President.  Obviously, we cannot vest before that.  I am very conscious of the desire to vest very quickly.  A company of solicitors are preparing in advance the memorandum and articles of association which are necessary to set up the private limited company to which I referred. There are other considerations as well, which should not necessarily delay the <Col N="822" /> Bill, but they have to be in one's mind when one is selecting a vesting day.  For accounting purposes it might be preferable for the NDC to commence operations from the first day of a month or the first day of a quarter.  Also it is worth remembering that the National Enterprise Agency might need some time to tidy up business on hands, because its functions, activities and liabilities are being subsumed in the NDC.  Also a full board of directors has to be agreed and appointed.  Certainly, it would be my intention to proceed as quickly as possible as soon as the Seanad passes the legislation.</P>

I would also like to ask the Minister to examine the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 is a blockbuster which is hard to comprehend in its entirety.  The method of debate we use means that we have to try to comprehend it in its entirety.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that it can be divided into three sections.  The first section, which is subsections (1) and (2), deals with the objects of the corporation. Subsection (3) deals with the powers of the corporation.  There are various subsidiary sections beyond that &mdash; subsections (4), (5) and (6).  There appears to be a well-established difference between what the object of a company is and what its powers are.  It is important that we should see whether the objects of the corporation as stated here are drawn widely enough to enable the Minister to do all the things which he wants to do under the legislation.  I have no objection to the breadth of the drawing of these objects.  The difference between objects and powers could be simply laid down as follows.  The objects of a corporation or company are the things for which it is established and which it may lawfully do.  The powers of a corporation on the other hand gives the company the power to do something but only in so far as they are consistent with the objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objects take precedence.  The principal objects are laid down in subsections (1) and (2).  They are the overriding authority under which the National Development Corporation will act.  Certain powers are given in subsection (3) which, in so far as those powers are consistent with the objects, they can be carried out by the corporation.  If any of the powers are inconsistent with the objects they cannot be done.  In all the objects as laid out here the power to sell, realise or otherwise dispose of the investment, which because of this revolving fund mechanism, is an essential part of the <Col N="824" /> idea of the National Development Corporation &mdash; that the same money can be used over and over again to provide more and more useful employment in the public sector.  This does not appear in the principal objects in a direct fashion.  The principal objects merely say that you can establish, you can assist, you can invest, but it never says that you can devest, that you can sell.  The power to realise is done only with the object of investing somewhere else.  It appears to be inadequately laid out in the principal objects of the corporation.  It is referred to indirectly in section 10 (2), which states:</P>
    <P>In carrying out its objects the Corporation shall have regard to the general duties under section 13.</P>
    <P>Section 13 refers to the question of the realisation of investments.  It would be more straightforward and certain if a provision was included in the Bill giving the corporation, as one of its objectives, the object of realising, selling or disposing of its investments.  Leaving aside the real meaning of subsection (2), together with section 13 to which it refers, nowhere within the objects clause as drafted before us in the power to sell, realise or otherwise dispose of the investments granted.  The granting to the corporation of a power to do that is not sufficient to give the company that power unless it is at least consistent with the principal objects of the corporation as stated in the memorandum.  Judge Ronan Keane, a distinguished High Court Judge, recently published a book entitled <i>Company Law in the Republic of Ireland.</i>  Reference is made as follows at page 45:</P>
    <P>Distinction between objects powers and objects</P>
    <P>The powers of a company must be carefully distinguished from its objects.  The objects clause, for example, will frequently authorise the company to borrow money; but in the case of most companies this is not an <i>object</i> of the company properly speaking but rather a <i>power</i> which it requires to achieve its objects.  As we have seen, <Col N="825" /> in addition to powers expressly conferred, a company may also enjoy implied powers which it may require to attain its stated objects.  But such powers, whether conferred expressly or by implication, may not be used for purposes which are themselves <i>ultra vires</i> or for an object not stated in the memorandum.</P>
    <P>If one of the principal objects of the company is to operate the revolving fund mechanism and to invest in companies and as they come to fruition to devest themselves so that more money is available for investing in other companies, it would appear to me that it would be better draftsmanship if the object to sell, realise or otherwise dispose of the investments was included among the principal objects of the company.</P>
    <P>I understand that this is a very technical argument.  I do not expect the Minister to give an immediate answer.  I would like the Minister to give the matter some consideration because I am concerned about it.  It would be helpful to the Minister and to the corporation also because, in establishing a corporation like this by an Act of the Oireachtas, we are limiting to a certain extent the freedom of operation of the corporation.  I am anxious that that limitation be minimal and that the maximum amount of commercial freedom be given to the corporation.  I know that the Minister shares my objective and it is in that spirit that I make this observation concerning the drafting of section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator O'Leary has raised this point.  I am rather confused about it.  I am satisfied that the corporation has the power.  The power is the means; the objects are an end. Having read the Bill, I came to the conclusion that the power in subection (3) (a) &ldquo;to sell, realise or otherwise dispose of its investments&rdquo;&mdash; and Senator O'Leary has raised a niggling doubt in my mind &mdash; that the Bill would be stronger if that &ldquo;sell, realise or dispose of its investments&rdquo; was making a contribution to the revolving fund, which is the <Col N="826" /> dynamic.  The heart of the matter is in section 10.  I would find it very difficult to draft any kind of amendment.  If &ldquo;to sell, realise or otherwise dispose of its investments&rdquo; is to be transferred under the heading of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, that is a legal technicality that I am not prepared to say anything about.  I accept what Senator O'Leary has said.  When speaking on Second Stage I said I had accepted that the revolving fund had the power and the authority to sell, use their profit margins, surplus values, or even to sell a project to realise or otherwise dispose of its investments.  Now that a doubt exists as between means and ends, the power to me is a means or an instrument.  I would like the Minister to clarify that now, because a niggling doubt has been raised in the legal sense.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank Senators for their contributions. Anything that is said by way of debate here will be carefully considered. I should like to draw the attention of Senators to section 13 (b) where there is a general duty on the corporation to carry out its objects and that shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as it is financially and commercially prudent etc.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (1) (b) states:</P>
      <P>The principal object of the Corporation shall be stated in its memorandum of association to be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) to establish and maintain (as soon as practicable after the vesting day) an investment fund which shall be known as &ldquo;the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment&rdquo;, into which there shall be paid any moneys realised by the Corporation on investments,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revolving fund is quite clearly stated in the objectives.  The implication of paying moneys into the revolving fund is very clear there in carrying into effect the power vested in the corporation under section 13.  To enable it to do so subsection (3) (a) gives the power to sell, realise or otherwise dispose of its investments.  In referring to Justice <Col N="827" /> Keane's point which is very valid, Senator O'Leary will note from subsection (3) (i) to borrow temporarily is one of the powers and again it is in accordance with Justice Keane.  It is in the powers rather than in the objectives.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to point out that subsection (4) and (5) are, in effect, catch-all saving clauses.  Subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall prevent or restrict the inclusion among the objects of the Corporation as stated in the memorandum of association of all such objects and powers as are reasonably necessary or proper for or incidental or ancillary to the due attainment of the principal objects aforesaid and are not inconsistent with this Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) says:</P>
    <P>The Corporation shall have power to do anything which appears to be requisite to or which appears to it to facilitate the performance by it of any of its objects as specified in this Act or in its memorandum of association and is not inconsistent with any enactment for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>Section 13, together with 10 (1) (l), together with the powers to sell and transact as in section 10 (3) (a), and then the catch-all subsections, if I may refer to them as such, certainly will enable the solicitors who are undertaking the task to draw up a memorandum of association where the objectives of the company will be very clearly stated.</P>
    <P>Finally, the point made by Senator O'Leary and commented on by Senator McGonagle will now be referred to the firm of solicitors who are drawing up the memorandum of association so that they can avail of the catch-all provisions of subsections (4) and (5) to make absolutely sure that the memorandum of the company will state clearly the objectives and that there will be no difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the analysis carried out by the Minister.  The only <Col N="828" /> reasonable conclusion one could come to is that the power is there.  If we are to have something as basic to the work of the National Development Corporation as selling, there should be a specific objective to sell.  I do not disagree with the Minister that all these things put together can be construed as making one of the objects of the company to sell the investments from time to time and there is obviously the power to do this.  There is no reason why a specific objective of that kind could not be included.  I am happy with the Minister's suggestion that he will bring the matter to the attention of those who will be drawing up the additional objectives which fall within the power contained in section 10 (4).</P>

      <P>Under section 6 the Minister will set the machinery in motion to have a limited company set up by the corporation.  Having sought some advice, I understand there is no conflict between a limited company and a holding company.  Subsection (1) (e) states:</P>
      <P>to assist (financially or otherwise), manage or act as a holding company for any State-sponsored commercial enterprise...which, in the opinion of the Corporation... has reasonable prospects of profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment;</P>
      <P>For example, does the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; mean that the corporation, which will be set up as a limited company and acting as a holding company, would, have the authority to call in one of the State bodies such as AnCO, the Industrial Training Authority, because they think the people are not properly trained?  Fóir Teoranta will be going out of existence.  But will Córas Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the Industrial Credit Corporation be within the powers of the Minister?  I know the IDA cannot come into this because it is a different matter.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 10 (1) (e) gives power to manage or to act as a holding company for State-sponsored commercial enterprises.  This refers only to those State-sponsored commercial enterprises established after the passing of this Act, so it would not apply to companies before the passing of the Act. It is a power which I do not think the company will use very widely in the immediate future, but the power is there notwithstanding this.  The Government decided that the NDC should be empowered to act as a holding company for any new State enterprises established after the passing of the Act.  It is intended that the NDC could provide a valuable source of advice and expertise and have representatives on new State enterprises engaged in new activities.  In practice it is not envisaged that the holding company role will be a widely used power of the NDC's portfolio.  It is there as a permissible power.  I am of the opinion that the corporation will be better engaged in setting up new enterprises and investing in new enterprises rather than engaging in any type of holding company activity which could become a permanent burden as against the developmental role which is envisaged for the corporation.  But if the corporation should decide to exercise the power then the new State body must fulfil the profitability criteria which it has in common with all the other NDC investments.</P>

      <P>In opening the debate on Second Stage the Minister at the time, Deputy J.

I fully subscribe to that view and I will carefully watch the appointments of the directors to ensure that the Minister's and the <Col N="830" /> Government's undertaking in that regard is fulfilled.  In addition I should like to refer specifically to section 11 (2) (d) which states:</P>
      <P>the remuneration of the chairman and the directors (other than the managing director) shall be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>If the right people with proven commercial records and appropriate expertise are willing to serve on this board then they should be remunerated in a realistic way. The pittance which applies to board membership of State-sponsored bodies at present is grossly inadequate.  For instance, Fóir Teoranta is named in the First Schedule.  I understand that the board of Fóir Teoranta meet two days per week.  That is an enormous demand on the board members and if the directors of the NDC are to make a worthwhile contribution to the affairs of the corporation then this will necessitate time and commitment.  Therefore, realistic fees should be paid to them.  The revision of these fees is now grossly overdue and if the right people are to be attracted with the appropriate expertise, then they should be paid accordingly for the very valuable time they will be investing in the board of the NDC.</P>

I agree with those who say that the board of directors must be the most efficient possible and that they should be appointed on a basis that is not one of political partisanship.  This is like saying that one is against sin to some degree.  I want to take it a step further and say, and here I imagine there might not be such unanimous agreement, that it is an inevitable logic from the kind of speech I made on Second Stage that the board of directors must clearly be people who believe in the capacity of the State sector. I emphasise that point because it will be <Col N="831" /> very difficult to find the kind of innovative intelligence that is at once combined with commercial capacity, that at the same time has that high level of public service dedication that will forego opportunities in the private sector to serve on the board of the NDC.</P>
      <P>The NDC will be one of the major State-led and initiated corporate entities working abroad.  Remember, its great strength will be the underwriting of it by the State in the end.  I can give examples of that in so far as, in relation to the sale of services abroad in the Arab countries, there is every evidence that people on the one hand want to avoid direct State-run companies because of the political embarrassment involved in the changing of contracts.  They want to deal with, at the same time, State-endorsed companies of a semi-State kind.  In the NDC you are getting a corporate entity with an immense flexibility and the kind of guarantees that make it a very competitive bidder for international contracts, without some of the inhibitions.  The very worst thing that could happen to it would be that people who are either not committed philosophically or in practice to the State sector, be appointed to its board.  It would be quite wrong of such people to find a home in the NDC.  There is a record of that in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage Senators were quoting all sorts of examples of successful people all round the place who are available to be chosen to serve on the board of directors, which is specifically mentioned in section 11 of this Bill.  May I say that the semi-State and State sector in Ireland is replete with examples of people who were appointed, not only perhaps &mdash; and we can all argue about this &mdash; on a basis of political partisanship, but who did not believe in the concept of the public and State sectors.  They certainly did nothing at all in relation to making the case for there being a large public acceptance of a State role in legal investment, even in such matters as the provision of utilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of Córas lompair Éireann is a clear example of this.  It had a clear <Col N="832" /> disability in relation to a number of people who served on that board who were not committed to doing either of two things, either enhancing and expanding the State transport sector or if you were on the board and you wanted to look at it from a board perspective and you wanted to make the case for both increased capital sums and current expenditure, it behoved you to try and separate out how much of the provision was being made for social purposes and how much was being made for economic purposes.  You had to do this if you were to try to beat off an approach which said that State and semi-State companies had to operate on purely commercial criteria. You had this tweedledum and twiddledee saying they are there for social purposes, which they are when something is being closed down, and they are there for commercial purposes when they are making a profit.  I very much agree with those Senators who are expressing concern here.</P>
    <P>I want to place it on record that I want to see on the board of the NDC, people who are committed and who will commit themselves to the innovative idea and minority view in Ireland, that the State is doing something totally new, that it believes in the State sector, that it believes in a State sector that will trade abroad, that it believes in developing research and development that has been developed by the State in turning it into a commercial, remunerative enterprise. It is not a matter of which persons are on this board, it is the kind of person.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that it is a terrible mistake to think that people will only be motivated by high salaries.  I certainly think if people are doing something, as so many of them will need to do, if they need to work seven days a week, as many of the people who are involved in this kind of enterprising activity in the past in other countries have, and if they are required to travel abroad, and if they are required to make great personal sacrifices, I think they should be properly remunerated for it.  Of course, I agree with that.  I am saying that the history of these type of boards in every country shows <Col N="833" /> that what is most important is the mental orientation of the people involved.  That is what should govern things.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not see where all these successful people are all round the place who have been selling services abroad in a private capacity and who are waiting to lend their skills if only they can be remunerated.  If they are patriotic why are they not offering to do so now?  Where are the projects they are sending in to the State?  Where are their public statements in this regard?  There is a great deal of huff and puff about all of this.  There is a notion in the country that the person who could do the trick at the races for himself might eventually be someone who could run a horse that would save the fortunes of the parish.  I object to the crudeness of all of that.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is most important.  What is important in it is that competent people &mdash; who go beyond the prejudices, ignorance and backwardness of the traditional thinking sector in Irish business &mdash; would have a management orientation that is way beyond theirs.  We will have difficulty getting such people who are committed to a time scale and investment and have the sophistication to work abroad and trade successfully.  We should work very carefully.  May I tell you something?  If a person was an activist in your own party anywhere, if you said to me that a person was a prominent member of Fianna Fáil and at the same time that the person was committed to the kind of innovative idea that this corporation has, if I was in the Minister's position I would not hesitate for a second in appointing such a person to the board.  Rather than a political orientation and membership being a disqualification, it could well be a qualification given that the person had the right attitudes.  It would only be tribalistic to exclude a person on those grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Professor Hillery said in regard to the necessity for ensuring the adequate remuneration of both the managing director and the other directors of the board as outlined and as being established by the passing of section 11 of this <Col N="834" /> Bill.  I know what Senator Michael D. Higgins is getting at, but we do live in the real world as well.  We cannot successfully write into the legislation a test of ideological purity which must be passed before appointment as a director of such a board.  His general thrust I must disagree with in one respect.  In my experience people who serve in the public sector, whether or not they come from the public or private sector, by and large and overwhelmingly, once they do serve they become committed to the concept of the operation of that public company in the best interest of the public at large.  Rather than there being a natural prejudice among the people of the country or indeed even among the business people of the country against State enterprise, all the indications are that there is a natural inclination to accept a level of State enterprise which is unique in western Europe.  There is an acceptance of that in Ireland, even among the business community, which is unqiue in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of acceptance which there is by many succesful companies &mdash; and I hope there will be more successful companies operating in the State area &mdash; indicates that there exists within the country a large core of people who would more than adequately meet the criteria for appointment to the board as set down by Senator Higgins.  I have no doubt that there are many such people.  They exist in public, semi-public and private employment at present.  I do not think any difficulty should be found in that regard.  There will be difficulty with regard to the question of remuneration because it is all a question of the level of commitment.  I do not know the level of commitment which you can expect to give if you are a director of Fóir Teoranta but if it is two days a week, obviously only a very élitist group of people could give the level of commitment and not be adequately remunerated for it: a person who was involved in some public enterprise where their money was not too dependent on attendance at their work on a particular day or a particular length <Col N="835" /> of time; alternatively those who are independently wealthy and have other people working for them.  The way to avoid that and spread our wings much wider is to get a cross section of people who themselves might not be independently wealthy but might have the capacity to manage and the innovation necessary to serve as directors of this company.  For these reasons, I certainly support what Professor Hillery said in that regard.  In so far as what Senator Higgins says sets down worthwhile criteria for the establishment of directors, I support him too, but not his pessimistic view on the existing situation in Irish society with regard to people and the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator O'Leary I think Senator Higgins might find the following somewhat reassuring.  In the course of research that the Department of Industrial Relations at UCD have conducted into worker directors and their relationship with other board members in the designated State enterprises, the worker directors told us that they were agreeably surprised at the level of support they got from other directors &mdash; that is the nonworker directors &mdash; who themselves, of course, are political appointees and many of whom have business backgrounds. Another surprising thing they found was the emphasis on consensus in decision making as opposed to pushing issues to a vote and therefore dividing on policy issues at board level.  The worker directors made a further point to us that this was contrary to the view on the shop floor.  There was a very high degree of co-operation and not a splitting on ideological grounds at board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay again on section 11, but let me repeat the thrust of the board dividing on ideological grounds.  I repeated that last day something which I believe passionately to be true on the basis of empirical evidence, that the most complete ideological set of attidudes that could constitute an ideology in Irish business are those that are <Col N="836" /> hostile to direct State-led investment. There is this idea that somehow or another those of us who are in favour of State-led investment and directors who would fill that purpose are somehow suffering under some illness that is called &ldquo;ideological orientation&rdquo;.  Some people use phrases like &ldquo;ideological purity&rdquo; and so forth.  There is a very comprehensive ideology that there is no such thing as a successful, innovating, State enterprise. It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>With the greatest of respect to Senator O'Leary the phrase &ldquo;ideological purity&rdquo; has indeed a meaning in current Irish business circles and discussion and public debate.  What it means frankly is that people are willing to take from the State in relation to the promotion of industry, training, research and development, marketing, the hiring of staff for the retraining programmes, the writing off of machinery costs and so forth, and to imagine at the same time that there is not a heavy State involvement in industry. That is not only ideological in its tone, but it is blindness because one is saying that they are private initiatives.  There are people who take risks, and I supported them the last day on Second Stage when speaking about the banking sector and so on.  It is very important for us to be unemotive in our language about this but the point we are making is there is no great ideology in it.  A State company that will be involved like this one &mdash; its board will be reflected and constituted as section 11 suggests &mdash; means that you must have the capacity to think differently. It is the difference between riding a bicycle and driving a car.  There are different skills involved.  That is all I am saying.  With the greatest respect in the world, you could be driving a bicycle with your legs, which might not be of much use in a car.  The consequences on the road if you were to try and accommodate that method of learning on the job that Senator O'Leary seems to favour would be dreadful.  So I wish that he would not be as suspicious of people who might be motivated towards State involvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed to the fact that I regarded section 10 and all its subsections as the keystone of the Bill &mdash; a progressive experiment by the State.  The State is using State abilities and private entrepreneurial ability. A synthesis I called it on the last occasion.  Section 11 deals with the people we are looking for who will now put the machinery into operation.  What kind of attitudes should they have?  One, proven business ability.  It would be a mistake to exclude politicians.  High calibre people with high calibre business ability may be politicians.  Because a politician is appointed it does not necessarily follow that it is &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  People who are looking at the appointments will have to look at the number one qualification, the business calibre of the people so appointed.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking on the last occasion I stressed that the field of operation was particularly narrow.  Neither the State nor the private entrepreneur has ventured into this field so far.  Therefore, it is narrow and presents serious difficulties. The question of remuneration should not be regarded as that kind of incentive.  Obviously, as a trade unionist, I believe the people have to be properly remunerated.  I must say that and agree with Professor Hillery, but this has to be dealt with with some sensitivity.  The idea of a patriotic duty is the overriding consideration rather than remuneration. That is the qualification I would offer to what Professor Hillery said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience in the field.  I was a director of the Management Development Services in Northern Ireland.  I was a director of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta in the Republic.  It is proven business ability and men of that calibre we are looking for and it is going to be a very difficult task.  I do not know what kind of tests will be put or what kind of volunteers may come forward or what kind of list is to be drawn up.  I would hasten to disagree slightly with my colleague, Senator Higgins.  I would not be compelled to say that the directors should all give an oath of allegiance to State enterprise &mdash; no way.  If I were on that <Col N="838" /> interviewing board I would appoint people who can actually implement and move into operation the machinery required to make this Irish progressive experiment a success.  People will be watching from other countries, especially those with low <i>capita</i> performance; high unemployment rates.  They will be watching with some concern and possibly admiration.  That is why the men to be appointed must be of the highest level and why section 11 is so important, probably more important than section 10. These are the people who will be moving the levers in this experiment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Just by way of conclusion I want to clarify what I was getting at.  I understood the Minister, Deputy Bruton to say that just because people have a particular political allegiance or a particular ideology that is not adequate in itself for their appointment.  It is quite likely that the people who will be appointed will have an interest in politics. What I would oppose is appointments solely on political allegiance, perhaps to the relative exclusion of the business expertise which Senator McGonagle rightly underlines.  The business acumen is absolutely vital, given the imperative of the commercial approach that would be necessary for this organisation.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Minister says, and I hope he will make some positive comment about improving the £800 a year or whatever it would be for directors' fees under the normal circumstances.  Even if he were to treble that it would not be adequate because we would still be relying on directors' spirit of public service. But some movement on existing fees is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have recognised a certain concern by the Labour Party Members of the House about the calibre and ability of the board of directors and of the chairman.  Senator Higgins has been at pains to explain that we have absolutely no interest whatsoever in the political affiliations of anybody on this board, particularly the chairman.  We are saying to the Minister, who will be <Col N="839" /> responsible for the appointment on the recommendation of the Government, that the Labour Party consider that an essential component of the qualifications &mdash; they will not be political but we would not rule out people with any political view &mdash; is that there must be a commitment to the type of concept involved in this corporation because it is a State-sponsored and directed corporation.  It is being promoted by the State, but that does not rule out the involvement of the private sector or otherwise.  It involves all of that, but it is an instrument of the State.  We need people to believe that the State can direct its energies in that area to stimulate employment.  What we need is commitment. You can have people committed to transport, but you could not appoint a bus conductor to be the captain of a ship. We are disregarding political affiliations because they are irrelevant.  This concept is a major development for this country, and for this Government.  It is one that we have been fighting for years as a Labour Party.  We need a commitment by the people on this board to the whole concept of involving the public sector to provide a stimulus for the development of the economy and creating jobs.  It could be a Fianna Fáil, a Fine Gael or a Labour Party person that would have these qualities. Whoever it is let us have the qualities, and let it be seen when the appointment is made that those are the qualities that count.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Senators for their contributions.  I cannot see anything that I profoundly disagree with.  The argument falls into two parts.  Whom to appoint?  What type of person to appoint?  How they should be paid?  Section 11 deals with the number of people to be appointed.  Section 27 deals with remuneration.  I presume that, once we have dealt with it here, it will not be discussed more fully again.  I accept most of what has been said.  We need honourable people who are public-spirited and have a sense of initiative, innovation and creativity, who are committed to the objects of the National <Col N="840" /> Development Corporation as stated in this Bill and will be stated in the memorandum and articles of of the company.</P>
      <P>It is a major advantage that we have proceeded by way of legislation through both Houses in setting up the NDC.  Anybody now who is invited to be a member of the board will know, not only from the text of the Act itself but also from the debate in both Houses, the kind of commitment that we are looking for and the kind of person that we want to serve on the board.</P>
      <P>On the question of people being appointed because they carry one particular party affiliation or another, I would not like a situation to develop in this country that, because dedicated business people commit themselves to the democratic process and support any one of our parties, this should be used as a disability against them either in their private capacity or in their fitness for any type of public office subsequently, and I include in public office appointment to State boards.  It will be a sad day for democracy here if a businessman is afraid to support publicly a political party because this can be brought against him subsequently.  I fully agree with what Senator Hillery said.  I would like to reaffirm the commitment given by my predecessor Deputy John Bruton.  People will not be appointed to the board of NDC simply because they carry a particular party tag.  I would also like to point out the fact that somebody who is good, dedicated, committed and suitable for the board will not be ruled out because he is the supporter of any particular party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things seem to operate in a kind of reverse perverse logic at the moment. It is almost taken now that if a Government appoint one of their own supporters to serve on a board it is assumed that he has been appointed because he is a supporter of the Government rather than because he has particular abilities which could be used to greater effect on a board. I am quite happy to reaffirm the commitment given by my predecessor.  I hope that we will be able to get good committed people, committed to the ideals and objectives of the NDC as set out in the <Col N="841" /> Bill.  If they are committed to the public or private sectors as far as I am concerned as long as they are committed to the objectives of the NDC and are prepared to work hard to implement the mandate given under section 10, then they are suitable people to serve on the board. We are prepared to get the best possible people to serve.</P>
    <P>On the question of remuneration, there is one key office and that is the office of managing director.  He will not be appointed by the Minister or by the Government.  He will be selected by the board.  He will be a full time executive officer.  He is the man whose salary scale we will have to watch.  It is quite obvious that the Bill does not come within the remit of the Devlin committee as previously instituted.  It is not going to be retrospectively put within the Devlin remit.  An appropriate salary for the managing director will be arrived at by discussion between the board and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the permission of the Minister for the Public Service.  I take the points made.  We obviously have to get the best person possible regardless of cost to act as managing director of the NDC if we are to get the kind of talent, of motivating force and dynamism we on all sides of the House consider necessary.  That is the key office as far as I am concerned in terms of remuneration.</P>
    <P>I take the points made about the members of the board.  It is difficult to expect, in the case of people working and spending one or two days a week and getting £1,200 or £1,300 a year as a kind of honorary remuneration, that that alone would motivate them.  I do not accept that people who join State boards are motivated by the small fee that they get.  The people we want are the people who have a sense of public commitment and who are excited by the challenge of the times, by the social and economic problems we have.  They want to become active soldiers in the fight to get employment for our people, especially our young people, and they want to be committed to the objectives of the NDC.  I do not think that it is a matter of motivation by <Col N="842" /> whether it is £800, £1,200 or £4,000.  I understand that this matter of fees to directors of semi-State companies is under active consideration by the Minister for the Public Service with a view to bringing proposals to Government shortly.  I accept the points raised by Senators. I will bring them to the Minister's attention.  The board is part time.  The chairman of the board is non-executive. The key figure is the managing director, who will be appointed by the board.  His remuneration will not fall within the Devlin remit and consequently an appropriate salary for such a person can be negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that the salary for the managing director of the NDC will not in fact be subject to the Devlin restrictions. Could I make a further point, and I have made it in a number of debates here?  My particular interest in this appointment in the State-sponsored body arises for two reasons &mdash; one is that I am a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies and the other is that I worked for several years in State-sponsored bodies before I joined the staff of UCD.  I have a long standing interest in the area.  I just want to make one further point.  I think it is important that the managing director of this body and indeed for any other State-sponsored bodies where the occasion arises should not be appointed for life but rather for a limited contractual period renewable if his performance justifies it.</P>

It will not make any difference to us what the person's political affiliation is and it should not be a condition that somebody belong to a certain party.  If he has the analytical and planning skills there is no reason why he should not be appointed.  I also agree with the question of the remuneration. In case there is any confusion about what the Labour Party attitude is and the argument of ideologies, by and large the Labour Party does not, for example, attack the possession of the means of <Col N="843" /> production.  What they attack is the social authority that property takes on to itself. We do not attack individuals with skills who can go in and do a job whether it is public or private.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that bothers me in this.  It is just a clarification. When you read through the long enabling provisions of section 10 which set out the principal objects of the corporation it seems that there is in the clauses dealing with investment an inevitable time-scale involved that will differ with projects. Some projects will realise their potential much quicker than others.  My question specifically is as to whether or not section 13 (b) is not perhaps inhibiting the realisation in full of some of the provisions of section 10 which might require a medium to longer time scale.  In other words, are you not inhibited by the idea of selling on.  Paragraph (b) states:</P>
      <P>to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as is financially and commercially prudent, in such a manner as to enable the Corporation to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it and ensure that funds are available in the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To clarify some of the matters that have arisen out of the public discussion <Col N="844" /> of this, it would be useful if the Minister clarified perhaps that a number of options are possible in this regard, that when sale on or the realisation of investment is envisaged, it need not be to the private sector.  For example, in relation to an integrated timber industry or an integrated mariculture development and so on, that an independent State entity could come into existence or alternatively a project sponsored and turned to commercial viability by the corporation could be sold on to another Government company or agency.  Even further any of such could take on a corporate form in future that would be of the shape of a co-operative, for example.  Many such are indicated &mdash; for example, if you wanted something in the downstream development of the wool industry where one could envisage a cooperative of people who were supplying the basic raw materials. I would like clarification of those two points.  One relates to the flexibility in regard to the time scale required in innovative, perhaps new technology-related, ventures.  The second is in relation to the interpretation of this clause and particularly the words &ldquo;realisation of investments made by it as soon as it is financially and commercially prudent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I see some dangers perhaps in the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;financially and commercially prudent&rdquo;.  If you take, for example, the preceding section 13 (a), it states that it should be &ldquo;the general duty of the corporation to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.&rdquo;  In regard to the history of State companies, I am very glad that we had the benefit of Senator Hillery's contribution.  I am sure that he would agree with me that part of the difficulty in making their case to Government of whatever sort has been the difficulty of separating out, both in terms of current funding capital and borrowing requirements required for their social purposes and for their commercially traded purposes.  One of the difficulties in evaluating the performance of these companies is the form of accounting which would consider, for example, that it is a valid purpose to create employment <Col N="845" /> and that the longer term sustenance of so many jobs which requires us to trade in such a time-span is quite different from the criterion of commercial trading or the selling of services in the short term. Perhaps the working is deliberately like this so as to envisage all of what I have said.  I would like an assurance in that regard rather than thinking that any of these measures that I am suggesting are precluded by a narrower interpretation.</P>

      <P>Minister Bruton in his speech to this House and also Senator Higgins spoke about the duty to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State and to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it.  How is it proposed to ensure a turnover of investment?  How will the NDC sell a minority shareholding in a private company and who will buy it?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, I think it is worth looking at the principle, the conceptual stage of the revolving fund.  Any state, or any company also no matter how vast the resources at its disposal is limited in some respect.  Given though the NDC will have a share capital of £300 million, there will be a limit on the amount of money at its disposal.  It is supposed to act as a dynamic within the economy to innovate, to create viable jobs, to fulfil the objectives of section 10 (1).  When it has done that at some particular point it is also an objective of the legislation that the wealth created be realised by the company so that they could reinvest subsequently in new enterprises, and this is the concept of the revolving fund.  Under section 13 there is a duty imposed on the NDC, especially in 13 (b), to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments so that the revolving fund can be set up and so that money will be available in the revolving fund to fund new enterprises down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretion on how and when to realise the assets and realise the wealth created is totally in the hands of the board of the NDC.  If you were to look at section <Col N="846" /> 14, you would see that the corporation has an obligation to inform the Minister in writing of each investment made by it, the time limit fixed by it for its involvement in that investment and any subsequent decision to extend any such time limit.  It is quite clear from section 14 that there is absolute discretion and absolute flexibility in the hands of the board.  They get three propositions.  They decide not to go ahead with one.  They decide to go ahead with (b) and (c).  In the case of (b) they fix a time limit of eight years because of the particular circumstances.  In the case of (c) they fix a time limit of 12 years. If at the end of the eight year period the company is successful, the duty under section 13 then obligates the corporation to act, looking at what is financially and commercially prudent.  At the end of eight years if it were seen that a particular company was going very well and that the particular product it was marketing was two years away from maximum capacity, then it would be financially and commercially prudent to extend the time of the company for a further two years before one would attempt to realise the asset by sale.  That is the way it would operate.  It is in the hands of the corporation and it is in the hands of the company which will be set up under the corporation. There is absolute flexibility given there to the corporation to do that.</P>
    <P>The actual form of realisation of asset has been raised by Senator Higgins.  It is open to the corporation to dispose of the asset in a variety of ways &mdash; they have the flexibility to do this &mdash; and as long as the revolving fund is used and the duty under section 13 is complied with I do not anticipate any difficulty arising there. I take the point made by the Senator.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue that Senator Higgins raises about what is financially and commercially prudent, the situation is as I have stated: it may be prudent to sell one year and it may not be so to sell the next year.  This adds to the flexibility of the company rather than reduces it.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of when it comes to the point of sale and who would buy it.  One of the simplest <Col N="847" /> rules of all is that if something is profitable there is no shortage of buyers, and if something is loss making there is a shortage.  If the company is successful people will be queueing up to buy it. Proposals are being considered in my Department to enable companies to buy back shares in a joint venture situation. The Stock Exchange will shortly establish a small companies market to facilitate the buying and selling of shares.  I do not see a difficulty even at present and there should be none when the Stock Exchange provide that alternative counter of opportunity for trading in small companies' shares.  I should like to stress that under section 13 &mdash; if you look at it together with section 14 &mdash; the discretion is left to the board to operate within the Act to fulfil the objectives of this act, the objectives of the NDC, and to allow them the flexibility to comply with the duty imposed on them under section 13 to set up the revolving fund and to act commercially and financially prudently.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention one point briefly relating to the interpretation of section 14 (1).  Information, in the nature of things, flows both ways. The wording stresses that the corporation shall inform the Minister in writing of each investment made by it, the time limit fixed by it for its involvement in that investment and any subsequent decision to extend any such time limit.  Section 16 deals with the exercise by the Minister for Finance of his rights by virtue of being the holder on behalf of the State of a certain proportion of shares.  Can I presume that what will be sought from the company is information that will go to the Minister, rather than the Minister offering what might be called highly directive advice, coming down the other way along the information channel? <Col N="848" /> Secondly, if this is the case, if it is just by way of keeping the Minister informed to establish the principle of accountability, how then does the enabling provision of this section relate to the powers which are possible in relation to section 16?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, there is a public interest consideration that the Minister should be informed of what a semi-State company is doing on a regular basis.  The public interest demands that.  The Minister for Finance is the shareholder in the company and the Minister of the day, as shareholder, should be informed of its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual Senators will probably be more interested in the powers vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce under section 31 rather than in any other powers.  Under that section the Minister can from time to time give the corporation such general directives in writing as to policy and operation in relation to all or any of the objectives stated in the memorandum of association of the corporation as he considers appropriate. That section allows for the two-way flow of information.  As you can see from the way it is drafted, the board has absolute discretion over the day-to-day running of the company.  The board has absolute <Col N="849" /> discretion over the evaluation of the particular projects that are put before it.  The board has absolute discretion about the time limit fixed.  The board has absolute discretion about the sale of the assets to get a flow of moneys into the revolving fund.  On the other hand, the Minister has certain powers in relation to the objectives of the NDC as laid down under section 10 and from time to time he may give policy directives to the NDC.  I think that is the proper balance.  I can assure Senator Hillery that it will operate as the Houses of the Oireachtas have decided in enacting the legislation.  It will be done in accordance with law and on no other basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states that the corporation shall not, without the prior permission of the Minister, invest in an enterprise an amount or amounts exceeding in the aggregate £1 million.  If reference is made for sums in excess of £1 million, is the idea behind it that the civil servants in the Minister's Department would then evaluate on a commercial basis these proposals that are submitted?  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I have the highest regard for the ability and the integrity of civil servants; I have had contact with them in a variety of capacities over many years.  My concern relates to a statement in the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy that the Department of Industry and Commerce did not have the people to monitor the progress of industrial policy which, presumably, included the State-sponsored bodies under the political control of that Department, namely, Irish Steel, NET and Ceimicí Teoranta.  As I have stated, I have no difficulty in putting on record my regard for the ability of civil servants.  My point <Col N="850" /> rather is this: do they have the commercial training and ability to evaluate complex commercial proposals which at the heel of the hunt they need if they are to advise their Minister on the approval of the £1 million or more?</P>
      <P>I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister in this regard.  Where civil servants need&mdash;and in many cases they do need &mdash; commercial experience the Minister and his Department should facilitate them in every possible way.  This could be by way of subbatical leave or a greater emphasis on or commitment to training courses, or for that matter university degrees.  This is not a plug for UCD, but we have an undergraduate programme &mdash; Bachelor of Public Administration and a Masters Programme in Public administration as well.  The syallabi are there to see.  They provide a considerable body of knowledge and a range of skills that would be appropriate for this type of role in the Civil Service.  Thankfully, a number of civil servants are attending these courses in UCD and elsewhere.  A lot needs to be done beyond current training and educational programmes.</P>

I presume the staff, when recruited, will be people with analytical and planning skills, together with the directors and the chairman.  There may have been a problem in the past over this, where there was not enough control and people went off on sprees and got into difficulties.  I can see the need for a measure of control.  At the same time, I appreciate the problem of over-interference and I accept the point about the need for the development of skills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two matters to which I would like to refer in relation to section 15.  One is the matter which was already referred to by Senators &mdash; the <Col N="851" /> question of the Minister's prior permission being necessary in the case of an investment of an aggregate of £1 million and the Government's permission being necessary in the case of an aggregate investment of £2½ million.  I can understand why the Minister would include something like that and it would have my support.  I think that ultimately investments do get to the size where they need to be monitored by a third party.  I think that whether or not I have confidence in a particular Minister &mdash; though I do in this Minister &mdash; and whether or not I have confidence in civil servants &mdash; even though I am sure that they are excellent civil servants, though it is probably not in order for me to say they are excellent, as it would not be in order for me to say that they were not excellent &mdash; nevertheless, whether or not any particular group of civil servants or Minister has the capacity or the interest to take an involvement in that, I think it is necessary that the duty should be put on them.</P>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister consider putting the duty on them in a slightly different way.  Would the Minister consider giving the authority to the corporation to grant approval subject to a veto by the Minister; in other words, it goes through unless the Minister says so.  In other words, let the assumption be that it will be all right and let the Minister, if he has any doubt, make a decision and say: &ldquo;I do not agree with that investment. Stop it, do not make the investment&rdquo;. The same system of notification would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What one might have as a result of that is inertia.  To have a situation where somebody within the NDC wants to make the investment and is engaged in a kind of negotiation with the Department as to what condition will bring it within the ambit of what the Minister would approve, is I think dangerous and I would much prefer if there was a bit more pressure put on the Minister, give the Minister the right to say no.  The Minister can say yes or not.  The Minister can veto it; otherwise it goes ahead.  It is a negative <Col N="852" /> veto so to speak rather than seeking positive approval, because I feel the problem with seeking the positive approval of the Minister is that the Minister will have to be involved in these things from the very start and will find him- or herself with the Department involved in the day-to-day operation of such decisions to a greater extent than is otherwise envisaged by the Bill.</P>
    <P>That might be overcome by saying to the NDC, and writing it in here, that where they have a proposal to make an investment of £1,000, £1 million or £2½ million, as the case may be, they have the power to do so, and the Minister has a certain period of time within which to refuse permission with regard to that: otherwise it goes ahead.  If the Minister does nothing, it goes ahead; or if he does not positively say no it goes ahead.  I think that is a different way of approaching the same problem, on which I would like to hear the Minister's views.  I am certainly not very hung up on it but it might be a better approach to keep the day-to-day operation of this corporation out of the hands of the ministerial helpers in the Department.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with another point for confirmation.  I presume that the Minister intends that the word &ldquo;invest&rdquo; in subsection 1 means to invest by way of equity plus loan.  I think that is the way it would be read when you read subsection (3).  I would like to have it on the record that the total of the investment means the amount invested by way of equity plus the amount invested by way of loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, it does mean equity plus loans, but as the Senator is aware the NDC will be expressly forbidden to give grants, so it is equity plus loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general point at issue here, this section brings about a situation where the permission of the Minister is required if amounts exceeding an aggregate of £1 million is involved, the permission of the Government is required if amounts exceeding an aggregate of £2.5 million is involved.  I have sat in Government for <Col N="853" /> three years and I have seen &mdash; and it is public knowledge &mdash; the results of very bad decisions made in the board rooms of public, semi-State and private companies. I think all Senators remember Irish Shipping.  I think they will also remember ICI.  Those of us who are elected to the Dáil and the Seanad and those of us that have been appointed to Government must protect the public interest and there must be checks and balances in any legislation such as this to protect the public interest, particularly the taxpayer because public money is involved.  The parallel situation is the case of the IDA.  Any grant aid by the IDA in excess of £2.5 million must go to Government by way of memorandum and the Government must make the decision on it.</P>
    <P>It is proper that in regard to this new body the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a certain level, should have to agree and at another level, sums are big enough and the matter is important enough, it should be a matter for Government agreement.  Whether we should do this by positive or negative action is a matter for debate.  Senator O'Leary suggests that a veto might be the appropriate way to do it.  If we become private citizens and think of ourselves in our own family situation £1 million is a lot of money.  When we are in here and when debating Estimates, we string noughts together as if it was confetti when we talk about current budget deficits and public borrowing requirements and so on but £1 million is still a lot of money.</P>
    <P>If you put it in context, the NEA that is being subsumed into the NDC, last year spent £2.7 million in total.  I hope that the National Development Corporation will get involved in a lot of activity which will bring about a situation where it will call down quite a lot of the share capital which is at its disposal, so that it can act as a dynamic within the economy. Still, a decision to spend £1 million in a particular enterprise is still a big decision.</P>
    <P>If it were to be done by veto I think the following situation would occur.  The board of the NDC with its staff would have got into negotiation with Company <Col N="854" /> X and arrangements would be made to the satisfaction of both sides.  It would be a matter of public knowledge.  It would certainly be a matter of knowledge outside the NDC that such an arrangement had arisen and I think that the Minister then in an attempt to exercise a veto in the public interest would be subject to all sorts of political pressure.  Now what we do not want here is a political decisionmaking process.  This can only work if the decisions are decisions made on commercial criteria, and if decisions are made on political criteria this will not work.  It is much better that the NDC are mandated to negotiate, but if the money exceeds £1 million then they submit it to the Minister and the Minister can then get the commercial advice available to him to evaluate the proposal.</P>
    <P>Senators have raised the question of the advice being available.  First of all, the NDC will proceed to inform the Minister by way of memorandum, as the IDA would do at present.  The <i>corpus</i> of knowledge and argument within the NDC at the decision making process will be available to the Minister when it is submitted to him.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister will have at his disposal the abilities of the civil servants in his Department.  I worked in a different Department and I worked very closely with not only the Department of Justice but with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I take the point Senator O'Leary makes.  I think we are out of order in praising civil servants in the House.  We cannot talk about their excellence, but if I were allowed to talk about their excellence I could tell you that the ability of the civil servants in Ireland in recent years has been underrated and understated.  There is a great pool of ability there.  Apart from the career civil servants, who come in in the normal process to the Department of Industry and Commerce, there are also professional people employed by the Department who have the professional skills to evaluate propositions such as this.  They do it in the case of the IDA when it is a grant aid situation rather than an investment.  They advise <Col N="855" /> the Government in that capacity in monitoring the IDA investments, which are far larger than the kind of sums of money we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is within the remit of the Department to bring in outside consultants if a particular project needs outside evaluation.  I would propose that while I am there I will avail of this if I think it is necessary and if I need outside advice.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms are there.  I think we are going the right way about it, first of all, to have the checks and balances in in the public interest to protect the taxpayer. We have experience in the past of the need for this.  Secondly, I think the advice is there and I propose to avail of the advice.  Thirdly, I think that ultimately it is better to have it as proposed in section 15 rather than have an arrangement by veto which would expose any Minister to the kind of political pressure which would cast a doubt on the validity of the decision making process and one would wonder in certain cases whether the decision was made on a commercial basis or not.</P>

      <P>The first thing I must do is to welcome the Minister to his new job. I do not know how he feels about it, but I think his new Ministry is possibly one of the most challenging.  Apart from the obvious things, an enormous amount of legislative reform, administrative reform and policy reform is needed, much of it not necessarily enormously expensive, in the area of the Department which he administers.  Some of it is, perhaps, moderately expensive relative to the expenditure &mdash; for instance, in the courts &mdash; but in terms of overall expenditure a reallocation of resources within his own Department could help.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well.  I do not envy him the job.  The impositions on his personal life of the security regime within which he has to operate must be a great burden to himself and to his family.  I wish him success in the job.

      <P>Perhaps he did not read the report fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of my making smart <Col N="857" /> remarks about Senator Belton, the report is most welcome and contains an enormous amount of information.  I am only going to take about a few aspects of it.  I will concentrate on putting on to the record of this House some of the conclusions that are drawn in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there has been reflection on the operation of the courts in this report.  I am particularly glad that the sort of mystical aura that surrounds the Judiciary, that somehow because you become a judge you become a pillar of wisdom, knowledge, information and judgment, is, in a gentle, respectful and no irreverent way, being questioned.  The suggestion that judges need to be trained, educated and to have an induction to the processes in which they are involved is both welcome and important.  Given the experience we have had in Cork in recent times, the need for a fairly thorough induction and training for members of the Judiciary is particularly apparent to those of us in Cork, including my fellowcitizen in Cork who had to run the best part of three miles in half-an-hour in order to keep out of prison &mdash; something I thought was an unusual penalty.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount in this report but what I would like to concentrate on is the section on page 43 on social inequality and crime, not because it is the only thing in the report but because I think one can either talk in broad generalisations about what is contained in this report or one can advert to specific issues that are raised within it.  The issue I want to talk about is the question of social inequality and crime.  The author of the report, as distinct from the council's comments on it, does go to some length to make it fairly clear that the connection between social inequality and crime is pretty well overwhelmingly proven, but that that can be misrepresented in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>On page 43 he said:</P>
    <P>There is a correlation which indicates that crime rates are high in years with high unemployment and crime rates are low in years with low unemployment. This does not imply that all <Col N="858" /> persons who are unemployed commit crimes, or even that a substantial minority do so.  Instead, it suggests that as the labour market opportunities of some groups become more restricted, particularly groups of young people, the relative attractions of non-criminal and criminal activities shift in a way that increases the probability of their engaging in illegal activities.  So with high unemployment the probability that a young person will commit a crime increases, leading to that age group having a higher rate of arrests.</P>
    <P>That is carefully worded, and quite rightly so, because those of us who would argue that crime correlates with social inequality can tend to stigmatise whole communities in the way in which we correlate crime with high levels of social inequality.  On the other hand, it is extremely important that what has been said here should be accepted, because if it becomes the basis for our analysis of crime and the causes thereof, then we do have an obligation to look at the social inequalities that correlate with crime. Unfortunately, it is true that some exercises in reducing some areas of inequality do not necessarily produce the immediate changes in the crime system that might be hoped for or in the occurrence of crime that might be hoped for.  However, regrettable that may be, the correlation, I think, is established.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>This way of linking economic and social conditions to crime can be used to explain variation between social groups in the rate of involvement in crime, rates that reflect the probability a person from a particular background will come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  It may lead us to conclude, say, that children from areas with high long-term unemployment have, say, twice as high a probability of becoming involved in crime, as do children from more advantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The author then concludes:</P>
    <P>The accountability of the individual <Col N="859" /> before the courts for his or her choice is in no way diminished by such a link.</P>
    <P>I must say I would take issue with that particular conclusion.  I remember Dr. Noel Browne on one occasion saying that there was a case to be made that all prisoners were political prisoners, because many prisoners were in prison because of factors over which they had limited control and, therefore, to a large extent they could not be regarded as being culpable for many of the crimes they became involved in.  That might be somewhat extreme.  Dr. Noel Browne was very good at challenging us by making statements that pushed us beyond our normal parameters of thinking. Nonetheless, I think it is a bit hard to suggest, if there is a correlation between social inequality and crime, that you can then pass on and say, that even though this correlation exists it in no way diminishes the accountability of the individual before the courts for his or her choice.</P>
    <P>If that means that one cannot prosecute people because of the crimes they have allegedly committed, that is, perhaps, reasonable; but if it means that there should be no distinction between the methods of dealing with people who commit crime, then we have a far more serious issue to be concerned with.</P>
    <P>The report goes through an overwhelming amount of evidence to add to this accepted correlation between social deprivation and high rates of crime incidence. It would be a boring and monotonous exercise that might even test the patience of the Leas-Chathaoirleach if I proceeded to quote long chunks of a report at this late hour of the evening.  I no longer believe there is a need for us to get involved in these eternal arguments about the causes of crime.  Whatever about the causes of crime, one of the correlations has been fairly well underlined. The report deals with educational disadvantage at great length.  It quotes from Hakim, 1982 as follows:</P>
    <P>...high levels of unemployment can be expected to contribute to higher levels of crime and delinquency and <Col N="860" /> to an increase in the prison population... Three processes appear to operate: unemployment increases recidivist crime; parental and youth unemployment increase juvenile delinquency (which can form the basis for eventual adult criminality); and unemployment increases reconviction, the rate of imprisonment and the size of the prison population.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly damning indicator of the cost of unemployment to a community and I think that the costs of unemployment, in terms of the increasing tendency towards criminality, need to be accounted.  I do not think economists are really in a position to assess these costs. Politicians can at least begin to attempt to measure them, because they are part of the balance sheet of a society, the human damage and, indeed, the damage not just to the criminal people but to the victims of crime, that are consequential on high levels of unemployment.  We do need to look at it with a good deal of care.</P>
    <P>In terms of the correlation between criminality and high levels of unemployment and high levels of social inequality, the report highlights a number of other areas, particularly of the perceptions of society of what constitutes crime.  I should like to quote one of the more astonishing statements in the report. While we might all have suspected it, I have never seen it stated so badly.  The quotation deals with the comparison between what are called &ldquo;street crimes&rdquo; and &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; crimes.  The report states the following:</P>
    <P>Though an abhorrence of &ldquo;street crime&rdquo; such as robbery is virtually universal, if we measure the cost of crime in financial terms, &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; crimes, such as embezzlement and fraud, inflict the greater loss.  White collar crime is the abuse of occupational positions of trust and responsibility. They are almost by definition middle class crimes.  The amount of money taken annually through white collar crime vastly exceeds the profits accruing to robbers and burglars in <Col N="861" /> most countries.  Indeed, the famous Equity funding fraud involved a loss to its victims that was equal to nearly three quarters of all money stolen in the United States by robberies and burglaries in the year the fraud was discovered.</P>
    <P>In terms of a society's perception of crimes and of the hysteria that at times is generated in society about alleged criminal activity, this perception of what constitutes crime is one of the most fundamental questions that needs to be addressed.  Our perception of crime gives us very much a class-based perception of what constitutes serious criminality. Burglary, as I have said, is regarded as a serious crime, but &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; crime is treated with far less opprobrium in the sense that, as the report has stated, far greater sums are involved in white collar crime.  But the real obsession in society is with the incidence of crimes like burglary and so on.</P>
    <P>That is all I should like to say on the issue of social inequality and crime.  It is satisfying and equally important, that the correlation between a high incidence of social inequality and the incidence of crime is, apparently, accepted and heavily underlined.  In terms of our response to criminal activity, that particular correlation must be accepted.</P>

      <P>In the one minute that I have left to conclude in, I will simply make one further quotation from the comments of the report on prisons.  It is very difficult to deal with a report of the length and breadth of this report in 15 minutes.  I do want to comment and read a footnote on page 153, which refers to the quality of the report on prisons of the Department of Justice.  The comment says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report on Prisons suffers from a format that is poorly thought out, inconsistent in its application within each report, and subject to arbitrary changes from one report to the next. <Col N="862" /> Tables often refer to subpopulations that are of no apparent interest (such as those omitting prisoners serving sentences of &ldquo;penal servitude&rdquo;) and the descriptive categories are often poorly chosen or difficult to understand (as in the choice of offences).  The crucial distinctions between remand prisoners, those sentenced to imprisonment, and those imprisoned on default are made for some purposes and not for others.  The format for the adult prisons often differs from that used for the places of detention.  No information is given to the user on how particular statistics are generated.  If these criticisms seem harsh, the reader is directed to the <i>Statistical Abstract of Ireland</i>, 1980.  We find in Table 238, for example, that the average number in custody in 1975 was 458; the 1976 average jumps to 1,049.  Equally peculiar &ldquo;leaps&rdquo; in numbers are found for a category in the analysis of committals to prison in the same table.  Some of the anomalies have obvious sources, as when figures for St. Patrick's Institution are incorrectly included with the adult prisons.  Others, such as the origins of the highly volatile &ldquo;committed and acquitted&rdquo; category of committals defy explanation.</P>
    <P>I simply quote that as an example of what I mentioned in my initial remarks when I was welcoming the Minister.  There is an area where no vast amount of expenditure is required, but where obviously an awful lot could be done to improve our knowledge, our understanding and our capacity, therefore, to deal intelligently with the obviously pressing problem of the increasing numbers of people in our prison system.  If the information is not presented in a coherent way, that is comparable from year to year, we can make no progress at all.  On that issue of the report on prisons alone the Minister could make a major contribution to the debate on the prison system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to contribute to <Col N="863" /> the debate on this motion and to speak to the House for the first time as Minister for Justice on a number of topics which come within my new brief.</P>
      <P>The areas which I will be speaking about are the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prisons.  I will begin with the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>While increasing Garda numbers cannot, of course, be regarded as the only response to the crime situation, a good Garda presence must be maintained in the streets of our cities and towns.  To this end, Garda strength was increased by close on 600 during the three-year period 1983 to 1985.  This extra manpower provided for an increased level of patrolling, with particular emphasis on foot patrols which are considered to play an important role in the prevention of crime.  We have now reached an overall Garda strength of 11,400, which is the strength provided for in the national plan published in October 1984.  The emphasis is now on ensuring that the existing strength operates with the maximum efficiency and effectiveness in meeting the policing needs of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of members of the Garda Síochána not residing in the areas to which they are appointed was raised earlier in the debate.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána accepts that members of the Garda Síochána who reside in the areas where they are stationed are able to maintain a closer and better relationship with the community they serve and it is his policy to encourage this practice in so far as is possible without imposing unreasonable hardship on members and their families.  The Garda authorities report that while the majority of members of the chief superintendent, superintendent and inspector ranks assigned to areas outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area reside with their families in their districts or in adjoining districts, a number of members of these ranks who were recently promoted or transferred have not yet taken up permanent residence in the areas to which they have been appointed.  Members of sergeant and garda rank are not required <Col N="864" /> by regulations to live within their subdistricts. The accepted practice, except where official accommodation is provided, is that a member is free to reside where he chooses provided he does not live at an unreasonable distance from his station.  The onus is on each Garda divisional officer to ensure that an adequate Garda service is maintained within his division at all times.</P>
    <P>Measures to get the Garda and members of the general public into closer contact are being pursued by the formulation and implementation of a policy of community policing.  Some experiments have been carried out with a view to establishing what can be described as &ldquo;police clinics&rdquo; in areas which are fairly far removed from a Garda station.  Such clinics would involve the attendance of a garda at a local centre for a fixed period one or two days per week and would provide the public with a convenient means of contacting the Garda, for example to report crime, discuss aspects of local policing, seek crime prevention advice or get various application forms such as those for motor tax, driving licences, and so on.  The Garda authorities are currently considering the development of this type of service, and other measures, aimed at fostering good relations between the Garda and the community, are also receiving attention.  There is a total acceptance on the part of the Garda of the need to involve the community at large in crime prevention activities and I think that resources directed to this end will show positive results in reducing crime, particularly the types of crime which can be prevented through extra vigilance on the part of individuals, neighbours and communities in general.</P>
    <P>The report referred to Garda training and that matter was referred to also in the course of the debate.  The House may be aware that the Commissioner established a committee in January of last year, under the chairmanship of Dr. Thomas Walsh, to undertake a thorough review of Garda training at all levels, from recruit intake stage up to and including courses provided for senior management in the Garda College.  The <Col N="865" /> committee presented their first report &mdash; Interim Report on Probationer Training &mdash; to the Commissioner in December of last year and this report is now being considered in detail.  I hope that it will be possible to implement a number of recommendations made to the benefit of recruits who join the Garda Síochána from the next recruitment competition. Having regard to the wide range of training that the committee have been asked to examine and to report on, it will of necessity take some time for them to complete all aspects of their work.</P>
    <P>In the context of the NESC report, it is appropriate to mention that the crime rate in this country is not exceptional by international standards and the problem of high crime is not unique to Ireland but is a feature of virtually every modern democratic society and indeed, a feature of a number of undemocratic societies also.  This is accepted in the report which compares our situation favourably with that of our near neighbour &mdash; the United Kingdom.  I should also point out that immediate measures to deal with specific problems such as joy-riding, drug abuse and attacks on the elderly, have had a fair measure of success.  In 1984 the Garda Commissioner reported a 2.6 per cent decrease in indictable crime.  This was the first time in seven years in which indictable crime had actually decreased. Provisional figures for 1985 indicate an even grater decline of the order of 8.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking features of the report is what it has to say in regard to the causative social factors of criminal behaviour.  I am referring to issues such as unemployment, poor educational attainment and certain housing and related environmental conditions. Although it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty in any individual case that any particular factor causes a person to become involved in crime, it is abundantly clear that there is a strong link between criminal behaviour and what we normally refer to as poverty or social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The report indicates that the 15 to 20 age group has a crime rate approximately <Col N="866" /> four times the national average, that the vast majority of young offenders are the product of disadvantage arising from a combination of factors including poverty, unemployment and poor educational attainment.  It is evident, therefore, that the response to the crime problem, if it is to be effective, must go beyond strengthening the components of the criminal justice system, namely the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prisons. A comprehensive, multi-dimensional response involving appropriate social and economic policies is called for. It is equally clear that the Government must work through its economic and social policies, towards the elimination of poverty in our society and for the achievement of equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that our efforts to identify the root causes of crime do not imply, in any sense, that we accept that these causes excuse crime.  I will say more about Government policies in the social and economic areas in a few moments. I want to emphasise the fact that law-abiding citizens must be protected in their persons and property now, and it is the responsibility of the Government and of the Minister for Justice in particular, to do everything in their power to provide them with that protection.  I would like, therefore, to outline some developments in the recent past which have been of assistance towards that end.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises the importance of a community-based approach to policing. I fully accept the necessity to involve the community at large in crime prevention activities and specific policies are being implemented in this context.  One such policy is Neighbourhood Watch. That is essentially a network of public spirited people who observe what is going on in their neighbourhoods and report any suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda.  The development of Neighbourhood Watch is an indication of the willingness both of the Garda to adopt new approaches to crime prevention and of the community to become actively involved with the Garda to defeat the criminal.  The scheme, which is most suitable for urban areas with high population <Col N="867" /> densities, is in operation at 107 centres throughout the country and is at various stages of implementation at 63 other centres. It is particularly appropriate in the context of discussions in this House on the NESC Report that I should mention that the Garda authorities have commenced a formal scientifically-based evaluation project on Neighbourhood Watch to measure the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing crime levels and in developing improved relations between the Garda Síochána and the community.  The results of this evaluation will form part of the process of formulating and developing other policies in the area of community-based policing.</P>
    <P>Long-term solutions to the main causes of crime, as the report highlights and as I have pointed out earlier, are more likely to lie in the areas of economic and social policy than within the narrower area of the criminal justice system.  It has to be accepted, however, that the creation of a society free from social and economic disadvantage is a long-term goal.  In the meantime, I believe that we can do many things to help towards the prevention of crime.  For example, local authorities, town planners and health authorities could all take greater account of crime prevention as a factor in their recommendations and decisions.  The Government's recently published National Youth Policy &ldquo;In Partnership with Youth&rdquo; is of particular relevance in this context.  The policy is aimed at assisting all young people to become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society.  It includes a detailed plan for the provision of services to young people generally and to disadvantaged young people in particular.  Total Government support for appropriate services in 1986 will be in excess of £6 million. I believe that the initiatives taken by the Government in this area will prove, in the long term, to be extremely significant in the fight to prevent and deter crime.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with some aspects of the NESC report which concern the courts, namely, the physical <Col N="868" /> appearance of courts, consultation facilities and the sound amplification of court proceedings.  The provision and maintenance of court accommodation outside the Dublin area is the responsibility of local authorities under the Courthouses (Maintenance and Provision) Act, 1935. There are three factors which influence the level of local authority expenditure on these courthouses (i) the large number of such courthouses, (ii) the relative infrequency of court sittings in many of them and (iii) the general financial constraints under which local authorities are operating.  There are basic physical deficiencies in many courts and I am taking steps to have them remedied in so far as these steps are open to me.  In taking action, however, the terms of the 1935 Act and the realities of present financial constraints must never be far from the front of my mind.</P>
    <P>In relation to court accommodation in Dublin &mdash; for which I have, in general, direct responsibility &mdash; there is an extensive building programme under way.  A modernised temporary Children's Court at Smithfield was opened recently.  Building work is in progress on an extension of the Four Courts complex on the site of the old Four Courts Hotel.  A contract is expected to be placed shortly for a purpose-built Children's Court.  When completed this will allow the temporary Children's Court to be diverted to other uses.  An examination is under way to see how the courts complex at Chancery Street might be improved.  Bearing in mind the general financial constraints, it is considered that this programme to improve court facilities is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of facilities for offenders to meet and consult in private with their solicitors, it is the policy to aim towards the provision of reasonable consultation facilities in court premises where they are considered essential and every suitable opportunity of doing so is being availed of.  Consultation rooms have been provided, for example, in the newly restored courthouses in Tralee and Waterford and in the new court premises at Dolphin House and the temporary <Col N="869" /> Children's Court premises at Smithfield, both in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Whenever sound amplification of the proceedings is considered necessary by the judge or justice the Office of Public Works, in relation to the Dublin courts or the appropriate local authority in other cases, is asked to provide the facility. Ultimately, however, the decision whether or not to make use of sound amplifications rests with the individual judges and justices who are controlling the proceedings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of inconsistencies in sentences being imposed by the Judiciary, the position is that under our legal system the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  This enables the judge or justice to exercise his or her discretion within the maximum penalty by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused.  This means that it is inevitable that there will be divergences between sentences even for the same offence because the circumstances will differ from case to case.</P>
    <P>While there is provision in law for meetings of justices of the District Court to discuss, among other things, the avoidance of undue divergences in the general level of fines and other penalties, there is no similar provision in the case of the other courts.  The position is, however, that over the past few years regional conferences of judges have been convened to discuss the administration of justice. Members of the Judiciary regularly attend national and international meetings and conferences on matters of concern to the Judiciary which keep them in touch with new ideas and developments. Legislation to make regular meetings mandatory is unnecessary in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the recommendations made in the NESC report in relation to the prisons.  The House will be aware that since this report was published we have also had the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the penal system which addresses in even greater detail many of <Col N="870" /> the issues referred to in the NESC report and many of the recommendations made by NESC are repeated and indeed amplified in the Whitaker report.  I am at present studying the Whitaker report and I have already make it clear that I regard taking action on the conclusions of the committee as a priority.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report was the first of its kind in this country for over a century and the decisions which are taken on foot of that report will shape penal policy here for a long time to come.  The issues which arise in this area are basic to the way we, as a democratic society, organise ourselves and it is a matter of the very greatest importance that the Government can get all of these right.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that I cannot say at this stage what those decisions will be, and you know yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that I resist temptations to indiscretion in this House. But I can repeat the commitment which was given here when the report was debated recently: namely, that if any of the recommendations made by the committee are to be rejected it will only be where a thorough analysis shows that the balance of the public interest lies elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While, as I have indicated already, I cannot respond in detail tonight to what the Whitaker report has to say, I can offer some preliminary observations on some of the issues currently affecting the prisons.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the prison service has to contend, on behalf of society, with some very difficult problems.  It is not uncommon to read reports of various &ldquo;crises&rdquo; besetting the prisons; and, while labelling the difficulties with which the prisons have to contend as &ldquo;crises&rdquo; is at best over-dramatic and certainly does not contribute in any way towards a resolution of the problems, it is important that there should be a public awareness of the difficult issues which arise in relation to the prisons.  I am bound to say that some of the public comment, particularly over the last couple of months, has not contributed a great deal to developing that public awareness of what those issues are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> A very heavy demand has been placed on our prison system over the past three years or so because of the unprecedented growth in the numbers in custody.  This, it has to be said, is partly a reflection of the Government's determination to ensure that people convicted of serious crimes &mdash; for example, crimes which threaten the safety of citizens such as joyriding and attacks on the elderly but other crimes also serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.  At present about 1,900 offenders are being accommodated, whereas just three years ago the daily average prison population was only about 1,200.  The unprecedented level of this increase can be seen from the fact that over the past three years numbers have risen by about 700 while the increase over all of the previous ten years was only about 200.</P>
    <P>The increase of over 50 per cent has had to be coped with, by and large, without any new purpose-built accommodation being available.  I should make it clear that, despite what is sometimes alleged, the lack of new prison accommodation cannot be attributed to any action taken by the present Government. It is obvious that an increase in the prison population of the proportions I have outlined and over such a short period places pressure on the prison system, but, generally, this increase has been dealt with in a very effective way.</P>
    <P>The Irish prison system is by no means unique in having to contend with pressure on prison accommodation.  Many countries, particularly in Western Europe, are facing similar difficulties and I do not think that it has been sufficiently recognised that we have been fortunate in being able to deal with this problem without resorting to the type of extreme measures which other administrators have found necessary.  We have not, for example, had to greatly restrict out-of-cell time for offenders or have offenders &ldquo;queue up&rdquo; to serve their sentences until a prison space becomes available.  The policy here has been to cope with the increased numbers in a way that maintains to the greatest extent possible the <Col N="872" /> quality of services and regimes in the institutions and I can assure the House that that is a policy I wholly support.</P>
    <P>While the outcome of consideration on the Whitaker report will have implications one way or another for prison accommodation, I think it is important that we are clear about the current situation. There has been a lot of talk lately about overcrowding in our prisons; but it is, nevertheless, the case that we do not have this problem on anything like the scale being experienced by many other administrations.  For example, in one neighbouring administration it is not uncommon because of pressure on accommodation for prisoners to be locked up three to a cell for 23 hours a day.  I am glad that we have never had to countenance anything like that.</P>
    <P>While I believe it is important to keep our problem of pressure on prison accommodation in perspective, I recognise that in terms of prison administration the numbers in custody are undesirably high. This has to be seen against a background of the need to ensure that people convicted of serious offences are not let out of prison without having served a substantial proportion of their sentences. Given the genuine and understandable concern which people have about crime, it is imperative that the prison system makes every effort to ensure that those convicted of serious offences serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts. That is what has been happening in recent years and when difficulties arise in the prisons I think, in fairness, that it is in this context that they should be judged.</P>
    <P>Even since the Whitaker committee reported, some issues in relation to the operation of the prisons have taken on a prominence and urgency which did not obtain when the committee were deliberating. In particular, we now have to face the problem of prisoners who have been identified as having AIDS antibodies. There are two points which I think important to emphasise about this.  First, the presence of AIDS antibodies in a person simply indicates that that person has come in contact with the AIDS virus &mdash; the chances of the individual going on <Col N="873" /> to develop AIDS itself are considered low.  Second, the indications are that the virus can be transmitted only through very limited means &mdash; essentially, either through sexual activity or blood to blood contact, through, for example, the sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that offenders found to have AIDS antibodies are now being segregated within particular institutions. This has been found necessary both to reduce the level of unease &mdash; however irrational or unfounded it might be &mdash; among the general prison population and to enable the precautions and restrictions which medical advice indicates to be necessary to be applied as easily as possible.</P>
    <P>While it is important to keep the problem in perspective, it will be clear that the presence of offenders with AIDS antibodies represents a wholly unwelcome development in the context of the pressures already being experienced by the prison system in dealing with the substantial growth in the numbers being committed to custody.  The presence of offenders with AIDS antibodies is a reflection of the high proportion of offenders who have been intravenous drug abusers before being committed to prison.</P>
    <P>Over recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of offenders with drug related problems. Dealing with them poses very severe difficulties for the prison service.  The prison system here &mdash; or indeed anywhere else for that matter &mdash; does not have some kind of ready-made cure for drug addiction and the essential difficulty which arises is that it is not possible to impose effective therapy on someone who is not sufficiently motivated to give up drugs.</P>
    <P>For some years now we have had a scheme under which prisoners who appear sufficiently motivated and who are not considered a serious threat to society are allowed temporary release from prison to attend at a centre such as Coolemine.  I intend to continue and, if possible, expand that scheme.  As part of my examination of the Whitaker report I <Col N="874" /> will be paying special attention to what further measures might be taken to help offenders with drug problems, but I think we should recognise that there are no easy or complete solutions in this area.</P>
    <P>What I have been saying about the prisons tonight represents just some initial observations on a number of issues which have received prominence lately. I look forward at a later stage to a fuller debate on many of these issues, particularly in the light of the outcome of our consideration of the Whitaker report.</P>
    <P>I now wish to say a few words on the question of statistics, which has been referred to on a number of occasions during this debate by Senator B. Ryan. Those references reflect in a general way the shortcomings already mentioned in this area in the NESC report.  I do not argue with some of the points raised in the debate and in the report itself.  For example, I agree that the availability of relevant statistics is essential for an examination of the system's problems and for the development of recommendations as to its future direction.  I agree with the report's point that current statistical practices do not allow us to track people through the criminal justice system from beginning to end, or to discern what is happening at certain stages in the process. I do not agree that they fail to give a general portrayal of what is going on within the system and what is being done about it, although the picture might not be as detailed as one would like.  It is not true to say that the information collected at present does not allow for evaluation or accounting for what has been done. Indeed, the financial and other data available accounts, to the last penny, for what has been done with the money spent in the system.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the consultant, by his extensive use, in chapter 4 of his report, of tabular statements of crime statistics taken from the annual crime report, shows just how valuable and relevant those statistics, and the way they are presented, are to analysts such as himself.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner's annual report on crime is a useful indicator not only of the level of criminality which faces <Col N="875" /> the community and the Garda, as reflected by the numbers of crimes reported, but also of how successful the Garda and society generally are in combating criminality, as reflected in the detection rate for each category of crime.</P>
    <P>My own Department's research unit is conscious of the system's statistical shortcomings and is tackling the problem on a methodical basis.</P>
    <P>As far as court statistics are concerned, a revised format for collection of statistics in the Circuit Court has been produced recently.  It is to be tried on a pilot basis in selected Circuit Court offices over the next few months with a view to full implementation from the beginning of the next legal year.  A similar operation is underway in relation to High Court statistics, with the same time-scale in mind, and it is intended to overhaul the District Court statistics-gathering system after that.  We will then have the more meaningful court statistics and the question of making them available to outside researchers will then be considered.  The council can rely on my own well known proclivity for statistics to ensure that we make rapid progress in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A very significant development is now taking place in my Department with the implementation of the first phase of a major computerisation project for the prison service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two aims to the proposed system are to modernise prison administration and to provide fuller data and analysis of that data.  The first phase of the project will include the computerisation of all prisoner records and the second phase will cover probation and welfare service records.  When the project has been completed it should go a long way towards meeting many of the criticisms which are made about the inadequacy of statistics. In an attempt to ensure that the information provided by the system will be as thorough and as valuable as possible, a committee of outside researchers has <Col N="876" /> been set up to advise my Department on requirements in this area.  I believe that having such a committee established virtually from the start of the implementation of the computerisation project will prove to be of substantial benefit to both my Department and the various interested outside bodies.</P>
    <P>I know that this has been far from the in-depth discussion of all of the items raised in the report.  I should like to assure the House that I will be an assiduous attender at debates here.  Having had the experience of the assistance of the House in the financial area for just over three years, I have every confidence that I will have the same level of assistance in the Justice portfolio.  The House can be assured of the same attention and, if necessary, assiduity, from me in relation to debates that we will have in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome and the good wishes that have been extended to the Minister in his new role.</P>
      <P>The motion calls on Seanad Éireann to take note of Report No. 77 of the National Economic and Social Council entitled &ldquo;The Criminal Justice System: Policy and Performance&rdquo;.  This report is another one of plethora of reports which have been submitted in recent years by a variety of committees and commissions which were established to examine various aspects of the criminal justice system.  We have had, for example, reports from the Committee on Court Practices and Procedures, the Task Force on Child Care, the Criminal Legal Aid Review Committee, the Ó Briain Committee, the Conroy Commission, the Ryan Committee and, more recently, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report to which the motion refers was submitted to Government in December 1984.  I am sure that by now it, like all the other reports that I have mentioned, is safely gathering dust somewhere on shelves in the Department of Justice and elsewhere.  One hope that this NESC report appears to express is that some day we will have a Government or a Minister with the political will to <Col N="877" /> implement at least some of the laudable recommendations contained in all of these reports.  Perhaps this motion should be calling on the Government to deal with some of the problems which the report identifies and to implement some of its recommendations, instead of calling on the Seanad to take note of it.  It is pointless to call on the Members of the House to take note of this report when there are so many recommendations in so many other reports which have not been &mdash; and probably never will be &mdash; implemented.  One would have to be an optimist to believe that this report will have a fate any different to that of many of the reports to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me in this debate it will only be possible for me to comment on a few sections of what is a very comprehensive and detailed document. The report is divided into two parts: part two runs to almost 200 pages and contains the findings of the consultant who was commissioned by the National Economic and Social Council to examine the social policy implications of the criminal justice system.  In part one the council notes the findings of the consultant, comments on them and on other associated matters.  I will confine my comments to the findings and recommendations of the consultant.  I am in total agreement with almost all of the conclusions which he reaches, as I am sure most people are.</P>
    <P>Crime in Ireland today has reached serious levels in spite of what the Minister has stated.  In certain areas, particularly in Dublin, it has reached crisis proportions. Nobody can deny this.  Statistics which are given in the report indicate clearly the colossal rise in the crime rate which has occurred in the last 15 to 20 years.  There were 55 robberies in 1932; 43 in 1942; 23 in 1952; and 39 in 1962.  By 1972 the figure had risen to 622.  In 1982 this number again had increased threefold to 1,883.</P>
    <P>This increase in the level of crime has posed serious problems for our criminal justice system.  These problems have manifested themselves in every area of the system.  The problems to which I refer <Col N="878" /> are further aggravated by the fact that the operation of our criminal justice system is antiquated in many ways.  This is mainly because the system was structured at a time when the crime rate was lower than it is today and when social conditions and attitudes were very different.  In the area of record-keeping, antiquated procedures are still being used.  The consultant points out that only the Garda Síochána have substantially modernised their record-keeping and he notes that the courts and, to a lesser extent, the prison system retain a deep attachment to older bookkeeping procedures.  As a result of this antiquated approach to record-keeping there is a serious lack of information and of accurate detailed records.  This lack of information and the inadequacy of published crime statistics are given by the consultant as factors which make it difficult to fully evaluate the operation of the system.</P>
    <P>These are areas which should be rectified immediately.  They should not have had to wait the publication of this report to draw attention to them.  The criminal justice system has not benefitted to the extent that it should have from the major technological advances in information processing and recording which have occurred in recent years.</P>
    <P>The main social objective of the criminal justice system is the maintenance of law and order.  The main agencies of the system are the Garda Síochána, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the criminal courts, the probation and welfare service and the prison system.  A large part of the report is taken up with an examination of these agencies and their activities, particularly the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison system. The Minister in his contribution dwelt mainly on these three agencies of the criminal justice system.  In the short time available to me these are the three areas which I will deal with.</P>
    <P>The report examines the pattern of crime and endeavours to identify those factors which appear to have an influence on the prevalence of crime among certain socio-economic groups.  It also deals with the relevance of various aspects of social <Col N="879" /> policy to the problems of crime and how social policies have an effect on crime levels.  The final chapter in the report looks to the future and outlines the options that are available for change.</P>
    <P>The report attempts to evaluate how well or how badly the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison system are fulfilling its role.  If one had to define the role of the Garda Síochána in one sentence one would have to say that their role is to prevent and detect crime, to maintain law and order and to protect the person and the property of the citizen. Such a definition provides a simplistic and incomplete view of the work which the force does on a day-to-day basis.  One of the reasons that modern police work has become so diverse is that the public expect the police to provide a whole range of services, some of which bear little relationship to either crime control or law enforcement.  One would imagine that success in the areas of crime prevention and law enforcement should be the criterion on which most people would judge the effectiveness and efficiency of the Garda Síochána.  It is interesting to note that the report points out that there is evidence that public satisfaction with police performance is most strongly affected by the non-crime public assistance role of the force.  It goes on to state that, if that is the case, the success achieved in such activities may well be a prerequisite to effective crime control and law enforcement, because both depend heavily on public co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, therefore, that in recent years the level of public co-operation with the Garda appears to be decreasing rather than increasing.  The main reason for this is undoubtedly the fact that the Garda are not out among the people to the extent they used to be in years gone by.  In those days they worked hard at getting to know the people and gaining their trust and confidence.  They were in much closer contact with the communities in which they served than is the case today.  In rural areas particularly the advent of the patrol car and the closing <Col N="880" /> of many small stations has changed all this.  They no longer know the people in their areas in the same way as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to another factor, which is that members of the force do not live in the areas they serve.  The report also deals with the discretionary powers of the Garda and points out that they are the main decision makers in the initiation of criminal prosecutions. The only cases which must be referred to the DPP's office are those which the Garda wish to pursue in the higher courts.  Otherwise, decisions taken by the Garda in relation to prosecutions are entirely at their own discretion.</P>
    <P>Having considered all these factors, the report concludes that the information needed for evaluation purposes as far as the Garda are concerned is simply not available.  The point is made that it is the method rather than the level of policing that affects both the level of crime and public attitudes.  The report also attempts to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the courts, and in the sections dealing with the court system the report refers to the desirability of avoiding unnecessary delay in court proceedings and also to consistency in sentencing.  I am sure that every Member of this House is aware of cases in which there would appear to have been undue and unnecessary delays.  Every effort must be made to eliminate such delays.</P>
    <P>On the question of consistency in sentencing, the report makes the point that it is unreasonable to expect that identical sentences will be imposed on all persons convicted for any one type of offence. However, it is reasonable to expect a basic level of consistency.  Unfortunately, the public perception is that this basic consistency does not always exist, and this perception has been strengthened in recent times by the fact that sentences imposed in a variety of cases have attracted a considerable amount of media attention and comment.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested in the report that the courts should convey by their physical appearance and the manner in which they <Col N="881" /> conduct their proceedings, the seriousness, dignity and openness of their work. All persons involved in court proceedings should be able to hear what is being said and to understand the terminology and procedure.  This should be the situation, but unfortunately it is not always the case and we have all read reports of dilapidated courthouses where there is inadequate heating and poor acoustics.  While it is very easy for the members of the legal profession and the Judiciary who are familiar with procedure to understand what is going on, sometimes it is very difficult for the unfortunate individual who may be appearing in court for the first time.</P>
    <P>The importance of access to legal assistance and also the work being done by the probation and welfare service are also dealt with in the report.  I would like to deal with the sections of the report concerning the prison system, but unfortunately I have not time to do that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, while I have only touched on a few aspects of the report, I want to say that there are many good points and excellent recommendations in the report and I hope to see many of these recommendations implemented. One criticism that I would make of the report is that it does not contain a summary of the recommendations which are contained in the various chapters.  A summary of the recommendations would be very helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with others who have welcomed the Minister, to this House in his new responsibilities, and to wish him every success and a fruitful period in the Department of Justice.  I will turn in a moment to the text of his speech, but I am glad to notice a continuation of the trend observable in his predecessor's speech of a new attitude, perhaps within the Department of Justice itself, towards the crime problem. When I began speaking about four or five years ago on crime and justice in the other House, there did not seem to be, for example, an acceptance of the basic difference between factors associated with the rate of crime and the incidence <Col N="882" /> of crime.  This is accepted very thoroughly now both by the present Minister in his speech and by his predecessor. That is not a pedantic point.  It has supported many of us who have been arguing for a separate discussion from basic structural features in society that affected the rate of crime and to prevent these explanations from being confused with particular case histories which used to be used from time to time.</P>
      <P>A number of other points are to be welcomed.  I welcome the commitment to carrying through some of the fundamental proposals of the Whitaker committee report.  May I, at this stage, pay tribute to Dr. David Rothman, who is the consultant involved in NESC report No. 77 and who has also served on the Whitaker committee report?  I believe that this report, taken together with the Whitaker report, comprise the two basic documents from which people who are studying criminology in Ireland will now depart.  They are very valuable locations of major theoretical issues in criminology and we are indebted to those who served on the committee and to Dr. Rothman for his work for the National Economic and Social Council and to the council itself for this report.</P>
      <P>May I begin immediately with what is dearest to the Minister's heart, the comments on statistics?  Quite frankly I wish his computerisation project well, but he will understand it when I say, instantly, that the problems about computing the rate of crime and trends in crime do not derive really from the mechancial manipulation of the data: they really derive from the construction of the data itself.  This point is well made in the consultants' report, and it is also very well adverted to by the council in responding to his report and in making recommendations on changes in the gathering of statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible and incorrect statiscally to take the data that comprises the categories of the report of the Commissioner to the Minister in any one year with another year.  It is impossible to take those that are represented in a particular column in the report and find them in <Col N="883" /> the following year's report.  Numbers of crimes go missing.  You cannot balance the books, to use an analogy which the Minister will be glad to say goodbye to, I am sure.  It will be much more difficult in relation to the crime area, if the Minister is relying on the Commissioner's report, than he found in his previous Department.</P>
    <P>There are other problems.  There is the fact that the individual offence may be reported in several different ways.  It may find itself in the statistics in several different expressions.  There is the further problem that individuals committing crime cannot be construed from statistics that report numbers of crimes.  Equally, the processional character of crime &mdash; that is processing, how crimes move through the system as you move from one column of the report to another &mdash; cannot be used.  I say this as someone who has wanted to use these figures professionally. You cannot use these figures adequately.  If you are going for an accurate statistical approach towards crime I would very strongly endorse the concluding recommendation in the report.  The consultation makes a suggestion that those who are involved in the preparation of gathering statistical material should provide an explanation of how they construe the unit that is being used and the manner in which the figures are being recorded.  Therefore, we might have a possibility of comparing like with like within the statistics.</P>
    <P>I equally say that we should look very seriously at the different points of entry to which our attention has been addressed.  There is the whole question of court decisions.  The decisions from the courts are recorded in various ways from one court district to another and even between one time period and another within the same court.  I am only saying this to be of assistance.  Computerisation from the final end of the processing side may not achieve as much as clear indications to those who are responsible for first direct entry in relation to crimes and so on.  The best way is to take the fine decision points that are involved and that <Col N="884" /> are referred to in this report.  It is suggested that these arise, first, in relation to the arrest or summons; second, initiation of court proceedings; third, the determination of category and court proceedings; fourth, the verdict; and, fifth, sentencing. If one took those five departure points as the points at which you said &ldquo;I want accurate figures on these that are comparable not only from one period with another, from one area to another and from one socio-economic group to another&rdquo; you would have valuable information and it would achieve a great deal.</P>
    <P>Far more important than the question of accurate statistics is the construction that exists of the rate of crime.  I welcome this report.  I find it useful and I am already using it with those with whom I discuss criminal law.  I would have welcomed a chapter or section on the media and criminal law, both in terms of the criminal justice system and in the public construction and perception of the crime rate.  There is no doubt at all &mdash; and I repeat it here so that it may be understood even more widely &mdash; that there are three different things in relation to crime. There are the crimes that are committed; there are the crimes that are reported; and, finally, there are the crimes that are perceived.  If we take a single example, in relation to crimes against the elderly, there is a great danger of the elderly in Ireland perceiving that they as a totality are at risk because of the much-publicised individual crimes from particular cities and from particular contexts.  It would be wrong to condemn the news media generally in this regard, but particularly the Independent group of newspapers has behaved with a disgraceful irresponsibility in whipping up what can only be called a moral panic, in relation to the crime rate in Ireland.  If you create a great deal of fear among older people you are doing them a great disservice.  In relation to crimes against the elderly they showed less interest in what was either the actual or the recorded rate than they did in increasing perceptions and fears among the elderly.</P>
    <P>The rate of crime in a society is always <Col N="885" /> amenable to the work of those people who I called earlier moral entrepreneurs, people who construe moral panics for their own purposes.  There is a wide literature in this regard even in relation to the linguistic expression of it.  If you look at the career of the word &ldquo;mugging&rdquo;, for example, it became fashionable in Britain for a period of about ten years and then they went back to the conventional description of people being robbed and battered and so on.  In other words, there are fashions in relation to exploiting fear in the population as a result of changing crime.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that I am closing my eyes to the changing nature of crime.  I have read Dr. Rothman's work earlier. I think his work has been enormously valuable in identifying the actual increase in crime and some factors that might be associated with it and in locating it in time very accurately.  Where I would differ slightly is in relation to the explanation of crime.  A great deal of work has yet to be carried out on the perception of &ldquo;the law&rdquo; in Ireland.  The criminal justice system is not an independent, objective entity perceived equally by all and every citizen in exactly the same way, irrespective of the socio-economic group to which they belong.  The law and the criminal justice system has an entirely different construction, for example, for those who are at the receiving end of a court system which has bad amplification, and who have to be nudged when they have to make their move within court, than it has for those who preside over the court. Equally, for those whose property has been stolen and who may have become victims for the first time, their perception of the criminal justice system is different in turn than for those who will work within the system, perhaps in terms of representing any of the parties involved and so on.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a much greater interest in this area as to how &ldquo;the law&rdquo; and the criminal justice system is viewed variably by different groups within society. For example, if you are to understand the prominence of car theft and associated crimes in Dublin city I believe that you <Col N="886" /> have to begin this work, if you are to understand crime.  I note I have used the word &ldquo;understand&rdquo;.  There is an enormous difference between understanding the criminal justice system and understanding the crime phenomenon and controlling the crime phenomenon.  A problem in relation to understanding the crime problem is one in which you have to look at all sorts of motivational patterns. Managing the level of crime is something into which Governments in Europe have fallen back.  I am glad the consultant knocks out the idea that we have become victims of something rather like the Asian flu which is going around at the moment and of which I might possibly be a victim. We are not being infected internationally but we have to try to understand crime in terms of our own structures and society.</P>
    <P>I would welcome greater attention in the report, and particularly in the council's response to the report to the changed nature of property in Ireland, to the increase in value of portable property, the increase in urbanisation rates and the changed spatial distribution of the population. In fairness, this is adverted to in the report, but I think it is of a much greater importance than is recognised.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about statistics and the construction of the rate of crime and the difference between the real rate and the perceived rate.  I also think that there should be an appreciation of the full title of this report.  It is entitled &ldquo;The Criminal Justice System: Policy and Performance&rdquo;. I presume that the second word in that title means that it is analysing the legal system as a processual entity.  If it is, it must be able to begin at the point at which the law impacts on people's lives, whether they are victims or those who perpetrate crime, and be able to go right up to the end, when perhaps it is the 8 per cent who have come out of the prison system.</P>
    <P>May I make a plea here, as I have made before, that in this enlightened age &mdash; and I wish the Minister success in his period of enlightenment in the Department of Justice &mdash; there be a great deal of openness in relation particularly to the prison system.  We are not able to <Col N="887" /> do the work we can in the area of law, crime and society in the absence of far more availability of information in relation to the prison system as it impacts on the lifecycle of prisoners.  This is not to argue for a second for infringement on the constitutional rights of a prisoner; it is to enable us to construct life cycles and patterns so as to be able to make the links that are necessary, for example, between social policy and crime.  I would take the position that might seem initially to be more conservative than the Minister.  I do not believe that the crime rate is as amenable to social policy as many people think.  The whole question of the distribution of life chances in society is much deeper than that.  I think that social policy on a day-to-day basis or as initiated by Government is insufficient to redress the structural imbalances that are producing the major fluctuations in crime.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many things in this report are valuable.  The proposals in relation to sentencing policy are very valuable.  I would like greater account to be taken of the section dealing with young offenders.  Dr. Helen Burke's views, stemming from her work on the social and economic circumstances of young offenders, is enormously valuable.  Many people who should be kept out of the juvenile criminal justice system at an early point could be kept out of it if there was a greater possibility of co-operation and exchange of information between the school attendance system and the youth offenders system.  I support every recommendation in this report that speaks for the extension of the juvenile liaison system, the social and welfare possibilities and back-up facilities available to judges involved in sentencing and who want non-custodial alternatives.  It is important to recognise that often when you have identified families with chronic school attendance problems you have identified families at risk in relation to youth crime statistics.  There could be much more done by way of intervention if we were able to do that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the criminal justice system there is a point occurring in the <Col N="888" /> middle of all of this, which I am glad has been ignored to some extent because it would generate heat in its own right.  That is, the distinction of role between the solicitors and barristers and perhaps the retention of what would be regarded as archaic practices of etiquette.  I have my own view on that.  I do not want to deflect now from the substantial considerations, but I think all of these problems are very important.  We too easily accept the legacy of legal procedures of former times.  There is no doubt in my mind that the court practices, be it in terms of the setting the procedures, the symbols, or even the assumptions concerning the process, are from a former colonial age and reflect our lack of confidence in ourselves to develop settings for the processing of people in difficulties.  When the British White Paper on children was published by Labour Minister many years ago it was called <i>Children in Trouble.</i>  I welcomed that because it had an appropriate title, a title that showed that you could perhaps look at how children came into contact with the law.  During the period in which the Minister is in the Ministry &mdash; I would like to offer him what co-operation I can by way of work in this area &mdash; I would tell him that he will have difficulty in countering the work of those who have, as has been accurately pointed out in this report, a vested interest in suggesting that the rate of crime is much greater than it is.</P>

      <P>Let me say it is not incidental or irrelevant to the more theoretical arguments I made for a better physical setting in which we might examine the criminal justice system.  May I offer one point in this regard?  If 90 per cent of the cases actually tried are tried in the District Court, why not make the District Court an absolutely model place in which everybody will hear and understand everything that is going on?  I conclude by saying this.  If somebody says that the law is coming and if the Cathaoirleach will put himself in the position of a <Col N="889" /> teenage urban young person about to steal a car and drive it around Dublin city &mdash; if you are going on to pass the decision points that are described here in a flow chart and if you find yourself in a court where you cannot hear what is being said, every physical setting, every set of social assumptions, the whole symbolic canopy will begin to emphasise more and more that you have entered a world which has stood apart from you; that it is not your law that is at stake, but that you have come into collision with their law.  All the physical improvements and all the social relationship improvements and others must work towards that end to try to create a situation in which the law might be the law of those who have come into conflict with it.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been facilitated myself many times and I would be glad to facilitate the Senators.  I will be brief. This is not an area in which I am expert, but nevertheless I have a general interest in that area.</P>
      <P>I welcome warmly the Minister of State, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, and wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a very fine report.  It is a comprehensive report and I would like to pay tribute to the members of the National Economic and Social Council and also to Mr. David B. Rothman for the work which he has contributed to the report.  I would like to feel that in a situation like this we would realise we are dealing with individuals.  I understand that statistics have a role to play; nevertheless, I think that this concept could be lost in referring to statistics.  I remember on one occasion many years ago, when I was working in Dublin, a serious crime was committed by a young man.  This got widespread publicity and the following morning one of the officers in my Department said that this man should be <Col N="890" /> flogged within an inch of his life.  Another officer, a more kindly man, with a young family of his own, said &ldquo;That is all very well, but it could happen to be your own son&rdquo;.  That is my concept of how we should view statistics.  When we call into a housing scheme and meet a young wife with a young family whose husband has left and will never return, she has this major problem whatever her views are on divorce.  It is far different when we come across these problems in the flesh, so to speak, rather than when we meet them in statistics.</P>
    <P>With regard to urbanisation, there is no doubt whatever that urbanisation results in increased crime.  I had many passages to read in connection with that but I do not have the time.  We should look at this whole idea of urbanisation. In the past people have gathered in the cities to find work.  Work is no longer in the city and yet we have this growth in urbanisation.  In financial terms &mdash; for example, as in the case of battery hens and deep litter broiler chickens &mdash; there is a case to be made for lumping people together like that.  On the other hand, if we take in the whole concept, if we take in the stresses that are caused on account of this, if we take into consideration the crime and the cost of crime, we would have to look again at urbanisation and feel that perhaps there is something to be said for encouraging people to remain in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12, on page 8 of the report, dealt with pattern of crime in Ireland.  It stated:</P>
    <P>In Dublin the inner city and the newer suburban estates accounted for a large proportion of those arrested.</P>
    <P>This is a very sad situation, and it illustrates what I say in relation to that.  People were pulled from their roots in the area of the inner city.  There was a strong case to be made for that financially, because land in the inner city is costly and therefore a strong political case could be made that for a certain amount of money more houses could be provided in the suburbs than in the inner city.  That was done and more houses were provided.  These <Col N="891" /> people were pulled away from their roots, their culture and their tradition.  They were put into stressful situations which resulted in an increase in crime for which they were blamed, but which in reality had nothing to do with them.  The Minister, referred to that.  He said for example local authorities, town planners and. health authorities could all take greater account of crime prevention as a factor in their recommendations and decisions. Of course they could.  If those problems and the cost of those problems had been taken into consideration, those people would not have been moved from the inner city.  Problems arise from this and this was illustrated where decent hard working people who never came in conflict with the law were pushed out by high finance and for other reasons into criminal areas.  This was wrong.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Garda Síochána, I would like to go into this in detail, but there is not enough time.  The Garda Síochána, in my experience, have fulfilled their role excellently.  As a peace commissioner I was involved in many cases with the Garda &mdash; many of them sad cases.  I do not know of any situation where the Garda could be criticised for being unkind or uncaring.  I know that the papers have highlighted areas where the Garda could be blamed, but in a force as large as the Garda I am sure it would be impossible not to have some people who are not considerate.  My experience is that the Garda have been very kind.  They have had, as the report points out, considerable discretion with regard to prosecutions. I should like to say in this respect that I know of situations where the Garda have worked very hard and where they have brought people to court on account of that hard work.  Then at that stage, because of representations made by public representatives, the cases have been dropped or something has been done to take the edge from the prosecutions. In situations like that the Garda have reason to feel peeved.  They are doing a job.  They are doing it well.  On the other hand I know it is very hard in a situation like that to say &ldquo;I am sorry, <Col N="892" /> this man deserves what he is getting&rdquo;. Many people ask me &mdash; as they do other public representatives &mdash; to make representations for them.  We cannot be a judge in that situation.  There is a conflict here.</P>
    <P>There are two final things I would like to say.  With regard to women in prisons, the report points out that the number of women committed to prisons is very small.  There are plans to provide a prison for women.  This could be looked at again to see if something more humane could be done rather than building solid walls to deprive women of their liberty.</P>
    <P>Finally, I feel that adult education is not utilised enough in this whole area. We know from the report that deprived people and uneducated people have been brought into this net.  At a time when we have so much unemployment and where we have the facilities in colleges and buildings that can be used in the adult education distance education summer time and in many other ways, adult education distance education or whatever we call it could help to reduce this whole problem of crime.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  Like all the reports from the National Economic and Social Council, it is very comprehensive and thorough.  It is unfortunate that we did not get more time to debate it.  I hope that the Minister will bring in legislation and whatever statutory instruments are necessary to incorporate the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you.  Senator Fitzsimons, for being so brief.  We have roughly ten minutes left.  It is between Senators Robb and McDonald, so I would ask you to divide it up as best you can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Senators Fitzsimons and McDonald for their generosity.  I will try to say what I have to say in four minutes flat, so it will really have to be a list.  I agree with the points Senator Fitzsimons made in relation to the need to produce a healthier and more holistic type of social environment so that crime will gradually become <Col N="893" /> less likely.  There seems to be three main types of crime in Ireland &mdash; the political crime; the criminal crime, if you like to call it that; and the crime of the genuinely pathological person.  These need different approaches.</P>
      <P>We are not here to deal with the political crime.  That is in the whole area of national and regional politics.  We are chiefly concerned with what people understand as criminal crime.  We have to consider what sort of person gets caught up in that.  Is he the person who has not got the confidence to cope with the society he finds himself in?  Has he in some way not had the opportunity to develop the talent that is unique to him in such a way that he can find a form of self expression in his society?  Is he a person who has developed a lack of confidence? Is he a person who resents the failures that he has had, and the lack of opportunity that he is presented with?  Is violence in some sense an expression of a need to find space, which has been denied to him?  If so, once he has violated, what are we doing with the remorse he feels, the guilt he has and the anger which is contained within him.  With all these things in mind I go with what previous Senators have said and say we need to have a new conceptualisation of prison and a new concept of the community supports that are needed in relation to community policing, community reintegration of the ex-prisoner and the whole community back-up that makes crime less likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal first then with the prisons. We must see our prisons as something which needs the integrated support of all the various strands that make up the community.  The doctor should not be seen primarily as a servant of the State. The doctor should be in the prison adhering to his prime role which is the one-to-one relationship between himself and the person who in the case is a prisoner.  Is he only concerned with curing his diseases or preventing them or is he concerned also with promoting his health in the total sense?  What about the role of the clergy? What about the role of the educators? Senator Fitzsimons mentioned that.  Are <Col N="894" /> we involving these people enough in the prisons?  Are they by statute obliged to go in?  I proposed at an international meeting of doctors concerned with the whole business of prison welfare that it was time we had an independent body in each country which would consist of criminologists; would consist, by obligation of representatives, doctors who have in their practice prisoners among it and who would be obliged to attend every now and then the person in prison as well as being attended by the prison doctor. Prison doctors, ex-prisoners, prison officers and policemen, this should form a new institute of criminology where the whole subject of crime and the causes of it could be discussed and analysed and the cures for it brought about in a political sense as well as a social sense.  That brings me back then to the community.</P>
    <P>There is much glib talk about community. Certainly as part and parcel of Senator Fitzsimons's decentralisation society, ruralisation of society, there is need not to talk about giving out in a patronising sense, but giving the people back a sense of their own power so that they can take back to themselves what has been lost. In the local community we might consider the positive aspects &mdash; and I mentioned this before &mdash; of a community forum where it would discuss maybe three or four times a years matters of importance. In this case, matters dealing with law and order; the containment of offenders; what we are doing with them; and what we are doing to reintegrate them.</P>
    <P>Do we have community fora at all?  Do we oblige and invite our citizens to discuss at community level important subjects such as this?  We might consider the idea of the guild &mdash; community law and justice guild where we could bring together the social workers, the clergy, the educators, the ex-prisoners, the young people, the parents that have people in prison and so on to discuss these matters at community level along with the community involved and the police, about whom we have heard something already.</P>
    <P>I have heard recently some chat about national service.  Why do people have to go out with rifles?  Why not have a <Col N="895" /> national social service where our youngsters, before they are given the badge of mature citizenship, are able to have periods of social involvement with the prisoner, the police, the courts and so on. They will become more aware of what is going on in society so that when they become mature citizens they will not only have the knowledge that their education is bound to give them, but an awareness of the whole breadth of social involvement. In this instance, this includes crime, prisons, prisoners and reintegration. I have covered, at a considerable pace a few of the points that I wanted to make.  I hope that this will not be the last time that we have an opportunity to debate this extremely important subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The preamble of the Constitution and Terms of Reference of the National Economic and Social Council states that:</P>
      <P>The main task of the National Economic and Social Council shall be to provide a forum for discussion of the principles relating to the efficient development of the national economy and the achievements of social justice, and to advise the Government, through the Taoiseach, on their application.</P>
      <P>I submit that this report does exactly that in a very caring way.  It gives those people in the Department responsible for the administration of justice, the criminal justice system, policy and performance, a lot of food for thought.  It is unfortunate that we do not have the opportunity of going in depth into this very worthwhile report but I should like to deal with two area and make two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my own experiences after almost 30 years in public life, I feel that we need, at this stage in our development, four prison systems.  We need a special unit for subversives, a training and rehabilitation unit for first offenders, a special rehabilitation and treatment unit for those people on drug-related sentences and very importantly, we need a tough, corrective institution for the punishment of habitual <Col N="896" /> offenders and people sentenced for serious and brutal crimes.  The entire prison system is constantly under review. I hope that the new Minister for Justice will ensure that adequate resources will be allocated to the prison service to give the prison officers a chance of carrying out their duties with some degree of safety.</P>
    <P>As far as the prison in Portlaoise is concerned, I ask that immediate steps be taken to provide adequate and new steel doors on that prison because obviously the old timber ones are not serving the purpose for which they were put in.  I would ask the people either in the Department or the Board of Works that the next time they are measuring them that they would be careful and not have the new constructed doors lying on some scrap heap.  It is a matter of urgency.  This should be dealt with if the prison officers are to get the support they need in the performance of their tasks.</P>
    <P>On the recommendations of the report I should like to quote one paragraph on page 185 dealing with the Garda Síochána.  I thoroughly agree with it.</P>
    <P>In all of this, the gardaí can draw on a tradition of public good will.  It is, however, a non-replaceable resource. Once expended, it cannot be easily recreated.  Maintaining that good will and good name should be a constant consideration.  Its continued existence is a prerequisite for successful implementation of schemes like community policing and for the continuation of the co-operation from the public at large on which both reports of crime and detection of crime depend.</P>
    <P>This is extremely important.  I note in recent times that there has been a very clear change of policy on the part of the Garda, certainly in the midlands.  They no longer appear to appreciate the co-operation of the public.  In the town of Portlaoise, housewives and members of the public going about their day's chores have the feeling that they are being subject to police harassment.  This carrying out the letter of the law by having 150 gardaí on the street and having people <Col N="897" /> stopped two and three times going up and down to school with their children in the mornings is unacceptable.  I believe that there is a need for a change of policy there.  I would ask the new Minister to clarify for the ordinary members of the public the kind of society in which we want to live.  We, as free people, are entitled to feel that the people paid by the taxpayers are our friends and our neighbours and we are entitled to have their co-operation and respect.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of making those two small points.  I regret that I have not been able to avail of the time to fill in my sentiments more fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on behalf of Senator Belton and myself, in whose names this motion stands before the House, to thank the ten Members who today and on the previous occasion have contributed to this debate.  The NESC report No. 77 is an extremely important report.  As I said at the outset it is a pity that the report is written in language that makes it difficult to read and its contents difficult to assimilate.  That having been said it is quite clear that the central issues have been identified by the speakers who contributed to this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald summed it up very well when he quoted from the Constitution of the NESC which is specified on page 3 of the report.  He referred to the efficient development of the national economy and the role which the criminal justice system plays in that.  One of the points that came out in this debate on an ongoing basis is that the various arms of the State which are concerned with the criminal justice system have failed to allow themselves to be used as an arm of the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the point made by speaker after speaker in the course of this debate that the statistics which enable us to gauge the level of crime, the performance of the courts and, more importantly, the crime detection abilities and capacity of the Garda, are absolutely unsatisfactory. I referred to this matter in my opening speech.  Senator O'Leary referred to <Col N="898" /> it.  Senator Ryan also referred to it specifically in relation to the prison system, as did Senator Michael Higgins.  I ask the Minister of State to communicate with the Minister for Justice and the Government in this regard.  The Minister for Justice in his response certainly indicated that steps were being taken in this regard. I regard the steps he specified as being inadequate.  The entire basis upon which statistical data are being made available, particularly by the Garda, in relation to crime detection and the apprehension of offenders is unsatisfactory.  I do not think that the annual returns submitted by the Garda Commissioner are in any way satisfactory.  They have been criticised by many people for differing reasons and I would like to see some change there.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith in his comments referred to the criminal justice system and its operation.  I quote from column 478 of the Official Report of 12 February:</P>
    <P>It is no harm to say that it is an archaic, slow and sluggish system.  This is borne out by the NESC report.  It is not alive to the changing trends in society.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with him.  One of the problems &mdash; and I say this as a practising lawyer &mdash; is that we must make the system relevant to the needs of the 1980s.  That is something which we have totally failed to do.  The Minister in his response made reference to one aspect of that when he said that he would see that funds would be made available for making the physical appearance of courts more satisfactory. He has obviously got a responsibility for certain courtrooms, but the sooner the 1935 Act is looked at and that this unreasonable burden is taken off the shoulders of local authorities the better, and that those who have to face the criminal justice system do so in surroundings which are reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech referred to the increase in the number of gardaí to 11,400.  He made reference, in particular, to something which I was not impressed by, and that was the fact that some gardaí are now holding &ldquo;police clinics&rdquo;. It is a ridiculous suggestion that <Col N="899" /> gardaí are holding &ldquo;police clinics&rdquo; when in the same paragraph of his speech the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities report that while the majority of members of the chief superintendent, superintendent and inspectors ranks assigned to areas outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area reside with their families in their districts or in adjoining districts...</P>
    <P>If the members of the Garda at all ranks were living in their areas there would be no need to hold &ldquo;Garda clinics&rdquo;.  The sooner we get away from this stupid ridiculous concept the better.  I challenge the Garda authorites here in the Seanad tonight as to the accuracy of their figures. I am not in any way suggesting that the Minister said anything improper tonight, but I do not believe that the figures furnished to him by the Garda authorities are correct in so far as the senior ranks are concerned.  I am sorry that so much of my reply in limited time must be taken up on this point.  I would like to challenge the Garda Commissioner to furnish exact statistics and details as to where every chief superintendent, every superintendent and every inspector lives.  On a previous occasion in this House I gave details of a situation in the Mayo district where five out of the seven officers lived outside their areas.  My experience would tell me that most senior Garda officers are driving from long distance into the areas that they serve.  If the members of the force lived in their areas there would be no need for clinics.  They would be holding clinics on an ongoing 24-hour basis and giving that kind of police service that people require.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly referred to the question of the rising crime rate.  I agree with him.  There is a problem in rural areas. Senator Higgins laid emphasis on the statistics problem.  That, of course, is a major problem.  Senator Fitzsimoms made reference to the question of urbanisation and the problem it creates for crime.  I do not altogether agree with Senator Fitzsimons.  I agree that the <Col N="900" /> changing face of our cities and the changing social structure of our cities is certainly making it more difficult to police in the traditional fashion.  A different form of policing is required in our cities. One would have to balance that against the increased crime rate in urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robb made a very interesting comment when he raised a question which was raised by earlier speakers as to the role of prison in our society.  Is it to be merely a punishment, or is to have a rehabilitative role?  The prison service must have a rehabilitative role.  I agree with the points made by Senator McDonald when he said that we must more clearly define the different types of prisons that we have.  There must obviously be a prison for the subversive but there must also be a different prison for the person who can be absolutely and totally rehabilitated.</P>
      <P>I have tried to cover in the time available to me the points which have been raised in the course of this debate.  I thank the various speakers who have contributed to the debate, and in particular the new Minister for Justice for his speech.  I hope that the issues that have been raised will be addressed by the Minister and by his Department during the remaining years of this Ministry.  If these issues are addressed, then certainly the economy and social fabric of this country can benefit.  The policies which are currently being adopted in relation to our criminal courts are holding policies. Nothing has been done in relation to the organisation or the administration of our criminal courts since the Courts Act, 1924.  The policy in relation to our prisons is merely a holding operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very discreet in speaking about the Whitaker report.  I compliment him for his diplomacy and discretion in so far as he referred to it.  I ask the Minister &mdash; and he has given that commitment &mdash; to examine very carefully the contents of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Finally, in relation to the question of the Garda Síochána, I have made one specific comment in relation to that, but the whole operation of the force needs to be addressed in a more meaningful way than it has been done at the moment.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Carlow Hospital Proposed Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch díot go bhfuil an seans seo agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo agus tá mé buíoch den Aire freisin go bhfuil sé anseo chun éisteacht liom.  At the outset I want to make it quite clear, lest my words might go astray, that I am opposing completely the closure of St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow.  I do so, not just on sentimental grounds, but because of the facts that I will produce as I go on with my speech.  There is an idea abroad and I saw it in the papers that some of the shock that was talked about when the announcement was made was hyped up and that it was artificially created.  Coming from Carlow I know exactly the genuine shock that was felt. It was not just organised by political groups; it may have been helped perhaps, but it was quite genuine.  I was at a meeting within 24 hours of the announcement and I saw one of patients who was not put up to anything reacting in a way that was quite genuine.  I regard Carlow as a special case, not again because of sentiment, but simply and solely because it was the one hospital that was not earmarked. The other hospitals were told four or five years ago that they were being replaced or being amalgamated.  Some that were closed had alternative arrangements in accommodation.  Carlow has not got that.  We are being pushed too quickly too soon.  It is not possible to put the cart before the horse and make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that community-based care has been discussed but it is not ready in Carlow.  This is the big problem.  If it was ready there would not be a problem. While I cannot speak officially for the staff I know from speaking to them that <Col N="902" /> they were all geared towards community-based care and they are quite willing to put it into practice.  Carlow has a special case.  If we look at the staff-patient ratio in Carlow it is the best in the country and I have been told it is the best in Western Europe.  That figure will probably be disputed but that is the figure that has been given to us.  The staff itself has been integrated years ago.  Long before integrated staff became a bone of contention in many hospitals, Carlow was using integrated staff in the wards.</P>
    <P>The reference to these walled-up buildings being an anachronism does not apply to Carlow either.  The walls were gone in Carlow long before it was thought to remove them in many other hospitals. It has been a community hospital for years.  It may not be community-based in the sense that the patients were still in the hospital but the community were in there; I played football there 25 years ago and so did many other better footballers. It was a short cut for people for many places.  The patients were being allowed to mix; the walls were down and there were beautiful gardens.  The whole scene was one of modernisation.  The staff cannot be faulted for the fact that community-based care had not come into action.  From a cost point of view the hospital must be giving great value.  The maintenance staff who look after St. Dympna's Hospital also look after our district hospital, the maternity hospital and the district hospital in Bagnalstown. That is fair value for money from one maintenance staff.  The kitchen staff provide meals for all of those except the district in Bagnalstown and they also provide 100 meals a day for St. Laserian's Special School for the Mentally Handicapped.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about planning for the future and community-based care so that these people should not be in hospital but should be out as much as possible in the community, either with their own people or in hostels and flats.  Carlow has started that; they have their hostel across the road from the main hospital and they bought a house last summer.  That is still there.  They have not the wherewithal to <Col N="903" /> put it into action.  They have been setting up a pre-hostelling course to train the patients who would have to go out into ordinary life again.  I was surprised to find that you would have to train people to plug in kettles &mdash; simple jobs like that &mdash; people who have been in hospitals and unable to cope.  The preparation of the patients is a very slow process; it takes a lot of time and it needs a lot of care.  If people are pushed out into the community after being in hospital they do not fit in.  A psychiatrist in another area told me that it took three attempts by one patient to settle down in the community.  He went to live in a house with a few more; he came back into the hospital.  He tried it a second time and he failed; he came back into the hospital.  The third time he managed to settle down.  Even patients who are willing to take part in community-based care are often not able for it when it is available.  They are used to being hospitalised and they have a relationship there with the staff.</P>
    <P>The patients have to be cared for and trained.  The staff have to be trained also; many of them are used to working in hospitals for a long number of years; they are used to the routine of wards.  They have to be updated in training to get them used to the whole question of managing in the community.  When we talk about community-based care we must also talk about the community.  If the community are inundated with people that appear to be dumped out without any preparation we can have more trouble.  The Minister will know this from what psychiatrists have said.  They have given examples of other countries where all kinds of trouble arose simply because the transition scheme was rushed.  For that reason alone it is not possible to close Carlow hospital as it stands now.  The people are not geared to come out unless we throw them out into the community and say; &ldquo;There you are sink or swim; there is nothing wrong with you&rdquo;.  That cannot be done.</P>
    <P>To provide all the back-up services for community-based care there is money needed.  I am well aware of the cost of the medical services.  I am a member of <Col N="904" /> the health board.  We had a meeting last Monday and there was a cut of £6½ million. I have to admit publicly I was not able to contribute much even though I had the escape that I am on the community care section of the health board and that was the one section where we were asked not to cut back, if at all possible because of the demands of that service.</P>
    <P>If the money is not provided by the health board perhaps, through the Minister, to set up a system nobody can go anywhere.  This is what I find difficult to understand, how we can just announce the closing down of a hospital and find that the staff are there.  I would be appalled if all it meant was that we were going to start transporting older patients, those who are institutionalised through no fault of their own; they are in the hospital for years.  There are 155 of them who are over 60 years of age and 108 of them over 65 years of age.  These are not people who will settle down too well in any other place that they do not regard as home. They do regard St. Dympna's as their home.  Again, speaking to an independent psychiatrist &mdash; in the sense that he had no connection with Carlow &mdash; I asked him what was the real position, how could one close St. Dympna's in a short space of time.  He said it was not possible.  He said there was probably 80 patients who could be lined up for community-based training to go out into the community.  If you were lucky 60 of them might succeed. There are 340 patients in Carlow.  That means one is left with 280 patients.  These are the older patients, the patients who are institutionalised, no matter what we feel about it.  If I had my way I would have every hospital closed, including general ones if that were possible.  But we cannot talk about that.  People have to be in hospitals and we cannot do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty in Carlow is causing problems for the patients and indeed for the staff, because the patients feel that they are going to be thrown around.  I certainly do not want to see an exodus from St. Dympna's Hospital to other hospitals in neighbouring counties or to see a fleet of ambulances or mini-buses <Col N="905" /> taking the old patients out of St. Dympna's.  I do not want that and I hope we will not come to that stage.  The older people there deserve to finish their lives in the surroundings they know.  I think it would be most unkind, ungenerous and inhuman on our part to decide that they are going to be told: &ldquo;We are taking you to Enniscorthy, Clonmel or St. Canice's in Kilkenny&rdquo;.  Maybe it can be done but certainly I am opposed to it.  I hope the Minister does not want to do it either.  I am appealing to him to make sure it does not happen.</P>
    <P>Everybody who had any connection with the mental hospital at all was geared towards a phasing down of St. Dympna's. Long before the announcement came we had asked about the effect that this community-based case would have on the hospital and we were told then that there would be a phasing out of St. Dympna's. Nobody objected to that.  That is part and parcel of the process of advancement.  We cannot oppose what is good for patients. The staff are not opposed to that.  They welcome the whole idea of modern methods and it would not affect them in the slightest because they would be dealing with the patients.  It would be dreadful to think that we would just simply, overnight, decide to tell these people to go, let them sink or swim.  I really do not want that.</P>
    <P>We have another bad position as well as regards the RMS.  What is going to happen about the filling of posts following this announcement.  Will it wear itself out by degrees because we have not got the staff?  In that process there will be no care there, and we will have an accusation then that the patients are not getting proper care in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I want to refer at this stage to the dreadful film that was made by RTE when they came down to do a feature on St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow.  I am sure it shocked people who did not know St. Dympna's.  I can assure you it shocked the people who do know St. Dympna's. The way St. Dympna's was depicted that time was a scandal.  I am quite sure it has influenced people who saw that film and concluded that it was a dreadful place.  I <Col N="906" /> do not blame people who saw the film and did not know St. Dympna's.  It was a completely unjust portrayal of St. Dympna's Hospital.  I hope that the Minister and his officials who have since met at least once with the South Eastern Health Board officials and discussed the future of the hospital, will continue these talks.  A lot more can be achieved in these talks than in much of the political posturing that goes on.</P>
    <P>I have to refer at this stage to Lanigan's ball in the Seanad this morning.  I put down this motion as soon as I knew about the closing of the hospital.  I was genuinely interested in the saving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly withdraw anything you wish to be withdrawn but I was told about Lanigan's Ball and that was why I quoted it.  I was not here, as you know.  It shows the absolute hypocrisy of some of the politicians who have been trying to cash in on these hospital closures. Coming from Carlow I have a genuine interest in the saving of St. Dympna's hospital.  I know the scene and I know some of the patients.  I also know some of the staff.  I think that we get nowhere when we start having outsiders &mdash; I mean people that are not from Carlow &mdash; who can cry crocodile tears and make a song and dance about the closing of a hospital simply because they want to make political mileage out of it.  They may grab the headlines but that is not for me.  I want to save the hospital and if anyone else was interested in saving Carlow hospital they could easily have asked me &mdash; this is always done &mdash; to share some of my time, but they wanted to attack me for raising this here and saving the Minister. <Col N="907" /> I am not saving the Minister: I am not attacking him.  I am hoping that he will have news for me that will be of benefit to Carlow and I regret very much that so many politicians have simply come and said the right thing, got the cheers and have gone away with absolutely nothing achieved.</P>
      <P>All this shouting and looking for notice and condemning Ministers and making scare headlines will not help Carlow hospital.  I want this hospital saved.  It deserves to be saved.  The staff deserve to be treated properly and the patients above all deserve to be able to relax and feel they are not going to be pushed around the countryside.  We have already had a maternity hospital closed in Kilkenny. Our district hospital is not a very big one.  We have very little medical care in Carlow.  Our mental hospital has set headlines years ago.  The patients will not suffer in the slightest if they are allowed to end their days there.  If modern treatment takes over and if all the hospitals &mdash; as I hope some day will happen &mdash; are closed because we do not need them then I will accept that, but only when there is no need for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator John Browne for raising the matter this evening.  I know that on a number of occasions he has endeavoured to do so in the Seanad, I want to elaborate on my decision to close the hospital.  I want to stress to Senator Browne that in doing so I was announcing a collective Government decision taken by myself and my colleagues in Government based, on the weight of opinion available to us, on the need for an urgent change of policy in relation to the provision of psychiatric services in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main impetus for this change came from the report referred to by the Senator &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; with which no doubt many Members of both Houses are now very familiar.  The expert group that drew up this report included four experienced officers of the Department of Health including the Department's <Col N="908" /> inspector of mental hospitals as well as a clinical director in child psychiatry, a professor of psychiatry, a chief psychiatrist and two other consultant psychiatrists, a chief nursing officer and a chief executive officer of a health board.  The main trust of their conclusions was, &ldquo;the psychiatric needs of the community must be met by a comprehensive and integrated service made up of a number of treatment components and largely located in the community&rdquo;.  The group also stated that &ldquo;in particular there must be a decided shift in the pattern of care from an institutional to a community setting with close links between psychiatry and other community services&rdquo;.  Finally the group called for the implementation of this programme in all parts of the country without delay.  It was in that framework that the closure of the hospital in Carlow was considered and must be considered in the future.  The reality is that unless large hospitals close a real change in community care just will not happen.</P>
    <P>St. Dympna's, which was established to provide services in the Carlow and south Kildare catchment area, is one of five psychiatric hospitals in the South Eastern Health Board area and, in addition, there are associated acute psychiatric units in Ardkeen and in Clonmel General Hospital.  Two-thirds of the population served by the Carlow hospital live in County Kildare.  The Eastern Health Board are responsible for services in this area and they will be making arrangements to provide such services.</P>
    <P>While everybody in Carlow has jumped to the defence of St. Dympna's hospital at this stage I think they are well aware that the hospital is a relatively old 19th century building.  It has not been a pioneer in recent years in the development of our psychiatric services.  The patient population which had dropped from 398 in 1965 to 318 in 1975 now stands at 340 in-patients.</P>
    <P>We are aware that there have been some adverse reports at health board level&mdash;outside of the references made by the Senator&mdash;and indeed adverse publicity for its services in recent years.  The <Col N="909" /> hospital has become overcrowded because it did have an excessively liberal admissions policy and it had a slow discharge policy.  These two were the norm. The prospects of facilities for patient comfort as a consequence were bleak and rehabilitation of patients was not adequate.  The call for action on those inadequacies has been somewhat minimal in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the closure of the hospital will lead to a far better psychiatric treatment model and indeed a lifestyle for most of the 340 patients accommodated there and that it will moreover permit of the provision of better services to those patients from the catchment area of the hospital who will require psychiatric services in the future. It will also facilitate the opening of the geriatric assessment unit at Ardkeen hospital in Waterford which is a much needed facility in the South Eastern Health Board area.  I want to assure Senator Browne that I am not neglecting the needs of the Carlow area because we are now providing over £4 million in capital funds for a new purpose-built 100-bed geriatric unit in Carlow to replace the existing substandard accommodation in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Carlow and that accommodation is now, as the Senator knows, being constructed.</P>
    <P>In St. Dympna's, as of last September, for the 340 patients there were four medical staff, 133 nursing and allied staff, four paramedical, 37 catering and housekeeping staff, 18 maintenance staff, 11 clerical and administrative, six other grades, a total of 213 staff plus 33 locums.  The budget last year was £3.7 million of which £2.8 million was pay.  The staff of the hospital will as far as possible be redeployed to positions in Carlow and in the general environs of Carlow in which they will be providing a service which in future will be more relevant to the real needs of psychiatric patients.  Those staffs will live, work and continue to generate their own employment and income in the area.  I have given those assurances in other debates because I have always ensured that the interests of the 58,000 people employed throughout the health services <Col N="910" /> are always taken fully into account when any necessary policy changes are made.</P>
    <P>I will come to the question of the patients. I can assure the Senator that in relation to any of the patients who are at the advanced psycho-geriatric stage I will take every possible care to ensure that those patients' interests are fully catered for.  I would be appalled at the prospect of any policy decision involving very elderly people&mdash;over 100 persons in the hospital are over the age of 65&mdash;which would adversely affect them.  I have given absolute assurances that that will not be so. On the other hand, I will not allow their plight to be exploited&mdash;not by Senator Browne, I can assure you&mdash;in terms of preventing essential changes which must take place.  It has to start somewhere.  We always talk about phasing in things in this country, about consulting at great length, about doing it over a period of years. Ministers come and Ministers go and nothing whatsoever happens.  In relation to psychiatric services in Ireland for the past 30 years nothing has happened and that is why I feel the start must be made somewhere, irrespective of the odium which is heaped on the Minister of the day who endeavours to bring about that change.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that the patients in the hospital have already been assessed by a consultant psychiatrist employed by the health board.  Seventy of the patients already are deemed to have a potential for rehabilitation to the community.  It is interesting to note that I was the first person to bring this to the attention of the population in a public sense.  I wonder if I had not made that point would anything ever have happened. The answer probably is &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; because with over 100 patients in the hospital well over the age of 65 I think admissions would still have been kept up to keep up the patient population of the hospital.  That is not psychiatric treatment; that is something that is totally intolerable in any health service.</P>
    <P>Eighty-eight of the patients are mentally handicapped in that institution.  They should never have been there in the first instance.  I am asking the co-operation of <Col N="911" /> the health board to get them out, to take them out in the best interest of persons who are mentally handicapped and who should not be with those who have serious psychiatric disorders.  Nobody should be in a psychiatric hospital unless suffering from a serious psychiatric disorder. People should not be in psychiatric hospitals for social reasons, I submit that that is endemic within the system and I feel very strongly about it.  Therefore, if one takes the two categories I have mentioned, namely those who are suitable for rehabilitation and those who are mentally handicapped that is half its population. That gives an indication of the potential that there is for transferring patients to the community.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that work is now being done, such as the building up of the acute psychiatric unit in Naas hospital.  We have given the go ahead for the construction of this unit which will cater for the Carlow catchment area. That is being provided without delay. I already announced it within the past fortnight.  The capital moneys required to enable this to be done will be available forthwith.  Equally I want to build up &mdash; and I have not the slightest doubt that we will have the full co-operation of Senator Browne and his colleagues on the health board &mdash; the day care facilities in the Carlow area, the provision of residences for persons in the Carlow area who are capable of living reasonably normal lives in the community, out of the hospital, and for the provision of supervised hostels in the area.  Then we will have the transfer of mentally handicapped persons <Col N="912" /> into the mental handicap services.  We are going ahead and doing all that rapidly.  The health board has substantial capital moneys which it is showing an extraordinary reluctance to release in some respects.  I am sure the Senator will not ask me to elaborate on that.  I am quite sure that those capital moneys can equally be put to the benefit of the patients concerned but if there is any great trauma in that regard the capital moneys from my Department will be readily made available jointly with the board. Furthermore, an assistant secretary from my Department will be in Carlow next week to further advance the situation to discuss the situation further and to advance it.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Senator that I fully appreciate his concern and if my actions have concentrated minds I think it is because in this country such concentration of minds never occurs.  We fudge, we fluff, we postpone, we defer any kind of decision which affects anybody and in the end the quality of life in our country, the quality of our health services and the care of those who have nobody to speak for them other than the politicians of the day suffer quite dramatically. Accordingly, I appreciate the raising of the issue by the Senator and I assure him that no patients or staff will suffer in this necessary transition to a far better psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 February 1986.</P>
