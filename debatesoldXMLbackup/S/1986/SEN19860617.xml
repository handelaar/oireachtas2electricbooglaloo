      <P>It is proposed to order for today Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in that order.  My understanding is that Senators are anxious that as much business as possible be covered in the next few weeks.  Accordingly, the suggestion is that we should sit, if necessary, until 10 p.m. but that no new item of business be taken later than 8 p.m.  It is proposed to rise from 5.30 to 6.30 p.m.  Tomorrow it is proposed to order Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9.  This means that the Air Pollution Bill, which was presented to this House as long ago as last February, will be taken tomorrow afternoon.</P>

      <P>The only thing that worries me is that the Leader has said that no new business will be taken after 8 p.m. If we decide now to sit until 10 p.m. we should sit until 10 p.m., and if we are finished item No. 4 at 8 p.m. we should go on to item No. 5 and get some of it done.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that suggestion.  The only reason I suggested that there be no new business was in case Senators felt that to start for an hour or so is to break up the Second Stage debate unduly.  But if it is the wish <Col N="708" /> of the House to sit until 10 o'clock I am prepared to accept that suggestion.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment which is purely technical, is to provide a definition in section 2 of this Bill, of the Dublin Bus Company.  Senators will recall the discussion on this that took place on Committee Stage.  The need for this amendment arises because of the proposed amendment to section 7 which will empower the Minister, by order, to direct that the name of any of the subsidiary companies be changed to such name as he specifies in the order.  The amendment is essential in order to facilitate changing the name of the company after the enactment of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>We were going to separate Dublin Bus.  That is where the anomaly arose.  We had this crude and criminal name, in my opinion, called simply Dublin Bus.  It lacked any sort of imagination. If we were changing it to the modern 1986, if that is what you call it, surely we could have come across something better than Dublin Bus.  To call it Dublin Bus <Col N="710" /> Company makes even the sublime ridiculous. There was a very serious lack of consideration in what went on here in the Seanad last week.  We more or less all agreed on the suggestion that what we were talking about was a Dublin city transport service.  I thought we would base the name on that.  We could have at least called it Dublin City Transport.  I made that suggestion last week.  Senator Michael Higgins did the Irish interpretation and when it was translated from Irish back into English, the whole thing sounded very silly.  From what I could gather at the time, what we wanted was to bring in physically the word &ldquo;transport&rdquo;. We had a big debate here last week about omnibuses.  People are confused.  I thought we left with the impression on Wednesday night that Dublin city transport services was the basis on which we would class the name.  Now we have the Dublin Bus Company.</P>
      <P>The amendment, earlier on, suggested that the Minister may by order direct that the name of the company be changed to such name as he specifies in the order and the company shall comply with the direction.  Section 23 of the Companies Act, 1963, shall apply to a change of name under the subsection.  Right throughout the whole of the amendments, there is no suggestion from the Minister as to what the name should be. I refrained from putting in an amendment on a technicality, as I was speaking in the initial stages.  I was the first person who commented on this terrible name that was being put on the three companies.  I said it lacked thought and any sort of imagination.  I still believe so.  There is no point in us here going through a whole series of amendments when the meat of what we are talking about is not written down, and that is the actual name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week because of the manner in which the amendments were put down, if we had purposely changed the name, it would have caused a sequence of anomalies in the Bill itself and that would be the wrong time to change it.  I left here in the hope that the Minister had not got the bright idea that we were moving towards an updating of the name.  I <Col N="711" /> thought we were basing the name on the fact that we were talking about transport.</P>
    <P>I argued last week that DART and Dublin city buses should be under one umbrella.  I have not changed my mind and there has been no argument to suggest to me that we should change that position in any way.  The Minister did not really make the case that I was wrong.  I still firmly believe that it would have been good for all companies &mdash; now that we are having three of them &mdash; if we had used that idea to sharpen up the efficiency of the rail lines.  I was arguing that people would have to be on time and that time would mean what it said, and not this nonsensical procedure in CIE where one service could be three quarters of an hour late, or in places, up to half a day late.  I felt that this as an ideal opportunity to bring DART into Dublin city bus services and to amalgamate the two into Dublin city transport services.  Even the name Dublin City Transport Services would be more appropriate.  It would at least draw attention to the services we were seeking and getting.  I do not know what pressures were on the Minister.  I know what pressures were on him last week.  I do not know what pressures came on him over the weekend and whether they are new ones.  The whole Bill lacks dash, daring and courage.</P>

      <P>I give my reasons for Senator McDonald to understand.  I am not saying DART is a bad thing.  What I am saying is that DART is a terrible name.  If Senator McDonald thinks DART is a good name he can stand up here when I am finished when perhaps he will please explain to me what is nice, attractive or good about it.  I thought we agreed last week that all the systems would be brought in, as it were, under the one umbrella.  I said that perhaps the <Col N="712" /> Minister was losing his courage.  However, he is allowing himself an opportunity in this amendment but he is not saying what the kernel of all this is.  What are we doing?  Are we going to allow somebody to come up with a fancy name without this House having a say in the matter?  We are giving the authority to the Minister to call it what he likes.  I was suggesting that this House should have an opportunity to name it.  At least we would be responsible for one good part of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not.  One section of the Government took it rather seriously and spent a long time harassing the Minister to change his mind on many issues which is very evident, but that is not what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>We now come to the old titles &mdash; Irish Bus and Bus Éireann.  &ldquo;Irish Bus&rdquo;&mdash; just stand back and listen to it.  Is that not enough?  Does it not express it?  We have argued that it is not right.  What has the Minister done since to make that right? We have suggested for the Dublin area, Dublin City Transport Services, DCTS. You can abbreviate it.  At least it shows it is a transport service.  That did not happen.  &ldquo;Irish Bus&rdquo;&mdash; I will leave that as it is because it is a void in itself.  Any other name would have to be more attractive than that.  If you tried to find the worst possible name that would be it. &ldquo;Irish Rail&rdquo; is not quite as bad.  When you listen to Senator Michael Higgins explaining what &ldquo;Iarnrod&rdquo; means, you understand how inappropriate it is.  The meaning of &ldquo;Iarnrod&rdquo; shows how silly the name is.  Its translation into &ldquo;Irish Rail&rdquo; is not exactly correct.  Iarnrod Éireann is one thing; Irish Rail is something else.  It is not a clear definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister will <Col N="713" /> say.  I will not be able to say anything about it after he has spoken, that is, if he says anything.  I would like the Minister to enumerate to us, one, two, three of four names they have been thinking about, that is, if they have been thinking in the last week.  We could then have an idea of the intention at the back of this amendment.  We must have impressed them into believing that those silly names were certainly not acceptable to anybody from any political persuasion.  That is probably a move forward.  I was glad that I initiated it, but I would be more delighted if I could have an idea of the intended names of the new companies from the Minister specifically.  I would like to know the names that he intends calling those three companies.  That would be deeply appreciated.</P>
    <P>I want to ask another question before I finish.  Now that we are dealing with the amendments, I have a right to speak to the amendment only.  When the amendments are passed or if they fall, or are agreed or disagreed, I have a right to speak again at this stage of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to deal with the matter now.  All of us in the House during the debate, both on Second Stage and Committee Stage, expressed <Col N="714" /> our concern at the names given to the company.  They are not necessarily the most attractive names.  The same view was expressed by the Minister himself in his Second Stage speech.  It seems that the amendment is reasonable in the circumstances. Obviously, the Minister has not been in a position, since the Committee Stage debate, to come in here with new names which he might suggest by way of amendment.  By virtue of his amendment No. 5 it is clear that he has set some process in train to bring forward names that would be more appropriate than the ones contained in the Bill originally. When the Minister has gone through this process &mdash; with the assistance, I presume, of his officials and advertising agencies or whatever other group would be appropriate &mdash; of determining suitable names given the nature of the comnpanies concerned.  I would be happy in the circumstances &mdash; though it would have been better as a matter of procedure &mdash; if we had had more attractive names in the Bill from the beginning &mdash; to give the Minister this authority to devise appropriate names in due course and, hopefully, before too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing what can be said around a suggestion of names.  Senator O'Mahony has put it in context.  We all expressed dissatisfaction with the names that were suggested in the original Bill, simply because they have incorrect Gaelic interpretations or because they might misrepresent what the board or subsidiary board might have in mind. Certainly, the bringing into law of the Dublin Transport Authority, which we passed through this House recently, will give an overview into what would happen in the Dublin city and Dublin county area in the Dublin Transport Authority legislation, which will have representatives from the local authority, Córas Iompair Éireann and other people.  The worry that Senator Killilea has will be contained within the particular statutory authority which we will give to that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get back to the names.  People with whom I have had discussions &mdash; and we have had discussions with many <Col N="715" /> people &mdash; have never suggested that Dublin Bus should be called Dublin City Transport Services.  That is a misnomer, because it involves everything.  It involves DART, rail, bus or anything else.  Dublin Bus, although we do not like the name, refers to bus services within the city and possibly county.  It was not acceptable to have a global name such as Senator Killilea has suggested, Dublin City Transport Services.  That was not acceptable to the people we spoke to.  When Senator Killilea passed the comments last week people expressed reservations about the terminology.  We began to look at what the Senator had in mind.  We appreciated what he had in mind but that name could create problems.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we read the wording of amendment No. 5.  It is:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order direct that the name of a company be changed to such name as he specifies in the order and the company shall comply with the direction.  Section 23 of the Companies Act, 1963 shall apply to a change of name under this subsection.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister made an order would mean that that order would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; in the Library.  We, as Members, will have an opportunity as it has to be there for a statutory period, of having an input, in case somebody should suggest a name for the Dublin bus services for which a subsidiary company will have a responsibility. We want to ensure that it is what it is intended to be.  British Rail get away with calling their rail British Rail but nobody expects the name to be Irish Rail. We can use some imagination.  I do not totally agree that DART is not a good name.  It signifies precision, speed and efficiency.  It gets to where it is intended to go as quickly as possible.  It is an abbreviation of the full name.  Any organisation should be easily identifiable in the abbreviation of its name.  We come up with the most extraordinary names which immediately identify in people's minds what is meant by the letters, whether it is HOPE, <Col N="716" /> CHERISH, ALONE or DART.  It is a good name and it is an excellent service I just give these titles as examples of what the imagination of professional people can do with names.</P>
    <P>This amendment takes out these three names as being obligatory and gives the Minister the power to specify other names.  The Minister is doing that as a result of reservations that we all expressed here on the Second and Committee Stages of the Bill.  It will be done by order which will give us an opportunity to have an input if we are not satisfied that it expresses what we understand is the company's role in the delivery of the service, whether it is Irish Rail, Irish Bus or Dublin Bus.  Whatever way the names are compiled they will have to indicate the service that people anticipate that particular subsidiary should give.  For that reason it is a good idea to put an amendment in to give the Minister certain powers.  We also have a certain role afterwards. With the Dublin Transport Authority we can overcome the problem of having an integrated Dublin transport service, which can be done by way of the statutory authority.  The naming of the company is something that could be a matter for another day's discussion if the ministerial order does not meet with our approval.  I welcome the fact that at least we are taking out these three names as being obligatory, and giving the Minister some discretion with our approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>What this amendment does is leave open the possibility of change provided that a better name is proposed.  None of the Senators nor the Minister was happy with the existing names.  There is no point in changing a name until a better name is found.  In other words, we are then advancing. What we have now is functional, but is not attractive in any way.  It is not attractive from the point of view of the company who will be using the name.  They, in turn, will to an extent be involved in advertising.  Very often one will find that an old established company, or a political party maybe, do not have a suitable name for advertising.  I was involved in this <Col N="717" /> aspect myself.  It was said that if we had picked a different type of name we could do all sorts of things with advertising. Here now we have the option of picking the appropriate name so that it will fit the advertiser later on.  That should be a consideration.</P>
      <P>Getting the right name is exceedingly difficult.  Out there somewhere there is an absolutely perfect name but getting it requires a flash of inspiration.  Anyone might come forward with the name, not necessarily a person involved in reading in detail about it: it could come from anywhere.  I remember from my own experience in RTE &mdash; where the name of a programme is very important &mdash; that it was much easier to get the concept of a programme and what a programme should be about than to get the appropriate name.  I am not talking about once-off programme but a programme which would be on the schedule on a regular basis.  Any person can get the appropriate name.  Very often competition is what leads to a particularly suitable name. Some of the major companies in the launching of products of one sort or another specialise in devising invitations by way of competition for names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure there are great names available.  No name has been rejected. Any put forward by Senators on the previous occasion have not been rejected as such; it is a question of examining the whole lot and finding out what is the best possible name.  I do not suppose the Seanad will get involved in running a competition to get the perfect name for this.  It will be a question for the Department.  I do not know that civil servants would be the most qualified people in the world to get the best and most appropriate name.  The matter will be examined in all ways that might lead to a solution with the possibility, if that were thought useful, of inviting in professional advice from people who are good at this type of thing.  It is very important that it should be got right.  What we have done here is to leave open the possibility <Col N="718" /> of a change if and when a better name comes along.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of the problem was mentioned earlier by Senator Ferris &mdash; that if and when there is a change it will have to come before the House by way of order, so there cannot be, as Senator Killilea felt, a situation where it would be slipped in or imposed without the authority of the House.  The import of this amendment is that it will come before the House.  I would have preferred, and I am sure everybody else would have preferred if a really suitable name had emerged from the contributions of the Senators or from the general discussion that has taken place but it has not emerged so far.  I do not think the best approach is to rush it during this debate.  Seeing that it has to come before the House again by way of order, it is best in this case to leave it and see will the perfect title emerge.  I am confident that it will.</P>

      <P>the purpose of this amendment is to provide for a minor drafting change.  Section 6 of the Companies Act, 1963, was amended in the First Schedule to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, by the substitution of a new subsection, subsection (1).  It is paragraph (3) of the subsection so inserted which now provides for the inclusion of &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in the title of the company other than a public limited company.</P>

We are part of the Oireachtas and no legislation can be passed or anything else done without our approval.  It is appropriate that the words &ldquo;each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; be included so that everybody will know that we have an input both into legislation and into anything else arising out of it.  There are some Oireachtas Committees which do not include Senators like the Oireachtas Committee on vandalism and law and order.  I think Senators would make an excellent contribution on that committee.  I do not see why they should have been overlooked.

      <P>In page 6, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) The Board and the companies shall have due regard to the Board's social role and the need to maintain public transport services integrated to the maximum extent posible within the financial resources available to them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage and at that point I provided as much information as I could about the thinking behind it.  Basically, it is that my colleagues and I in the Labour Party were concerned that the provisions in section 8 of the Bill which were concerned with the principal objects of the companies to be set up did seem to allow for quite a deal of competition between the three <Col N="722" /> subsidiary companies and in particular between the two companies, Irish Rail and Irish Bus.  We were concerned to see to it as far as possible that the Bill placed on the board and the companies an obligation to provide an integrated public transport service which in our view offered the best opportunity for a comprehensive system of transport throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition we wanted to build specifically into this Bill the idea that the board does have a social function in providing transport.  This, of course, is already recognised in the subvention given to the board annually.  What we are attempting to do here is to build in an additional safeguard to ensure that the companies do not compete against each other either to the detriment of themselves or to the detriment of the social role which the board has in providing transport or to the detriment of the idea of public transport as an integrated system.  That is what this amendment does.</P>
    <P>The Minister during the course of the Commitee Stage debate when we first discussed it said that he would give consideration to it.  I hope that it will now be possible for the Minister to agree that this amendment is worth while and adds something to the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 12 is adding a new section between lines five and six. It should be read in the context of the whole of section 8.  As Senator Flor O'Mahony has said, the Minister and the Department conceded on the last occasion that the addition of this final safeguard we felt necessary was worthy of consideration to ensure that all the services throughout the country worked in co-ordination with each other and complemented each other.  In addition, we would also be considering the social content of the services provided by any board like Córas Iompair Éireann because if decisions are made only on economic grounds then many of the services in rural Ireland with which all of us, particularly Senator Killilea, are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Senator Killilea was worried about rural Ireland.  I am worried about it because I come from rural Ireland.  There is a social need in rural Ireland and we have to ensure by way of legislation that the board of CIE have regard to it.  It is not wrong to request in legislation that a board who are already fulfilling a social need will continue to do so in spite of the lack of economic justification for it.  It is imperative that it is provided and we are asking that this be done within the financial resources available to them.  This Government have, for the first time, determined what they consider to be the appropriate fraction of the allocation on subvention to Córas Iompair Éireann for the social content of services and that is now understood to be one-third of the total State subvention.</P>
      <P>We are asking that it should be included in this legislation that the board and the companies should have due regard to the board's social role and the need to maintain public transport services integrated to the maximum extent possible within the financial resources available.  Naturally, Córas Iompair Éireann, like everybody else depending on the State purse, cannot have all the finances available to them that we would wish them to have because there is a limit to the taxation process particularly in the PAYE sector but in the provision of the social service which Córas Iompair Éireann provide we are anxious that the board would have regard to the social need. That is why we are asking that this additional section be inserted in the context of section 8.  The Minister, when he learned of our concern in this regard, was anxious to consider it and I hope that it will be included today on this Report Stage.</P>

I am satisfied, subject to what happens on the next amendment, that we have a very effective Bill and a Bill that is very much improved on the original draft. These improvements came about by way of discussion and deliberation between the Minister and the Labour Party and within the Seanad as a whole.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea's concern for the Labour Party is nothing compared to the concern which the workforce in CIE should have about the knowledge given to us in the Seanad last week that a Fianna Fáil Minister for Transport in 1982 proposed to the Cabinet that the CIE company be disestablished and dismantled. Had that happened or had there not been an election at that time which put that administration out of office there would not now be a CIE company to discuss because, apparently, it would have been dismantled on the basis of those recommendations which were taken hook, line and sinker by the Minister of the day, despite the proposals contained in the McKinsey report.</P>

The concern he expressed in relation to the Labour Party comes a bit too easily from somebody who, when this debate started on Second Stage, came down in favour of the Bill as originally drafted and who discovered the difficulties <Col N="727" /> with the Bill from the point of view of the workforce and service to the consumer only after members of the Labour Party made clear the deficiencies which existed in it.  I regret that Senator Killilea has chosen to cast his eye on the Labour Party and I feel it is only appropriate that I should cast my eye on his party in return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to provide for the appointment to each of the subsidiary boards of two worker directors to be chosen from among those elected to the parent board in accordance with the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  In the course of the debate on Committee Stage in this House the question of worker directors being required to accept appointments to the subsidiary companies was raised.  The Minister, having considered this matter further, came to the conclusion that freedom of action as regards acceptance or refusal of appointments to the boards of the subsidiary companies must be left to the worker directors elected to the board of CIE.  However, if a worker director decided not to accept appointment on the basis of the existing text of the section there could be a legal obstacle to the functioning of the company concerned.  In the circumstances the amendment, that is a new subsection (3), <Col N="728" /> is essential.  This provision does not dilute in any way the intended worker participation on the boards of the subsidiary companies. The additional element is essentially to provide for the case where one or both of the members of the board of CIE decided not to accept appointment to the subsidiary companies.  This does not in any way undermine the statutory constitution of the board.</P>

      <P>In page 6 subsection (2) (a), line 20, to delete &ldquo;5&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7&rdquo; which shall include two worker directors.</P>
      <P>It was abnormal for any Minister in any Government to allow such an error as not to include worker participation to occur in the first draft legislation.  I am glad that the Minister has admitted this and amended the section.  While he has not agreed with my figures &mdash; he has changed them to six rather than seven &mdash; he has instanced publicly the relationship necessary by at least putting two worker directors on the board.  I welcome those two sections on that count.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say to Senator Killilea that the reason the number of directors is six rather than seven as suggested by him is that the Labour Party had previously agreed with the Minister that first, there should be worker directors on the boards of the subsidiary companies and, second, that there should be two out of six rather than the two out of seven he suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making this point because I know that these things can be misconstrued subsequently.  The reason we have worker directors is that the Labour Party discussed the matter with the Minister and he agreed to it. Had Senator Killilea not cast a cold eye <Col N="729" /> on the Labour Party previously I certainly would not be continuing to cast a cold eye on what he is saying.</P>
      <P>I am most unhappy with amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  I only saw them at lunchtime today and I am afraid I cannot agree that in the event of worker directors from the main board for any reason not agreeing to go on the subsidiary board, the chairman of the company would have a right to appoint anybody at all, including people who are not members of the workforce, to take their places.  The purpose of the original discussions we had with the Minister was to see to it that workers, through the provisions of the 1977 Act, would be reresented on the subsidiary boards.  That is what we want and we cannot accept a situation in which in certain circumstances a worker director might not &mdash; though I cannot see why it would happen &mdash; agree to go on a subsidiary board, and a place reserved for him or her could be allocated to somebody from outside the company altogether.</P>
      <P>The principle which is important to us is that workers are represented on the board in the proportion of two out of six. While I cannot foresee any situation in which worker directors from the main board might not, following consultations between themselves and the chairman, agree to see to it that the positions on the subsidiary board were filled, I cannot at all see that this is the way to handle this problem should it ever arise.  If the Minister has a fear of this kind then a provision whereby the vacancy caused should be filled by direct elections within the company under the 1977 Act seems to be an appropriate way to deal with the matter in keeping with the spirit of that Act and the agreement we reached with the Minister previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this provision would give to the chairman powers which it is not intended he should have in relation to the two positions of worker directors on the boards of the subsidiary companies. That is not to cast any aspersions on the chairman as an individual but rather to make the point about the position <Col N="730" /> and the powers he would have.  It is because of that concern about perhaps giving to him powers which it is not intended he should have under the original amendment adopted on Committee Stage and also because the provision breaks with the spirit of the amendment as adopted on Committee Stage, that I cannot see that it is acceptable in the least.  I would urge the Minister to withdraw amendments Nos. 14 and 15 and leave section 11 (2) (a) as it emerged from Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister to consider that very strongly.  Should it ever happen that in any eventuality the worker directors could not agree among themselves as to how they would distribute themselves among the subsidiary boards, the problem can be dealt with in dialogue, consultation, discussion or in argument if necessary.  It could be dealt with in the normal process through which the worker directors relate to their membership of their unions and to the Congress of Trade Unions.  The matter should be left as it was.  If the Minister wishes to change it to cover the eventuality foreseen I would suggest that the only way it can be changed in keeping with the spirit of the 1977 Act would be to provide for filling any such vacancy that might arise through direct election within the company concerned.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the appointments to each of these subsidiary boards of two worker directors to be <Col N="731" /> chosen from among those elected to the parent company.  The absolute intention of this is to have the workers' representatives on the various companies.  There is no doubt but that that is the entire spirit and the actual text of it.  It is very difficult to see the eventuality arising where the worker directors from the parent company would be unwilling, for any reason, to serve on the board.  But the difficulty is that if they did, with the existing text of the section, there could be a legal obstacle to the functioning of the company concerned that would, of course, create major knock-on difficulties.</P>
      <P>Because of that, it was felt that this amendment was necessary.  The right of the worker director or any one else to serve on a board must be protected.  They cannot be forced to go on the board if they do not so desire.  It is very hard to see this difficulty arising.  I see the points made by Senator O'Mahony and I see what he is seeking to avoid.  I would accept that it is a very long shot but I suppose it is natural that there should be concern for long shots as well as for other things that might occur.  The Bill, which is only now passing through the Seanad, was initiated here.  As Senator O'Mahony said himself, he only saw the difficulties at lunchtime.  I did not know of these difficulties until much later &mdash; I have just heard of them &mdash; and I will certainly bring them to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is an example of what this House is all about.  It is something about which Senator Killilea is concerned. It is amazing now that Senator Killilea is on the same side as the Minister on this issue and Senator Flor O'Mahony and I are on another side simply because &mdash; I want to put it as clear as possible &mdash; on Committee Stage Senator Lanigan, in stating a viewpoint said he felt there was no need for the Chairman of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann to discuss or consult with anybody about who the worker director should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made the point that worker directors in particular, because they are very special and represent special interests, <Col N="732" /> would be people who should be consulted. It was arising out of Senator Lanigan's concern that in the process of consultation, particular members might refuse to serve on boards, that the Minister considered that possibility and that has now led to this unnecessary amendment by the Minister.  This arose because there was a question that, perhaps, somehow of the four worker directors elected to the main board &mdash; following through our argument about commonality between the two boards &mdash; the Chairman of CIE might not get two of them to serve on the subsidiary boards.  We feel that is a long shot and we are saying to the Minister that we consider it to be a long shot, most unlikely to happen.  But the Minister is trying to protect himself in the event of it happening.  I am suggesting to him that if he allows the section he refers to in the first part of the amendment, he is changing section 11 (2) (a) which reads at the moment:</P>
    <P>The number of directors (including the chairman) shall be not more than 6, two of whom shall be members of the Board appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977;</P>
    <P>For those of us in the Labour Party that is very fundamental because, first, it ensures worker participation on the subsidiary boards and, secondly, it ensures that the workers who are serving on the subsidiary boards would have been, in the first instance, appointed to the main board by the sections of the industry in which they work, by the members in the unions.  Therefore, they have a speciality and a brief from their electorate when they go to serve on the main board.  We feel that reflection should be continued down onto the subsidiary boards.  The issue of commonality is also important because we would feel that they could have a major input to make in the subsidiary boards on which they would work.  We are suggesting, as Senator Flor O'Mahony has suggested, that if that section is allowed to stand it will be obligatory on the chairman of the board of directors of Córas Iompair Éireann <Col N="733" /> that, in nominating the subsidiary boards, two of them shall be members elected under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  Amendment No. 15 states:</P>
    <P>The directors to be appointed to each company shall include two persons selected from the members of the Board appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, provided that such persons are willing to accept office.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;provided&rdquo; mean it is negative.  It means that in the long shot situation, which we feel would not arise, the chairman of the board of directors would have the power to fill the board with other people who would not be worker directors simply because he could say that the four worker directors who were elected refused to act on any of these subsidiary boards and that he then had the power, under this section, to fill the board with six members.  I am sorry if Senator Killilea did not see it in that light.  We are with him in that we want to ensure that there are worker directors on the subsidiary boards but we want to ensure that if, for some reason &mdash; unknown to us and unknown to the trade unions they represent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In our opinion all that could happen is that a vacancy would have arisen in the worker directors representation or that the worker directors, under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977 could be elected under the section, whereby their representation on the subsidiary board is required.  We are asking the Minister first, to leave the original section intact. We on this side of the House want two worker directors on the board.  If for some reason that does not come about, because they refuse to act, vacancies will occur in the normal process and will have to be filled by worker directors.  They could not be filled by anybody else.  That <Col N="734" /> is the problem with the second amendment suggested by the Minister to replace the first one.  If the Minister is not forthcoming on this matter I will require time to consider the full implications of what this is about between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Senator that we have performed fairly well on this legislation.  I am now asking the Minister not to actually put amendment No. 14 to the House.  If that remains in, there will be an obligation by legislation that, when these boards are set up, they will have to include two worker directors.  If the two worker directors, for some way out reason, are not available or refuse to act, or are put on a board in which their own brief would not be reflected and their own expertise would not be reflected, then a vacancy will be created and can not be filled by anybody else, by the Minister or by the Chairman of the board or anybody else.  They will be filled by the workers in the particular section of the industry which elected the worker directors initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the important point.  We feel that if, for some reason, the worker directors cannot act or accept office, they will have the right to renominate through the Worker Participation Enterprise Act, 1977, to elect their person back on to the board again.  That is the least we can expect in the spirit in which this Bill was <Col N="735" /> processed through this House, in the spirit in which the Minister met all our reservations, met us by way of amendments of his own, accepting amendments from us, the lengthy discussions we had with everybody.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy if at this eleventh hour with the Bill in its final stages, the Minister proceeded to pursue the withdrawal of the obligation of having two worker directors, even adding in section 15, which, I think, is unnecessary but as long as section 14 is there, that is the most important thing.  It is imperative that section 14, in the original, page 6 remain.  I am asking the Minister not to put that to the House because there will be disagreement about it.  He will understand why I am concerned.  I am concerned that there be two worker directors on the subsidiary boards.  If that is written into the legislation, nobody else can change it.  If the other situation arises in which they refuse to act, that challenge can be met through the process that we all accept that these worker directors will be elected by.  That will be the process.</P>
    <P>I realise that you cannot have a board that says that there will have to be two worker directors, if you have no worker director to act.  That means there will have to be an election to elect worker directors to ensure they take their place on the board to represent the interest of the workers.  You cannot have it any other way.  It is imperative that this section remain, because that will ensure that the legislation reflects our view and, indeed, the view of Senator Killilea, that there should be two worker directors on the subsidiary boards.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister not to move that amendment.  It is unnecessary in my opinion.  Once it is there, it is a definitive legislative direction to the board of directors and to the chairman of the board, who will be appointing the subsidiary boards in consultation with the Minister, that two of them at least will be worker directors.  There is only one process that I know to provide worker directors and that is through the State Enterprise Act, 1977, which gives the workers in an <Col N="736" /> industry the right to elect people to represent them on any of these boards. There will be four of them already elected to the main board.  We hope that it will never arise and I cannot see it arising and this suggestion that it might arise came from Senator Lanigan.  The Minister responded.  It certainly did not come from our side because our knowledge of the input of worker directors in Córas Iompair Éireann has been first class, second to none.  It has been beyond question. The input they have made has been of paramount importance to the board and the formulation of its policy.  I know quite well that the people who are on that main board will be available to act and we want to ensure that the legislation says that they must act.  They should be on it and they should be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make as genuine a contribution to this section as I can.  In my opinion if no worker directors were willing to act, the chairman of the board, in composing the board then would only have the power to nominate four and it would be a matter for the workers then to meet that challenge by <Col N="737" /> ensuring that they had, as required by law a worker director, to serve on the board and by carrying out the elections to fill that process.  There is no need of sections, which in themselves are contradictory, providing that the board shall include two people, provided they are willing to act.  That is the same as saying, if you do not act we will do without you. I do not want to do without worker directors on this board.  I want the legislation to reflect our view that they should be on it and if that section is left as it is, the worker directors will perform as we expect them to.  There will be no shilly shallying.  There will be no copping out but if, for some reason, a death or any unforeseen situation, for instance, if they were all directed by their trade union to get off the main board of CIE, the whole process is there to re-elect other people.</P>
      <P>That is what would happen here if we all abdicated our responsibility.  There would be an election in the morning and there would be people re-elected again. The same thing would happen here because workers will always ensure that their interests are represented on the board proper and on the subsidiary boards.  In view of my concern in this, I am asking the Minister not to move these amendments.  They are unnecessary. They would spoil the whole spirit of the Bill as we understand it.  I feel that there will be grave resentment from the workers that this amendment is written in to specify them only, because no other director on these boards has been singled out in this way.  Worker directors are very special people.  They have a special brief. They are the most democratic boards' directorships in the country because they are elected by the people they represent.</P>
      <P>It is very important that they would not be taken out of context.  The workers want to serve.  They have a process of electing people to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under amendment No. 15 the chairman of the board whoever he is &mdash; and I have the greatest respect for the present occupant of that post &mdash; if these people refuse to act, has the power to replace them with other people, who would not <Col N="738" /> be worker directors, simply because we have taken out the other section which says they shall be.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, because I am not permitted to speak again, I ask the Minister not to move his amendments. We consider them unnecessary.  We think they spoil the Bill.  We were not consulted over the weekend about this.  It came from a suggestion by Senator Lanigan. We do not agree with it.  I suggest that the Minister leave it out of the Bill and before it goes to the Dáil, he can have all the legal opinions about what situations might arise or otherwise.  From the point of view of the Seanad, we do not want those written in and we would prefer if they were not.  We are asking the Minister not to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not share all the apprehensions of my colleague, Senator Ferris.  In this Bill the Minister has been extremely forthcoming with very wide-ranging amendments.  I must say that from my own experience of worker directors, and it is confined to people working in Bord na Móna and the ESB in the midlands, they have made a great contribution to the semi-State organisation.  I can understand Senator Ferris's apprehension that these people, whoever would be elected, would not be prepared to sit and make a contribution.  That legislation which came in about ten years ago making provision for worker directors on the semi-State boards, has been a huge success and the contribution that these people have made in my experience has been extremely worthwhile.  I am sure that the view is shared by other directors on the board and by the industry in general. That is the only point.  I do not share the Senator's apprehension that these people might for some peculiar reason not wish to participate.  For that reason I think the proposal should stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a contribution in regard to this difficulty. I fully understand the concern expressed by Senators O'Mahony and Ferris and, indeed, concern shared by the House universally.  I do not think that even Senator Killilea is against the principle of worker directors on State boards such as we are discussing.  We are discussing, on the other hand, the unlikely eventuality in which worker directors on the main board might not wish or were not prepared to take part in the subsidiary board by way of being directors of a <Col N="742" /> subsidiary board.  I think everyone here shares the view that this is a most unlikely train of events to occur at any stage in the foreseeable future, through nothing is completely out of the possible line of fire, as one realises when one is long enough around in this world.  As unlikely as all of that is, there is the dilemma for the Minister, for the chairman and the organisation of the main CIE board and for the chairman of the subsidiaries concerned with CIE, that you cannot really have a board operating, over, perhaps, a period of months or for longer, when there is a difficulty in the appointment of a particular director in that somebody is not prepared to serve or there is no easily understood way that the mechanism for appointing a substitute to fulfil the role of worker director is not available or possible to be taken up when an occasion of that kind arises.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress this aspect.  It is a point that has not been made so far in the discussion of the amendment presented by the Minister, admittedly over the weekend.  The question is how you can have a board of such extraordinary importance to the running of the country, by way of being responsible for the whole rail service or for the entire provincial bus fleet or perhaps for the entire transport arrangements in the city of Dublin, if one-third of the directors to that particular subsidiary are unavailable, not prepared to participate for a period of months, perhaps, stretching into a longer period while some dispute or some disagreement continues?  We are talking about the most unusual and unlikely eventuality where something of that kind would occur, some very unlikely circumstances which would bring the problem right into the forefront and where a solution had to be found, where it was incumbent on the chairman, and the Minister to come up with some method of keeping the particular sector of the transport industry working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a dilemma there.  The Minister has a difficulty here this afternoon.  While the mechanism is being thought out to bring something in that will have the <Col N="743" /> effect of introducing in the other House, as this Bill is only being initiated here, some suitable amendment to this particular area that would not cause anything more than a temporary difficulty.  I hope that my colleagues here from the Labour Party will be prepared to go along with the Minister of State at this time.  There is a dilemma on both sides, not just a dilemma from the point of view of the Labour Party in seeing the possibility that worker directors would not for a period be members of a subsidiary board.  There is equally the dilemma facing this Goverment or any other Government who might be in office where the worker directors are not on the subsidiary board because of some internal difficulty and are not operating by way of not being&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has been exceptionally receptive to ideas as far as this Bill is concerned and has introduced several important amendments and changes arising out of discussion in this House.  That is the way it should be.  It is the example of the due process and perhaps a good example of the value of initiating a Bill in this House where some of the points detected by the Senators are now incorporated in the form of amendments adding to the Bill.  I wonder if the section which indicated that one particular aspect would only come back to the Dáil and not to both Houses of the Oireachtas would have been picked up.  Had it been introduced in the Dáil it would have been rather interesting to see what the process would have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> Several important amendments have been introduced.  What Senator Flor O'Mahony and Senator Michael Ferris have been talking about and what I have been talking about are two very unlikely eventualities.  One of them is that the particular members might not serve on the board and that the company, because of the legal obstacle, could not function properly and the other possibility is that the positions might be filled by people other than workers' representatives.  As I said earlier the absolute intention is &mdash; indeed everyone accepts that that is the spirit of the whole area in the Bill &mdash; that there would be workers' representatives and, of course, in the ordinary foreseeable circumstances there will be no difficulty about them serving.</P>
    <P>We are talking about very slight possibilities somewhere down along the line but in all of these cases I suppose those have to be taken into account.  If one considers our political field many of the things that actually happen are ones that we would not readily predict ourselves if we were forecasting; scenarios we would not attempt to draw.  The same thing could happen here.  The job of legislation is to have total protection, to copperfasten and not to be coming back again.  I believe a formula could be produced to meet both eventualities we are talking about, to cover the legal situation as far as the functioning of the company is concerned and to ensure that the workers' representatives have their places there, and that if they did not take their seats on the board, a system could be worked out to cover that as well.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators O'Mahony and Ferris to accept that I will go to the Minister now and acquaint him of their very deep feeling on this aspect.  I will point out to him the genuine difficulty they see and the necessity for some formula by which this can be covered and ask him to take these things into consideration before the Bill is introduced in the Dáil.  I have no doubt that it will be possible to get a suitable solution that will cover all the cases that have been very strongly argued by both Senators.  They do not see the likelihood of what they fear.  Neither do I but there <Col N="745" /> is the question of the legal obstacle to the functioning of the company and the chaos that might cause.  We cannot be sure of those things but I believe that a formula exists somewhere along the line which would meet both eventualities.  I ask the Senators to allow the matter to proceed as it is now on the basis that it can be considered between now and its introduction in the Dáil.  The Bill is only being initiated here and, as Senator Alexis FitzGerald said, it should be possible in the interim period to produce a formula that will meet the difficulties that have been expressed by the two Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he sees some significance in the case Senator Ferris and I have made and he is prepared to discuss with the Minister for Communications the possibility of a further amendment during the debate on the Bill in the Dáil.  I suggest to him at this stage, given his acceptance of the substance of what we are saying and while we obviously also see the problem the Minister is alluding to, that he would consider talking with the Minister about it.  Then, any amendment that would be required could be introduced in the Dáil rather than pursuing the two amendments here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just make one further point.  A problem like this could arise at any time with any board with worker directors.  If they decided to pull out of the board there would be a crisis.  It does not hapen in practice and, as we all said, it is not likely to happen here.  I suggest, in view of what the Minister has said about his willingness to consider a further amendment in this area in the Dáil, that he would withdraw the amendments before us today.  That would still give him the opportunity to consider a suitable amendment which would meet the cases both of us are making.  I urge very strongly on the Minister to withdraw the amendments today and to consider the situation prior to the debate on the Bill in the Dáil where any amendment that might be required could be made.  I have no doubt that when the Bill would come back to the Seanad it would be dealt with very expeditiously <Col N="746" /> indeed because we have had a long debate on it already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a lengthy discussion on this amendment.  There was agreement between the Minister and ourselves that this provision was necessary so that the Act would be legally operable and if something definitive is written into it it can be followed through in law.  The Minister felt that, on the suggestion of Senator Lanigan, in the event of worker directors refusing to act some clause would have to be included to ensure that the boards could function.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>The directors to be appointed to each company shall include two persons selected from the members of the board appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, provided that such persons are willing to accept office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain merit in that but we feel that the words are not correct.  The Minister, before the suspension of the House at my request, gave a commitment that he would look at the problems we raised on this section.  We feel there should be worker directors on the board <Col N="747" /> and that the legislation should state that. The Minister has given a commitment that; before this Bill is taken in the other House, this section which we are not happy with, will be re-examined with a view to taking into account the concern expressed by us and indeed accepted by the Minister in his generous response to it.</P>
    <P>I hope, before the Bill goes to the Dáil, that a suitable amendment will be put in to take into account our reservations. Our reason for suspending the House was because we were concerned that worker directors could be discriminated against if they refused to act.  The original Act ensures that on the election of members to the board, by law they are not required to act on the board.  This situation would not arise on the main board and we hope that the same application of the Act will take place in regard to subsidiary boards. In the parliamentary process we are expected to express those worries.  That is why we have asked the Minister to consider the problems we have raised and even consider dividing the new subsection. However, according to the procedure of the House on Report Stage, it is not easy for the Minister to act in that way.  It is not easy to suddenly come up with a formulation of words in 30 minutes which would meet all the concerns expresed by Senators on this side of the House. We had advice available to us.  I hope the House will forgive us for adopting this procedure but this Bill is very important. As a result of the input of this House we have an excellent Bill and I hope, with an absolute categorical commitment from the Minister on this section, that our worries can be met.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely amazed at what has just happened, that the leader of the Labour Party in this House, Senator Ferris, taking on the mantle of Deputy Leader of the House, could suspend the House for half an hour <Col N="748" /> because he did not agree with a certain section of the Bill.  The question arising from it is simple.  It appears that the reason the Minister is putting in this amendment is very simple yet it will not be announced publicly.  It is fundamental to the error in this Bill, the formation of the three companies.  Basically that is what will happen.  I hope I will be proven wrong but I am obviously backed up in this thought by the Minister and the Government in their including in the Bill the protection that when the companies are formed they can act.  We have formed a company too many.  In order to enable the companies to operate, compounding that error, we have had to put in this amendment.</P>
      <P>We have a Labour Party and a Fine Gael Party in Government and yet we are in a situation here today where the Labour Party do not agree with the Bill, the House is suspended to allow everybody to go to their offices to get advice, we come back and we are exactly as we were.  Since the foundation of the State it has been the normal process of Government to introduce legislation.  I assume that the process by which legislation is introduced is by Government memoranda circulated in plenty of time to each Department for input, to each Minister for input and then the Government make a decision and produce a document.  That document is presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and normally it is unanimously agreed by the Government.  I have never heard otherwise until now.  This is a unique situation.  The Labour Party Ministers in Government do not seem to know what the Labour Party in the Seanad want.</P>

I am not saying that the Labour Party in the Seanad are wrong nor am I saying that the Labour Party in Government are wrong but there is a huge hole in the <Col N="749" /> bucket and it is leaking rapidly.  We saw the consequences of that leak last week. In recent weeks two former Labour Senators evacuated their positions on the Government side and vanished.  A Labour Party TD last week walked out on his party.</P>

If they had stood firm with us last week in our Committee Stage amendment, No. 2, we would be talking today about two companies in CIE, but they did not and they came in here today trying to pick the crumbs from the table.  It makes no difference to them what the cost is.  This error should have been stopped on day one at Government level. This Bill should have been presented properly to the Seanad.  There should have been a unified and more constructive approach.  That is my opinion and that of my party.  Because this was not done we find ourselves in the crazy situation where we have public pronouncements by the leader of the Labour Party in the House, begging and beseeching the Minister to change his mind.</P>

      <P>It is very important that some protection be included in the Bill and this amendment is a protection for the company. As far as I am concerned we have seriously erred in this Bill by the formation of three companies.  This is the only protection they have for survival.  It may only be necessary for liquidation.  This point was made by many Senators.  The Minister, Deputy J. Mitchell, said we were only daydreaming but the fact of the matter is that this is the situation.  We have erred seriously and I hope the Dáil will not compound that error but rather correct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a mediocre verbal performance last week with regard to the formation of the board.  We see the beginning of the problems in this amendment.  The same people cannot run both boards.  It cannot and will not work.  The boards do not matter in the operation of those companies.  It is the workers and the computers who matter.  We seem to have <Col N="751" /> forgotten all about these people and thought only about the members of the board, particularly in relation to the two companies in the amendment.  That is a relevant point in this Bill and the Minister has brought that out very clearly.  I am disgusted at what has happened today, that a legislative package produced by the Government has been broken by its own members.  The Government avowed that from day one Government policy would be arrived at by consultation and agreement.  I am sure the Government saw this amendment and agreed with it, yet the Labour Party in this House disagree with it.  There certainly is a hole in the bucket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point before we pass the Final Stage because there is a major difference between the Fianna Fáil attitude and the attitude of the Government on this Bill.  It is based on the formation of the companies.  In the first section of the Bill it is our contention that we should have had two companies &mdash; the bus and rail company in rural Ireland and Dublin City Transport Services. I believe a compromise was reached as a result of political pressure.  The amendment suggested by the Minister does not meet the requirements for a good performance by these companies.  I cannot understand how the new boards of those companies shall be similar.  Amendment 15 (a) states that: &ldquo;A majority of the directors of Iarnród Éireann &mdash; Irish Rail and Bus Éireann &mdash; shall be common to both companies&rdquo;.  If people who are appointed to those boards cannot see eye to eye on certain matters there can be naturally a disruption or a conflict of opinion as to what might be best for either or both of the companies.  At that stage we are dealing with it only from the top. We have heard over the years &mdash; and every Senator in this House will agree with this statement &mdash; that the public image of the problems of CIE is that they have been overburdened and over weighted at the top.  All we have done in this Bill is to add more weight at the top. Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State convinced me, in any argument they had in this House, that we were doing the right thing in forming three separate companies.  Basically, I believe it is an error.  I hope the Dáil will change that.  At this stage of the Bill we can do no more than say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that, <Col N="754" /> human nature being what it is, rural bus will direct traffic to rural bus and that rail services will naturally be depleted on that account.  This may not happen initially but it will certainly happen at a later stage because financial pressures will be put on those companies to show profit.  The company will prove its strength by its profit.  The rural bus will do their utmost, through their staff on the ground, to show that their company are the best.  They will direct traffic to rural bus and will give the expressway services and the present services which we see are not adequate a boost.  I forecast that rail will be the loser in that instance.</P>
    <P>Members of this House who will be lucky enough to be elected to the next Seanad &mdash; some might take another point of view and consider themselves unlucky enough to be elected to the next Seanad &mdash; will have problems concerning rail. This is a sad forecast because it would be a tremendous loss to this nation if our rail passenger services were depleted in any way.  If that happens, it will not be their fault.  The board of the company will not be able to do anything about it.  The bus company cannot be blamed because they will be operating under the fundamental pressure that, &ldquo;If you want capital investment, show me the requirements and show me the proof that you can make it viable&rdquo;.  That is the normal requirement. Slowly but surely the decline and ultimate death of Irish rail will begin.  That would be a major tragedy.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister in the strongest terms to refrain from the platitudes and to face that fact.  He will have time in the Dáil to do so.  If he is good enough he will be brave enough to make the change. I do not think anybody will think any worse of him if he changes his mind on this issue.  The formation of the three companies is for one purpose only.  The Minister mentioned this on the Second Stage.  He said he wanted to be able to financially rule those three companies.</P>
    <P>In my opening address I said that it could be done on a regional basis and <Col N="755" /> there was no need for the Bill.  I still believe it could be done on a regional basis within CIE structures.  But the Bill is here and must take it as we see it.  We must accept that it is Government policy to have this re-organisation of CIE.  However, one can be only baffled as to the extent of Government policy, judging from the performances I have seen in the House.</P>
    <P>One cannot draw a white line at any railway station or bus station in this country. We are dealing with a commuter public who want to reach their destinations efficiently and quickly and for as little cost as possible.  That is the market place today.  If CIE can do that they will do it and if they have the authority to do it they will do it.  Under this Bill they are given the single authority to do that.  There is no commitment that there will be a link from one company to the other apart from the fact that the two boards sitting at the top will meet once a month and make a decision.  The implementation of that decision may be rather difficult and might take some time.</P>
    <P>CIE have made a significant contribution to this country.  They have given a tremendous service over the years.  Only in the past ten years have they been experiencing pressure.  Times have changed drastically since day one of CIE.  CIE did not change.  We can blame who we like, where we like and when we like but CIE did not change.  Now that we are changing them we should put them on the right road, I do not think we are doing this.  I appeal to the Government, through the Minister of State, to reconsider in the coming days or weeks this major issue of separation and competition and to bear in mind the cruel results that will follow.  If we settle for a two company structure we will have one complementing the other and that will result in a better and more economical service and in a good working relationship between all workers within this fine company.  That is where their success will lie.  Until such time as they are working together for the same company they <Col N="756" /> cannot be successful.  Because of the subdivision of CIE into three companies we will be calling for a vote to make our point in the strongest possible way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the Bill.  When the Bill arrived in the Seanad I understood, as has been proven since, that it came here for our consideration and amendment. No legislation, as the Minister of State said, can be so perfect that it does not allow itself to be amended.  The amended Bill we have before us is a distinct improvement on the Bill which came before us.  The point in connection with the two or three companies was argued, discussed and debated at length.  The Minister gave his decision as to the necessity for a three company structure, because the improvements in management and in management direction would have been improved in this formula.</P>
      <P>Our concerns, which were expressed vociferously on this side of the House, related to the dangers involved in a three company structure.  Thankfully, the Minister met our reservations by ensuring that the boards of two of the companies &mdash; Irish Rail or Irish Bus, or whatever they may be called in the future &mdash; would have common directorships.  This would ensure that if there were three companies two of them at least would be run by a majority of the same board so as to eliminate any unfair competition that might arise in the overall dash that is now popular to justify everything that is done on economic grounds only.</P>
      <P>The final amendment which the Minister accepted this morning from Senator O'Mahony and myself is to ensure that the social content of the services of CIE will not be forgotten by the board, the Government or any future Government. I am only concerned about this Government and they have already shown the proof of their interest in the social content of the service.  Now that it is in legislation this will ensure that no other Government will eliminate the social content of it or, if they do, at least we will have had an opportunity to have a particular political philosophy stamped on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> I should like to pay a special tribute to Senator O'Mahony, the Cathaoirleach and my other colleagues who met frequently at all levels with the trade union movement, the workers' representatives and consumers.  I should like also to pay tribute to the Minister, the Minister of State and the members of the Cabinet</P>

      <P>This legislation is an indication of how successful we were in trying to put our particular stamp on it.  It involves an important industry &mdash; the transportation industry.  This industry is linked up with trade, commerce, tourism and so on.  Our policy for many years was that it would be integrated to the greatest degree possible.  This legislation will reflect the kind of integration that we want in the service.  I owe no apology to anybody on the other side of the House for any discussions or negotiations &mdash; even during a period of suspension of the House, which was done by the agreement of the House &mdash; to allow that process to continue.  That is the parliamentary democratic process and that is what we followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being forthcoming during those processes of discussion and negotiation.  The Leader of the House has been patient with us, and with myself in particular, on this matter of legislation.  I would, and have <Col N="758" /> always been, patient with other Members of the House, even the Opposition, if they had particular concerns about any piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>I have always facilitated the Opposition.  I do not act on my own in this regard.  We always act in a group situation.  We have proven this in anything that we have done.  We have acted as a political group which are a legitimate part of the Government.  Whether that suits Senator Killilea or not is totally irrelevant to me.  The fact that the Bill reflects our input as a political party, taking part in a Government and the fact that this legislation reflects that participation to us and to myself as the leader of the group, is satisfying.  If does not worry me whether Senator Killilea agrees with it or not. That is the reality of it.</P>
      <P>As one of the most able negotiators, and debaters in the House the Cathaoirleach will recognise and is aware of the process that took place because he took part in it.  It is his right as an elected or nominated Member of the House.  He fulfilled that duty without question from anybody because that is his role.  The Minister recognised our role this morning and throughout the debate on this legislation. On Second Stage I was the first person to raise a question about the content of the Bill, in spite of Senator Killilea's total welcome for the Bill as it was initiated in the beginning.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the worker-directors will be protected under this legislation, with no thanks whatsoever to Senator Killilea.  I do not take it from him that he put it down.  Opportunism is a marvellous thing when you implement it in the House but being able to deliver the goods is the most important thing.  We delivered the goods.  The workers in CIE know this and so also do the trade unions. <Col N="760" /> The sections that are relevant to them are included in this legislation.  I am pleased about this.  This is the whole parlimentary process.  I hope that when we have a further meeting with the people concerned they also will be satisfied.</P>
      <P>It is an excellent Bill.  I am delighted with the Minister of State's final commitment that he will look at the problems we spelt our for him in the final section of his amendments.  It is our right to express reservations about any words we feel could be detrimental to the workers' representative's interests on the board.  The Minister has given a commitment that between now and the time the Bill enters the other House the possibility of amendments being initiated there will be considered if that is deemed to be legally necessary.  This is what I want to ensure would happen.  If the Minister did not move his amendments, that possibility would have arisen in any case. There was no disagreement about this. There was the question of the process to achieve it.  Because we were at the Report Stage of the Bill, the facility we would have on Committee Stage was not available to us to have the cut and thrust of debate.  The only way we could achieve this was to have discussion.  We had discussion.  If we made history in the House, there is nothing wrong with that. If we do it in the overall interests of the legislation, I am delighted about that and so are the Labour Party.  We have no apologies to offer to any Fianna Fáil Senator.</P>

      <P>I never find difficulty in agreeing with the distinguished Leader of the House, Senator Dooge.  I cannot say the same sometimes for the Deputy Leader.  I do not have to be long-winded to say what I am going to say.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that this Bill should be wrapped up this evening giving the impression that Fianna Fáil tried to block, or not help the legislation going through the House.  I happened to be in the Chair when this decision was taken. I have been upbraided regarding who spoke when and how many times before that adjournment took place.  The Minister came back and talked.  He gave us &mdash; which I thought was a little unfair &mdash; nearly a lecture on the procedures of this House and how democratic it is to participate in debate.  I totally accept that but it is not like this Minister to lecture us.  The few of us on this side of the House who did participate &mdash; and, indeed, the few on the other side &mdash; did so in good faith.  That is when we end up with a better Bill.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong, even if Senator Ferris is responsible for this being a better Bill, if this House adjourned when this legislation has gone through, without all of us acknowledging the part played by the Government partners, the Opposition, and others such as Senator Killilea. I am not referring to myself.</P>
      <P>I am referring to the Deputy Leader's remark.  We have found during this session in this House that we do not play party politics and we come out with better legislation.  In future persons would be better not to use the expression &ldquo;I am going out with a better Bill this evening&rdquo;. It is the Seanad that is going out with a better Bill this evening, I would hope.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, with regard to what Senator Honan said about my giving the House a lecture, I am sorry that she interpreted it in that fashion.  I was simply attempting to be a little bit more vigorous than usual in responding to Senator Killilea, which I felt Senator Killilea would expect me to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution just now Senator <Col N="762" /> Killilea made two main points.  One was about the future of the railways, or, as he might put it, the lack of future of the railways under the new legislation, and the other point was about the three subsidiaries, instead of two.  With regard to the retention of the railway, I should say that these proposals are designed to ensure the future of the railway.  That does not mean that we are not going to ask for a better performance from the railways.  The new organisational structure does not mean that the railways and the provincial buses will go their separate ways.  They will continue to be dependent on each other as they are at present. Disruptive competition will not be permitted by the Board.  It must be emphasised that the board of CIE will have the key role in approving the plans of the companies and supervising their performance. This will, of course, automatically embrace the scope and extent of competition.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by several people about the three companies, instead of two.  The units are smaller and more manageable.  It is possible to have more precise objectives with the management and provide scope for more intensive effort in the separate managements. Overall, the Bill has emerged in a considerably amended fashion.  I get the impression that Ministers down the years would rather see a Bill emerge intact from either House.  I never had that opinion myself.  As a commentator and observer of this without being a practitioner, I always felt a certain amount of resentment towards a Minister, when good solid points were being made, when he would have no give, but would stay solemnly with the brief that he had in front of him and not alter it in the slightest in deference to logically sound arguments from the other side.</P>

I believe that <Col N="763" /> it is, over all, a good day's work, both for the course of legislation and also for the company whose affairs are being altered through this legislation.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport (Preinspection Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the setting up of a US immigration and public health preinspection facility at Shannon Airport.  That facility is to be set up in accordance with an agreement proposed to be made between the Irish and US Governments. The terms of the proposed agreement, which is scheduled to the Bill, have been approved by the Dáil.  The agreement will be completed on behalf of the two Governments when the legislation is enacted.  The preinspection facility is due to start, on a trial basis, with effect from 1 July, hence the urgency attaching to passage of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Arising from an Aer Rianta initiative aimed at increasing traffic through Shannon Airport, the question of establishing US customs, immigration, and public health preclearance at Shannon has been discussed with the US authorities on various occasions since the 1970s onwards.  The US already have such arrangements with Canada, the Bahamas and Bermuda.  In the early stages of the discussions, a full preclearance arrangement was considered, but it was not proceeded with because</P>
      <P>(a)  Aer Lingus were concerned about the delays which would arise for the Company's services to the US due to the necessity to off-load baggage at Shannon in order to process it through customs and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> (b)  the US customs authorities seemed to be less than enthusiastic about the proposal.</P>
    <P>Interest in customs preclearance at Shannon tended therefore to recede somewhat. Last year, however, the Minister decided to pursue the matter further with the US authorities and, at a meeting in Washington in October, with Mrs. Elizabeth Dole, the US Secretary for Transportation, raised the question again.  The meeting was well worth while and, following discussions between officials of our two administrations, the text of a draft agreement on a more limited preinspection arrangement was finalised.  Under the proposed agreement, officers of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service would conduct at Shannon Airport inspection of passengers and aircraft crew required by United States immigration and public health laws and regulations for entry into the United States.  Customs clearance would be carried out in the normal way on arrival in the United States.  The draft agreement allows for extension of preinspection to other airports if considered desirable at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, airlines operating long-distance routes between parts of the US and Europe may, for a variety of aeronautical reasons, have to make a technical stop for refuelling purposes at an intermediate airport and, over the years, Aer Rianta have marketed Shannon as a suitable transit stop.  The principal benefit to Ireland of preinspection is that Aer Rianta will be able to market it as another reason why airlines should operate through Shannon, thus generating additional traffic movements at the airport.</P>
    <P>With the prospect of avoiding what are often lengthy delays at immigration on arrival in the US, preinspection at Shannon would mostly benefit business people and passengers holding other than US passports.  Aer Rianta believe that preinspection should be of particular interest to airlines operating between Europe and the US with significant numbers of non-US citizens on board.  Indeed, I see no <Col N="765" /> reason why it should not also be of interest to airlines operating scheduled services between the US and Ireland, particularly those which turn around at Shannon.</P>
    <P>To test the value of preinspection to Shannon Airport, agreement has been reached on an initial trial period of four months, commencing 1 July, after which the results of the trial will be evaluated by both countries and a decision taken as to whether preinspection should be established on a permanent basis.  The trial period covers the peak period at Shannon Airport and, in the view of both the Irish and US authorities, will be sufficient to determine whether or not the experiment is a success.</P>
    <P>Initial estimates were that preinspection could result in 100 extra landings at Shannon during the four-month trial period, generating significant net additional revenue for Aer Rianta from aircraft landing fees, inflight catering, sales of fuel and sales in the duty-free-shop. Aer Rianta estimated that the additional revenue generated would more than compensate for the &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; cost to the company of providing the physical facilities required at Shannon for preinspection.</P>
    <P>Recent developments with regard to international terrorism have affected somewhat the Aer Rianta projections, as it is now generally accepted that fewer US visitors will come to Europe this summer. However, this new situation makes it all the more necessary for us to take all possible measures to maximise the attraction of this country and its airport facilities to airlines flying between the US and Europe.  The Government have decided, therefore, to press ahead with the proposals for preinspection at Shannon.  I have been assured by Aer Rianta that, on the basis of commitments already received from a number of airlines, the preinspection scheme will still be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Under a permanent arrangement, the additional costs to the US Government of providing preinspection at Shannon compared with the cost of inspection on arrival in the US would fall on Aer Rianta.  However, in accordance with the <Col N="766" /> terms of the proposed agreement and normal practice in the US preclearance arrangements with other countries, these costs could be recouped by Aer Rianta from the participating airlines.  In the course of the negotiations, the US side agreed that the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service should bear the costs of posting INS officers at Shannon during the trial period and that the cost of the required physical facilities at Shannon would be borne by Aer Rianta.  This should make participation in the trial period more attractive to airlines.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Aer Lingus, who have expressed concern lest preinspection might cause delays at Shannon to their services to the US, nevertheless propose to avail of the trial period to put some of their flights through preinspection. I was glad to hear of this because my Department have been assured both by Aer Rianta and the US authorities that sufficient resources will be made available to ensure that delays will not occur.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is intended to give legal effect to the terms of the proposed agreement with the US.  There are two aspects of the Bill and the draft agreement to which I think I should draw particular attention.  They relate to the questions of national sovereignty and law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The presence of officials from a foreign Government at Shannon has given rise to some fears in regard to sovereignty.  I would like to set the record straight.  The INS officials at Shannon will be acting within the powers granted to them under the Bill which is before the House and proper and effective safeguards have been built into the Bill and also into the draft Agreement which is scheduled to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the draft agreement which could be held to touch on Ireland's sovereignty, for example, Article IX which deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the question of immunity for US citizens assigned to INS duties in Ireland; Article V which deals with the powers of INS officers, and Article VI, paragraph (4), which deals <Col N="767" /> with law enforcement, have been drafted as restrictively and tightly as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill specifies the preinspection duties which INS officials will be authorised to carry out in the State, while section 6 provides for immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for such officials while carrying out those duties.  Senators should note, therefore, that the immunity enjoyed by the INS officers will be strictly limited to acts performed in the course of their duties at the preinspection facility. It should also be noted that provision is made in section 6 (3) of the Bill, as in the draft agreement, whereby the immunities granted may be waived by the US Government.  This is normal procedure under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Counsular Relations.</P>
    <P>The House will see, therefore that, in so far as Irish law is concerned, the INS officials are, in effect, designated persons under section 5 of the Bill carrying out specified functions and subject to Irish law in every way like other residents except for the immunities under section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (4) provides for protection of the facilities used by the INS officials, while the provision in section 6 (5) of the Bill reflects the undertaking contained in Article IX (4) of the draft agreement regarding privileges to be accorded in the future to the relevant US officials.  The House will note that the question of the privileges to be enjoyed by the US officials concerned will have to be the subject of further consultations and agreement between the two Governments.  It is envisaged that these privileges will relate principally to the areas of income tax and customs examination on transfer of residence.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the text of the draft agreement, by imposing obligations on the US authorities to consult with and/or to seek the agreement of the Irish authorities in relation to a number of significant operational aspects of preinspection, provides an important element of control by the Irish authorities.  For example, Article VI (2) provides that the preinspection facilities to be provided <Col N="768" /> must be the subject of agreement between the competent authorities of both countries; Article VI (3) requires the agreement of the competent Irish authority to any communications and inspection aids and equipment required by the INS for preinspection purposes and Article VII (1) provides for Irish control over the number of INS officials to be assigned to preinspection duties; Article VII (3) imposes an obligation on the US authorities to consult with the competent Irish authority on matters relating to the implementation of the agreement; while Article VII (5) provides that the INS shall immediately inform the Irish Immigration Service of any refusal of passage onwards to the US and supply the latter with all data relevant to that decision.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the US authorities have accepted, and it is written into the draft agreement and into section 5 of the Bill, that any search of passengers by INS officials would have to be on a voluntary basis.  We regarded this as a very important point of principle.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is concerned with aliens control.  At present, for the purposes of aliens control, persons who are in transit at Shannon Airport are not regarded as having arrived in the State. This principle is reflected in section 7, which provides that persons flying into Shannon, who are cleared for passage onwards to the US by the INS and who then continue their journey to the US will not be regarded as having arrived in the State.  Where, however, a person is refused passage onwards by the INS, it is necessary that that person should be deemed to have arrived in the State and be required to present himself or herself to an Irish immigration officer for permission to land.  This will be necessary because there may not be an early return flight to the person's point of embarkation or place of origin.  Persons refused passage onwards will be given or refused permission to land in the State having regard to their individual cases and to the Aliens Act and orders made under that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> In the case of persons refused permission to land in the State, it may be necessary in some cases to keep them in detention pending suitable flights out of the State.  It is not expected that the number of people refused passage onwards will be large or that their numbers should pose any problems for our immigration officers.  Accordingly, no extra staff will be needed to deal with this category of person.  As I have indicated already, the INS will be required to provide information to our immigration officers about persons refused passage onwards.  Such information would be of use to our immigration officers in the event of such persons seeking permission to land in Ireland.  This arrangement will not result in any expense to the Irish taxpayer as the draft agreement provides that the air carrier will be responsible for all expenses and arrangements in connection with return to the point of embarkation or country of origin of persons refused passage onwards by the INS.</P>
    <P>I think it is important also that I should draw to the attention of Senators the fact that, under the terms of the draft agreement, law enforcement at the proposed preinspection facility will remain in Irish hands.  Under Article VI (4) of the draft agreement, the Irish Government undertake to provide appropriate law enforcement assistance to prevent persons refused passage onwards from boarding a preinspected flight.  Such assistance would be confined to cases where there was a threat of a breach of the peace or, for instance, where there was a threat of an assault or where an actual assault had taken place.  That type of situation can arise at present at any of our airports.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what is envisaged in the draft agreement in relation to law enforcement is not new.  Indeed, boarding or attempting to board an aircraft by an unauthorised person is already a prohibited act under Article 4 of the Airport By-Laws 1978.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for increased penalties for offences such as obstructing, impeding or assaulting <Col N="770" /> authorised officers or for refusing or failing to leave a State airport when required to do so by an authorised officer.  The existing penalties were laid down by the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950 and are very much out of date.</P>
    <P>As with the immigration service, it is not envisaged that the extra work on law enforcement will necessitate any extra staff to deal with matters arising from the preinspection operation at Shannon. Incidents requiring law enforcement assistance, which are expected to be few in number, will be dealt with as part of the normal workload of the law enforcement officers concerned.</P>
    <P>In view of certain comments made recently outside Leinster House, I should like to make one point absolutely clear. INS officers assigned to Shannon Airport will not be armed, nor was it ever intended that they should be.</P>
    <P>Over the years, Shannon has had its peaks and troughs.  The introduction of jet aircraft on trans-Atlantic routes in the late fifties obviating the need for refuelling stops, threatened the viability of the airport.  This was the stimulus for the establishment of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which was given responsibility for developing traffic through the airport and for encouraging industrial development in the immediate vicinity of the airport.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant contribution made over the years by the development company in attracting terminal traffic to Shannon Airport.  The results are highly visible and of high profile on the ground for anyone even with a casual visit to the area at present.</P>
    <P>The efforts of SFADCo were built on by Aer Rianta from 1969 onwards, when they took over the management of the airport and, later on, the catering and duty free shops.  The marketing of Shannon as a technical stopping point, the expansion of mail order and duty free sales and the success of the Aeroflot refuelling facility have all made substantial contributions to the wellbeing of the airport.  The turnaround in the financial performance at Shannon in recent years has been largely due to the efforts of <Col N="771" /> the board, management and staff of Aer Rianta.  They deserve high praise.  Following a series of losses in the years 1979-82, which reached a peak of £1.6 million in 1980, results at Shannon in recent years have been much improved, with surpluses of £3.3 million and £3.6 million respectively in 1984 and 1985.  In view of the expected downturn in the number of US visitors to Europe this summer, it would be too optimistic to expect the results at Shannon this year to match those of recent years.  Nevertheless, the proposed new preinspection facility should provide some measure of compensation by attracting new traffic to the airport.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving this Bill a welcome and recognising that it can be very useful, we nevertheless must admit that it is less than was sought by Aer Rianta in the beginning.  It is unfortunate that customs clearance facilities will not be available as well as the immigration and health inspection facilities which will become available.  It is unfortunate also, after so much work has been put into the setting up of this major facility of Shannon Airport, that it would seem as if the trial period of four months is too short a period in which to evaluate the value of this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, as the Minister said, in terms of the operation of Shannon Airport peaks and troughs.  It may be that the four month period from July 1 onwards might be a trough period, even though in terms of normal traffic through the airport it should be a peak traffic period. The facility is one which is very welcome. It should create the opportunity for about 100 extra flights into Shannon during the four month period.  He is worried that we may not reach the 100 extra flights because of the lessening of passenger traffic into Europe from the United States.  Obviously, if there is a lessening of traffic into Europe from the United States there will be a lessening of the number of people who will be travelling back to the United States, unless there <Col N="772" /> is a build up of traffic from Europe by Europeans to the United States to compensate for the fewer Americans who will be travelling to Europe this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister highlights the fact that international terrorism has caused a large drop in the numbers of people coming from America to Europe this year. Unfortunately, in the past number of months too many people have been concentrating on terrorism as being the main cause of this downturn in visitors from the United States to Europe.  If the Americans were being honest and a proper evaluation was being made of the causes, the primary cause would be shown to be the change in the value of the dollar.  The fact that the dollar has increased in value in the past months means that people coming from the States are not getting what they would consider to be as good value as they had been getting in the past number of years. It has to be said that the reason that Americans were coming in increasing numbers was because European currencies against the dollar were very good value for Americans.  People could fly into Ireland, Great Britain and into continental Europe and in a normal week's purchases of reasonably priced luxury goods save the fare from America.  There is better value for Americans at present in staying in America for their holidays. There is better value to be obtained in America in terms of the cost of oil products.  Therefore, the big push in America is to see America first.  The visits to Europe have been cut down.  The value of the dollar is the main cause for Americans not travelling and not the threatened international terrorism.  Unfortunately, this message does not seem to have got through.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for welcoming the preinspection at Shannon of emigrants to the United States.  This gives a speedier preinspection for people who are emigrating or who have to go through the emigration process.  The delays at the major airports in America are enormous and can create problems.</P>
    <P>For certain people who may be trying to get into the United States illegally <Col N="773" /> or with emigration visas which are not proper there is a certain saving for airlines of European origin, in that these people will not be flown over the Atlantic and then have to be sent back at great cost to the airlines involved.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions that have to be asked regarding the setting up of the facility at Shannon.  It is suggested by the Minister that the airlines can be charged in order to recoup this cost.  Can the Minister give us any indication as to the cost of providing this facility?  There has to be a major capital cost in terms of equipment and buildings.  I do not think that there is sufficient space at Shannon which could be used by the immigration services to do the job which is supposed to be done under the aegis of this Bill.  I would like to ask the Minister how much it is going to cost the Irish Government to set up this facility.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the cost would be recouped from airlines.  May I ask the Minister if airlines feel that landing in Ireland is a costly process?  The cost per tonne of landing in Ireland is quite high.  How much will be added to this cost for the provision of facilities for preinspection?</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to see that Aer Lingus have agreed to have only some of their flights preinspected.  I cannot see why they do not go along with the great efforts that are being made by Aer Rianta and by the Government now, in following up Aer Rianta's great work and initiative in producing this Bill, and allow all their aircraft which are heading for the States to be preinspected at Shannon.  It is expected that at least four other airlines will use the preinspection facility.  I am very disappointed that Aer Lingus are not availing of this facility to the fullest extent.  If we are trying to sell this as a bonus for Shannon Airport, for Ireland and as a bonus for travellers, Aer Lingus should have gone along with the purposes for which this Bill is before us today.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been raised in relation to what the Minister has said. A few of them will be of concern to people who feel that our sovereignty could be at risk because of the fact that <Col N="774" /> we would have United States immigration officials working on Irish soil.  It will be the first time I think that facilities like this will be provided in Europe.  It appears that the personnel of this facility will have the same status as embassy staff who, while within the embassy doing their job, have political diplomatic immunity.  It would appear now that we are going to have a secondary area of diplomatic immunity in Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>There is a definite worry that we could have in Shannon a situation where highhanded INS officials could create problems for people travelling to the United States.  It has been mentioned that this type of operation has been working in Canada for a number of years.  I would sincerely hope that the personnel who would be stationed by the United States Immigration Department at Shannon would be a little more human in their attitude towards young people who are going to the States than is the case in the current situation in Canada.  Numerous stories come back from Canada of people travelling from Shannon by Air Canada and passing into the United States.  They are being treated like dirt by various immigration officials in Canada.  There have been incidences of strip searching. The situation here does not seem to be any different in the sense that the person who wants to go through the immigration officials can object to being searched or need not answer any questions.  Of course if they do not answer questions or if they object to a search obviously they are not going to get through the facility.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the Minister must ensure that young people who are travelling to America will be treated, whether they are on student visas which will allow them to stay there for 12 months or whether they have holiday visas for three months, as human beings and not treated as people who are trying to buck the system.</P>
    <P>What I have said in regard to some of the United States immigration officials based in Canada is not true in all cases but it does happen on occasions.  We do <Col N="775" /> not want a parallel here in Ireland.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the immigration officials who do come over here are people who do their job as a European would do, as a gentleman or as a lady would do it.  They must realise that everybody who is going into the United States and who is under 25 is not going out to work illegally: they are not all wetbacks. A number of them are going out for legitimate purposes whether it be for holidays or for summer work.  On the visas granted by the Embassy here in Dublin 99.9 per cent of the people concerned are going out in a legitimate manner.</P>
    <P>Mention was made in the Minister's speech of immunities granted which may be waived by the United States Government. I would like to have some clarification on this.  Diplomatic immunity is granted in certain circumstances but the Minister is suggesting that the United States Government may waive these immunities.  If immunities are to be waived why is it not the Irish Government who would waive or have the power to waive immunities?  As these people are operating in our State, I cannot see why it is the United States Government who would waive immunities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the facility at Shannon I would like to ask the question: will it be totally staffed by United States personnel or will there be any Irish presence there? What privileges will the immigration staff be afforded?  In terms of the worries of Aer Lingus I would like to know what delays might arise at Shannon as a result of these preinspections?  To take a typical flight from Dublin landing at Shannon, what extra time is it envisaged might be taken up by going through the immigration preinspection and health inspection? What is the situation where you might have people who are not Irish citizens travelling on an Aer Lingus plane and it might seem to the immigration officials that these people would have to be questioned for a longer period than an ordinary applicant for immigration purposes would have to go through.  Will these people be taken off the planes?  Will they be held over for the next plane or <Col N="776" /> what is the situation that will apply there?</P>
    <P>It would appear that if this proposal works &mdash; and I sincerely hope it does &mdash; that there will be a continuance of the facility at Shannon.  As I have said, I think that four months is too short a period to evaluate any major scheme of this nature.  The workers in Shannon and indeed the workers in factories who have facilities in the duty-free shops in Shannon must welcome any enlargement of the numbers of flights that will stop at Shannon.  I am sure that Aer Rianta if they had a guarantee of a longer period than four months to market this facility could do a fantastic job in selling the idea of stopping at Shannon and having the immigration and preinspection facilities afforded to people travelling onwards to the United States.  I do not think they can do this in four months: I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>Obviously, workers are going to benefit if the number of flights increase, not alone in Shannon but in the duty-free shops and the workers in the factories supplying the duty-free shops will benefit. On the question of security in this area I would like to have the Minister enlarge on what he has said.  He did say that no United States armed personnel will be allowed in this facility.  I would like to know what sort of security will be provided by the Irish Government in this facility or surrounding this facility.  How does the Minister foresee security problems which might arise in the facility being dealt with since apparently there will be no Irish presence there and the people inside will not be allowed to carry arms?</P>
    <P>For the sake of Shannon and the whole Shannon area I am delighted to see that there has been a turnaround in the trading figures of the airport and that for two consecutive years there has been an increase in profitability.  I have no doubt in my mind that this is due to the fantastic work that has been done by Aer Rianta and by SFADCo in the region.  I sincerely hope that Aer Lingus, as our national airline will pay more attention to Shannon and indeed pay more attention to getting people in and out of Ireland at a reasonable cost.  If Aer Lingus became <Col N="777" /> more cost conscious, as they are being forced to do at present because of increased competition, we would have a lot more tourists, business people and traffic going through Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>In section 7 of the Bill which concerns alien control, it is suggested that there will be no cost to the State; if persons are not allowed to go to America, the costs of holding them or of sending them back to the country of origin will be borne by the airline carrier concerned.  Do these costs include the cost of keeping a person in Ireland while awaiting transportation back to where they embarked on the plane and what facilities will be provided in these instances?  Will these people be held in custody in a facility in the Shannon Airport area, as happens in Canada where people are held in jail custody and have to wear jail uniforms before they are sent back to where they came from? Can the Minister tell us exactly what facilities will be made available for people who are not allowed to travel onwards after being questioned by the immigration people at Shannon?  If the airlines carry the cost of repatriating these people, equally they should bear the cost of keeping them in a reasonable facility other than incarcerating them in jailhouses or garda barracks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that the facilities will not finish at the end of the four month period but that they will be continued.  Hopefully, in the future there will be a full customs clearance facilitity provided in conjunction with the immigration preinspection and health inspection.  This Bill should increase the revenue to Shannon Airport and in doing so also increase the value of Shannon to the entire country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. In doing so I wish to pay a particular tribute to the Minister for Communications who took the initiative last October of having the preinspection project at Shannon advanced to the point where we are now enacting legislation to deal with the facility being provided at Shannon Airport.  This is a very fortunate development because the effects of international <Col N="778" /> terrorism and the great pressure that tourism is under because of these events over the last number of months could not have been predicted last October.</P>
      <P>We are all well aware of the recent visit of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to the United States and the televised pronouncements of the British Prime Minister relating to the concern felt in Britain also about these terrorist attacks.  Of course we have even closer associations with North America.  The widespread feeling that exists in Europe generally on the downturn in American tourism required some kind of a fillip and new initiatives that would produce a throughput at Shannon. This development is coming not just at the right time but it could not have come at a better time from the point of view of Shannon.  It was interesting to hear the in the Minister's speech the historic role that Shannon has played as a major centre, and about its being the most important international airport in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the arrival of jet aircraft in the fifties we saw a change in the need for Shannon in that aircraft did not need to refuel.  In the period after that, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company put Shannon on the map as an area which did not just provide an international airport but provided a very strong industrial base.  We have now got the development of something even more significant on an international level, the development of a European gateway to America which surely Shannon must become in the foreseeable future with the emergence of a full customs clearance role for the Airport in due course &mdash; although I realise that is not the intention of the Bill as of now.  The introduction of immigration and public health preinspection at Shannon clearly indicates a new and important development for the airport. I am satisfied that the four months trial period, which was a concern of Senator Lanigan, will be long enough to prove whether the facility will be as valuable as indicated in the Minister's speech.  This period will start, fortunately, in the busiest season of the year and I am quite <Col N="779" /> certain that the ingenuity of the US and Irish authorities will be utilised&mdash;I would expect all of it from Aer Rianta &mdash; to let it be known to international carriers that this facility is available to avoid the great problems that exist in such airports as Kennedy in New York.  It should speed up transit to America and avoid the difficulties that passengers can encounter going in and out of that airport.  This period is long enough; frequently the impact of Governments or Oppositions is judged on a shorter period than four months.  We can expect in a four-month period &mdash; particularly because of the timing of this period &mdash; to get a really sound indication of how useful this form of preinspection will be in the long term.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Lanigan's concern about how ready Shannon Airport is for this development.  I wish it every good luck and hope that Aer Rianta will be able to respond with facilities at the airport which will be able to cater for the 100 extra landings that are expected at Shannon during the four-month period. It is indicated in the Minister's speech that we are talking here of in-flight catering sales of fuel and sales in the duty-free shop.  Could the Minister tell us what kind of separation this preinspection facility will have at Shannon?  Will it be a part of the airport or set aside from the normal role that Shannon Airport plays as the principal international airport of this country?  Will flights coming in for preinspection be directed to one particular set of buildings or will they use the facilities that are there already and thus ensure that there is little or no need for Aer Rianta to compensate otherwise for the provision of the new facilities at the airport? I would be interested to know in a little more detail what evaluation has been made of the requirements for preinspection at Shannon when the period of temporary preinspection has been concluded successfully &mdash; as we all hope it will be.  We hope it will lead to a full preinspection facility and perhaps customs clearance in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill carries with it the promise of great development for Shannon.  This <Col N="780" /> facility can be a showpiece for Shannon. People who pass through Shannon on preinspection flights will be attracted to come back and visit Ireland another time. Presumably, these will be people who perhaps have never visited Ireland and we may be able to make a good impression on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan spoke of the difficulty experienced by some young people at airports in Canada where this preinspeciton facility exists.  I share his concern in this regard.  He went on to express his concern about what might happen at Shannon in the future when he spoke of incarceration of young people on their way through the airport.  I hope this will be in no way typical of the type of incarceration that is associated more with conditions in the Maze or other such places of detention.  I hope we will be operating a new level of facility at Shannon which will be seen as a showpiece for the country. I would like to know what kind of development will be necessary beyond the four-month trial period and whether it will be a facility which will be separate from the airport itself and the normal international role it plays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill as a great step forward.  This facility was available to this country in 1981 or 1982 but was not accepted because Aer Lingus had some idea that it would not work because of passenger facilities.  This was sad because we would not be talking today about the ordinary facility but about a much greater facility with full customs clearance which Senator Lanigan spoke of.  Those problems would be resolved now and Aer Lingus would not be in a position to block anything and would first accept this facility without any pre-conditions and if there were problems with Aer Lingus they should be directed to use the facility completely.  If other airlines wish to use this facility but the national airline do not, it blurs the situation for us.  Every obstacle should be removed and Aer Lingus should be forced to use the facility completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on the proposal that preinspection may be conducted <Col N="781" /> at additional locations in Ireland by agreement expressed in writing between both Governments.  This seems to indicate that there are other areas where the Government would wish to carry out these preinspections.  I am referring to Dublin Airport.  We would be afraid that when the runway which is to cost in the region of £30 million is completed the Government would intend to move the preinspection facility from Shannon to Dublin.  I would like the Minister to acknowledge that this will not happen and that the facility will be given exclusively to Shannon as is stated in the agreement.  It is important that Shannon retains this facility and that employment in this area would be completely protected.</P>
    <P>Tribute should be paid to the Minister for entering into this agreement and also to Aer Rianta who in the past three or four years especially have been aggressive in their marketing operation.  It is wonderful to see this happening in a semi-State body and I would ask other semi-State bodies to be as aggressive in the marketplace.  I would like to pay tribute to Aer Rianta for bringing this facility here.  As Senator FitzGerald said it is an historic role for Shannon Airport and, indeed, it is of historic significance that both Ireland and the USA have entered into this agreement.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the present position is and future position will be with regard to people seeking refuge in this country or looking for political asylum. Commercially it is probably the wrong thing to say but we have seen many disturbing incidents with regard to people who, for reasons of their own, have asked that they be granted political asylum in this country.  This has happened in transit between Cuba on one end and Moscow on the other.  It is sad that few of the people who have asked for political asylum have been granted it.  One would have to ask what happens to those people once they are left on that plane after they have asked the Irish authorities to give them political asylum.</P>
    <P>The Red Cross in Ireland are deeply <Col N="782" /> concerned about this situation and the Government's approach to it.  Are the commercial implications for this country the over-riding factor?  As far as I understand it, many people have been flown out of here on Aeroflot.  What happens to them and to their families after they arrive in Russia should be investigated as a matter of urgency.  As I understand it, the people who are conducting this are young and have a certain rule book.  I should like to know when the rules were written and who wrote them, how up to date they are, and whether they should be amended because of the situation now.</P>
    <P>Are we happy that we, a free country, are giving the facility to people who, because of their own situation, have approached this country looking for political asylum?  Anybody who is courageous enough to seek political asylum should be given the full courtesy of this country.  It ought to concern us, as a nation, as to what happens to people once they leave this country, having sought political asylum here but being refused.</P>
    <P>The other area I should like to comment on is that of the American tourists. The Minister referred to the company making a profit in the year 1984-85 but said that is not likely to be the case this year because of the fall in American tourist traffic.  As we have relationships now with our counterparts in the USA, we should impress on them that this is a peaceful country and one which they should be sending their tourists to.  There is also the situation where nearly 2.1 million American tourists have been going to England while only 350,000 have been coming here.  This is an area we should explore with the American officials to see if more American tourists might come here.  Naturally, they would be welcomed by the Irish people and by Shannon.</P>
    <P>The first reservation I would have is in relation to Aer Lingus.  I would hope that they would enter into this without any reservations and be fully prepared to cooperate and use the facility.  Second, regarding Aer Rianta, they have been very aggressive in the market place and have done an enormous amount of good <Col N="783" /> to promote Shannon.  Third, the Minister should examine carefully the matter of political asylum to see if the commercial factor is the over-riding factor in this whole matter.  We should ensure that people who apply for political asylum get a fair deal from us.</P>
    <P>We should welcome the American tourists in every way possible and allay any fears they might have in regard to their safety so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a great improvement and it provides a great facility for Shannon, a facility which will continue to grow.  I agree with the Minister when he says that he has to get it through the Seanad fast as it has to be in operation from 1 July.  I do not think this House will hold it up.  It will be very interesting to see what happens during the trial period.  I have no doubt but that the trial period will be the basis on which this agreement between the two countries will operate for the betterment of Shannon and for the betterment of this country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a short contribution to the discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill this evening. Coming, like you, a Chathaoirligh, from the mid-west, I would like to congratulate the Minister in bringing this measure before the House.  I say this because of the benefits and the advantages I can see coming to the Shannon region as a result of the operation of preinspection at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will not be aware of the fact that it is now almost 16 years since the idea of preclearance at Shannon in respect of passengers to the USA was mooted.  It was the brainchild of both SFADCo and Aer Rianta.  I am satisfied that it would have reached fruition much earlier were it not for opposition it encountered from agencies and from people within the State.  It is regrettable that almost 16 years had to pass before a measure, which would be of obvious benefit and which had all the indications of being a successful operation would be <Col N="784" /> introduced.  That delay has been due to the refusal of certain agencies and certain people within the State to accept the value of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Initially, the idea was for customs, immigration and public health preclearance at Shannon.  The proposal, because of the opposition to it, receded on many occasions and was resurrected from time to time.  I want to express a special word of congratulation to the Minister for having successfully raised this issue again last year with the American Secretary of Transportation and for having succeeded in getting two thirds of the package that was planned originally.  The original package included customs pre-clearance as well.  Customs preclearance is not included in the present proposal.  It is simply immigration and public health pre-clearance.  These will be a reality on 1 July next and I am satisfied that the four months trial period which the Minister has proposed to test the value of the operation will be sufficient to indicate that it can succeed, that it will be successful and that operational difficulties should be at a minimum.</P>
    <P>The proposal represents a further element in the development of Shannon Airport. There are spin-off benefits which will very clearly emerge from it.  First, there are the landing fees from the additional aircraft at Shannon.  Then there are the additional jobs in the catering services there, in fuelling and in the duty-free shops.  I am satisfied that the quality of the management at Shannon Airport and the quality of the work force there will ensure the success of this proposal.</P>
    <P>There is another element of the deal for which I feel the Minister deserves special praise.  He has succeeded in sharing the costs of getting the operation off the ground, sharing the cost of what has to be done physically at the airport to enable the operation to take off.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with the question of national sovereignty and law enforcement.  I have no doubt that he felt obliged to do that for the purpose of ensuring, as it is his duty, that there would not be an infringement of national sovereignty <Col N="785" /> and to clarify the true situation which will prevail in relation to law enforcement. Perhaps to some degree &mdash; it was very much a secondary degree &mdash; I am sure he was inspired to do that as a result of several red herrings that have been introduced in relation to this aspect of the project in recent weeks.  I never cease to be amazed at the lengths people can go to to find an excuse to knock a good idea.  There is this amazing capacity in so many of our people to search and to seek for the negative angle in any worthwhile project or proposal.  Where that negative angle cannot be located, the capacity to construct an artificial one is always there. In relation to this matter we have seen that happening.  To some extent these negative aspects of the scheme may have been promoted by an element of jealousy that this project is now to become a reality at Shannon.  The Minister has adequately dealt with any justifiable fears raised in relation to that particular aspect of it.  He has told the House that the provisions of the Bill and of the draft agreement which will be scheduled to it contain sufficient safety conditions and that these conditions and the draft agreement and, indeed, the provisions in the Bill, have been drafted as restrictively and as tightly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the pre-inspection and the fact that this facility, after long years of effort, will now be available at Shannon. I am satisfied that the project will be a success there and I look forward to its being a permanent arrangement, including customs clearance as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the legislation.  My views on Shannon and on any new project are well known.  I should like to put on record my thanks and indeed, the thanks of many other people for the great imagination and sound judgment of men like Liam Skelly and Michael Guerin.  I mention just those two people of a big team, as Senator Howard knows well.  We could do with more people like Liam Skelly and Michael Guerin in the nation today to get other projects off the ground such as this one. The reason I mentioned those two people <Col N="786" /> out of the full team is that somebody made reference earlier as to whether Shannon was ready.  Shannon was always ready for any challenge over the many years, including not alone senior management but right down to the lowest paid, shortest hours workers.  They have an extraordinary commitment in Shannon which has proved itself well.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald made reference to Shannon being the gateway in future to all places.  I would say that Shannon is the gateway to all places, for Senator FitzGerald's information.  Any legislation that gives 100 extra landings at Shannon, I welcome.  There may be questions asked as to whether Shannon is prepared for 100 extra landings.  I would say yes, it is ready.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta will maintain and have maintained Shannon Airport; it has met all the challenges that have been handed down to it.  The personnel of Aer Rianta have maintained a very high standard and have given the highest service at all times. Extra traffic through Shannon will not be any bother for Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>When this project was initiated it was rejected.  It has taken 15, 16 or 17 years to come about.  Anything that comes even after 16 years is to be welcomed.  The Minister dealt with the four-month trial period, commencing on 1 July.  When the Minister is replying to the debate, he might make it clear as to who will decide that the four-month trial period has been an absolute success?  It might suit some people to knock it and not allow it to continue.  I do not know and I should like to know this evening.</P>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister said that there will not be extra jobs created.  Again, I should like to ask the Minister if he is totally happy that it will be all personnel outside his jurisdiction or that of an Irish Government that will be dealing with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made references to diplomatic immunity being granted to the INS officials at Shannon.  This is an area where I would hope there would be an input from a Government Department on the Irish side.  In any new project or scheme, there could be a snag that would <Col N="787" /> cause upheaval of the whole thing.  Just as there would be supervision from the INS, there should be supervision from the Irish side also.  We are talking about a very important airport and apart from it being in County Clare, it has been involved in a debate on our neutrality.  I should like the Government to have an input in the supervision of the INS personnel. This is because of my concern arising from discussions in other places touching on our neutrality.</P>
    <P>On the question of delay at the airport, I understand that Aer Lingus stated that they could not have delays.  With due respect to Aer Lingus, let them leave Dublin earlier.  Shannon is a pleasant place to be in and a half an hour or an hour more there will not do any of the Aer Lingus boys with the gold braid on their cuffs any harm, if that would be their only problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard made reference to knockers of some description.  I do not know to whom he was referring to.  The Senator is like myself about Shannon. Ever since the Airport was put there there have been knockers.  We have had a repetition of that elsewhere in recent weeks.  Knocking an airport does not upset or bother me at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the INS officers assigned to Shannon Airport will not be armed.  I am concerned about this matter and at the same time I do not want to take it out of context of the Minister's speech.  He says that the INS officers assigned to Shannon Airport will not be armed.  Will the Minister tell me how will he or his Department know that some of these persons may not, at some time in the future, be armed?  This is a sticky problem.  It is not something to throw across the bow because I warmly welcome the legislation.  Anything that helps Shannon helps the nation.  Who will have the authority to find out whether officers, are armed or not at any time, even if it is only one individual?  We can search our own, but can we search the INS officers?</P>
    <P>Will there be extra gardaí, because at no place in this legislation has extra staff been mentioned for this legislation.  I do <Col N="788" /> appreciate that the spin off will give extra jobs.  I am big enough to admit that it will give extra jobs.  Will there be a need for extra Garda personnel at Shannon?  I would say that the Garda personnel at Shannon are fully stretched with what they have to do.  If there is extra supervision of any part of this, I would see then that there would have to be extra gardaí in the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  I hope that the Minister will keep a close eye to it, and that in four months from July 1 nobody will allow him to change or to remove something that he intends to implement.  I have already placed on the record of the House my confidence in Aer Rianta at Shannon.  They are a credit to the nation.  I say that I do not know what way any of them vote.  I see it at first hand.  We could do with more persons like them.  I totally support the Bill and I should like the Minister to deal with the few reservations I have mentioned; it is only for future security and our neutrality that I make those references.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support very strongly anything that has a beneficial effect on Shannon Airport.  A country the size of ours can only really have one international airport.  The balance of advantage lies in maintaining Shannon as the international airport for the country.  Too many of our facilities are concentrated in the Dublin area.  I will not pass any comment about other grandiose schemes that people might have to transfer the facilities in a more northerly direction, a north westerly direction to be more precise.  That is bordering on the ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I suppose the introduction of a Bill like this cannot fail to send a little shiver down our spine.  It is telegraphed by the Minister in his introductory speech and by most of the other contributors in that there is something a little bit subservient or threatening to one's national independence, the very concept of inspecting people going from this country to the United States of America.  It may well be that temporarily there are quite a number of people going <Col N="789" /> for temporary periods of time from this country to the United States of America. But I believe the time has long passed when on a permanent basis it is either good or healthy to send our most educated and adventurous people abroad. We should welcome United States industry into this country and look for the development of those industries within here rather than export our brains in order to bolster the economic strength of that fine democratic republic.</P>
    <P>It is a bit threatening.  For that reason the Minister has placed the agreement between ourselves and the United States of America in its proper context.  He has confronted the problem of sovereignty which was mentioned by most people as being something which would need careful examination in relation to the implementation of this agreement.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister has, indeed, confronted that problem properly. While instinctively I would oppose the measure because the granting to a foreign Government of some kind of additional or extra facilities which seem to place us in a subservient position would be naturally distasteful to me.  However, I am confident the Minister has taken into account the views of people like myself.  The agreement which has been negotiated between the Government of this country and the Government of the United States reflects properly the balance which should exist between sovereign Governments.</P>
    <P>There are two areas in which I consider that to be very well catered for.  One is in the text of the agreement itself and the other is in the assurance which the Minister has given us.  I would consider it quite unacceptable for the employees of another country to be armed in Ireland. If anything for me spoilt the very pleasant and welcome visit of the President of the United States of America, it was the obvious facilities for armed employees which were made available to him on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It gave rise to some difficulty, not only in this country but also in the United Kingdom.  It did not exactly sit easily with us in this country that such a thing should be necessary.  I do not want that to take from the very wonderful visit it was and how welcome President Reagan was to this country.  In giving the House the guarantee that the employees of the United States assigned from time to time to carry out duties in this country will not be armed, the Minister has taken a load off my mind.  For that I congratulate him.</P>
      <P>The second point which I would like to refer to is the question of the limited immunity which it is proposed to grant to the employees of the United States under section 6 of this Bill.  It is a very limited kind of immunity.  I wish sometimes that Senator Lanigan would carefully read the legislation before talking in terms of diplomatic immunity.  To call this diplomatic immunity and to equate it with an immunity which you would give to a diplomat is quite daft, to say the least of it.  It is an immunity only in respect of acts performed in the exercise of their duties under the agreement. That is a very limited form of immunity. In fact, the actual duties are listed.  There is no immunity for anything that does not fall within that.  This person will be susceptible to the Irish driving, drink, parking and fire-arms laws.  All these people will be liable to all these statutes. That is only right and proper.  That gives me considerable confidence that the Minister has maintained a proper balance in negotiating this agreement.  To suggest, as Senator Lanigan did, that that amounted to diplomatic immunity is stretching the definition of diplomatic immunity very far indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We examined this concept of immunity previously in this House in the Euro Control Act, where certain people under that Act were given immunity in respect of acts which they carried out and other people were given a greater degree of immunity.  The level of immunity proposed in section 6 is sensible.  That is the second reason why the Minister continues <Col N="791" /> to have my confidence in this delicate area.</P>
    <P>The Minister might indicate who he considers to be the competent authority, who he proposes to appoint as the competent authority.  I presume he proposes Aer Rianta as the competent authority. The competent authority is rather ponderously defined as &ldquo;the Minister or any person appointed by him by order under section 2.&rdquo;  Does the Minister intend to appoint Aer Rianta or does he intend to appoint anybody else?  Does &ldquo;person&rdquo; mean a human being or an organisation? The Minister might like to indicate whether it will be open to him under that definition &mdash; it may well be open to him as a result of the Interpretation Act to appoint a company or an organisation as the competent authority rather than a living person?  Any person appointed by him shall be the competent authority. If it is an organisation, does he intend appointing Aer Rianta?  If he does not intend appointing an organisation or if it is not possible to do so who is the competent authority he proposes to appoint? That competent authority is given the power under section 3 to enter into agreements with air carriers who wish to avail of preinspection.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like the Minister's response to and I would like to make some contribution in regard to it on Committee Stage.  An initial response might facilitate the debate on Committee Stage.  Section 6 (5) proposes that a citizen of the United States shall enjoy, in addition to the immunities, such privileges as may be agreed between the Government and the Government of the United States by an exchange of notes. The Minister said that he envisages income tax concessions and customs examination on transfer of residence.  Is it open to the Minister to make an exemption in respect of income tax?  Under the authority does he propose to so do?  Can he say that Mr. Jones, who is coming over here, will pay income tax as if he was still resident in the United States?  I have no objection to that.  It is quite reasonable that that should be done.  Has <Col N="792" /> the Minister authority to do so is the point I am making and, if not, should he take that authority?</P>
    <P>I do not understand the need for exemption of customs examination on transfer of residence.  I would have thought that customs examination would be an automatic matter on the transfer of a person's residence or the transfer of a person from one country to another.  If, for example, the agreement included a customs clearance area I could understand the inclusion of this second customs examination exemption facility.  In the present context I find it difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The words used in the agreement and the Bill are riot exactly the same.  I understand why that is the case.  The agreement is an agreement within two countries and, therefore, has to be expressed in one type of language.  The Bill is, of course, internal to our country and should be expressed in a different way.  Is the Minister happy that they are compatible?  I would like his assurance on that.  Subject to that, and to the other points I have raised, I welcome the proposal and wish the facility every success during the initial period and subsequently in its permanent implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan questioned whether the period of four months for an experiment of this new idea of pre-examination would be sufficient.  I must say, as a lay person without expertise in this area, that I have somewhat the same view myself.  Both sides, I am assured, agree that this period is long enough to decide if the experiment will be a success.  As I explained earlier, it us unlikely that the 100 extra flights which were envisaged when discussions were going on will now materialise at Shannon.  Nevertheless, Aer Rianta say that the experiments unquestionably will be very well worthwhile, will give the necessary information that they seek and of course, with the fall off in the number of people using it against the forecasts, every effort should be made to introduce <Col N="793" /> the extra facilities which in fact might still improve the throughput through Shannon on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan also dealt with the question of fees and the cost to airlines. Under a permanent scheme of preinspection, that is, if the experimental period turns out to be successful and it is put on the ground on a permanent basis, the participating airlines will have to bear the cost of the stationing of US officials at Shannon over and above the cost which would be incurred if the same inspection were carried out on arrival in the United States.</P>
      <P>The cost will be allocated amongst the participating airlines on a per passenger basis, each airline being charged a fixed amount in respect of each of their passengers and crew members subjected to preinspection. The cost per passenger cannot be calculated accurately at this stage as negotiations concerning the number of flights and passengers from each participating airline which will be preinspected have not yet been concluded.  Obviously, the more passengers that go through who are preinspected then the more cost effective the operation would be and the lower the cost per head.</P>
      <P>We can at least refer to what is happening in other countries.  On the basis of the cost of existing pre-clearance operations in Canada, the Bahamas and Bermuda it is considered that the cost to the airlines participating in a permanent preinspection arrrangement would be in the range of 50p to £1 per passenger.  The cost, of course, will not arise at all during the trial period when the only charge on the airlines in regard to preinspection will be the charge for overtime and Sunday working by US officials which the airlines would be obliged to pay, in any event, for inspections conducted in the United States on Sundays or outside official hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald and Senator Lanigan also mentioned the question of the permanent facilities that will be required at Shannon and the facilities required for the temporary inspection for the trial period.  A separate new building will not be required at present.  The facilities to <Col N="794" /> be provided in the trial period will consist of an inspection area equipped with an appropriate number of inspection booths for the INS officers, two associated interview rooms for secondary inspection purposes with appropriate office furniture, a sterile holding lounge of appropriate dimensions with seating and other passenger facilities including toilets of a style to be agreed between the INS and the airport authorities and adequate office space and associated facilities for supervisory and general INS staff usage.  These offices and facilities will be in accordance with the standards and practices normally applicable to office accommodation provided by the airport authority for other agencies at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta will be in a position to move very quickly to provide the necessary facilities as soon as the Bill is passed and an agreement is signed.  Additional facilities will have to be provided next year when we move into the permanent situation.  It is not possible with accuracy to give the actual cost for the facilities, that is there for the physical structures that I have outlined.  On this occasion it will not be very substantial in overall terms.  I should think that, if the permanent preinspection facilities are set up there, the cost will still work out at less than £250,000.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan questioned the quality of the INS officals and the necessity that good manners should be shown at all times to passengers passing through.  The INS are naturally anxious that the experiments be a success and the INS officials who will be carrying out preinspection will be very carefully selected.  I am sure that the Senator's fears in this respect, although very correctly expressed, will turn out to be groundless.  Naturally this is something that on an ongoing basis we hope will work out very well but, despite the reservation expressed by the Senator, overall the experience with INS operatives is pretty good.  I hope that the good nature and charm of the area in which they will be living will in due couse rub off on them, and they will go to work in good humour every day and that this will be reflected in the manner in which they <Col N="795" /> will handle their passengers going through.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan, Senator Lanigan and others asked whether it would be entirely United States citizens who would be employees.  A condition of employment of the INS immigration inspectors is that they must be citizens of the United States.  That is a condition, wherever they are operating, at home and in the other areas in which they are operating as well. Therefore, while there are no jobs available in that area as far as Irish citizens are concerned, there is no question of any Irish citizen being deprived of employment opportunities because they are coming here.  There is, as mentioned by Senator Howard and several other Senators, the obvious spin-off that will take place with the increased throughput of passengers and the flights that we hope this will bring to the Shannon area and the spin-off that will come in the duty-free zone and in all of the other areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made a passing reference to the extra landing costs.  There will be no extra landing costs for the planes as such.  The carriers can either use this facility or not use it.  If they use it there will be a cost on a per passenger basis in the permanent scheme.  It does not make it any more expensive for people to use Shannon who are not availing of this facility. In other words, it does not impinge on their costs there.</P>
    <P>As regard the question of security, all I can really do here is to assure Senator Lanigan, Senator Honan and the other Senators who mentioned this that the security matter will be very fully and thoroughly looked after.  I am afraid that I have to ask the House to take my word on this because it is not customary, and certainly would be inappropriate now or at any time, to give details of the existing security at Shannon or indeed of any planned future measures that might take place.  All I can do then is ask the House to accept my word on this, that naturally all of these things are investigated on an ongoing basis and any implications that this might have for security matters will also be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Senator Lanigan spoke about the detention facilities for persons who might be refused permission by the INS officers to travel onwards to the United States. When this happens, such persons are of course required to present themselves to Irish immigration authorities to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the aliens legislation.  Under the draft agreement air carriers participating in preinspection will be obliged to refuse carriage onwards to the United States to any person found ineligible by the INS to travel on a preinspected flight.</P>
    <P>They will also be responsible for returning any such person to his or her point of origin or country of nationality. In the event of such person being refused permission to land here under the Aliens (Amendment) Order of 1975 they might have to be held in an authorised place of detention should a suitable flight out of Ireland not be available immediately or quickly &mdash; this is the point that was mentioned by a number of Senators.  Whether such a person would be so detained or would be temporarily released would be a matter for decision by the Irish immigration authorities, and detention would be in an authorised place of detention such as a Garda station.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway dealt with the matter of applications for refugee status.  The situation under the Bill is no different from the position that exists on the ground at present.  There is a very well tried and very detailed system of operation when this happens.  When people seek asylum there is a procedure of consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees representative at London before the Minister for Justice makes a decision in such a case. The introduction of this Bill makes no difference as far as our general approach to people seeking refugee status is concerned. There is a very clear set of rules for treatment of such applications and these are followed and will continue to be followed.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway mentioned the question of additional locations.  Article 4 which deals with this is an enabling provision <Col N="797" /> which could enable preinspection to be conducted at additional locations in Ireland on the agreement of both sides. There are, however, no proposals at present to conduct preinspection except at Shannon and, given that it is a longstanding Government policy that all trans-Atlantic scheduled services must stop at Shannon in both directions, then Shannon is the logical location for the preinspection.  It was, however, felt that it would be desirable to provide in the agreement for the possibility that preinspection might be conducted at some airport other than Shannon not least to avoid the charge that preinspection was being granted to Shannon as an exclusive right to the detriment of other airports in the State.  It is an enabling provision. There are no proposals at present to conduct preinspection except at Shannon and, of course, we have the longstanding Government policy that transatlantic scheduled flights must stop at Shannon in both directions, so it is a logic allocation. The possibility is there however, and in dealing with legislation which will be on the Statute Book and perhaps may not come again before either House of the Oireachtas for ten or 20 years this is the proper approach in this particular case.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway said that Aer Lingus should be forced to use preinspection. Senator Howard and a number of other Senators drew attention to the fact that Aer Lingus did not appear to be overenthusiastic about this new introduction. It cannot be denied that Aer Lingus have reservations.  They will be sending some of their flights through inspection and they will be monitoring the position closely.  The Minister's general policy in this respect &mdash; I believe it is the right one &mdash; is not to give directions on such matters to the various State bodies.  The bodies must have freedom to act commercially as they judge fit.</P>
    <P>Why have Aer Lingus got reservations? The principal concern seems to be the possibility that preinspection will cause delay to flights with the resultant disruption of their schedules and as they operate with only three aircraft, as distinct from some of the other airlines, <Col N="798" /> it could be difficult to put these right quickly.  For this reason they have indicated that they do not intend to participate fully in the experimental period of preinspection.  As I have said, they will be putting a number of flights through and they have also indicated that they will monitor developments very carefully during the trial period and will review their position afterwards.</P>
    <P>I am confident when Aer Lingus see this in operation they will have a change of mind about it and realise that the competitive thing to do at the end of the trial period will be to go through preinspection. A number of people mentioned the fact that this was not the full canvas of the preinspection and that we do not have customs here.  It is a known fact also that the longest delay is caused by immigration officials rather than by customs, so that what we are giving here, even though it does not include customs in the particular agreement, is a very valuable amenity for travellers and carriers going to the United States.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked who will decide on whether the experiment has or has not been a success and whether it will continue.  This is covered in Article 12 of the draft agreement.  Both Governments must agree that the experiment has been a success and should continue.  It is a question of the consent of both Governments that it has been a success and should continue.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of immunity from prosecution, as Senator O'Leary explained, this is a very limited form of immunity dealing only with immunity while the INS staff are about their actual work.  As far as the immunity from civil and criminal prosecutions is concerned it only covers acts exclusively in the exercise of their duties as set out in the agreement and the Bill.  In all other respects as regards waiving immunity this would be subject to the law of the land.  It is possible also that the United States Government could, in the same manner as is possible in diplomatic immunity, to waive immunity, also to do so in this particular case.</P>
    <P>The duties of the INS officers do not <Col N="799" /> involve carrying arms.  We have an assurance that they will not be armed.  If an INS official was suspected of carrying a firearm he would be subject to the relevant Irish firearms legislation like anyone else and he could be prosecuted.  Assurances have been given by the INS that they do not intend that their officers should bear arms at Shannon.  They are not doing so under the agreements they have worked out as far as Canada, the Bahamas and Bermuda are concerned.  It has been asked, who could carry out an inspection on the inspectors to see if they are armed?  The fact remains that in the ordinary course of events they would be subject to our legislation just the same as anyone else might be and they would be subject to the firearms regulations and legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked that question was that there was an officer in Canada who was armed.  I simply ask if there is any protection for us as legislators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if there was an officer carrying a firearm in Canada then obviously it was not in accordance with the agreement worked out between the United States and Canada.  I have specific information here that the situation is that weapons are not carried by the officials in Canada, the Bahamas or Bermuda where agreements for preinspection have been worked out.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan asked if more gardaí would be needed.  It is not envisaged that the extra work of law enforcement will necessitate any extra staff to deal with matters arising from the preinspection operation at Shannon.  Incidents requiring law enforcement assistance are expected to be very few in number and they will be dealt with as part of the normal workload of the law enforcement officers concerned.  However, if such turned out to be necessary, naturally we would have to take cognisance of the fact and provide the necessary personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary dealt with section 2 which provides that the Minister shall be the competent authority in Ireland for <Col N="800" /> the purposes of the agreement and that he may by order appoint an appropriate person or body &mdash; it could be a corporate body, it could be an individual &mdash; to carry out certain specified functions of the competent authority.  It is proposed to delegate to Aer Rianta certain functions dealing with air carriers wishing to avail of the preinspection.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary asked what privileges will be granted under section 6 (5) of the Bill.  It is understood that the privileges which the US authorities are anxious to secure relate to taxation of INS salaries and to customs charges on household and personnel effects on transfer of residence. The privileges will be a matter for agreement by the two authorities. As regards the legislation under which it would be possible to give an income tax free situation as far as an American citizen working here is concerned, under the Irish-United States agreement for the avoidance of double taxation US officials stationed at Shannon under the agreement will be exempt from income tax in respect of remuneration paid to them by the US Government.</P>
    <P>On transfer of his normal residence to this country a US official could import his property without payment of import charges under the transfer of residence provisions provided such property had been owned and, in the case of</P>
    <P>(a)  durable goods, used in a country outside the EC by the person concerned at his or her former normal place of residence for at least six months before the date on which the importer ceases to have his or her normal residence outside the EC and</P>
    <P>(b)  had borne, either in the country of origin or in the country of departure, the customs or fiscal charges to which it is normally liable and which is not the subject, on the grounds of exportation, of any exemption or any refund of such charges.</P>
    <P>It is very strictly tied up there.  There is no double taxation and it really deals with household goods and other durables that might be coming in provided they <Col N="801" /> have been in the possession for a considerable period of the person who is seeking to have them imported.  There may be some other privileges sought by the United States but until further discussions take place we cannot say what they are.  As I have said, any privilege granted will be subject to agreement by us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reception given by Senators on all sides to this Bill.  It is another initiative for the Shannon area which has been a trail blazer in many respects in the past with very good resultant effects for its area and indeed for the country generally. I hope we are dealing here with a permanent arrangement.  There will be an experimental period of four months first but there is much confidence in it amongst the people who should know.  I will be very interested to see how it works.  It certainly has the goodwill of the Members of this House and I hope that it will live up to expectations.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his exposition on the privileges which it is proposed to give to the United States authorities in respect of their employees in the country.  The Minister said it is envisaged that these privileges will relate principally to the areas of income tax and customs examination on transfer of residence.  Is it the examination that will be exempt or is it just the duties that will be exempt?</P>

      <P>On that point also, I am concerned that the Minister has merely increased the level of fine in respect of section 19 (3) of the 1950 Act to £250. This is a very serious statutory offence, the breach of which should, on summary conviction, command a fine greater than £250.  This is the offence of a person being required by an authorised officer, acting under this section, to give his name and address and the person refusing to do so or giving a false or fictitious name and address.  The fine imposed for this offence should be of the level of £1,000 which is the normal upper limit in respect of <Col N="804" /> conviction in a court of summary jurisdiction.</P>

Obviously, they have hit a level which comes somewhere between the desires of Senator O'Leary and Senator Durcan and that must be fairly correct.</P>

That is an offence of a most serious nature when committed under the circumstances envisaged by section 19 (3) of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950.  I am disappointed that the level of fine for that kind of offence has not been increased to £1,000.</P>

      <P>My objection would not be to the increase to £250 or indeed beyond £250.  That is a substantial fine in that context.  If somebody assaults an authorised officer in the course of execution of his powers and duties he is liable to a fine of only £1,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months but, apparently is not liable to both.  That probably was the fashion in 1950 and we are now following that fashion.  It is a small penalty for a person who assaults an authorised officer in the course of his duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">

      <P>I do not want to pursue this point any further but section 50 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, increases the fine imposed for somebody who is apprehended by a fisheries officer and gives a false or misleading or fictitious address.  The maximum fine under that Act, which increases the level of fines imposed by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1962, is £500.  In 1980, the Oireachtas, in its wisdom at that time, decided that somebody who gives misleading information in relation to his identity to an authorised fisheries officer can be fined £500.  Six years later the fine, under the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1986, for a similar offence is half that which was imposed in 1980.  We have had a level of inflation since then.  Bearing that in mind it appears the Minister does not regard the type of offence created here as serious as was envisaged in 1980 in the context of the Fisheries Act.</P>

      <P>While I agree that giving an incorrect name to an authorised officer can lead to a very serious breach of the law in this case, I do not think one could directly compare an offence under this Act with that under the fisheries legislation. All of these levels of fines and punishments have been thought out very carefully by the various law officers involved as well as by the Departments concerned. These were thought to be the correct levels.  Usually we are blamed <Col N="806" /> for being overzealous in this respect.  I remember bringing a number of items from the Department of Communications through the other House &mdash; which might not have the sophisticated view of things that this House has &mdash; but on those occasions I was accused of being overzealous and seeking to introduce excessive penalties.  I think that perhaps we have got the level right here.  It is encouraging for me to hear some suggestion that perhaps they may be too high or too low.  That gives me renewed confidence in the fact that we may have just got the level correct.</P>

      <P>In his gracious reply the Minister gave us an assurance about the four months trial period, but I am still worried as to who will decide whether the project continues after the trial period in Shannon.  A Senator suggested earlier that if it were a success some bright boy might get the idea of moving it to Dublin. Senator O'Leary asked who were the &ldquo;body&rdquo;?  Would it be Aer Rianta or some other &ldquo;body&rdquo;?  Is it the Irish and American Governments or personnel of both Governments?  Who will decide that it will continue for a test period of four months commencing on a date to be agreed by both Governments?  Article III states:</P>
      <P>If both Governments notify each other by diplomatic note that they wish preinspection to continue it shall recommence at a date agreed by both Governments and shall continue for so long as this Agreement shall remain in force.</P>
      <P>Is there a weakness there?  I have been listening to the learned lawyers on the other side.  Is there a weakness there that someone could decide to opt out of Shannon after the four months, even if it were a complete and total success.  My esteemed friends are talking about fines but I am still concerned &mdash; and I have to voice my concern here &mdash; that somebody might decide to opt out of Shannon after the four month trial period whether it was a success or not.  What protection have the Government or the people of the region in such an event if this legislation goes through this House without ensuring that it cannot be moved out of Shannon?  I am worried that the agreement does not provide the guarantee that if successful it should continue in Shannon after the four month period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Senator Honan's difficulties and reservations but the fact is that all of this has to be done by agreement between the two Governments.  It is for the two Governments to decide as to whether the facility is terminated or otherwise.  It is only right to say that there is no such thing as an absolute guarantee. It might work like a dream with tremendous benefits but, for some other policy reason, one or other of the Governments might decide to opt out.  There is no definitive guarantee that it continues.  All we must do &mdash; and I think it is reasonable that we should do it &mdash; is accept the good faith of the US Government as we accept the good faith of our own Government in this case that there are benefits for them as well.  Otherwise they would not have negotiated the agreements they have with Canada, Bermuda or the Bahamas where it is operating very successfully now.  Obviously, it is in their interest also and they would not have gone this distance down the line unless they were hopeful that it would be a success.  Remember there is an installation cost, although not very significant. During the preinspection period the extra cost is not being imposed as far as the officers are concerned.  This will come into effect if we enter into a permanent arrangement.  The short answer is that there is no absolute guarantee.  It is a matter between the Governments.  Both Governments must accept before it can continue because either one or other would have an absolute veto in the situation and could have the agreement scrapped if they so wished.</P>
      <P>As regards transferring the same facility elsewhere, this is an enabling piece of legislation which would permit that. However, there are no other applicants other than Shannon at present.  I gave the reasons for the logicality of setting up this installation at Shannon.  It is likely that it would remain in that key position in future years because of the standard requirement by all Governments down the years that all transatlantic flights coming in and out of the country would stop at Shannon.</P>

Let me tell him that if he tried to move it out of Shannon that would be another day.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is happy about Article IX which states:</P>
      <P>United States citizens who are permanent employees of the Government of the United States, assigned to INS duties in Ireland under this Agreement shall not be amenable to the jurisdiction of the judicial or administrative authorities of Ireland in respect of acts performed by them in the exercise of their duty under this agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that came up earlier.  A very limited immunity is afforded here, strictly for the particular officers in the performance of their duty. There are reasons why they should seek to have that.  A good example is the possibility that someone who, at the preinspection stage at Shannon was refused entry to the United States, could possibly take an action against the officer for the loss of a contract or something of that nature.  This is the kind of thing they seek to have themselves safeguarded against. But remember that once they are off duty, once they are not involved in the carrying out of their duty, they are subject to the law of this State exactly like everyone else.  So far as Irish law is concerned INS officials are, in effect, designated persons under section 5 of the Bill, carrying out specified functions and subject to Irish law in every way like other residents except for immunities under section 6.  That section deals with their official or professional activities.  I gave you an example of one of the reasons for that.  There are a number of other reasons.  An example would be where they would be requested to give an explanation as to why they did not clear a person for entry to the US.</P>

      <P>On previous occasions on which I have had occasion to move early signature motions as Leader of the House I have indicated that I always do it with reluctance as I do now.  It is one of the functions of an Upper Chamber to exercise some sort of a watching brief for the Constitution. I have to say in this instance, as I said in every other instance, that I believe that the President, who is in a sense the Third House of the Oireachtas should not be abridged in the time available to him for consideration of legislation and the exercise of the very small discretion which the Constitution allows to him. Accordingly, as usual, I move this motion with reluctance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the Government have sought the concurrence of the Seanad is that, as the Minister of State has indicated, it is proposed to put this agreement into operation on 1 July.  In order to allow that to happen it is necessary that the President should sign the Bill.  It is also necessary that a ministerial order be made under section 3 of the Bill.  These things must all be done so that the experiment can start on 1 July.  I understand that it was due to the hogging of time by the Finance Bill in another place which led to the fact that this Bill was late <Col N="811" /> coming to us.  Having expressed regret about it, we have to face the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  These circumstances are that there is not the normal time available to the President for consideration of the Bill.

The Bill has a specific purpose, a very good purpose, on which we all agree. While the 1982 urban renewal legislation could be applied to many and different urban areas this Bill is related specifically to the Dublin area and to Waterford, Galway, Limerick and Cork.  Would it be more appropriate to have that inserted in the Bill by stating, for instance: &ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Urban Renewal (Custom House Docks and Designated Areas) Act, 1986&rdquo; or in some way to mention as well the cities of Waterford, Galway, Limerick and Cork?

      <P>Section 2 is interestingly referred to as the interpretation section. When I read the section first I had hoped it would be referred to as the definition section.  I raise that point because I am concerned at the interpretation which this Bill gives to the phrase &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;.  Section 2 of the Bill tells us that &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 6.  Section 6 of the Bill simply tells us that, first, the Custom House Docks area shall be a designated area for the purposes of the Bill, and, secondly, that an area which is affected by an order under section 6 (2) shall be a designated area.  Section 6 (2) simply states that the Minister may, for the purposes of the section, by order, declare an area to be a designated area where he is satisfied that there is a special need to promote urban renewal therein and may by such order describe such an area in whatever manner he thinks fit.  I would like to ask the Minister if he would agree with me that the interpretation section, so far as designated area is concerned, and section 6 (2) lead us nowhere.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (1) contains definitions in so far as they are necessary. The appropriate Minister is defined for the purpose of section 9 (3).  &ldquo;The authority&rdquo; means the Custom House Dock Development Authority.  &ldquo;The Board&rdquo; is defined as the Dublin Port and Docks Board for the purposes of section 13. &ldquo;The company&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of paragraph 1 of the definition of &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; in section 2.  Section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, defines &ldquo;company&rdquo; as a company formed and registered under the Act, or an existing company.  &ldquo;An existing company&rdquo; means a company formed and registered in the State under the earlier Companies Act. &ldquo;Development plan&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of section 12 (3).  &ldquo;Local authority&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of paragraph (c) of the definition of statutory body and for the purposes of sections 7, 10 and 20.  The Local Government Act, 1941, section 2 (2), defines local authority as a council of a county, a corporation of a county or other borough, a council of an urban district,.... commissioners of a town, and....  (b) a committee or joint committee or board or joint board, whether corporate or unincorporated, appointed by or under statute to perform the functions or any of the functions of any of the bodies mentioned, .... and (c) a committee or joint committee or board or joint board whether corporate or unincorporated other than a vocational educational committee or a committee of agriculture of or appointed by one or more of the bodies mentioned. &ldquo;Statutory body&rdquo; is defined for the purpose of section 9 (5).  Section 2 is a standard drafting provision under which &ldquo;performance of functions&rdquo; is defined to include the exercise of a power or duty. Section 1 includes powers and duties. Subsection (3) is the standard draft provision.</P>

      <P>I want to pursue the point I am making.  I have no difficulty at all <Col N="814" /> with section 6 (1) (a) which provides that the Custom House Docks area is a designated area.  We are talking about the interpretation of &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; in section 2.  Section 2 says that &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 6.  I have no difficulty with section 6 (1) (a) which provides one type of designated area.  The other type of designated area is that which the Bill attempts to define in section 6 (2).  It refers to an area which the Minister declares to be a designated area.  What is, therefore, a designated area?  I would say that this Bill, in section 2, in so far as it attempts to interpret &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; is totally misleading.  It leads us nowhere, because there is no interpretation of the term &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;.  There is no definition of the term &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;.  I do not think it is sufficient or fair of the parliamentary draftsman to allow the Minister to present to the Houses of the Oireachtas a Bill which does not give a precise definition and, which leads us on a roundabout which gets us nowhere.</P>
      <P>We all know, if we refer to section 6 (2), that there is a wish to promote urban renewal.  That exists in so far as every urban area is concerned.  My concern is that if one reads the interpretation section, which is section 2 and if one examines the phrase &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;, if one follows through to section 6, which is the direction one is given in section 2, one is led nowhere.  This Bill is defective in that there is no proper statutory interpretation available within the confines of this Bill of the phrase &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;. That is in so far as section 6 (1) (b) refers to such an area.</P>

      <P>The Minister may define them but the purpose of the Oireachtas is to introduce legislation which gives a little clarity to the law.  We are introducing extremely important legislation on which the recent Finance Act has some <Col N="815" /> bearing.  Yet there is no precise definition of what is a designated area.  It is not a matter for the Minister, at a future date, to sit in the Custom House and look out over the River Liffey and decide what will be a designated area.  We are here attempting to legislate.  We have before us, on Committee Stage of this Bill, an interpretation section.  One of the phrases we are trying to interpret is &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;.  This Bill is very defective in that there is no clear definition.  I have no worry at all about the Minister sitting in the Custom House and trying to define &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;.  I know that he will be there for a long time.  A long time may be a mere five or ten years.  Beyond that period there may be people sitting in the Custom House whose interpretation of &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; may be very different from the Minister's interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When I come to section 6 I will deal with that.  First of all, the designated areas were designated in the Finance Bill, as the House is probably aware.  The designation in this Bill is purely for the purposes of rate relief, and has not any financial implications.  In the Schedule to the Finance Bill the particular areas of designation were clearly defined, literally street by street.  From the point of view of financial provisions that is dealt with in the Finance Act.  It is the only way it can be dealt with.  When I come to section 6, I will outline the position more fully.</P>
      <P>There is nothing irregular about the legislation.  The legislation is normal legislation, given that it is encompassed in two pieces of legislation.  The financial arrangements have to be made in the Finance Bill.  That is where all the areas in the Schedule were properly designated, literally street by street, for the purposes of granting tax relief.  In the same areas rate relief will apply.  There is not any ambiguity with regard to the actual areas of designation within the law of the land.</P>

      <P>It seems that these sections are quite comprehensive regarding <Col N="816" /> interpretation and yet when we come to section 7 (3) there is a reference to &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;. I went back from that section to this interpretation section and I see that there is no definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  I would like to ask the Minister if he thinks it might be necessary to define the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  This is an important section. Is that definition sufficiently determined by statute so that it does not need a definition?</P>

      <P>I have one other point which relates to the definition or interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo;. Section 2 (1)(g) reads: &ldquo;a board or other body established by or under statute.&rdquo;  I think that is a pretty interesting and very embracing phrase.  The point I want to put to the Minister is this: does that phrase not, in fact, embrace as many of the other things which are specifically deemed to be statutory bodies within the meaning of this Act?  If that is so, as I believe it to be, there may be a certain amount of surplusage in the interpretation given by this Bill.  What prompted me to raise this, initially, was that on my first reading of the statutory body interpretation I felt that the regional fisheries boards should have been included.  I find they are not included.  I find they could be covered by (g).  If they are covered by (g), then is there not a lot of other surplusage, for instance, local authorities, harbour authorities and health boards, which could all be excluded to make the Bill slightly less bulky, though it is not a bulky Bill.  Bills should contain as little as possible.</P>

Basically we are in the draftsman's hands when it comes to framing this type of legislation.  His best advice is that it should be done in this way.  I accept what you are saying.  When one is dealing with <Col N="817" /> the parliamentary draftsmen, you have to take their legal expertise and legal advice in the interest of the longstanding tradition in law.</P>

Section 8(1) deals with orders concerning the establishment of a Customs House Dock development area.  Section 9 (3) deals with orders concerning assignment of functions to the authority in addition to those already assigned by section 9(1). Section 13(1) deals with orders transferring land owned by the Dublin Port and Docks Board to the Custom House dock development authority.  Section 22(1) deals with orders dissolving the authority.

      <P>This refers to designated areas.  These are already determined, as I understand it, in the Fourth <Col N="818" /> Schedule to the Finance Act.  The Minister also told us in his introductory speech that the areas proposed for designation have already been determined and are described in the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1986.  Therefore, it seems to me that we are talking about a specific area.  Would the Minister, for example, enlarge those areas or if that is not possible perhaps other areas could be declared to be designated areas for the purpose of this Bill?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister in relation to this section where we are dealing with areas which would be designated, other than the Custom House Docks area, where of course, there is a special and separate authority set up under the Bill, how he expects the local authority to respond in relation to the question of dealing with bringing about a degree of excellence in these areas above and beyond the manner to which the local authorities respond at this point in time?  I noticed recently in a statement by the Minister for the Environment that he will expect the local authorities &mdash; and I have particular interest in this in the Dublin Corporation &mdash; to mount an aggressive sales campaign in relation to designated areas in order to publicise a new package by whatever measures seem most appropriate.  The corporation will need to see themselves as a development broker bringing land <Col N="819" /> owners and development potential investors together, where necessary and doing everything they can to facilitate development and redevelopment proposals.  In short, it would be up to the corporation to show that they have the capacity to act as a development corporation to their area and to use the wide powers they have under the Planning and Development Act to promote and facilitate development. In the course of that speech quite a wide area was mentioned by the Minister all of which, of course, is very welcome.  It is very much of an initiative for these areas as distinct from the authority set up for the Custom House Docks area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to indicate that he intended to ask the corporation in Dublin in relation to designated areas to appoint a suitable senior officer to act as a development co-ordinator in order to review their development plan so as to ensure that the development planning was not inhibiting or inflexible or containing out of date provisions and to make land owned by derelict or vacant sites available on reasonable terms, to initiate a crash programme in these development areas leading towards interim improvements of derelict sites, many of which have a very disfiguring effect on the city, and then to get on to use their compulsory purchase powers, where necessary, to ensure that sites of suitable size and shape are available.  More interestingly, it deals with special attention to street cleansing and refuse collection in the designated areas, the handling of unsightly advertising or other material on hoardings and the initiatiation of programmes to affect environmental improvement in designated areas by creating small landscaped areas in vacant lots and the carrying out of tree-planting.  It deals with ensuring that footpaths, roadways and public lighting are maintained to a good standard. Special attention is directed towards developing and implementing pedestrianisation schemes where appropriate.  Of course these schemes have advanced recently.  It deals with reviewing the <Col N="820" /> approach to street furniture and generally to ensuring that their own housekeeping in the areas is greatly improved.</P>
    <P>This section does not go into as much detail in relation to designated areas as it does in regard to setting up the very new authority for the Custom House Docks area.  Given the performance of Dublin Corporation or of other local authorities in this area how does the Minister expect the corporation to be able to act in this area of development co-ordination? Does he see them getting involved in attracting personnel from outside the corporation who might bring a new breadth of vision and interest to the activities of the corporation.  How do they visualise the very exciting proposals, contained in this statement that I mentioned, being implemented?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in designating all of these areas we did have consultation with all of the local authorities. Indeed, it was on their suggestions that we took on board all of the areas that are there, after full consultations with officials.  The local authorities were very keen.  I would have to compliment most of them for the progressive way in which they initially were very keen on the ideas and are taking them on board and moving in the direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we issued a directive and a statement to the corporation of what we wanted done was that first of all the appointment of a development officer was important.  Somebody who is responsible for moving and getting all of this development into place is important.  If we leave it to the various Departments, as can happen, nothing will happen because there will be a breakdown in communications and disagreement as to who is ultimately responsible for carrying it through.  That was the reason for the need for a development officer who would inform the corporation that they have a responsibility in these areas in regard to site assembly, helping compulsory purchase orders and where they have land themselves information that they would either develop the land themselves or dispose of it at a reasonable price to allow of good <Col N="821" /> development.  We have indicated quite clearly that what is required in all of these areas is high standard development.  A high standard of development is necessary if we are to improve the image of the particular area of dereliction.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is the matter of derelict sites for which local authorities as well as private individuals have a responsibility.  We will be bringing for ward legislation before the year is out to have something done about the eradication of derelict sites in order to ensure that people just cannot sit on them for whatever reason they want for years and years.  They must be brought forward, or if there are problems at least the sites and the surroundings of them must be brought up to a high environmental standard, so that we will not have this willy-nilly dereliction.</P>
    <P>Street cleaning leaves a lot to be desired.  There is a very low standard.  I am glad we were able to announce today a package of £10 million for the Dublin city centre.  It is designed to allow for the improvement of the areas of main shopping streets and getting a commissioner in there to take it on board and to reach a standard.  After three years it would be expected that he would hand it back to the local authority at a very high standard.  There are standards there to be reached.  We have not got standards. There is no level at which to draw a line.  That is why we have continuous dereliction and the downward trend within our cities.  There is not a standard there.  By doing what we are doing in the new Bill we are bringing before this House and the other House shortly that such standards are what we want to achieve. The local authorities have the responsibility for these areas.  They have an obligation to initiate schemes and to encourage developers.  They will be advertising.  We are in the process now of publishing a book on all of these things and the reasons for them and the values in them.  Local authorities will get these books and they will be widely circualted. We hear complaints if we take powers from local authorities.  We get bad publicity about it.  We are not in this case doing <Col N="822" /> it.  We are giving them a lot more responsibility.  What we are saying and what we did say in our correspondence &mdash; and I have been in correspondence with the managers &mdash; is that they have got a job to do now and they must get out and do it efficiently, effectively and well.  We are telling them they have the tools.  I have no doubt that in some local authority and county borough areas things will be happening very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome every word and portion of the statement of the Minister in relation to designated areas. It will be a great step forward if only we can get the kind of response from the county boroughs as the Minister appears to believe he will get.  The Minister and I were elected in the same electoral area in 1974.  Shortly afterwards the then Government played a backroom role in relation to ensuring that something was done about inner city housing renewal. Of course, over the decade and more that has passed since there has been a great renewal of that kind in the centre of Dublin.  It was brought about more than anything by the decision that was taken accurately at the time against the wishes of the then city manager to appoint a housing co-ordinator responsible for the programme in the centre of the city which was the programme of inner housing renewal.  Although he had a wider brief of responsibility for housing generally in the city and county he took particular interest in getting on with the rebuilding of sites that had lain dormant and very inactive although intentions on compul sory purchase orders were in the back ground for decades earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The status of this housing co-ordinator was Assistant City Manager.  We were particularly fortunate in the individual, Mr. Molloy, who took over that role in the mid-1970s.  I just wonder whether or not the high standard that the Minister talks about &mdash; and I would like to see that happen &mdash; will be sufficiently demonstrated if we do not get the right calibre of official responsible for these designated areas and for the whole new approach that the Minister envisages.  It would be <Col N="823" /> unsatisfactory if that individual is not given in the Dublin context and the scale of the designated areas involved here a status of that kind, because the role he will have to play will run from one department of the corporation to another.  Within the operation of the county borough development will have an immensely important effect on designated areas but only if the status of the officer responsible for them means that he is right up at the city manager's table and is able to negotiate with his fellow assistant city managers on matters of detail.  Funding will have to back up that detail.  I would hope that in the appointment of the individual concerned as senior officer, perhaps the Minister might consider creating an assistant city manager position which would have a role of much greater strength within the office of the county borough to ensure that this question of designation is given the status it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The managers have been requested to appoint officers in all the areas.  A number of them have done it.  It is my clear understanding that the person who will be appointed will have full power at management meetings.  In Dublin I have no doubt it will be an assistant city manager or a deputy city manager who will be appointed, giving him obviously and all the other managers seats at the same table.  It is important that that happens.  In other areas the same type of appointments are being made.  People of the highest calibre within local authorities are looking after this.  Some of them are moving rapidly forward at the moment despite the fact that the Bill has not yet been passed.</P>

      <P>Everybody would welcome the legislation which the Minister talks about for dealing with derelict sites provided it is sensitive.  Also, I would welcome the guidelines regarding design provided that these are wide enough in scope not to inhibit creativity.  With regard to the Minister's reply to my earlier question about designated areas I <Col N="824" /> understand the position to be that the Minister has the power by order to enlarge these areas or to declare other areas designated areas but these areas would not then have all the financial benefits that accrue to these particular ones.  In that situation I would say to the Minister that there is no point in having this power because it would be quite ineffective.  I would like to ask him if there is any way that financial benefit of the order given in this Bill could be allocated to other areas if he wanted to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way that could be done is by bringing in an amendment to the Finance Act.  As I indicated, we have a right to make other designated areas but only with the rate relief involved and no other financial provisions.  An amendment to the Finance Bill would be required if we felt that tax breaks were needed if we decided on another area. That is not envisaged as of now.  I want to make that quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the last remarks of Senator FitzGerald and the Minister's response with particular interest. It seems that if we are to promote urban renewal we can do so by a Bill of this nature in one sense.  We cannot do so in an absolute sense unless we encourage people back to live in the city centre.  For that reason I agree with and support the remarks made by Senator FitzGerald in so far as he spoke in that direction.  I do not think we can do that unless there is a firm indication by Government that there is a willingness to introduce the necessary aids to encourage people and to make it attractive for them to live in the city centre.  By that I refer in particular to the whole direction of housing policy at the moment whereby people have made available to them very substantial grants to build new houses.  People living in local authority houses are now encouraged to give up those houses and to buy or build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not the same encouragement to people to come and buy and live in the city centre.  That applies not only in <Col N="825" /> Dublin but in the urban cores of all our towns throughout the country.  There is a disincentive in relation to the grant levels despite the new house improvement grants.  There is a very substantial disincentive in so far as stamp duty is concerned in that there can be a very substantial burden placed on somebody who wishes to live in the city centre because when he acquires a building he is faced with a very heavy stamp duty charge which would not otherwise be payable. If we are to remove from city centres the problems of crime and vandalism which we have at the moment, essentially we can only do that if we bring people back to live in the city centres, to act as a constant vigilant police force there. That is the big problem with Dublin city centre at the moment.  I say this as a rural person, as somebody who comes from the other side of this country but who can remember, not too many years ago, coming to Dublin on visits and being able to walk with a feeling of safety around the centre city streets.  One could do that because people were living there.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this Bill, of itself, will get people back living in the city centre.  I do not think, of itself, it will renew the city centre unless the other steps are taken by Government to encourage people to live there.  By that I mean special provisions in relation to the abolition of stamp duty on people who acquire dwellings in designated areas and further housing grants for people who attempt to create a dwelling within the city centres.  I do not believe urban areas will be renewed if people are kept out of there.  Cities like Dublin and other urban centres were built and designated for people to live in.  It seems that this Bill on its own will not encourage people back to live in the city centre.  I would like to get from the Minister an assurance that the other necessary steps will be taken to encourage people to live in the city centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Durcan in this.  That is the whole thrust of what we are doing here.  With regard to the incentives, what <Col N="826" /> we are actually doing is that as well as all the incentives that are available for people purchasing houses today, such as mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers or the mortgage subsidy, if they are building a home within this area they get a 50 per cent write-off of that dwelling over ten years.  If they refurbish it they can write off 50 per cent of the refurbishment over ten years, as well as all the other breaks that they get.  That is a fairly substantial incentive for people who are contemplating living in the city.  No piece of legislation will in itself encourage people to come in.  Many other things would have to be done.  The indication to the corporation the desire to improve the environment and clean the streets and improve the general attitude towards the environment within the inner city had as its purpose to make it more attractive environmentally for people to come and either work or live there.  The incentive of 50 per cent over ten years is a reasonable additional incentive.  Unlike the section 23 provision by which the owner gets the concession, when he rents the property he can write the rent off.  This is for the end user, the tenant.  It is purposely designed to give residents the benefit for residing in the particular areas of the city.</P>
      <P>The Bill published today will also have this effect because it will uplift considerably the main spine of our city, running from Grafton Street right across to the foot of Parnell Square and all of the smaller streets intervening.  This will be uplifted to a very high standard and make our city more attractive.  People will get to know it a little better and will possibly then want to reside in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would hope to have, after consultations with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, a different type of law enforcement &mdash; the same Garda Síochána but possibly differently structured in the areas we talked about today.  All of that will tend to make people aware of the city and encourage them to decide to live there.  The only way we can do it is by making the city more attractive.  The local authority have a role to play.  Central Government in the tax breaks and indeed in what we have introduced today will <Col N="827" /> also, have as much, if not more, impact in helping to improve the overall standard of our city and other cities as well.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the breaks we are giving for housing particularly are pitched about right.  You can always ask why we did not give 100 per cent but you cannot give too much away: you have to strike a balance.  Someone building a house gets £2,000 new house grant plus £3,000 mortgage subsidy plus the 50 per cent write-off for the cost of the building over ten years plus &mdash; if they are borrowing the money &mdash; interest relief on the mortgage. All of that makes it very attractive for someone to consider residing in the city. I hope it is sufficiently attractive because the problem is something that has worried me.  The corporation have done a great job with regard to housing people in the inner city.  It has been a lopsided social development and what we want is a good social mix.  I hope this Bill will bring about the kind of social mix which is needed in villages, towns and cities.  We must have all strands of society getting to know each other and in trying to achieve that we have got the right balance and it is now only a question of time.  These benefits apply for three years so things will have to happen quickly if people want to benefit.  We should see movement in the next six months and we will then be able to see in what direction it is moving. One hopes it will work and it will not be for want of effort by my Department or myself if this is unsuccessful.  It is a new approach which is long overdue in regard to all our cities and it will be a landmark in the campaign to make inner cities more attractive for people to live in.</P>

      <P>I welcome the extension of this scheme to Waterford and I thank the Minister and Minister of State for all that they have done to expedite the extension of the scheme to Waterford because when the scheme was announced for Dublin, Cork and Limerick and Waterford found itself in the unenviable position of being the one borough council omitted from the scheme there was consternation, to put it mildly, at local level. <Col N="828" /> The corporation of which I am a member since the last local election and the chamber of commerce and all the various bodies within the city quickly got together and took concerted action in order to draw the attention of the Minister and the Department to the fact that Waterford had &mdash; by accident, I hope &mdash; been omitted from the scheme and fairly speedily the Minister and the Department conceded that the scheme should be extended to Waterford and also to Galway which was then designated a borough council.  So, all five borough councils now have designated areas.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his visit to Waterford, hot on the heels of a visit from Minister John Boland who visited us very shortly after he took office to announce that the scheme would be extended to Waterford.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, then came and told us the details of the designated area. The scheme has been very warmly received in Waterford.  I understand that there has been a great number of inquiries to the City Hall and to the planning department and one hopes that very soon evidence of this interest will be seen in a tangible, practicable form when some rejuvenation and revitalisation of Waterford becomes apparent to the casual observer.  In the designated area which was outlined by Minister Fergus O'Brien on his visit it is quite obvious that the city had become derelict and run down and that some sort of fire-brigade action was needed to bring it up to scratch.  There were huge gaps and derelict sites and an all-pervading air of decay &mdash; that would be the kindest way to describe it &mdash; in the area.  Certainly, the incentives contained in the package must make it attractive to developers to get cracking and bring about the necessary change in the area. I would not like this Bill to go through the Seanad without voicing my appreciation of the fact that the scheme has been extended to Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to concur with what Senator Durcan has said about additional incentives required for people who decide to live in the inner city and to refurbish old houses.  I take the Minister's <Col N="829" /> point about the necessity and desirability of having a good social mix.  That is certainly significant and makes for better communities.  I have noticed in Waterford a tremendous surge of interest in the local authority building in the inner city and a tremendous wish on the part of many families who now live in local authority estates on the outskirts of the city to come back into town where they will not have transportation costs and where they will be near facilities.  It will facilitate people who were brought up in the inner city of Waterford and who perforce have had to live outside it in the estates on the periphery.</P>
    <P>By and large Waterford has an excellent scheme for building local authority houses within the inner city but the refurbishing of houses by private individuals requires greater State underpinning.  I know of cases where people feel a little hard done by.  By choice, they would like to refurbish an old house within the inner city area and they do not get the same grants and incentives they would get if they decided to build a new house on the periphery of the city.  I know people who have had to take second choice in the matter of housing because they have not been able to avail of incentives and grants to do what they wanted in the inner city. This is a pity because there is no point in talking about the desirability of a social mix if we do not make it easier for people to achieve it and live in the inner city.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan referred to the problems of vandalism and crime which flow from a depopulated and under-populated inner city area and the same applies in Waterford as other centres.  We should do all in our power to encourage the social mix and greater population in inner city areas and in order to do that we need to do so much more than just express that as an ideal.  We need to put in the financial incentives which make that desirable.  A person who wishes to refurbish an old house encounters greater financial difficulty than if he decided to build elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome this scheme and I know I speak for many people in the Waterford area who were pleased to have <Col N="830" /> a positive response from the Minister and his Department in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the announcement today in relation to the central trading area and the £10 million package that is to be available towards uplifting that area.  I understand that a Bill on this matter is likely to come before the House before the summer recess.  I referred earlier to the status of the officer responsible for the designated areas in the county borough and I was very encouraged to hear from the Minister that somebody of the status of assistant city manager will be responsible.  He said earlier that he expected a high standard of local authority action in these areas in enticing others to come in and build, improve, rehabilitate and generally to bring accommodation in these areas which are generally run-down up to a new level.  It is very important that these areas should be identifiable as compared with the rest of the city and all the various areas that were mentioned to the Minister, park developments, pavements, and so on will have to be uplifted.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage funding being available towards getting ahead with some of this work in some parts of the designated areas in advance of others?  It will be important for the local authority to show very early its real grasp of the enormity of this task by doing some of the initial remedial work that could be done to attract development, in other words, to demonstrate that this is not going to be dealt with in the manner local authorities have dealt with the surrounding areas of new development in the past but that it would be marked by a change of approach and the high standards the Minister mentioned.  I wonder to what extent Dublin Corporation will be funded to get on with this work early.  It is important that it be done early.  The encouragement that would give to good development would be enormous and I think it will be necessary to ensure the success of these designated areas.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Bulbulia for her kind remarks about including Waterford: we were delighted to do that.  With regard to refurbishing a house it has the same tax break as if one were building a new house.  You can write 50 per cent of the refurbishment off over ten years plus any of the other benefits that may accrue.  There is that incentive.  If people like an old house they can refurbish it and write off 50 per cent of the cost of so doing over ten years.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald seems to have a little niggle in his mind about the quality or the type of planning the local authority might bring forward.  It is the job of the planning authority to ensure that a high standard be developed as we have asked. Ultimately, the independent local authority will make these decisions.  If we did not want it that way we should have appointed a separate commission to do the job.  On balance, with regard to the areas of designation, I think we are better to leave them in the hands of the local authorities because they are more capable of doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the streets commission we talked about today for which money is being made available, there are no grants or tax breaks in that area but there are such in the designated area.  There is a limit to what one can do in all of this and, again, it is a question of getting the balance right.  The tax breaks in the designated areas are right.  It is important to mention them again.  Outside Dublin there is a 100 per cent write off on commercial buildings, and a ten-year tax relief for the end user which is the most important benefit of all because if you are going to build you must get people to use.  If there is a good attraction for the end user the whole scheme will be a success. The attraction for the end user here is a double rent write off.  This in effect means that people who are in business to make a profit can write double rental off which means that they have rent free premises for ten years plus a ten year rate relief.  This is a tremendous attraction for people contemplating moving into an area.  That will be the incentive that will sell this package.  That is the financial <Col N="832" /> incentive that is going into the designated area.</P>
    <P>As I indicated quite clearly, the local authority have a role to play here to ensure that the environment is right.  It has been their responsibility always to have the environment right.  It may have slipped from their grasp over the years but it does not mean that they have to be absolved from the responsibility now.  We are setting in place the areas with the kind of tax incentives to make it attractive and the least a local authority should do for their own area is to make it as attractive as possible and create the right environment for people.  We are not talking about large sums of money when we are talking about that kind of treatment. To totally spoonfeed local authorities and let them bask in all the benefits that come in is not I think the kind of climate that would create the kind of developments we want.  The local authorities are charged with a responsibility to move forward and get these areas developed rapidly.  I believe they will do that.  I believe the personnel they will appoint will be of an adequate standard.  We have all stressed &mdash; and I believe that forward planners in the corporation feel the same way &mdash; that we want to see in these areas buildings of high quality.  If we do that we will further increase development in the surrounding areas because once an area becomes popular people want to locate in or about that area.</P>
    <P>What we are doing will be the catalyst encouraging development in other areas and in particular north of the river.  That is an area that has been neglected for far too long.  In the period 1960 to 1984 only 15 per cent of the office development has been located north of the river.  Ten per cent of that was in one area by one particular company.  Little or nothing has happened on that side of the city and it is imperative that something does happen. The development of the port and docks area, which is not the designated area we are talking about, should have a tremendous effect in encouraging people to locate north of the river.  As a result of this you will see a tremendous renewal in <Col N="833" /> the next ten or 15 years in an area of the city that has lain dormant and derelict for far too long.</P>

      <P>I have been teasing this out because I have been aware of the considerable work done by the city planning department in recent years as regards studies of areas of the city in which environmental improvements and uplifting were necessary.  Bound books have been produced on what should be done with these areas.  The difficulty has been that funding is not normally available to the planning department. The city planning department is not a spending department and for that reason not enough action has taken place at local level.  I hope that the city council can be useful in this area by way of the estimates next year.  However, I am very concerned that the funding will be available for the start that will be necessary to encourage developers to get involved in these designated areas in advance of some work on the ground, showing the standard of urban renewal that the corporation will for their part undertake.  It is important from a timing point of view that the corporation be seen to come in first to make some kind of a mark on the area and to give an indication of what can be expected from them.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to sit again at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow and the proposal is that we should continue in the morning with the Committee Stage and hopefully the remaining Stages of this Urban Renewal Bill to be followed then by the Second Stage of the Harbours Bill. In the afternoon we would hope to take up the Companies (Amendment) Bill and the Air Pollution Bill coupled with the report of the joint committee on acid rain.  Any other time available in either the morning or the evening would be devoted to the resumption of the Second Stage of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill.</P>
