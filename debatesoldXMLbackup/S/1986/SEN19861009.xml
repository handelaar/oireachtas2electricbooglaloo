      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State for the Arts to consider reversing the decision to introduce admission charges for the Treasury Gallery in the National Museum.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the adjournment and it will be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, as you know, I raised the issue of debating the crisis in the public finances but was ruled out of order. As there appears to be no procedure which works in the matter of <Col N="314" /> debating in this House emergency issues of this sort I wonder if the Leader of the House would consider giving Government time &mdash; something which I am sure would have the support of other parties in this House &mdash; for debating the crisis which exists day in and day out and is becoming worse so far as the public finances are concerned?</P>

      <P>With regard to the request which has been made by Senator Ross that Government time should be given to the discussion of public finances I have two remarks to make. First, he said there seems to be no way of raising this question. I would like to point out that the Independent group had the choice of topic for discussion in Private Members' Time during the past two weeks. It was perfectly open to them to choose that subject. They did not choose that particular subject. Secondly, there is a large amount of Government legislation before us. I do not see any reason whatsoever for that legislation being delayed in order to have a debate on the public finances. I fail to be persuaded that a debate in this House would improve the public finances. I say that particularly when I remember that Senator Ross recalled this House from its recess in order to debate the public finances on a former occasion having put the country to the expense this involves.</P>

    <Title>Status of Children Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the memory of Senators the occasion of the discussion in this House of the proposal which has still not been passed into law for the abolition of the death penalty. The then Senator John A. Murphy rose and read the first sentence of the Bill which was to the affect that no law shall be enacted by the State to take a person's life. He said it was a magnificent occasion to be present in the House for such an event. I am in that position today. What a magnificent occasion it is to be present in the House to have the opportunity of contributing to a discussion on legislation, the purpose of which is to abolish all the discriminations and all the legal disabilities which attach to the innocent victims, to children whose status in law up to this was one of illegitimacy.</P>
      <P>The Government are to be congratulated &mdash; and it is not too often I congratulate them on anything because I do not think that is a function of a Senator &mdash; and the Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, is to be congratulated on her significant contribution to ensuring that this dramatic piece of legislation will take its place on the Statute Book prior to the ending of this term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the elimination of the discriminations to which I referred are obvious and are shared by all those in this <Col N="316" /> House, whether they be of a conservative nature or of a liberal nature or if, like myself, they are hovering somewhere in between. However, we heard in the debate yesterday, and particularly in the very sensible and good contribution from Senator Conway, that sometimes people's emotions about this matter run away with them. They pretend that a law can be enacted which will change the reality as it is on the ground. Irrespective of whether one calls something illegitimacy, as long as marriage is an institution which is recognised by the law of the country, or even more important, recognised by the custom of the people, there will be an inevitable difference in terms of social opportunity and social status in respect of those children who are fortunate enough to be born of such a union and those who are not. Nothing we can do here can change that. It would be a ridiculous objective to set ourselves to abolish illegitimacy because the only way illegitimacy can be abolished is to abolish marriage itself. That is not our job. Our job is to abolish all legal disabilities and discriminations against the child.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should recognise that the object of this legislation is the child, not the parents. When people speak about the thorny problem of the guardianship of the children in cases of non-marital unions and get hot under the collar about the fact that automatic guardianship is not being given to the father, what they are saying in effect is that in some way there is a right which would attach to the father which is not being dealt with in this legislation. I am in favour of giving all and every right as is appropriate to both parents, but only in so far as it is consistent with the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>The object of this legislation must be to abolish the legal disabilities and discriminations against the child who is the innocent victim of the parents' decision to have a child or their carelessness in having a child, depending on the circumstances of the birth. The object of our attention must always be the best interests of the child. It does not concern <Col N="317" /> me if the rights of either or both of the parents are less than perfect if that is necessary in the interests of the child. If one views the controversy which has arisen concerning the question of guardianship on that basis one will see that the automatic extension of guardianship to the father may not be in the interests of the child. Unless I were satisfied that it was in the interests of the child I would not support it. The present proposal is correct for that reason.</P>
    <P>The present position with regard to guardianship is that the guardianship of a child born outside wedlock rests exclusively with the mother and the proposal in this legislation is that the position of the mother as guardian of the child should be retained but that a new provision should be inserted whereby the father of the child could, on application, become its joint guardian. That situation would come about if there was the consent of the mother or, in the alternative, if the father was registered under the appropriate provisions as the parent of the child. The alternative which is being promoted by those people who say that this Bill does not abolish illegitimacy is that there should be automatic guardianship in such cases for both father and mother. This may work well where there is a stable relationship and we know there are quite a number of stable relationships around. But the majority of children born outside wedlock are born in a situation where the very last thing the father wants to do is to recognise his fatherhood.</P>
    <P>If we were to give automatic joint guardianship as a matter of law, we would in effect, be saying that the father would be guardian of the child even where the father was denying his parenthood. It is a most extraordinary proposition that we should grant to the fathers of children who have denied that they are fathers an automatic right to be their guardian. Is that in the interests of the child? It is in the interests of the child that he or she should have, if possible, two guardians. I do not think it is in the interests of the child that it should be left in a legal limbo with its mother having one set of rights as guardian and some protesting father, <Col N="318" /> known or unknown, in some mysterious way having guardianship of a child, the existence of and the connection with which he denies. That is a misplaced attempt to re-write the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>The proposal outlined in the Bill, provides that a father can for the first time become a joint guardian of such a child in the special circumstances where the mother consents or, alternatively where for one reason or another, either as a result of agreement between the parents or as a result of a decision of the court, the father is registered as the father of the child. It should be pointed out that even in circumstances where the mother denies the parenthood of a father, action can now be taken by him to show that he is the father. Therefore, as a result of that action he will be in a position to be appointed guardian of the child and to exercise the responsibilities that rest with such a person. For that reason the first of the matters I wanted to deal with, the question of guardianship, is well dealt with in the Bill. The alternative proposals which have been put forward by some people, including the members of Young Fine Gael who have been in the forefront of the fight to abolish the stigma which attach to the status of illegitimacy, and their insistence on an amendment to the law, are misplaced. However, it is right that I should put on record, for the benefit of this House, that the members of this organisation have played a significant part in changing and bringing public opinion to a stage where the central theme of this legislation is no longer a matter of controversy. It is merely the details that are at present under discussion in this House and in the country at large and will be discussed in the other House in due course. That is not to underplay the significant part played by other organisations, including other political organisations, in this process, but I am conscious of the significant part played by the members of Young Fine Gael, and it is right that their input in this area be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The area which it is anticipated by those who are in the know that will <Col N="319" /> present the greatest difficulty in this Bill is the area of property rights. It appears that ultimately everything in Ireland goes back to property rights. We are always worried or appear to be worried about the impact of our social legislation on property rights. Leaving aside for the moment the actual details contained in the Bill, we should try to establish what principle we consider appropriate in these matters. If we consider as an appropriate principle &mdash; and I do &mdash; that there should be some opportunity for parents to pass on some of their savings by way of property to their children, do we accept the proposition that the responsibility which exists towards children in that context extends to whether a child is a child of a marriage union or not? Leaving aside the details contained in Part V of the Bill, this really is the central question to be addressed. For the life of me I cannot see how I, if I was a father of a non-marital child, could distinguish between my responsibility in respect of that child and its future and my responsibility in respect of the children who were the product of my marriage. To suggest that in some way the father of a non-marital child has less of a responsibility or should have less concern for the rights, the property rights or any other rights or the wellbeing of his non-marital children as compared with his marital children is not only to discriminate against non-marital children but it is to fly in the face of the equality of treatment under the law to which all citizens are entitled. If we establish as a general principle that our law should be framed in such a way as to ensure that non-marital children are treated in the same way as marital children, then it is only a matter of parliamentary draftsmanship beyond that as to how we achieve that object.</P>
    <P>A source of considerable regret to me is that the current interpretation of section 117 of the Succession Act appears to be that the definition of a child contained therein does not include what has up to now been an illegitimate child. I have not got that Act here with me, but under that section it is right of any <Col N="320" /> child who has not been properly provided for in the will of his or her parent to make an application to the court, and the court, using the criteria of what a just and prudent parent would do &mdash; some expression like that &mdash; will decide what the just and proper provision should have been. It has always been my view that the better interpretation of the section would have been that it applies to all children, but I recognise that a clarification and a restatement of the law is necessary in this regard particularly in view of a judgment in 1985 which is reported in the <i>Irish Law Monthly Reports</i> and which is referred to in the excellent explanatory memorandum which went with this Bill. The case which requires this House to address this problem is &ldquo;In the goods of William Walker, Deceased; Florence O'Brien <i>versus</i> M.S. and the Attorney General&rdquo; which is reported in the <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly,</i> 1985, page 86. That and other cases taken together seem to indicate clearly that this change in the law and clarification of the law in this area are necessary.</P>
    <P>Before getting too excited about what the property rights of non-marital children are it is well that we would establish what are the rights of children at all. Indeed, the rights of children on succession are minimal. Basically if a person is so careless as not to make a will, then ultimately that person's property will pass to his or her children. A proportion of it may go in the intervening period to the spouse, but if the spouse adopted the same attitude, then ultimately all property in the case of a person who does not make a will will pass to the children. There is no big deal in that because anybody with significant property to transfer these days will make a will, but while the spouse has, under the Succession Act quite legitimately so, a right to a portion of the estate &mdash; probably a right to too small a portion of the estate &mdash; and can insist on that right, the children have no such right. If I rear my children, educate them and set them up reasonably well in life and was fortunate enough &mdash; which I am not &mdash; to have a substantial amount of money to leave, there is absolutely no <Col N="321" /> obligation on me to leave it to my children, and there is no doubt that in those circumstances any application by my children under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965 would not succeed. If I looked after my children, educated them and gave them a good start in life there is no doubt that the court would say that I had fulfilled my duty as a prudent and just parent. In point of fact the succession rights of a child when a person decides to leave the property to somebody else are minimal indeed. Therefore, when we say that we are going to include in this equation non-marital children we are saying effectively that we are going to treat them the same way, but as the treatment is very scant anyway all we are offering them is a percentage of very little indeed.</P>
    <P>Scare stories are the stuff of which objections to social legislation are made. Stories of farms of land being snatched from parents by illegitimate children popping up all over the place and putting in late claims for the estate have nothing to do with reality. Any sensible person will, of course, have made a will. Even where a sensible person has not made a will it will be an issue only where the status of the non-marital child is such that the proven parent would have been under an obligation to make provision for that child. The number of occasions in rural Ireland where the Succession Act has meant that the garda or the parish priest or the civil servant living in Dublin has mysteriously and in the dead of night got a share of a farm over the head of the fellow who has stayed at home for 25 years are few. It just does not happen in practice.</P>
    <P>It happens sometimes because that is the way the family want it, but if the father or mother, whoever the surviving spouse is, determines to leave the family home and the family farm to the person who remained at home, it works out like that. That is what happens. It would happen exactly the same way whether the person is a garda, a civil servant living in Dublin, or in the category previously known as legitimate or illegitimate. It will not make any difference. <Col N="322" /> Therefore to scare people into thinking that their present freedom to dispose of their estate is in some way being diminished by this legislation is to put an interpretation on it which, in my opinion, is not correct.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Senator Durcan for drawing my attention to one point during the course of a very pleasant meal we had yesterday evening and it is well that it be put on the record of the House so that the position could be emphasised to the Minister, who could consider it before Committee Stage. Section 32 (2) of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>Where, on the application by the spouse or any child of an intestate in a case to which this section applies, the court is of opinion that the spouse or any such child, as the case may be, has made a contribution of a substantial nature to the accumulation of the intestate's estate and that injustice would be caused by the application of the rules for distribution on intestacy contained in the Act ... the court shall...</P>
    <P>make such provision as it thinks is just in the circumstances. That means that where a person has not made a will, and where because of the rules on intestacy &mdash; leaving aside the interests of the other spouse for the moment &mdash; the property will be divided equally between the remaining children, an application could be made for example, by the fellow who stayed at home that he had built up the farm and was entitled to a greater share. That is a very good, wise, sensible and fair decision and is a protection against those people who are worried that the person who stays at home is going to be cheated out of his fair share by people who have left the family home at an earlier stage, whether they joined the Garda, became civil servants or parish priests or if they were marital or non-marital children.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the application can be made by children who are marital children or non-marital children, but &mdash; and here is the crunch &mdash; it appears only <Col N="323" /> to apply where there is at least one non-marital child in the family. In other words, we now have the extraordinary situation of two farmers living next door to each other, one with four children &mdash; all products of a marriage &mdash; three of whom went to Dublin and one of whom stayed at home, but he dies without making a will. No application can be made to the court to vary the rules of intestacy in that case which, means a quarter share each and this may be quite unfair to the person who stays at home.</P>
    <P>The next door neighbour also has four children, three the product of a marriage and one a non-marital child: one stayed at home and the other three went away. Because there is at least one non-marital child, the child who stayed at home can make an application to the court and say that as he stayed at home, he is entitled to more than a quarter share. In other words, this application &mdash; which I think is good law &mdash; can only be made in circumstances where there is at least one non-marital child. Why can it not be made in the ordinary case as well? I realise that we are talking about the status of children, but this is of crucial importance to the status of children, whether they be marital children or non-marital children. What we are effectively saying is that in some way, to use the old fashioned expression, the legitimate children are in a less favourable position where there were no illegitimate children. That appears to make no sense.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent idea which gives the court discretion but the principle of giving the court discretion should be extended to families where there are no non-marital children. I am particularly grateful to Senator Durcan for drawing attention to that point. I have no doubt the Minister will deal with it during her Second Stage speech but if she does not, she can rest assured that we will deal with it on Committee Stage. We will examine this Bill to ensure that it is drafted properly and that it achieves the worthwhile objectives to which we all subscribe.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer, that is, blood testing. <Col N="324" /> Is the Minister satisfied that the definition of a blood test is sufficiently wide to take into account advances in technology? I am not an expert in this area, but during the Kerry Babies Inquiry reference was made to a more sophisticated way of testing for the parenthood of the child. If the Minister and her officials look at the evidence of some expert &mdash; I think it was somebody from the North of Ireland &mdash; in that regard, they will see that the ordinary blood grouping was confirmed to a greater degree by this new and more sophisticated test. The view was that it gave an absolutely certain, beyond all reasonable doubt result. This would be of considerable benefit in cases where there is a dispute. Is the Minister happy that blood tests, as defined in section 41, cover that? I see she is nodding but I am sure she will expand on that in her reply and we will also discuss it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which reference should be made, and will be made, during our discussion of the Bill is the question of maintenance. The changes in the rules there, in particular the less severe standard of proof required &mdash; that is, introducing the concept of the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, as is introduced by section 14 &mdash; represents an acknowledegment that justice requires that if there is an error, it would be on the basis of the child being maintained rather than not being maintained.</P>
    <P>Having generally welcomed the details of the Bill, and recognising that there are 54 sections which will have to be examined at considerable length, I should like to conclude by saying that the whole thrust of the legislation is very welcome. What is most welcome and reasonable is that it seeks to get rid of the legal disabilities and discriminations against the child. If anybody in this House, wishes to put down an amendment which improves that, and if they can show that there are legal disabilities and discriminations mainly against the child which can be corrected, they will have my support, but if they are seeking to improve the position of one or both of <Col N="325" /> the parents, and at the same time create a degree of uncertainty with regard to the child and its legal position, then these people will not have my support because in this matter the interests of the children who in most cases are the victims of irresponsibility are paramount. Any amendment to this legislation will only have my support if it reinforces the position of the child or reinforces the position of either of the parents without reducing in any way the protection and enhanced legal status being afforded to children.</P>
    <P>Against that background, the Minister is to be commended for introducing this most significant legislation in this House. By the tone of the debate which has been set by Members on all sides, representing all political and sectional interests, the Minister will be convinced that as a result of our deliberations a Bill will be sent to the other House which will, by that stage of the debate, command widespread support. I hope it will be speedily enacted by the other House so that this unnecessary restriction on the rights and privileges of an important section of our citizens will be once and for all removed from the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Second Stage of this important Bill. I welcome the fact that so many Bills are now being introduced in this House. Yesterday we had the Control of Clinical Trials Bill and now we have the Status of Children Bill. We should acknowledge the tribute we owe to the Leader of the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>Whereas at first sight this appears to be a simple, straightforward Bill in fact it refers to about two dozen previous Acts, some of them going back to the time of Queen Victoria. For a non-legal person it is not easy to follow the Bill without considerable research. There are many grey areas so far as I am concerned &mdash; but by the time the Bill goes through the House I am sure matters will be clarified.</P>
      <P>The first sentence of the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> The purpose of this Bill is to remove as far as possible provisions in existing law which discriminate against children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>Like all the other Members of the House I welcome the Bill. The Minister's introductory speech was complete and very helpful. He covered all the areas thoroughly and simplified some of the more complex matters. The Minister hoped that the debate would be imbued with the same spirit of social concern that motivated the Government in promoting it. The Minister should feel confident that this will be so.</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out in the Minister's speech that in enacting this Bill the Government were simply following an international trend dating back about 20 years. In 1975 the position in Europe had developed to the point that several member states had adopted the convention on legal status for children born out of wedlock. The purpose of this convention was to bring about a situation throughout the continent of Europe where the legal position of children born outside marriage would in all essentials be similar to that of children born within marriage. When this Bill becomes law the Government intend to ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>There were other obligations in this area. The Minister referred to a particular judgment in 1979 when the court expressly recognised that while support and encouragement for the traditional family was in itself legitimate and praiseworthy, measures aimed at achieving that end should not be such as to result in prejudice to the family not based on marriage. The Minister also stated in his speech that until recent times the child born outside marriage was ignored by statute and I would also say was ignored by society. In many different areas, in religious orders and in the professions, the child born outside marriage was victimised in various ways. A report on illegitimacy by the Law Reform Commission was published in 1982, a very thorough and complex document. The heart of that recommendation was that <Col N="327" /> the concept of illegitimacy be done away with and the remaining recommendations then followed from that.</P>
    <P>One point the Minister made which I think was important concerned situations where you could have a child brought up in a loving relationship outside marriage. The Minister told us that this Bill caters for such cases by enabling the father of a child born outside marriage to share the responsibilities and rights of guardianship with the child's mother where that would be in the interest of the child.</P>
    <P>With regard to the illegitimate child, I think we had, in effect, apartheid in this country. There was a stigma attached to the unmarried mother. As I said before in this House, I felt that that was society's way of stating that the proper way to bring up a child was in the loving care and relationship of a father and mother and I have no doubt that that is still the best way to bring up a child. For that reason, society frowned on the situations where it was other than this.</P>
    <P>While there may be many cases where a child would be better off without the father, I feel that the concept of the family is the proper one, where the child is brought up with care and concern. Society did not appreciate the difficult role a woman was destined to play but I believe that stigma is by and large gone. I said that before in this House and there were others who felt otherwise. It is not only now that I have been interested in this problem of the unmarried mother.</P>
    <P>In 1971 I published a poem entitled &ldquo;Towards the Emancipation of Woman&rdquo; which at the time was referred to by one paper as an epic poem. I will not dwell on that but I simply want to emphasise that I had a deep concern for the problems at that time and the attitudes of society and with the permission of the Leas-Chathaoirleach I should like to recite the last three verses of that poem to emphasise the point I want to make. They are as follows:</P>
    <P>When Markey's cow went to the bull</P>
    <P>Janey checked the date,</P>
    <P>She added nine months to the time</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> And marked it on a slate.</P>
    <P>For weddings, too, the neighbours knew</P>
    <P>Janey checked the date,</P>
    <P>She added nine months to the time</P>
    <P>And marked it on a slate.</P>
    <P>She was the first to know the worst,</P>
    <P>Her work was blessed until&mdash;</P>
    <P>To be quite frank the slate is blank</P>
    <P>Since woman got the pill.</P>
    <P>I was not making a judgement on the pill as such but I was condemning that attitude, that of valley of the squinting windows syndrome, that ingrown situation which, like an ingrowing toe nail only causes festering. I thought at that time that we had reached this stage not simply through some medical research but through an enlightment in society through education, perhaps more contact with the outside world through television, the media and the papers. I thought that we had reached the turning point and I was glad that happened. I believe it is so.</P>
    <P>We know that at present unmarried mothers select this role to give them an identity or, perhaps, to give them an income or for some other reason. I suppose there are areas where this has not changed as radically or as fast as we would like but, the atmosphere which will be generated by this legislation will bring about an early demise of whatever residue there is. We are talking here about the status of woman as well. As a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I have expressed my very deep concern about this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the Bill. I believe that one in 14 births are extramarital and it appears that for various reasons many people do not believe in marriage. About one in four give up babies for adoption which means that the others keep their babies, look after them with love and care and bring them up well. The State should do everything possible to help those people because in the past and, indeed, in my lifetime, many beautiful girls had to flee the country or were taken into care.</P>
    <P>The unmarried father now has rights <Col N="329" /> but, as Senator O'Leary and others have pointed out, these are not automatic. Application has to be made to a court to establish guardianship and custody and some mothers might feel that would not be in the interest of the child. This seems unfair to fathers who have been and would be responsible. In passing I should like to pay tribute to the families of unmarried mothers, the parents and other members of the family, who have stood by them and are standing by them more now than in the past.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Bill the unmarried father does not have the right to prevent adoption. We have still got segregation if one is to judge by the references to a marital child and a non-marital child. I would prefer to see those terms eliminated. They seem to make this basic distinction again. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum defines the term &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo; as a person who is not a marital child. It is not synonymous with an illegitimate child but, at the same time, it conjures up the same notion. I hope I am wrong in that.</P>
    <P>With regard to property rights, in spite of what Senator O'Leary has said, this is an area which has caused deep concern to many committed people. Part V of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum dealing with property rights states:</P>
    <P>This Part puts marital and non-marital children on the same footing for succession purposes, and includes non-marital children in the meaning of expressions such as &ldquo;child&rdquo; or &ldquo;issue&rdquo; when used in wills, deeds and other dispositions unless the contrary intention appears. Also in this Part there are provisions designed to avoid injustice in certain cases where a parent of a non-marital child dies intestate, and to exclude an unworthy father from benefiting from the estate of his deceased non-marital child.</P>
    <P>Some people have specific concerns. For example children brought up with love, care and devotion by their parents could, perhaps, when they are in their twenties, have to deal with somebody by claiming <Col N="330" /> affiliation under this legislation. There could be a problem there.</P>
    <P>I note that the position in Ireland has not always been as it has been in my lifetime. I should like to quote two sentences from Gaelic and Gaelicised Ireland in the Middle Ages by Kenneth Nichols, which deals with affiliation and the naming of children. It states:</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the Irish law did not distinguish in matters of succession between the legitimate and the illegitimate, all being equally entitled to share in the paternal estate. This applied not only to the children of temporary marriages such as those referred to above and to the offspring of recognised concubines, but also to those born of casual relationships and afterwards affiliated by the sworn declaration of their mothers. This was the well-known custom of the &ldquo;naming&rdquo; of children, described by Frynes Moryson.</P>
    <P>A ridiculous custom that married women give fathers to their children when they are on the point of death ... commonly they gave them fathers of the O'Neills, O'Donnells or such great men... and these bastard children ever ever after follow these fathers and, thinking themselves to descend from them, will be called swordsmen and, scorning husbandry and manual arts, live only off rapine and spoil.</P>
    <P>References to the practice are numerous in contemporary records. The most famous example, of course, is that of Matthew or Feardoragh O'Neill, baron of Dungannon and the father of Hugh, earl of Tyrone, whose mother was the wife of a smith in Dundalk and who, according to the account, admittedly prejudiced, of Shane O'Neill, until he reached the age of 15 or 16 years was taken and named none other than Matthew Kelly and no man knew him to be otherwise than the smith of Dundalk's son, born in wedlock, till a little after that age his mother, for vainglory and for a name for herself, declared him to be <Col N="331" /> O'Neill's son, alleging and boasting how O'Neill lay once with her. And O'Neill (Conn Bacach, first earl of Tyrone) being a man that never refused no child that any woman named to be his, as he had divers besides the said Matthew, accepted and took him to be his son.</P>
    <P>Where some claim or other in this regard is made, apart from the tensions it would cause in a happy family and all the problems it would create in that loving relationship, is the Minister quite happy that the Bill if enacted would not lead to some injustice in this area? The Bill is complicated for the layman and I am not too clear in regard to when claims of this kind can be made when the Bill is enacted. I think there is a period of six months before the Bill becomes law and different parts of it may become law at different times. Are we dealing with people who are born after the Bill is law? Does it apply to elderly people? What is the situation with regard to that general area where a claim for inheritance might be made? Can the Minister clear up that point to everybody's satisfaction?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are always people who have conservative and reactionary views and we have got representations in this regard from people who are not in favour of this Bill. I welcome the Bill <i>in toto.</i> I look forward to Committee Stage when all the questions that might arise will be teased out and answered by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a notion that this debate would last a lot longer than now seems likely. It is worth making a point that in the past six months there has been intensive media speculation that this Bill would be almost as controversial as the contraceptive legislation and the divorce referendum. They were all categorised in this utterly misleading title on social legislation and we were led to believe that there was this groundswell of opinion within the Oireachtas against reforming legislation of a social nature and this was categorised with it. I am sure the Minister <Col N="332" /> of State is probably even more aware than I am of the speculation that this would be explosively controversial and that we would have the farming community down on our heads.</P>
      <P>What I have heard both here and on the monitor has not been about the possible threats to the existing order of this Bill but to the perceived inadequacies that many Members on all sides of this House have seen in the Bill. The general discussion here has not been about whether this Bill goes too far but, in relation to different views, whether it goes far enough. The general consensus in that issue is perhaps to encourage the Minister to think about amendments which would clarify issues. Perhaps she has a feeling that she has got far enough and is not inclined to pursue the matter further. It is clear that, with the exception perhaps of one troglodytic member of the Oireachtas, there is an overwhelming consensus that this legislation is worthwhile and necessary.</P>
      <P>We should no longer allow perhaps only one Member of the Oireachtas to hypnotise us into believing that there is not a groundswell of public opinion to support this legislation. There is no evidence of any large representative public lobby on this issue; it has been clearly seen to be in tune with public thinking and it also incidentally confirms something that I have long held, that it is impossible to divide Irish public opinion along some sort of line which says liberal and conservative and to put divorce, contraception, the Status of Children Bill and a whole lot of other things on one side. In other words, with all the good guys on one side and all the bad guys on the other side. Senator Hanafin is a case in point. He took a very definite view for instance on the divorce referendum. Senator Hanafin yesterday made a point with considerable passion on this issue which is totally at variance with the perceived view of how people like Senator Hanafin feel about issues like this. It is very important that this should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not a society which decides on all issues on the basis of some sort of gut response. People decide on the issues <Col N="333" /> with far more maturity. I say this as one of the almost invariable losers in many of the debates about many worthy issues. It does not in the least persuade me that Irish society is either uncaring, uncompassionate, or uninterested. Irish society makes its decisions on the merits of each case and I regret many of the decisions it makes. I regret particularly the decisions it makes about the vast majority of the people who are elected to Dáil Éireann but I cannot do anything about that, I have to live with it.</P>
    <P>Irish society is caring and compassionate. I of all people in this House have ample evidence of the extent of that compassion. The response to this Bill, as distinct from the imaginations of the media about hostility to it, has demonstrated the degree of compassion, caring and commonsense in our society. There is no heavy lobby against the Bill. The lobbies on the other side do not bother me any more because they know they are wasting their time, paper and energies. I gather from the general response that there is no heavy lobby on the other side. The real lobby is about improving this Bill. We can do a useful job in this House given that we will not have any high pitch of emotion about the principle. We can do a useful job, going through it and trying to amend it.</P>
    <P>I went on at length last week about people apologising for not being experts. I am now probably going to contradict myself because having read the Bill I realise why the Minister took so long to produce it. It does run through a whole mass of property legislation in particular, not because property is sacred but because there is an enormous amount of legislation involved which must be right. The amount of consultation within and between Government Departments must have taken a long time. I am, therefore, very pleased that the Bill has been published. The Minister probably anticipated most of my remarks on the issue but it is probably as well to reiterate them. It needs to be said that the discrimination against those whom up to now we referred to as illegitimate children was <Col N="334" /> not something that characterised the State alone.</P>
    <P>It is not that long ago since an illegitimate child could not be ordained to the priesthood by virtue of being illegitimate. Sometimes my Church gets away with something close to murder by being able to proclaim itself as the model of all virtues when its own history is very much a reflection of the history of the human race generally, warts and all. It also says something about our whole instinctive view of this that needs to be worked at and dealt with and of which changing the law is an important part. The term &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; is a pejorative term used as abuse. If we believed that children born outside marriage were entirely the same, that term would never have developed the pejorative connotation it now has. It is to be welcomed that we are moving away from that, and that we have recognised what is, when you sit back and look at it, a self evident fact. Whatever guilt is attributed to children being born outside wedlock, if there is any, the child is an entirely innocent party. Any society which claims to be concerned about children, whether they be born or unborn, gets itself into a knot. Politicians for that matter who claim to be concerned about children, born and unborn, and still justify discrimination against one category of children are at least in difficulty with their logic if not, perhaps, with their consciences.</P>
    <P>The putting aside of non-marital children is fairly recent. In the pre-Tridentine days, kings and princes, and indeed, popes looked after their non-marital children extremely well. Half the royal houses and half the aristocracy of Europe can trace their origins back to non-marital children of eminent personages of Church and state. Excluding non-marital children, pretending they do not exist, and keeping them out of sight is probably relatively recent. It did not seem to be such a matter of shame in the more distant past.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill goes, the point has been made that similar reforming legislation in New Zealand includes a reference to the abolition of the status of <Col N="335" /> illegitimacy in the title. In terms of the rhetorical intent of this Bill which is to bring about a change in public perception and public attitudes, it is an aspect that if possible should be looked at. I would counsel the Minister of State not to be overpowered by the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, because we have had occasion in this House in the last six months to come across phrases and, indeed, paragraphs in legislation that did no credit to the general profession of the parliamentary draftsman. They were far more ambiguous than any layman could ever dream up and still stand as monuments to confusion. I do not want to get involved in criticising individuals who are not present but the parliamentary draftsman seems to be a particular authority that Ministers use to justify the strangest things, whether they be insertions or omissions in legislation. I would counsel the Minister of State that if it is simply the parliamentary draftsman saying it is not necessary, which seems to be a particular counsel, it might be worth doing because it signals the intent of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult, but even a statement of intent on the question of changing terminology would help. It is an affront, and I am sure it is an affront to the Minister of State to have to bring in a definition of marital and non-marital where this phrase is used continuously in each subsection &ldquo;legitimated or legitimate&rdquo;. It still gives one the impression that we are changing names but what they really are are legitimate children and this other category.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get away from that and, therefore, it should be possible at least to hope that all future legislation should contain the phrase marital and non-marital. This is where the technical skills of drafting and lawyers pass me out completely. Perhaps all references in past legislation to &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; should be taken to mean and interpreted to mean marital and non-marital and should be read as such. It would at least abolish retrospectively the <Col N="336" /> concept of illegitimacy. I do not think it would make any legal difference.</P>
    <P>We are involved in an exercise not just to change the law but we are attempting to reflect a new perception of society about the status of children born outside marriage. When you are trying to do that your rhetoric can nearly be as important as your law. Therefore, to the extent that it is consistent with good drafting and good legislation, it is worthwhile to enshrine that kind of rhetoric, even if it is only rhetoric, in the legislation. It makes clear both here and to the Judiciary, who will have the job of interpreting this, what is in the mind of the Oireachtas. I am not good enough, I am not briefed enough and I am not informed enough to be able to say that there are possible ambiguities of interpretation in this legislation. I know where there is one and I will come to that in a moment. The Minister of State knows where it is too, so she will not be surprised when I come to it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the definition what is there I gather is comprehensive. It is simply a question of extending what is contained in the definitions to clarify our general intent to get rid of what we regard as a dreadfully unfair use of terminology.</P>
    <P>On the issue of guardianship, and in particular the thorny one of automatic guardianship of fathers and the different views on this, having witnessed on at least one occasion a perfectly concerned father being excluded to a large extent from access to a child because the mother felt that way about it, and because the man in question did not feel like making a big issue out of it through any sort of legal activities. I was inclined to be of the opinion that automatic guardianship was a good idea. I have had to come to the conclusion that, on the evidence of the fact that in the vast majority of registered non-marital births the father does not seem to show sufficient interest to be even recorded on the birth certificate, it is very hard to go around giving absolute rights. The history of the experience of women who have children outside marriage is that the fathers do not show sufficient interest or sufficient concern to be recorded on the birth certificate and <Col N="337" /> therefore be given automatic rights to guardianship.</P>
    <P>It is only when you think about it that you realise just how significant this word &ldquo;guardianship&rdquo; is. Indeed, it is the extent of the rights that a guardian has that raises a problem later on about void marriages and the children of annulled marriages. Guardianship involves people's decisions about schooling, passports, domicile and a whole range of issues. It is not just something nice for the child. People say a child is entitled to a father. A child can have a father whether the father is the guardian or not. I have personal acquaintance of one of these peculiar situations &mdash; I am not involved I hasten to add &mdash; where the father is not in any way the guardian of the child but he acknowledges his paternity and the child knows who the father is. There are complicated reasons why he could not be the guardian or would not be the guardian but the child has no doubts about who his father is. The father is not the guardian of the child. This is for reasons to do with the situation people are in. I do not think that, in order for a child to have a father, the father necessarily has to be the guardian.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes reference to simplified procedures to enable a father to have guardianship. It is a pity those simplified procedures are not spelt out, particularly in the area where this is being done by agreement, where both parents have agreed that the father should be a guardian as well. There is a preference for doing some of these things by regulations or by administrative procedures, but I would like to suggest to the Minister of State given that we have a considerable consensus on this issue, it would be well worth talking about, particularly the area where guardianship is agreed. As I said, that has been a rowing back on my part from the position I would have chosen.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased by the progress on the question of paternity. I was somewhat astonished to discover &mdash; it would be far too arrogant to say informed &mdash; that the best a woman can hope for at present is to have someone identified as the putative father. There cannot be a final decision <Col N="338" /> that a certain man is the father of a non-marital child. The mind boggles at what the astonishing requirement of corroborative evidence implies. There could be a whole profession of &ldquo;private eyes&rdquo; involved in assembling corroborative evidence to prove that a man is the father of a child. In this area of corroborative evidence in respect to rape and to all sorts of areas, there is an extraordinary degree of men protecting themselves, with a woman's whole sexual history being given in court in rape cases.</P>
    <P>In the past, you could not prove that a man was a father unless somebody else corroborated the evidence. The evidence the mother and the father would give would not be sufficient to sway a court. The woman had to produce extra evidence over and above her own, to prove the man was the father. I am very glad that blood tests are going to be allowed for this purpose. I understand that these tests cannot be conclusive in proving that a person was the father. They can, of course, be conclusive in proving that a person is not the father. It is, at least, additional evidence. I am relieved that this concept that a person, at best, would be the putative father has been removed.</P>
    <P>In what is otherwise worthwhile and positive legislation, the matter of the children of void or of annulled marriages does tend to hit you between the eyes. We are talking about the children of void marriages being treated as if the parents were married. I stand to be corrected, but as this legislation stands both of the partners in a void marriage have guardianship rights over the child. Given what I have just said about guardianship and about the need for people who have the right of guardianship to be prepared to take that right seriously and not to act malevolently or obstructively or go missing and present all sorts of legal problems, it appears to be a little too trite and, to a certain extent, a concession to those who will not recognise the realities of marital breakdown in our society to simply redefine children of annulled marriages as being marital, because it does give, by definition, guardianship rights to both parents even though in many suits <Col N="339" /> for nullity here it is one parent who is endeavouring to demonstrate fundamental defects in the contract of marriage which were based on an inadequacy in the other partner. In that case you are going to have parents demonstrating that they were never married because the other person had some flaw in his or her personality, or one of the other bases for nullity and then having to accept that even though they were never married the other partner still has guardianship rights over the child. That is the argument that was put to me and I look forward to the Minister's explanation on it.</P>
    <P>On the whole area of property rights which was supposed to be emotive, one argument is that because it should only apply to wills that are entered into after the Bill comes into force it does not have any immediate effect. Perhaps in some way that is welcome. I missed the Minister's introductory speech and I am still not entirely clear why there could not be some retrospective effect in this. In other areas we have no problem with retrospective legislation. We have even done that in the area of taxation on occasions. The problem with retrospective effect is that there is always a date you have to pick. The provision is most helpful.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what Senator O'Leary and a number of people said, that is, that the exclusion of injustice clause in this Bill seems to actually do the opposite of what the Bill sets out to do. It seems to discriminate between non-marital and marital children. You could argue that it discriminates in favour of non-marital children, although it is hard to know which way it discriminates. If one says that a non-marital child benefiting from an estate would render an injustice to the person who had legitimately claimed to contribute to the family business or the family farm, which is the objective of this clause, I do not see why a similar provision should not apply to marital children in a similar position who may have left home at 14 years and were not seen since but were still given a share of the family farm by the father when the will was made. The <Col N="340" /> person who contributed most has no claim in that case, which is an injustice. It is only in the case of a non-marital child that the injustice can be claimed. That is regrettable and if the intent is not that that should be the case, then it should be written into the legislation and if the intent is that, I should like to know why. Perhaps there are constitutional problems.</P>
    <P>Beyond that, the Bill is one of these significant reforms that may not be trumpeted by the media from the house-tops. I think that the media have lost interest in this legislation now that they find it uncontentious. I regret that. It is important reforming legislation. I welcome the fact that it was introduced in this House. In two successive days two important pieces of legislation have been debated and concluded in this House and yesterday the Minister for Health accepted that there would be a considerable number of amendments emanating from this office on the basis of the debate here. I am equally confident that the Minister of State will give us a similar indication that amendments will be considered both from the Department and from Members of this House. This demonstrates that there are two Houses of the Oireachtas and that this House &mdash; and I stand over this in many ways &mdash; debates issues with considerably greater conviction, with considerably less party-political intent and with, in many cases, a greater concern for the issues for the people involved and for the policy-making nature of legislation and the implications of legislation. As with yesterday's Bill on clinical trials, I look forward with great interest and enthusiasm to Committee Stage of this Bill and congratulate the Minister and the Government for introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to reply to this Second Stage debate. It was my express wish during the preparation of this legislation that it would be introduced in this House. The debate we have just had has justified my feelings and my views in that regard. I intend to respond to the main points <Col N="341" /> made by Senators in the course of their contributions. A few questions of detail were raised which will, no doubt, come up again on Committee Stage and can be gone into then.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan, on behalf of the main opposition group, was very generous in his expressions of welcome for the Bill. However, he made a political point in complaining at the apparent haste with which the debate was opened on the day the House adjourned for the summer recess. The reality of the situation was that I was very anxious to have this Bill considered at the earliest possible opportunity, but the House was so taken up with other urgent business in the period following the presentation of the Bill on 9 May that it was not possible to find time for this debate until the last day of the session. The arrangement on that occasion whereby I was able to explain the background to the Bill and summarise its provisions and a representative of each group in the House was afforded the opportunity of indicating, at least in broad outline, his or her attitude to it, gave Senators some very useful material to reflect on during the recess. The fact that, in spite of the pressure of business, we managed to have the Bill taken on that day was an indication of the Government's commitment to pressing ahead with this Bill and the other measures of social reform on their programme, with the aim of having them enacted into law as soon as possible. Some Senators criticised the fact that the Bill does not remove the concept of illegitimacy entirely from the law. As Senators will be aware, the Law Reform Commission's first recommendation was that legislation should remove the concept of illegitimacy from the law and equalise the rights of children born outside marriage with those born within marriage. This Bill implements the second part of that recommendation: it equalises the rights of persons born outside marriage with those born within marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of abolishing the concept of illegitimacy would be that the father of a child born outside marriage would in <Col N="342" /> every case automatically be joint guardian of the child, irrespective of the nature of his relationship with the mother. This would entitle the father, among other things, to have an equal say with the mother in the child's upbringing, and even to remove the child from the mother's custody if he so wished. While there are, no doubt, many cases where the father of a child born outside marriage is willing and well qualified to act jointly with the mother as guardian of the child, there are many other circumstances where an automatic right of guardianship for the father could operate against the best interests of the child. Indeed, a survey carried out by the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children pointed forcefully against the granting of such an automatic right of guardianship. The federation, which is an umbrella body including in its membership most, if not all, of the organisations dealing on a day to day basis with the problems faced by unmarried parents and their children, had sought the views of its members on each of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. The solution to this dilemma which the Government have decided upon is that, while the fathers of children born outside marriage will not automatically have guardianship rights, the Bill will provide a means whereby they can acquire such rights. Where there is agreement between both parents and the father's name has been entered on the child's birth certificate a special informal procedure will be provided for in court rules. However, in all cases, the matter will come before a court to ensure that the interests of the child are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Hanafin that his view is correct: the approach of the Bill is designed to safeguard the paramountcy of the interests of the child in each case.</P>
    <P>The differences that will remain in the legal treatment of children born outside marriage after the implementation of the proposals in this Bill are differences which necessarily arise out of the fact that such a child's parents have not married each other, and therefore owe to each <Col N="343" /> other none of the mutual duties of fidelity and trust which apply between a married couple. As has been said before, it will not be possible to point to any area of the law which discriminates against persons on the basis of the fact that their parents have not married each other.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, in particular Senators Hanafin and Durcan, objected to the use of the term &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo; and expressed the fear that this term would simply replace the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and attract the pejorative connotations of that word. It was to ensure against just such undesirable connotations arising that it was decided to replace the present term illegitimate by what was considered to be an entirely neutral term which would reflect the fact that the child's parents were not married to each other.</P>
    <P>The practicalities of the situation require the use of some term in order to reflect the difference in treatment of children under the Bill depending on the marital status of their parents. This arises, particularly, in the areas of guardianship and maintenance. The Law Reform Commission acknowledged the problem in relation to maintenance when they pointed out, at paragraph 77 of their report, that having regard to the basic approach of the 1976 maintenance legislation in imposing on both spouses an obligation to maintain each other as well as their children, very great conceptual and practical difficulties arise in attempting to apply the policies of that legislation to children born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of the amendment of revenue law to abolish discriminations in that code affecting children born outside marriage. The amendment of revenue law is a matter for the Minister for Finance. It has been arranged that the necessary changes in that area of the law required in consequence of the enactment of the present Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas by the Minister for Finance at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson complained that a child born outside marriage will not enjoy recognition of a family status as with a <Col N="344" /> child within a marriage. The Constitution affords not only legal recognition to, but also guarantees to protect, the family based on marriage. If a couple wish to establish a family relationship recognised by the law, they will marry. If they wish to live together in a family-like situation without having that situation legally recognised, they are free to do so. If they wish to live together even though one or other is already part of another family recognised by law (that is, married to another person), then the new relationship will not be recognised by law; and as several Senators have reminded us, it was recently decided in the referendum on divorce that that should continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators criticised section 6 of the Bill, which would have the effect of deeming to be legitimate certain children of void and voidable marriages. Senator Robinson, in particular, argued very forcefully and eloquently in favour of deleting this section. Other Senators, on the other hand welcomed this provision.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the arguments for and against this section and came down in favour of its retention. However, in deference to the strong views expressed against it, I propose to look at it again before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of lump sum payments in maintenance applications. This is not a Bill to amend the maintenance code as such; the amendments made here are purely to put the maintenance provisions for children within and outside marriage on a par with each other. Thus, the general question of amending the maintenance code to permit lump sum orders to be made for specific purposes, over and above the regular periodical payments, was not considered appropriate to this Bill. The only issue relevant to this Bill is whether there should be a means whereby a parent could be permitted to buy off his or her continuing liability to maintain a child by making a once-off payment which would act as a bar to all further claims. This facility is at present available to the putative father of an illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I find it extremely difficult to accept the notion that the parent of a child born within marriage should be able to protect himself or herself against all subsequent legal proceedings for maintenance of the child by the payment of a lump sum for the lifetime of that child. It seems to me to be a denial of what society, and the Constitution, perceive to be the role of the parents within the family. By extension, I can see no justification for allowing the father of a child born outside marriage to be &ldquo;let off the hook&rdquo;, as it were, in this fashion. I have no difficulty with the principle of lump sum payments as such &mdash; though the practicalities may be difficult and have not been considered in the context of this Bill. My difficulty lies in the aspect of the present system, under the 1930 Act, which makes the payment of a lump sum a complete bar to further claims.</P>
    <P>I come now to a point made on the &ldquo;Property Rights&rdquo; part of the Bill. Incidentally, this part is called &ldquo;Property Rights&rdquo; because it deals with such rights not only on succession but also arising out of deeds between living people.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to the provision, in section 26 of the Bill, to the effect that, unless the contrary intention appears, words in wills and deeds denoting any family relationship will be construed as including people born outside marriage or related through a non-marital link. In particular, she asked why this new rule of construction should not apply in future to all wills, no matter when drawn up.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that it would be wrong in principle for the law to change the effect of a will, drawn up in the context of a particular legal background, which must be presumed to reflect the wishes of the testator at the time. To impose by legislation at a subsequent date a change in the meaning of words or expressions used originally with a particular meaning would be objectionable, and quite possibly unconstitutional. Not everyone would have an opportunity of making the necessary changes to the will in order to restore its original intent; <Col N="346" /> cases come to mind where mental incapacity might arise after the making of a will or a testator with property here would be unaware, through absence from the country or whatever, of the changes made in the law. These objections apply equally to the suggestion that the new rule of construction could apply to all wills whenever made, after a time lag of two or three years.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the approach adopted in drafting this provision would perpetuate discrimination in the making of wills takes no account of the fact that testators have always been, and will continue to be, free to dispose of their property as they wish. The Succession Act, 1965, guards against abuse of this freedom of testation by giving a surviving spouse the option of claiming a substantial share of the estate as a legal right and by giving surviving children the right to claim just provision out of the testator's estate. Under the Bill, this right will extend to non-marital children of a testator who dies after the new law comes into effect, no matter when the will was made.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins expressed concern at the emphasis in Irish society on material values at the expense of personal rights, as exemplified by traditional attitudes towards children born outside marriage. However, one cannot legislate to change people's attitudes. What legislation can do, and what this Bill will do, is to create a climate and a legal framework where discrimination against children born outside marriage will no longer be acceptable. The Bill, of necessity, deals with property matters. But I am satisfied, and the Government are satisfied, that the Bill strikes the correct balance between these matters and less tangible issues such as guardianship.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might remind Senator Higgins that the major piece of legislation in favour of which Senator Robinson's Private Member's Bill of 1974 was withdrawn was subsequently enacted as the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, an Act that made substantial changes in the law relating to the maintenance of children born <Col N="347" /> outside marriage. The Bill now before the House arises directly from the report of the Law Reform Commission published in 1982.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin was concerned that the question of parentage might be raised after the death of the alleged parent. He felt that this might be unfair to that person's surviving spouse or other relations. I would like to point out, first of all, that the onus is on the person alleging parentage to prove his or her case, and not on anyone else to refute it. If the alleged parent is dead, then this makes it much more difficult for the person alleging parentage to prove his or her case, since one of the best witnesses is unavailable either for cross-examination or for blood tests. It does not make it impossible, however, and there may be circumstances where it would be unjust to refuse to make a finding of parentage solely because the alleged parent is dead, even if there is otherwise sufficient evidence available to enable a court to decide the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin wondered why the giving of a blood sample in parentage cases should not be made mandatory and suggested as an analogy the Road Traffic Acts provisions in relation to excess alcohol. I am satisfied that the analogy is not a sound one for a number of reasons. First, under the road traffic legislation one has the choice of giving a blood or urine sample. Secondly, there is a major difference in character between criminal proceedings &mdash; which are essentially dealing with wrongs against the public at large &mdash; and civil proceedings &mdash; which are mainly concerned with problems between individuals.</P>
    <P>It is justifiable in criminal matters to have a criminal sanction against refusal to supply a sample of blood or urine but for the law to demand, in civil matters, that a person undergo an invasion of his bodily integrity under pain of fine or imprisonment would surely be wrong in principle and quite possibly unconstitutional. I am satisfied that the provision whereby the court can draw inferences from a refusal to give a sample <Col N="348" /> will be ample encouragement to alleged fathers to oblige.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Senator O'Leary's contribution and to thank him for his supportive remarks. I have taken note of the points he has made in relation to section 32. I would like to assure him that I will give it further thought. The section as it stands is designed to interfere as little as possible with the principle of certainty in intestate succession.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan suggested that procedures governing the grant of guardianship to the father of a non-marital child should be set out in the Bill. In my view it is much better that detailed procedures of this kind should be settled by those familiar with the operation of court procedures. For that reason this matter will be provided for in the rules of court.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary and another Senator brought up the question of blood testing. Indeed, it is something on which I have had submissions from various groups. There are various blood tests which may be carried out with the object of ascertaining inheritance characteristics. Those currently available include blood grouping tests on the red blood cells such as the classification of the ABO and rhesus positive-negative systems as used by the blood transfusion service and tissue typing on the white blood cells based on immune reaction to foreign cells. Other tests being developed at present, but not in general use as yet, include DNA fingerprinting which compares the genetic material of cells. All of these are encompassed by this term &mdash; blood tests.</P>
    <P>That concludes my response to Senators' contributions. It remains for me once more to thank those who contributed to the debate and to assure Senators that all the issues raised will be very carefully considered between now and Committee Stage of the Bill. I trust that we will have a similar reasoned debate and discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Third Report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights: Portrayal of Women in the Media.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Women's Rights, in examining the subjects which it might take up for examination in a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, has indeed found a wide variety of subjects. This third report deals with an area which some people might at first glance not think to be a particularly important one. However, the committee did take the view that it is an essential right of any group &mdash; it is certainly an essential right of a group as large as the women of this State &mdash; not to be misrepresented seriously and continuously in public in the manner in which they were portrayed by advertisements.</P>
      <P>The report that the Seanad is discussing today is not just an amalgam of the particular views of the members of the committee, the views that they had originally, the prejudices with which they took up this subject and is not concerned with the preceding views whether prejudiced or otherwise. It is based not only on a long series of discussions within the committee but was also based on evidence taken from a number of groups. The committee sat six times in public in order to receive evidence. It is interesting, in view of the fact that the committees and the Oireachtas are often criticised in regard to application to their work that, in fact, a good deal of the hearing of that evidence took part during the summer when the Houses of the Oireachtas were not in session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> Apart from that, the report was based on research that was directly commissioned by the committee, a directly commissioned research on the question of what was the attitude of women in Ireland to the manner in which they were portrayed. Therefore, when the committee came to make its recommendations it was not basing itself either on its previous notions or merely on what had been said by particularly interested groups but it had gone to the trouble &mdash; and indeed put the State to the expense &mdash; of having definitive research on this topic.</P>
    <P>What is the primary conclusion of this evidence, of the deliberations of the committee? The conclusion is that sexism exists in advertising in Ireland to a large degree and that the existence of sexism in advertising has an effect not only on women but on men and children.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that the latter remark is an exaggeration, that the way in which women are portrayed in advertising would have an effect on children. I have noticed, and I am sure many others have noticed, the fascination that advertisements have for young children. The first contact of a child with television is through advertisements. It may be that their span of attention is such that they like the quick change of advertisements, but the child who is placed in front of a television set while the mother or father or whoever is looking after the child is busy, that child's favourite programmes are advertisements and not features. Therefore, the first impression a child receives through the medium of television is what that child receives from advertisements.</P>
    <P>The very first report of the Committee on Women's Rights which dealt with education stressed the primary importance of education in trying to eliminate the stereotypes that exist in Irish society in regard to the relative roles of men and women. We can all be happy that steps have been taken in regard to the removal of such stereotyping from the text books children use when they go to school. The Department of Education have issued regulations endeavouring to ensure that <Col N="351" /> when a child starts to learn to read, the book from which it first learns to read is free of this false stereotyping which has come to use from past phases of society. On the question of the fascination advertisements have for very young children we have a pre-reading stage at which the false stereotypes of society can be implanted in the child at a time when the mind is such that impressions can be deep and lasting and difficult to eradicate.</P>
    <P>What do I mean by sexism in advertising in the media? The committee has been clear on this point. Pages 9 and 10 of the report set out a table which indicates what the proper criteria should be by which the portrayal of women in various media should be judged. It is not possible for me to read into the record the fullness of table 1 which appears on pages 9 and 10 but I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. There are two main portrayals which are false. Women are portrayed on the one hand as having only the two characteristics of glamour and passivity or, on the other hand, dependence and lack of intelligence. Both of these images are an infringement of the rights of the women of this country not to be misrepresented in this way. It has often been said that there has been a tendency, in endeavouring to secure the rights of women, to under-value the role of the women who chooses to make her career as the home maker. There is no greater insult to the woman who makes her career as a home maker than the manner in which she is portrayed in the advertising media and particularly in television advertisements.</P>
    <P>Why is it that at this stage of Irish society we still have this condition existing where women are represented in this way which may in some aspects have been true of earlier generations but is not true today? Some of it may be deliberate exploitation. But it seems that much more is due to a lack of awareness on the part of the advertising industry and on the part of the media of what is involved in this case. It is the duty of those of us in public life to make the various people <Col N="352" /> in the media aware of the reality of the situation. It is probable that most people in the advertising industry feel that little harm is being done, that there is very little resentment on the part of the women who are so portrayed. The research carried out for the Joint Committee on Women's Rights indicated that this was not the case. I would refer to table 9 on page 26 of the report. We find in the survey carried out by a professional social worker that, with regard to the prime first question, whether advertisements should reflect the way women's lives really are, 91 per cent of women either agree or strongly agree that this should be so. It may well be. The advertising agencies delude themselves that they are showing women as they really are. If we go on to the second question which asked for comment on the statement advocating change on the basis that women should be shown in a variety of roles, not just as wives and mothers, 97 per cent of women who were the subject of this survey agreed or strongly agreed that a change was needed, three per cent did not know and nobody disagreed with the need for change.</P>
    <P>In regard to the stereotype of the glamorous type of woman who is the subject of a number of advertisements, we had a total of 72 per cent of women of the opinion that women's bodies should not be used to advertise products, 11 per cent did not know and only 17 per cent disagreed with the need for change.</P>
    <P>The final statement very substantially involving change which was the subject of this survey, was put in the words: &ldquo;I would like to see stronger legal control of the quality advertisements&rdquo;. In this 35 per cent of women strongly agreed, 51 per cent agreed, giving a total of 86 per cent agreeing, 8 per cent were &ldquo;don't knows&rdquo; and only 5 per cent disagreed. In regard to the effect of what happens at the moment in the portrayal of women in the media, only 5 per cent of women disagree with the idea that there should be stronger legal controls. It seems that this indicates a <i>prima facie</i> case for stronger legal control of the portrayal of women in the media and that, indeed, is <Col N="353" /> the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. This puts a very strong onus on legislators in this House and in another place to take action in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is the contention of the advertising industry that there is a self regulating system which is adequate. The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland have produced a code. They have indicated in evidence to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights that they feel that this code is adequate in content and that the procedures under the code are also adequate in regard to this problem. Therefore, it is necessary for me to say why I believe the advertising industry are deluding themselves in this and that it cannot be sustained either that the code is adequate or, even if it is adequate, that the procedures are being properly used.</P>
    <P>If we look at the records of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland themselves we look at their statistics of the number of cases which are examined in regard to the question of complaint. In the case of complaints in regard to the sexist nature of advertisements, 29 per cent of these are upheld, compared with the 41 per cent upheld in other cases, so immediately there seems to be what a statistician would recognise as a significant difference which should be further investigated. If we look at the structure and the procedures of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, we begin to see why such a difference should occur. At first glace it seems to be set up in such a way that there is an adequate representation of the consumer interest, because there is a board for the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland which consists of ten members, five of whom represent industry and five represent the consumer. There is also a committee of management. The committee of management have four representatives of the advertisers, four representatives of the Institute of Advertising Practitioners and four representatives of the media. In other words, while the board contain representation of consumers, the committee of management consists only of those <Col N="354" /> with a financial interest in the advertising industry. Let us ask ourselves who it was who upheld only 29 per cent of complaints about sexism in advertising. Was it the board, which had a broad consumer representation? No, it was the committee of management. It is the industry only judging itself in this particular regard. That does not necessarily say, of course, that it is reaching a wrong conclusion, but if we read carefully the code of the advertising industry and if we examine the evidence given on behalf of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, which was the evidence given to the committee on 23 October, we find, indeed, that they appear to be misdirecting itself. We have here in their code something which might appear to cover the situation and I am quoting directly from paragraph 4.8.6 on page 14 of the <i>Code of Advertising Standards for Ireland.</i> I will arrange to have a copy of this placed in the Library if it is not already there. I quote: &ldquo;No advertisement should explicitly or by implication infringe the principle of the social, economic and cultural equality of the sexes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It can be said that the right of the women of Ireland not to be misrepresented in terms of either of the false stereotypes of which I have already complained is adequately covered in this regard, but if you read the evidence which was given on behalf of the advertising authority, which revealed the manner in which they approached this, you will find that they appear to be judging complaints in regard to sexism in advertising, not under that part of the code, but under the general part of the code, which is given on page 7. I quote from general rule 2:</P>
    <P>Advertisments should contain nothing which is likely, in the light of generally prevailing standards of decency and propriety, to cause grave or widespread offence.</P>
    <P>When the Members of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights closely questioned the representative of the Advertising Standards Authority for <Col N="355" /> Ireland in this regard, he defended the decisions on the grounds that widespread offence was not given by the advertisements complained of. That is not the point. Sexism in advertising and indecency in advertising are two quite different things.</P>
    <P>If I am right in thinking that the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland are judging complaints about sexism on the basis that they are not offensive to a majority of people on the general grounds of decency, then they are misdirecting themselves in regard to their code. It is this reason that moved me, and I am quite sure moved other Members of the committee, to the recommendation that we need legal statutory control of advertising in order to remedy this situation. I suggest that the code is deficient, even if it were operated properly under section 4 rather than section 1, and I think the procedure is also deficient.</P>
    <P>The committee considered not only the question of the advertising industry itself, that is the people who are endeavouring to place advertisements in the media but also the question of the reception of these advertisements by the media. What was the attitude of the representatives of the media in this regard? In regard to radio and television, RTE have a Copy Clearance Committee whose role is discussed on page 35 of the report. This appears to be the proper procedure of self-control, but what do we find when we look at this RTE Copy Clearance Committee? In spite of the fact that in 1979 RTE had an internal working party to examine the position of women in Irish broadcasting, including the portrayal of women in advertising, we found that, until very recently, until the Committee on Women's Rights were actually dealing with this problem, on this Copy Clearance Committee there was not one woman. Again we find a complete bias in regard to the pre-existing practices. There are a number of women at middle management level in RTE and in the advertising industry because this is a profession in which women have taken quite an active part in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> If we look at the print medium, what is the position? I am happy to say that a number of editors responded to the invitation of the committee. They came and discussed the problem of the portrayal of women in the media. In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the proprietors and the editor of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> for the arrangements in that newspaper. This newspaper is outstanding in regard to the arrangement they make for their women employees and in their attitude towards the problem we are discussing. This is quite clear from the evidence that was given to us. The editor was generous enough to say that because his newspaper had no pre-existing tradition, because it was a late foundation, and because of the manner in which it had been launched, that it was easier for <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> to act in this way. Nevertheless I think it is right that this tribute should be paid.</P>
    <P>In the evidence given by the Advertising Authority of Ireland they tell us that there is one Irish newspaper which is not a member of that authority. <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i> The one newspaper that seems to have got the things right, which seems to be treating women as they should be treated, apparently will have nothing to do with this body which says it is adequate to act in a self-regulating capacity and that there is no need for further legal statutory control.</P>
    <P>One editor did not wish to appear before the committee, the editor of <i>The Sunday World.</i> He wrote to us in terms that we thought reflected, quite clearly, what was wrong in regard to certain areas of the media and we printed his reply as an annex. I quote one sentence:</P>
    <P>Your committee's view seems to suggest that there is no difference between men and women.</P>
    <P>He continues with semi-fantasies about girls in bikinis on tractors and men in y-fronts on tractors. It is not so much the fact that a person does not appear before the committee that concerns me, but that anyone should be so unintelligent, and at the same time in charge of a newspaper, as to think that the Joint Committee on <Col N="357" /> Women's Rights saw no difference between men and women. We see no difference between their rights. Our work in that committee room is going to continue so that we can make our contribution to seeing that women are not underprivileged in this country, but to say that we can detect no difference in the profile of a man and a woman is saddening.</P>
    <P>The committee had two options when they had finally reviewed all this evidence. Should they recommend that the existing voluntary system be improved? The committee looked at the procedures in other countries and came to the conclusion that there were countries in which the voluntary system could work. Canada was one that many members of the committee felt offered a good model for voluntary regulation. There were other countries in which a statutory approach had been adopted. Here the committee came to the conclusion that for this country a statutory system somewhat along the lines of that in force in Norway might be suitable. Ultimately the committee had to choose which they should recommend. I had no hesitation. We have so much self delusion in this country, so much self delusion in the advertising industry and in parts of the media itself that the task of taking the existing voluntary method and trying to reform it so that it could make a real contribution towards the advancement of women's rights in this country is one that should not be attempted because Hercules is dead and nobody else would be able to do it.</P>
    <P>As the committee have recommended, the situation in regard to the portrayal of women in the Irish media is far from satisfactory. Many women may have the good sense to shrug this off, and may attempt to ignore it but that is no reason for us in the Oireachtas ignoring the problem. As I said at the beginning, women have the right not to be misrepresented in this way and it is up to the Oireachtas to vindicate that right. In my opinion this can only be done by statutory control. I commend to all legislators and to all those interested to read this report, to read the <Col N="358" /> evidence. I am confident that having done so they will agree with me.</P>

He was indeed a very positive and regular contributor to the work of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and I wish him well in his new role, however long it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take great pleasure in seconding this motion. I join with Senator Dooge in urging Members of both Houses to read the report in detail and to ponder on its implications. It is a very serious report. The nub of it is that a committee who were an all-party committee have agreed <Col N="359" /> that in the control of advertising and the exclusion of sexism from advertising we could not accept self regulation. That has many implications. As we began our proceedings gathering evidence we had before us those who would have been responsible for self regulation. It could have been gathered from the manner in which we heard the evidence and the evidence itself that we were going to bring in the report within a period of time. The attitude of the members is not unfairly represented by my stating they were of the opinion that when it came to print the report, even in that brief period of time no significant effort had been made to seriously extend or improve the standards or procedures that would have eliminated sexism from advertising by self regulation. Hence the unanimity of the recommendation. That point is very important.</P>
    <P>The other point made by Senator Dooge in moving the report, that this report should be seen in the context of our first report on education, is an important one. When we discussed the first report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights many people in the discussion here stressed the importance of the manner in which images of women pervade the overall cultural system. The media is very important in this. If one looks at the manner in which sexist attitudes arise in society, one can see that they are at their most obdurate when they are presented as natural. It is as if differences of gender are being translated into differences of social roles and the assumption that obvious differences of a biological kind between male and female are translated into what are suggested are obvious differences in sex roles in the workplace and in the home.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to perhaps the most colourful page in the report, page 74, Appendix II containing the letter from the editor who did not appear before us. He gave not only a natural explanation of the practices of his newspapers but, as is usual in this country, he involved a God. Following the paragraph <Col N="360" /> quoted by Professor Dooge that Editor stated:</P>
    <P>My own view is that there is a considerable difference between men and women. They look different for a start and I firmly believe that a tractor adorned by a girl in a bikini is infinitely more pleasing to the human eye than the same tractor adorned by a man in Y-fronts.</P>
    <P>To me, that's the way God planned it.</P>
    <P>In that you have it all. It is the classical justification or more accurately, the classical basis of prejudice and its rationalisation. Nature made it so: God made it so: or God and nature made it so. One can order them whichever way one likes. It is interesting that the views which are admittedly sexist, about tractors, Y-fronts and bikinis, can so easily move to the transcendental plane of God. It tells you something not only about sexism but about religion in our culture.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of socialisation, people would regard that the images gathered in the early years of life in the home are of crucial importance in establishing roles and images of male and female participation in society. Thus, children look at and see how their parents work and live. For example, little children will say early on, &ldquo;Daddy is going to work, what are you going to do&rdquo;, and so on. The atmosphere in the home and the family is very important and the committee, when preparing the education report, realised that.</P>
    <P>Moving on from the settling of the home, the next major arena in which sexism is either created, sustained or amplified is within the educational system. Hence our discussion in report No. 1 on the content of curricula, the question of the participation of women in the management of schools and the structural control within the Department of Education. It is in this wider arena still, for the very early times when people read, listen to radio and watch television, that we have the most sustained reinforcing of images that have been gathered from the two previous sets of experiences. <Col N="361" /> Thus it was that the committee had to begin by looking at the overall portrayal of women in the media in terms of their participation as a workforce within the media, the question of the manner in which the media covered women's affairs and, of course, the representation of women in advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before we adjourned I said that this report should be taken in the context of the overall work of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, particularly in the context of their first report, that on education. That report addressed the whole question of socialisation of children into images of appropriate male and female roles and I mentioned that we had begun, if you like with various roles that are sustained by versions of what is maleness and what constitutes appropriate versions of the female within the family.</P>
      <P>This is extended within education and that was why the committee were so happy with many of the recommendations made in the first report dealing with the elimination of stereotypes from text books. They were also pleased with the general ambience in schools. This does not mean that the issue in any sense has been rectified. In that regard many parents who talk to me about this issue and who know my interest in the issue of sexism as a part of the core of the value system of society often say how distressed they are that, even if they, against the total cultural tendency try to rear their children with non-sexist values, these values are quickly eroded in the school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first report we were talking about curriculum reform and the removal of stereotypes in textbooks. We equally realise that the total ambience of schools, the assumptions and attitudes of teachers and the presence of women and men in particular roles within, for example, the management of schools and so forth, was <Col N="362" /> something on which progress would take a longer while but we set down the basic demands in that regard. The maleness of the authoritarian control and structure of the school system is a very significant obstacle at present. The assumption in regard to education is that women belong outside the gates to collect the children and in the junior classes of schools. They are under-represented in management. Female parents are excluded very often from decision-making. Female teachers are not given full access to the posts of authority within the school system. That will take longer to rectify but at least our report noted it.</P>
    <P>It makes links with what I will say later, that if you think of how this is extended into the third major area of socialisation, advertising, all of this runs together as a kind of college of discrimination and prejudice within the culture. For example, think of the advertisement which suggests that a woman who is not using the right powder for cleaning her floor will be covered in guilt because her child is left waiting sitting on a wall whereas the bright women who listen to the male voice over in advertisements suggesting the right powder to use on the floor have all collected their children on time. The women collectors of children, allied to the idea of women who listen to advertisements, the voice-overs of which are prepared by men all fits together including the question of guilt. I might come to that point straightaway. We began in our consideration in this report on sexism and the media with advertising because advertising fits as a reinforcing set of mechanisms into images that are already there.</P>
    <P>I need not delay long on what I said earlier on the assumptions of a major editor of a newspaper trying to reduce our work to the level of the trivial by suggesting that we do not know the difference between men and women and that he knows these God-intended differences. Let us leave that kind of rubbish aside altogether and get on with the business of the two main implications within advertising. The first is in relation to the use of women to sell products and the <Col N="363" /> second, which occurs earlier in the report, is the fact that in every advertisement which is aimed at selling products there is another message which makes a statement about what women do in society. It would not be an unreasonable assumption to gather from the structure of many advertisements that women for a start are essentially defined within the homemaking role. We note three things: the exclusion of older women from advertisements; the use entirely of younger women; that women, for example, are presented whether they are young or old, whether they are beautiful or aging &mdash; whatever way you want to define all those terms &mdash; as not being able to make up their minds and need the assistance of a male voice to suggest what is both the inferior and the superior product. Thus, they are at the zenith of their poor powers &mdash; God bless them &mdash; when they refuse to give back the successful powder to the male who has come to take it back to go on and test it somewhere else. These images are regarded as appropriate for the sale of products. They are making very powerful statements.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge in introducing the report very correctly emphasised its research base. The committee had research commissioned not only on the content of advertisements but also on the reaction to them. Senator Dooge has correctly emphasised the point that perhaps advertisers are making a very serious mistake in assuming that the advertisements are acceptable to wide categories of the population. The evidence is otherwise. The evidence is that women find them offensive. It is very clear also from the evidence given to the committee that many other people are offended by these depictions. Indeed, when you think about it in many ways there is a kind of &ldquo;ageism&rdquo; in it also. Why is it that a particular kind of woman is depicted in the media? What happens all the women who were in the previous advertisements? Did they die of the products they were selling? Did they ever grow up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They were kept eternally youthful by the washing powders, the liquids and so on. On page 19 of our report we note a very important point, which is based on a number of comments made to us by the women evaluating the advertisements we showed them. We comment that advertisements which were evaluated as bad were those marketing washing powders and floor cleaning products which portray women as stupid, unintelligent and obsessional about &ldquo;dirty clothes and dirty floors&rdquo;. The idea is that the mind of the woman is entirely limited by an obsession that the man that she lives with will have clean cuffs, that the children will have greasy spots removed from their clothes, whether she will have them ready in time and not be found wanting. It is a great image of a woman in a republic and all this coming out like snow every day, etc., then gasping with delight at technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed the relationship within science, technology and society of the role of women is a very interesting one. In the advertisements we looked at it was as if women were captured by the very technology itself. They were extensions of the machine, almost like the extension lead of the vacuum cleaner. They were just attached on to the end. Obviously, you needed to be very young to deal with all of this because you never saw an older woman in any of these advertisements. The danger in many cases is that it represents a powerful rationalisation. We should be very clear about this, it is the rationalisation of a prejudice and has to be seen as that. It is very powerful in its effect on the young. I remember speaking at the committee some time ago about a standard four primary school textbook in Irish which spoke about a woman going to buy a new dress. She brought her daughter with her. The mother said to the daughter: &ldquo;Táimid ag ceannach gúna nua, tá a lán airgid ag daidí etc.&rdquo; Daddy was allowing mammy to buy a new dress. The son intervened in the conversation and said that when he grew up he was <Col N="365" /> going to have a lot of money, too, and would buy dresses for the woman that came into his life. This in order to reinforce things better and give it a transcendental quality in the first language of the country which, no more than the involvement of God and the natural in advertising as I mentioned earlier, tells us something about the damage that this does to the language. I am not sure whether that text is withdrawn yet. With regard to the stereotypes in the text, there has been a considerable amount of achievement.</P>
    <P>We benefited enormously from the quality of the submissions that were made of a written and an oral kind. The very first submission from Máirín de Búrca was a very fine one. It was well documented and it was a very lengthy submission. I am sure I speak for all the members of the committee when I say we were enormously indebted for the great start it gave. It was one of the submissions that came in the early work of the committee. It enabled us to get stuck into the matter. It was in that submission that the other aspect of the secondary existence of women was referred to in a very stark way. It referred to the presence at a funeral of the one of the most distinguished women of letters in Ireland. She was described as the daughter of somebody and as the wife of somebody else and her own name was excluded entirely: poor dear. She just happened to be there as a kind of after thought of the dead and the living.</P>
    <P>It was in relation to advertising that we got some of the strongest submissions. It was in that area also that we commissioned research. In this regard we had a number of things to deal with. There was, first, the extent and quality of advertisements. I do not need to repeat, because it was placed on the record by Senator Dooge earlier, the degree to which the advertisements were offensive, objectively, and were found to be offensive in the reaction of the further research.</P>
    <P>The point that arose immediately was who had control in this area. One is inclined to get from professional bodies <Col N="366" /> the rather pious statement that in every profession there are bad apples, like there are the odd abhorrent people, but by and large the profession is proud of its standards. The very definition of professionalisation in anything is that people have a certain anxiety about status, pride and standards. It became clearly apparent that there was a far distance between the advertising industry's code of standards and reality. On page 8 of the report we quote from the industry's code of standards:</P>
    <P>all advertisements should be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the consumer and to society. No advertisement should explicitly or by implication infringe the principle of the social, economic and cultural equality of the sexes.</P>
    <P>Did that mean that the profession has straightened everything out and would direct us to that as they did early on? The problem was that the submissions which came in and the research findings that had been commissioned all indicated something else and that was the distance between the reality and this particular statement. The proposer of this motion in asking us to note this report has drawn attention to the procedures that exist in terms of who makes the decisions that would implement this particular paragraph. They were singularly ineffective. Even if they were and you decided to invoke this particular paragraph we had the enormous discrepancy between complaints on the basis of sexism and complaints on every other criteria.</P>
    <P>If they were serious about this it would set up a warning in the minds of the advertisers and their body that we were unhappy about the content and the implementing procedures of their very own criteria. But unfortunately there was not a response in the time the committee was sitting. Therefore it was that which moved &mdash; a point I noted earlier &mdash; the committee to come unanimously to the conclusion that we could not rely on self regulation in relation to advertising standards and that there was a need for statutory control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> In relation to some of the other points that had been made, when we were presenting the report at the press conference we prepared a video which drew attention both to offending advertisements and also to advertisements that were trying to induce sexism from outside of this country. Reference has been made already to Canada. It is interesting to note the enormous shock when males were put into the stereotypical situations that females had been in previously. For example, one advertisement dealt with the question of a man furiously trying to get the table ready for his wife and her friends who were coming to dinner. Suddenly, there were males in all of these roles and people were shocked.</P>
    <P>Advertising is located in a society, and this is the interesting fact, in which discrimination and prejudice against women are established and have been rationalised as natural. This question was raised here: can you get out of it if you are an advertiser by simply saying &ldquo;I am here to sell products?&rdquo; That has been answered by the advertisers themselves. They put in this paragraph about cultural, social and economic equality because they knew that the blatant statement, &ldquo;We are there to sell products and that alone&rdquo; would not go down too well. So they did what is now very normal in western societies, they affected a kind of responsibility by putting in this paragraph that I have quoted and then went on to live with the reality of stereotypical discrimination in advertising against women. It is extremely important that we address this.</P>
    <P>The advertiser may well ask, have they the responsibility of undoing the prejudices of society? We do not say that they should be the main carriers of attitude change, but we do say they should not participate in the sustenance and, indeed, the creation and introduction of new forms of prejudice against women by carrying the kind of advertisements they carry. We have said explicitly in this report that we are not satisfied that they are able to enforce any standards themselves. We are to take the responsibility <Col N="368" /> of going before both Houses and asking for legislation in this area and we do so.</P>
    <P>We now turn to the question of the national broadcasting service. They, after all, consume the outcome, the practices of the advertising industry. What is to be their responsibility? Can we, for example, draw a distinction between two particular forms of broadcasting? Supposing we were in a country that said that the market place dominates, and that should be the only criterion as to what the people will wear, what the people will buy. That might be acceptable if you had purely commercial version of broadcasting, something which happily does not prevail yet in this country. We have still a commitment to public service broadcasting, so the first constraint on looking at the treatment of advertisements and their possible sexist content is to note the responsibility that is implied in the very concept of public service broadcasting itself.</P>
    <P>Public service broadcasting has always been justified on the basis that it is claimed to vindicate a wider, more responsible social vision, its cultural responsibility for example, its protection of minority interests and so forth. This to many people represents a tedium at times. It is there right at the centre of the concept of public service broad-casting&mdash;this concept of the public, for example, that goes beyond the private, the concept of service itself, which is an idea that it is provided with some involvement by the State or that there is a consensual basis for it. There is the acceptance of responsibility to minorities as well. Women, as it happens, are not a minority. When we interviewed the representatives of RTE they did not fall back on the ploy of saying &ldquo;We are at the mercy of the people who supply us with advertisements&rdquo;. They had a much more fruitful approach than that. But it did transpire, in the course of the evidence given, that they were in competition with other forms of broadcasting over which they had no control, so what were they to do? In many ways a great deal of the committee's work was spent on this very <Col N="369" /> question. What can a broadcasting network, even a State broadcasting network, do if they are, for example, in competition for viewers and listeners with systems that are outside the jurisdiction altogether and that might be operating under other criteria?</P>
    <P>What can they do in another constraint if the product that is given to them is supplied by someone who has purchased time but has also purchased the advertising material in a finished form? Within RTE, as Senator Dooge has said, there is a copy clearance committee. We were pleased and so noted in the report that although when we began our proceedings and hearings there was no woman on that copy clearance committee by the time we finished our proceedings a woman had been appointed to the committee. That was a helpful development and it will assist in some small way. However, it does not answer the problem so the problem remains.</P>
    <P>I hope many of these gaps will be closed by more procedural measures than by legislation. For example, if you consciously set about it, you must not only operate in terms of avoiding the previous defective type of advertising, but you can seek to undo it. I appeal to RTE to take an initiative, possibly based on the Canadian experience, or any other experience they may wish, to seek to consciously intervene to reverse the kind of assumptions that exist in the minds of the viewing public in relation to the appropriate roles of men and women.</P>
    <P>The question arose as to an area in which apparently there was no responsibility at all. We had evidence given to us about advertorials, for example. As far as the advertising standards as I understand it, were concerned, they were not responsible for advertorials. I quote from page 32, 2.3:</P>
    <P>The members of the Joint Committee were surprised to hear from the Chief Executive of the Advertising Standards for Ireland that advertorials are outside the scope of the Code of Standards of the ASAI.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> An advertorial is an item the contents of which are part advertisement and part editorial.</P>
    <P>Some advertorials are in the opinion of the members advertisements in all but name. The members were appalled at one particular advertorial to them. The words and pictures were blatantly sexist and very offensive in their innuendo. The Advertising Standards Authority claims that advertorials are not advertisments, and that such a presentation has by definition some editorial imput. The members of the Joint Committee wish that the situation be clarified as to where the onus of responsibility lies &mdash; with the Advertising Standards Authority (primarily advertising) or with the NUJ (primarily editorial).</P>
    <P>There, we are being somewhat idealistic in imagining that the NUJ govern the consciousness and thought of our editors, but let us be idealistic. The more important point I do wish to make is that here is a lacuna of response in terms of responsibility in relation to standards in advertising.</P>
    <P>I shall move on from advertising. The points have been so well covered by the mover of this motion that I do not need to be repetitive. I wish to refer to the significance of the innovation which the appointment of a woman member to the copy clearance committee in RTE represented. One must remember, that Radio Telefís Éireann, employing 2,269 people at the time we wrote the report, had 680 female staff among that 2,269. One might think that 680 out of 2,269 represents a certain kind of proportion but, the absence of a woman from such an important committee tells its own story. That is the significance of the development which took place.</P>
    <P>While noting the situation here in Ireland, among the more important sections in the report are those dealing with controls which exist in other countries. We note these in the report. We make reference to the controls which exist in the Scandinavian countries and in Canada, and we make a series of <Col N="371" /> recommendations for the controls which would eliminate the sexist content of advertisements in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Specific legislative proposals are not easy in this area. It is perhaps easiest, in relation to drafting legislation, to specify what is directly offensive. That might be a starting point. It is more difficult &mdash; and it has to be approached in a more complex way &mdash; to tackle this question of the transmission of sexist assumptions in relation to roles. The portrayal of &ldquo;the normal&rdquo; is far more difficult and cannot be directly tackled by legislation. One can only lay down controls and guidelines within which progress can be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>We were not in the business of issuing widespread condemnations. Thus, at the centre of the recommendations are a number of proposals for establishing interim procedures which would enable progress to be made. These involve the establishment of liaison committees, which would include representatives of all of those involved, so that we might make progress together towards the elimination of sexism. In this regard, the committee, leaning back towards its very first report, took cognisance of the importance of education. I want to lay a little more emphasis on that. It is absolutely inadequate, in the kind of world we live in, not to have courses available which make it possible for people to read the media accurately. With the original extension of literacy to vast minorities long after newsprint, people felt that if people could read the Bible only and not Tom Payne, things would be fine. People got into trouble immediately when they began to read widely, including pamphlets. Part of one's adequate participation in society is to be able to read the media. In that sense there should be educational programmes to try to create the capacity in children and young adults to know the significance and content of certain kinds of advertisements as they appear.</P>
    <P>Although it was at the centre of this report the committee were not solely concerned about sexism in advertising. We <Col N="372" /> were interested also in the overall structure of the media, particularly the position of women in the media. I endorse what Senator Dooge said in connection with the interview with Vincent Browne of <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i> It was a very impressive interview. It was very clear that positive procedures had been laid down and that steps were being taken to ensure that women participated in the senior positions within that newspaper.</P>
    <P>In relation to RTE, I have already given the number of people who work there and the proportion who are women. On page 48 of the report one can see the percentage disposal between males and females of the 2,269 people throughout the organisation. Of 241 section heads and higher executives, 220 are male and 21 are female, that is, 8.7 per cent are female. In the technical operational area, of 780 altogether, 727 are male and 53 are female, giving a 6.8 per cent of females in that category. In secretarial clerical administration, of 441 people employed, 366 are female and 75 are male, giving 82.9 per cent of females in that area. Thus, within the structures of perhaps one of the principal media organisations, you have a reflection of a situation which is markedly unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Taking up the question raised earlier of what is statistically significant and what is politically significant, in trying to understand these figures we must ask questions as to what they are telling us. In relation to news, for example, things get a bit better. Of 146 people, 29 are female and 117 are male, that is, 19.9 per cent are female. The figure in programmes on TV is very satisfactory. Of 251 people employed, 128 are female and 123 are male, that is, 51 per cent are female. In programming on radio, 226 are employed, 69 are female and 157 are male, that is, 30.5 per cent are female. In the case of Radio na Gaeltachta, 30 people are employed, four are female and 26 are male &mdash; female employees number 13.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must ask questions as to what these figures tell us in relation to the overall employment pattern of women. Is it not very similar to our first report where we <Col N="373" /> looked at the primary teaching sector and we noted the enormous number of women who were involved in primary teaching, but when we looked for women holding posts of principals of schools they were not there? This led us to tease out the question further about the criteria for the appointment of principals in schools. We found we could not answer the question on the basis of the criteria only, and we had to probe further to the interviewing process.</P>
    <P>From submissions to us in relation to appointments to posts of responsibility and principalships of primary schools, we found that women were being asked questions such as: &ldquo;Will you be getting married?&rdquo;&ldquo;Do you intend having a family?&rdquo;&ldquo;Who will look after the children?&rdquo; Lo and behold, in the natural world, males rose automatically to the principalships of national schools. We are not in a position to say the same thing in relation to the broadcasting system, but the question is there. Why the under representation of women, given the fact that even within the organisation, in some sections women have been so markedly successful in both technical areas and the range of interests they have?</P>
    <P>In relation to women and current affairs, one of the points which came out of the research which was particularly significant to me, was the fact that women, looking at advertisements and looking at portrayals of women in the media, are very angry at the assumption that they are not interested in anything other than domestic grit. Over 80 per cent of them are interested in current affairs, international news and so on.</P>
    <P>Since this report went to print a colleague of mine at Galway University has been preparing another study on a week in the Irish newspapers. Only two or three days ago he drew my attention to the first rough result he had. The study was on photographs and I noted that practically months at a time go by with no woman ever appearing in the business and financial pages of any the Irish newspapers. In addition to that, one can then go looking for women in any capacity throughout the newspapers. One will find <Col N="374" /> that they are not represented 25 per cent of the time. Children, too, are unrepresented in the same way, because the world seems to exclude both to some extent.</P>
    <P>When women do appear, they appear as the appendages of their partners in social events and so forth. There are very few presentations of women in their own right in areas where they are successful, for example, women standing outside Leinster House speaking about matters on which they have introduced motions or legislations. That tells its own story. It is an unfair argument because it introduces a circularity at the annual general meeting of shareholders or the meetings of companies and boards etc. It would be very wrong for me to blame the newspapers for not finding a women present at the annual general meetings of the banks, for example, as they have only just recognised the existence of the gender. In that regard, it is telling us the story that the media are reproducing, in their exclusions as much as their inclusions, a particular image of the society. I could not emphasise sufficiently that this is offensive not only to women. It was pointed out by the people who came to see us that it was found to be offensive by many individuals and groups.</P>
    <P>Another point the committee noted is the manner in which items from abroad can filter into the Irish media in an almost uncritical sense. On page 50 an example is given from a column which appeared in 10 January 1986 under the heading &ldquo;The World in Brief&rdquo;. I quote:</P>
    <P>Evelyn Arroyo, who is seeking a seat on the Hoboken Board Education, has taken off her dress and set the whole town talking. An advertisement in the local newspaper shows her curled in a seductive pose wearing a silken off-the-shoulder negligee....</P>
    <P>What is the point in printing something like that in a &ldquo;World in Brief&rdquo; column other that just some kind of mindless titillation? I would remind the people producing such columns, that we have not got as far as education boards not to speak of elections in education in Ireland. <Col N="375" /> We are very far from people taking off their clothes to get elected to anything like that.</P>
    <P>What is the relevance of something like that being carried in a column headed &ldquo;World in Brief&rdquo;? It is a column that would not carry the fact, for example, that four people are starving themselves to death at this very moment in Washington because of their condemnation of what the Administration are doing to kill, maim, murder and plunder in Nicaragua and that one of them will probably die in the next day or two. That is a fact that apparently is not appearing in the Irish media. One of them is a priest and the other three Vietnam veterans. But the &ldquo;World in Brief&rdquo; can appropriately carry the fact that Evelyn Arroyo, God bless her, has taken off her dress in some God forsaken hole in the United States in order to get elected to an education board.</P>
    <P>I ask this House to take very seriously the recommendations we are making. It is appropriate at this stage, as a member of the committee, to thank the clerk of the committee, John Cullen, and to pay tribute to the members of the committee, particularly its chairperson, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and Deputy Monica Barnes, the vice-chairman, for the work that they have done and also the researchers who have worked with us and the people who made all the submissions. It is very valuable that the work of the committee is coming fairly quickly before the Seanad. I am hopeful that it will generate the necessary legislative response as quickly as possible. It is terribly important that these reports are not allowed to gather dust. In that regard I am not a pessimist at all.</P>
    <P>There has been a response to our report on education. I have welcomed the implementation of those recommendations. I know too that many of our recommendations in relation to social welfare have found their way into the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. I know that we are to some extent ploughing new ground and I ask the House to lend its unanimous voice in an <Col N="376" /> appeal to the appropriate Departments to implement our recommendations as quickly and as effectively as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, like the two previous speakers I am glad to get an opportunity to make my contribution on this report. I would like to start off where Senator M. Higgins finished by paying a tribute to Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the chairman, and Deputy Monica Barnes, the vice-chairman, for their hard work. I would also like to thank Mr. John Cullen for his patience and help on occasions and his assistant Ms. Maura Flanagan. I would also like to thank Ms. Maeve Casey, research psychologist with the department of psychology in UCD. Earlier today I paid a very brief tribute to Deputy Richard Bruton and I will not repeat that except to say that the committee passed a resolution congratulating Deputy Bruton on his promotion and expressing regret at losing the help of such an able and committed member. Together with many other aspects, this shows very clearly that the committee are, as they should be, above party political considerations. That is clear and I am grateful for it.</P>
      <P>I will make a brief reference to the committee system. It is well worth while. It entails a great amount of work. In my case I found difficulty in attending many of the meetings. It is not easy to participate in the meetings and play a part in the proceedings of this House. That is the reservation I would have. Perhaps when reconsidering the committee system at a future date fewer committees might be more helpful, or there could be consideration with regard to meeting at different times when this House is not in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the two previous Members, I want to express thanks to the individuals and groups who made written and oral submissions. I understand these will be published. I would like to know if they are available at present because, while we in the Oireachtas may get copies in the Oireachtas Library, I am sure many people outside would like to get copies <Col N="377" /> of the minutes of those presentations. In terms of this report &mdash; and it is quite an extensive volume &mdash; those minutes would run into many volumes. I should like to ask the Minister if they are readily available. I think they should be.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the report &mdash; and indeed I will only deal with sections of it as it is so comprehensive that it would take very long to go through the whole report &mdash; I should like to deal with the religious aspect and specifically with the ordination of women. I raised this matter at the joint committee meeting on 14 February 1983 and I got a good response. Indeed, I made the case that even in this area we do not have altar girls, not that that would be satisfactory in itself. I have seen many reports since in this regard. Many people would say that we have more important matters to deal with at present such as unemployment and the state of the economy and, indeed, I would agree. Nevertheless, in relation to women's rights I believe this is a very important area. There might be others who would say it is not appropriate for me to make a case in this regard. I feel strongly about it and I got a good response at that committee meeting.</P>
    <P>I am referring specifically to the Catholic Church of which I am a member although I am setting no great headline as a member. There is a basic inequality with regard to women. Men may receive the seven sacraments but women may receive only six. They cannot receive Holy Orders. The difficulty is that the Church upholds the highest moral standards. Nobody would question that. Here we are on this committee trying to do whatever is necessary to achieve equality. How can we expect to get equality when the Church says that women may not be ordained, that for some reason they are not suitable, they are not good enough and they cannot be ordained. I cannot see any difficulty in this regard. The historical fact is that women have never been ordained in the Church, but I do not think there is any great change of dogma necessary to bring about a situation in which women would be ordained, because the <Col N="378" /> Church has life, vitality, growth. The central doctrine of the Church, the Mystical Body of Christ, is alive and growing. There is this evolution in it.</P>
    <P>Like church buildings one cannot be stagnant. We all recall the buildings of our youth. Indeed, some of them are with us still &mdash; the Gothic arches and so on that we identify with the Church. In the Church we have this growth. Buildings have changed and we now have modern buildings. What better evolution could we have or what better development within the Church than that women would be allowed to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders?</P>
    <P>I will finish on this note in regard to this matter. I am no prophet, but I can foretell that the Church will ordain women. If it is to survive for another 2,000 years, and I believe it will, it must come to that decision to ordain women. People ask me am I questioning Christ. I am not doing any such thing. I am putting the case, as this committee are doing, that there should be equal rights for men and women. In this basic area of morality, no case can be made for continuing the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are fairly concise. They are that the joint committee shall:</P>
    <P>(a) examine or propose legislative measures which would materially affect the interests of women,</P>
    <P>(b) consider means by which any areas of discrimination against women can be eliminated, and by which the obstacles to their full participation and the political, social and economic life of the community can be removed.</P>
    <P>(c) consider specific economic and social disadvantages applying to women in the home, and bearing in mind the special nature of their contribution to the community, to recommend effective policy and administrative changes to help eliminate these disadvantages and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas thereon.</P>
    <P>What I would like to say here is that religion is not included. I accept that. <Col N="379" /> Indeed, I am sure religion should not be included. The State should not be involved in religion. But then, and for that reason, it is all the more important to deal in whatever way possible with religious inequality. I know, and indeed today's report in one of the newspapers states very clearly, that there are many women who would not want to be ordained. That is not the basic problem. Even if Holy Orders were available to women and even if no woman wanted to receive Holy Orders, the big question is are women in religion unequal to men? With the situation as it is at the moment, that is as I see it. I believe that should be changed.</P>
    <P>Some people feel that equality in effect is a lowering of the status of women. Some women believe that they are stronger, more principled in character, that many ways it is the women who keep the men on the straight path. I would accept that. But that is in a situation where we have a reaction of women in a loving relationship. It has been said, that we are not saying that women are equal in strength to men or in many other areas. It is a question of equal rights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reports we have dealt with before on education and social welfare, Senator Michael D. Higgins has said there has been an impact. This will extend into the future. This report on the portrayal of women in the media is equally important. Indeed, if it had been selected as our first report, I would not quibble with it. It is of such significance. It is a subject to which the members of the joint committee have devoted considerable time and deliberation. They did so in the belief that the subject is one of importance, not only to Irish women, but also to concerned Irishmen, in other words to society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The committee devoted particular attention in a number of areas, and these are specified; images of women in advertising and their effects, the structure of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland and the application of their code of standards in relation to sexist abuses, controls for sexism in advertising that <Col N="380" /> exist in other countries, the situation of women employed in the media and images of women in broadcast and print media. We had the oral presentations and the written submissions and in addition research was commissioned, as Senator Michael D. Higgins has stated.</P>
    <P>The committee were satisfied from all the representations made to them that there is a high degree of resentment among sectors of the general public at the way in which women are portrayed in parts of the media. I would say this is related to concerned, thinking and forward looking people. The members are committed to elimination of this sexism from out society. Recognising the power of the media to influence attitudes, they attach a high priority to the elimination of sexism from all branches of the media. Some of the Members have dealt in detail with television and indeed television has a great impact. We all know the power of advertising. This is a feature of commercial and business life. Indeed, anyone who has a product to sell knows how important advertising is. In many instances I know that the price of an article is doubled, specifically because advertising is very expensive. But it pays in the long run. In the United States an £8 billion industry in the fifties rose to a £40 billion industry in the seventies. In Ireland £105 million turnover in 1984 grows to £117 million in 1985. That was an extraordinary increase. It is clear that such a high investment would not be countenanced by the industry unless it had an impact. Clearly in this area there is great potential for good, and the reverse.</P>
    <P>All the advertisments project an image. Those targeted on women contain two messages. One is to buy brand X and the other is that women are thus in society. This is easy to understand. The primary purpose is to sell a product, but in addition to selling that product a myth is put across about women, that women are thus. The impact of this is great. The whole trend of the report is geared towards this power. To deny the implicit &ldquo;women are thus&rdquo; message is to deny the efficacy of advertising. Senator Dooge <Col N="381" /> has stated that advertisers would claim that it is not the function of advertising to promote social change. As against that, the manner in which they portray women has an impact on social change, and cognisance should be taken of that. Members drew attention to the industry's own code of conduct which states that all advertisments should be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the consumer and to society, and that no advertisment should explicitly or by implication infringe the principles of the social, economic and cultural equality of the sexes. In a sense, I suppose, this is not terribly strong, but in any event it is the standard. It is the standard or the norm by which industry will judge advertisments.</P>
    <P>In relation to sexism in advertising, the committee dealt with the reports and analyses of various journals. These reveal a consensus as to the main sexist abuses and are dealt with under three headings, (1), the demeaning portrayal of the home maker, that is by far at the top of the list, (2), the exploitation of the female body and (3), failure to mirror current reality in role patterns. This research has been condensed into a rather compact table. Senator Dooge has referred to it and I should like to take the important parts of this table which is worked out under three headings, (a), female image portrayed in advertisements (b), criteria of sexism and (c), rationale for criteria of sexism.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of home maker the criteria are woman as dependent, male authority voice-overs, male expert advisers and women as unintelligent. The rationale for criteria of sexism suggests woman incapable of doing basic domestic tasks on her own authority or on a shared authority with her partner, the home maker reaching unparalleled heights of ecstacy from doing basic domestic tasks or being obsessional about certain domestic chores.</P>
    <P>Under the second heading, the decorative female is subcategorised under the headings of carefree, fashion, sensual and sex symbol. The criterion there is that excessive use fails to mirror the current reality of women in a wider diversity of roles. That excessive use implies that the <Col N="382" /> female main role in life is to be passively decorative. The criterion with regard to the sex symbol is nudity as eye catcher, and the rationale or criteria of sexism are use of female body solely as attention getter; woman as object; exploitation of female body, and other areas which I will not mention in regard to the concept of decorative female.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, consideration is given to modern woman combining a career with a home making role. The criteria there are excessive avoidance of modern woman &mdash; failure to mirror current reality in role patterns with the rationale denying current reality of the growing number of women's lifestyles.</P>
    <P>Number four relates to the older woman and the criterion there is excessive avoidance of indeed, we could go so far as to say total avoidance of the older woman. This suggests that the older woman is better hidden or invisible, even privately, given the portrayal of domestic life in advertising.</P>
    <P>The last consideration is of authority in voice-overs. We note that there is excessive use of male authority voice-overs and that this fails to mirror the reality of women as comprising over 50 per cent of the population. I do not spend very long in front of television but even so I note that we have these voice-overs. I realise that many of these advertisements are prepared in other countries and that it will take some time before this report will have effect in that regard, but I will be looking out for that.</P>
    <P>With regard to sexism in advertising in Ireland, the committee found that in order to present reliable and accurate information regarding the portrayal of women in advertising it was necessary to commission research. Part of this involved the collation of 339 advertisements under certain categories from television, radio, magazines, newspapers, buses and billboards during the period March and April 1985. It is interesting to note from the table supplied in the report with regard to that research that of the total number of 339, 84 were related to home maker. Of these, 27 had <Col N="383" /> own or shared authority, 45 had a male authority and 12 had no voice-over. The decorative female category had a staggering number of 183 out of 339, 44 showes the female as carefree, 66 as sensual, 38 as fashionable and 35 as sex objects. Therefore, of the 339, 84 and 133 involved the home maker or the decorative female.</P>
    <P>Let me make a brief comment on that research. Of the advertisements using a home maker image 54 per cent suggested with their choice of voice-over that a woman performed her domestic duties subject to male authority and a number of these implied that women attach enormous importance to basic domestic chores.</P>
    <P>In the category excessive use of decorative females in advertisements, 54 per cent suggested that a woman's main role in life was to be decorative and a majority of these showed woman as passive. Of the advertisements referred to 19 per cent were blatantly exploitive in using women as sex objects and only four per cent portrayed women in any work whatever outside the home, including the most traditional female work areas such as clerk, secretary, teacher, nurse and factory worker. It is noted that almost 80 per cent of the advertisements sampled showed women in the glamour girl, home maker dichotomy and only 1 per cent of the advertisements portrayed older women, while 82 per cent of radio advertisements for non-domestic products used male voice-overs, thus failing to reflect that over 50 per cent of the population is female.</P>
    <P>The report comes to the conclusion that these findings present a narrow, limited, inaccurate and at times exploitive portrayal of women. Could anybody really question those findings? I do not think so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effects of sexist advertising, the cumulative effect of this portrayal hour after hour, day after day, week after week, is to undermine women whether their primary roles be as home makers or participants in the labour force. It does not mirror current reality <Col N="384" /> in role patterns. More important, this undermining is bound to counteract the work being done in other areas such as schools, industry, trade unions and among all concerned people who want change in this area. It is not suggested that advertisers set out consciously to demean women; of course they do not, but the widespread use of sexism in advertising indicates a grave awareness with regard to the advertising industry and is contrary to their own code of standards &mdash; the standards of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland &mdash; which state, and this has been mentioned by Senator Higgins:</P>
    <P>All advertisements should be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the consumer and society. No advertisement should explicitly or by implication infringe the principle of the social, economic and cultural equality of the sexes.</P>
    <P>That is not as positive as we would wish but nevertheless it is a norm and if the advertisements shown on television were compared with it, they would not be allowed. This portrayal of women is inaccurate at all times &mdash; the report states &ldquo;at times&rdquo;. It is common to so many people that it poses a real problem, not only for today but for the future. This is the nub of the problem.</P>
    <P>The constant exposure of young impressionable people to this type of advertising will lead them inevitably to believe in it and many of them will accept it as true. Over a long period the effect of this type of advertising will certainly influence women as to how they should behave and convey to men and to boys an impression as to how women should behave. If they do not behave in that manner they are stepping outside their role and misbehaving. This lays down the parameters to the role women must play. This is the major problem. It is impossible to understand fully the impressions advertisements make on young people. In that area, there is no room for the many women who have special talents. The media are one area which shows that women have many talents. The talented <Col N="385" /> well known women journalists are proof of that. I am tempted to name some of them but, on reflection, it might be better not to. Everybody will accept the statement that women in journalism and in the media could be considered superior to men.</P>
    <P>With regard to woman as the home maker, this is an important area. A number of submissions emphasised that many advertisements implied that a woman's place is only in the home, that her only work is housework and that this is the only basis for asserting her worth. She is shown as being interested only in serving her husband and children without regard to her own talents or ambitions. She is seen as a docile, passive and contented individual. While advertisements might show the woman in that light, many married men would say otherwise. I say that in passing. These advertisements show a woman as being unsure of herself and always needing the advice of a man and his approval for anything she does, buys or wears. Most of the advertisements are for products used mostly by women.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the preponderance of male voice-overs which, in one sense, is insulting to women, with regard to such items as washing machines, detergents, polishes and so on. In any of the advertisements I have seen on television, I cannot recall seeing a man wearing an apron washing up dishes. Perhaps there is such an advertisement, but if there is, I am sure it would be typical of modern life in Ireland where increasingly the husband is playing his part with the domestic chores. The report asks how many men know anything about these articles. Even when they help in the home, I am sure they depend on the judgment of the woman of the house.</P>
    <P>The joint committee are not denigrating the value of the work of a woman in the home. On the contrary it is a contribution Members believe our culture has consistently undervalued. It must be emphasised that the talents of a woman extend beyond the area of the kitchen. There is a growing tendency for the work to be shared by the man and the woman, <Col N="386" /> but this fact does not seem to have permeated through to the advertisers. This portrayal implies that the woman is lacking in intelligence and that her interests outside the home are nil. It is inaccurate in that it suggests men do not share the housework with their partners. It shows the woman slavishly tied to the kitchen sink. Those of us involved in house design know that the trend is to get away from the kitchen sink and this trend has been very successful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the woman as a decorative female sex object, the proliferation of advertisements which depict women as sex objects or mere decorations suggests that women are obsessed by their bodies and by being sexually attractive to men. This type of advertising reinforces the impression that a woman cannot be appreciated as a person in her own right, a person with intelligence, chosen for her intelligence and appreciated for her intelligence, but for such things as hair style, make-up, perfume, clothes or lack of clothes, which make her attractive to men. This is insulting. It undervalues the intelligence of women and those who watch the advertisements. It is interesting to note that, in advertisements of this kind, women are always portrayed as young, pretty and slim. It would seem that in the world of advertising the heavy hand of old age never touches the female form. This is a totally unreal situation.</P>
    <P>The report stated that the portrayal of a woman as a sex object to promote the sale of goods and services is, in effect, an affront to the dignity and the intelligence of the human person. It stated that the continued portrayal of women in such situations as decorative additions to merchandise can result only in a lowering of the status and dignity of women in society. It was represented to the joint committee that such a portrayal is on a continuum from soft to hard pornography. Those are very strong words. It is a very strong condemnation but who can say it is extreme? Who can say it is exaggerated? It puts it in its proper light as viewed by the committee.</P>
    <P>The report stated that while it cannot <Col N="387" /> be shown there is direct link between such portrayal and the sexual abuse of women, it is reasonable to infer that the portrayal of women as sex objects conditions the mind to accepting them as such. Advertisers must realise they have a responsibility in this regard to portray women in a non-sexist and dignified fashion.</P>
    <P>The Advertising Authority for Ireland have been referred to. They are a voluntary body responsible for both broadcast and print advertising. I wish to express my gratitude to them for the help they gave the committee. The Code of Advertising Standards for Ireland is administered by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland. It is a voluntary code containing a specific reference which deals with sexism. The code states <i>inter alia</i> that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;all advertisements should be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the consumer and to society. No advertisement should explicitly or by implication infringe the principle of the social, economic and cultural equality of the sexes.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer to see that in a positive rather than in a negative light. It also stated that all advertisements should be legal, decent, honest and truthful. Quite frankly, I find this to be rather ambiguous. Some of the advertisements to which the committee would take grave exception might possibly be justified when considered in the light of those criteria.</P>
    <P>The report stated that between the period May 1981 and February 1985 almost 10 per cent of the 945 complaints by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland related to sexist issues. Some 945 complaints were received and of these 727 were not pursued. Of the total number received 92 relation to sexism, 16 were not pursued, 76 were pursued and 22 were upheld, 29 per cent. The report made this comment in connection with the matter.</P>
    <P>Of the 92 complaints relating to <Col N="388" /> sexism, 76 were pursued. Of these complaints 22 relating to three sexist advertisements were upheld. In the latter case the offending advertisments were withdrawn but no fines were imposed on the manufacturers, advertising agencies or media involved. Whilst the members accept that the low number of complaints received suggest public apathy on this issue, they find it deplorable that in the case of 36 complaints made and not upheld (mainly relating to the portrayal of women as a sex object) the specific clause of the ASAI code relating to sexism appears to have been ignored. Complaints were rejected on the grounds that they were not in breach of a general clause in the code which states that&mdash;</P>
    <P>advertisements should contain nothing which is likely, in the light of generally prevailing standards of decency and propriety, to cause grave or widespread offence.</P>
    <P>I find this is very vague and not at all forward looking. Something more specific is required there.</P>
    <P>The report states that members of the ASAI interviewed claim they had a difficulty in interpreting the clause covering sexism in their own code. The committee suggested that the criteria laid down in the table in the report be accepted.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins referred to advertorials. An advertorial is neither an editorial nor an advertisement. It is difficult to come to a conclusion as to who is responsible for it. It seems to me that an advertorial is a clever way of pretending that something advertised is recommended by the editorial staff. I am sure it is very effective. I will not go so far as to say it is deceitful, but in a situation where so many people would read an advertorial and accept it as editorial input I think it is deceitful. Advertorials, as I understand them, are not related solely to text; pictures are included. This is an area where it is necessary to have some kind of definition as to who is responsible. I hope this will be done in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> The committee made certain recommendations for change in the ASAI. They were satisfied that, if the existing code of standards were strengthened by the inclusion of a specific section dealing with the portrayal of women, including proper guidelines as to what is and is not acceptable in the whole area of advertising, the agencies and the industry in general would become more aware of the need to eliminate sexism to reflect the reality of the rapidly changing role of women in society.</P>
    <P>The code of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland at present contains ten appendices setting out rules to be adhered to in relation to the advertising of specific goods and services but, significantly, there are no rules, regulations or guidelines to cover the portrayal of women in advertising. The committee consider that omission should be rectified immediately. I feel if this were done it would do much good and it would in itself justify the work of the committee. Again, the committee suggest that the criteria laid down in table 1 in the report be adopted.</P>
    <P>The broadcast media have been referred to by Senator Dooge and Senator Michael Higgins. The role of Radio Telefis Éireann as the national broadcasting service is vital to any discussion of women in the media. The joint committee expressed thanks to the Liaison Group on Women in Broadcasting and the copy clearance committee of RTE for appearing before them, setting out the situation as they saw it in RTE and also to the management and staff who gave the fullest co-operation at all times.</P>
    <P>The report states that in January 1979 a working party was set up by the RTE Authority to examine the position with regard to women in broadcasting. Its terms of reference covered three specific areas: (1) representation of women in programmes, in terms both of actual participation and programme orientation; (2) job opportunities in broadcasting; and (3) portrayal of women in advertising. All advertisements on television are subject to the code of conduct of the ASAI <Col N="390" /> but RTE also operate their own code of conduct for standards in broadcast advertising.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge dealt with the question of the copy clearance committee and pointed out that it did not have even one lady member. It is very difficult to understand how in an organisation where so many women are employed and have made a big impact that this is so. The committee were very disappointed to discover that. However, as Senator Dooge said, arrangements were made to draft one lady onto the copy clearance committee and we were promised it would be done by September 1985 but this deadline was not met. Nevertheless, in October 1985 a woman was drafted onto that copy clearance committee. The joint committee made it clear that they wanted a very competent person, somebody who would make a big impact on that committee and I believe this has been done. The committee also had reservations about the composition of the copy clearance committee and Senator Dooge referred to that. Members were drawn solely from the managers sales division and the committee thought it was very important to have consumer representation on that committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the print media the image most prevalent in advertisements is that of the decorative female. Members of the joint committee are very conscious of the importance of portraying a woman in an attractive way but they rejected the narrowness of vision which emphasises this aspect of femininity to the exclusion of all other aspects of a woman's life. Appendix J to the Code of Advertising Standards states:</P>
    <P>Advertisements should neither claim nor suggest that any drink can contribute towards sexual success or make the drinker more attractive to the opposite sex.</P>
    <P>Yet this is being done. It is difficult to understand how, in view of that part of the code, these advertisements got through but, nevertheless, that is the reality.</P>
    <P>In their recommendations with regard <Col N="391" /> to control of sexism in advertisements here the committee felt it was necessary to have a statutory regulation for the control of advertising. We considered the position in ten countries that had various means of controlling advertising. Canada is one country where a voluntary code seems to be successful. Other countries had less success but the committee came to the conclusion with regard to the progress being made here and the want of concern, that statutory regulations were important. The committee felt it was important that in any new legislation there would be a specific clause covering sexism in advertising. The report dealt with Norway where there is a specific statute and although the clause seemed rather innocuous to me it appears to be very effective. The clause is as follows:</P>
    <P>The advertiser and anyone who creates advertising shall ensure that the advertisement does not conflict with the inherent equality between the sexes, and that it does not imply any derogatory judgment of either sex, or portray a man or woman in an offensive manner.</P>
    <P>The committee suggest that in order to aid the transition to non-sexist advertising a liaison committee should be established. The joint committee felt this should be comprised of one ASAI representative from each of the following groups: advertisers, advertising practitioners, broadcast media and print media. It should also have one representative of consumer interests, nominated by the Director of Consumer Affairs and two representatives of women's affairs nominated by the Council for the Status of Women. Members recommended that the liaison committee in pursuit of their aims should take the following steps:</P>
    <P>(1) prepare guidelines of do's and dont's towards a positive portrayal of women in advertising.</P>
    <P>That is important, could be very effective and would not be in any way inhibiting. The recommendations continue:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> (2) prepare an audio visual presentation on sexism in advertising to be made available to the industry, consumer groups, women's groups and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>(3) that speakers be available to address interested groups, in particular groups from the advertising industry.</P>
    <P>(4) that a bibliography of sexism in advertising be prepared and made available on request.</P>
    <P>(5) that the committee's role as watchdog for the primary consumer group in our society as regards her portrayal in advertising, be made public.</P>
    <P>Like other Members I should like to thank the editors of the Irish Sunday newspapers who came before us. Members of the committee were disappointed that one editor declined an invitation to appear before the joint committee and a copy of his letter is included in our report. It has been referred to already and I do not intend to spend any time on it except to say I was disappointed with the letter. The editor of that newspaper stated:</P>
    <P>My own view is that there is a considerable difference between men and women. They look different, for a start and I firmly believe that a tractor adorned by a girl in a bikini is infinitely more pleasing to the human eye than the same tractor adorned by a man in Y-fronts.</P>
    <P>With regard to that point, the exploitation of the female body, the report states:</P>
    <P>The distaste experienced by women's rights activists at the exploitation of the female body in a National Sunday newspaper is well known. The members of this committee find it regrettable that the NUJ continue to tolerate such blatant, flagrant, and persistent infringements of their own Code of Professional Conduct.</P>
    <P>The point has been answered perfectly by Senator Dooge. Anybody trying to sell a tractor will be hoping to sell it for agricultural use and, while I am sure there <Col N="393" /> are many women playing a very important role on the farm and driving tractors, it is not a decorative role, and people will buy a tractor for what it can do rather than on the basis of a picture in a paper.</P>
    <P>The religious basis this editor referred to was dealt with and is interesting. He concluded:</P>
    <P>And I don't think that me sitting in a room answering questions is going to change the fact that women, by and large, not only look different to men, but also think differently and act differently.</P>
    <P>My regret in this regard is that in order to make inroads into this problem it is very important to have the co-operation of all those who are in such vital positions. This editor, if he came before us, while he did refer in a perjorative way to the august body, would find that the emphasis was in trying to deal with this great problem. I very much regret that the editor of such an important paper could not see his way to play a part in the work we were trying to do.</P>
    <P>Any lowering in the dignity and status of woman is an offence against the whole human family and is resented by both male and female. The joint committee presented the report to all the interested parties in a spirit of co-operation and goodwill. The study by the members was not intended to antagonise or upset anybody or any group and criticisms in the report arise only after long and careful deliberations, from their commitment to eliminate sexism and from the point of view that it could not be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The final part of the report is as follows and is important. It is stated on page 70:</P>
    <P>Every individual can play a part in promoting the concept of equality between the sexes, but nowhere is the opportunity to do so as great as in the mass media, that powerful moulder of attitudes. This opportunity must be grasped by all concerned so that the days of negative and unreal portrayal of women be a thing of the past, and women are seen to have equal rights with men in the pursuit of fulfilment <Col N="394" /> and happiness, be their primary contribution as homemakers or in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply. As the two previous reports on education and social welfare made a considerable impact, I hope that this report will make an even greater impact because it affects everybody; nobody escapes from it. For that reason, I look forward to immediate and long term results from this very comprehensive report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief and I do not intend to go through the whole report. It has been adequately dealt with by the other people who have spoken in the House but there are a few points I wish to make. The concept of equality of the sexes is not freely understood, particularly in Ireland, and the confusion about the fact that men and women are different tends to lead to the conclusion in some parts that because they are different they cannot be equal. They can be different and equal at the same time of course. It is a difficult concept to get across sometimes. Interestingly, I wished to acquire a new pup in my household recently and when I rang the vet for advice as to what kind of a pup to get, always being aware of the difficulties of having a bitch in the house at certain times of the year, she said that bitches are far more intelligent. I do not know if that is the case with humans, I should like to think we are all equally intelligent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one would disagree with the fact that the most important influence in modern times is the media, particularly television. Therefore, the transmission of an attitude through television of an inferior status of women will make the job of attaining equality between the sexes much more difficult. There is not much point in making progress in the educational sphere &mdash; as indeed progress has been made &mdash; by encouraging girls to take up science subjects and saying that they can do jobs that heretofore were considered to be in the male province only if the media are screaming at us all the time that women are inferior and <Col N="395" /> only fit for certain roles in life. They are putting across an attitude which is not in tandem with the realities of modern living and, therefore, it is important that changes should be made. I agree that it will require legislation, I do not think it will happen voluntarily because there is no awareness of the problem. I do not think that even many women are aware of the fact because it is done very subtly on television. People tend to accept what they see in advertising without analysing it or without realising that a certain attitude is being subtly pushed. I do not think that the advertisers deliberately create a situation where they maintain women in an inferior status; it just happens to be the custom.</P>
    <P>The other proposal at the end of the report that there should be a proposal to introduce media studies into the curriculum in secondary schools which would include a study of sexism in advertising is very important and ought to be taken up because until people are fully aware of the extent of the problem there is no chance of dealing with it. As we all know, it is only when public awareness is heightened about the problem and pressure put on politicians and on other people that things begin to happen.</P>
    <P>Traditional attitudes regarding the superiority of the male or the role of the woman in the domestic area will not change because of the vicious circle in relation to women not getting promotion. heretofore, they were not educated to take up certain jobs but even nowadays there is an attitude that women are not fit for these jobs. There is also the other hurdle of convincing people that women are fit for these jobs but if the media promote traditional attitudes then you are not really dealing with the problem, you are just creating a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>We must begin with education and I was horrified to read the pages about women in the media, especially women in RTE. Although I accept what is said in the report that there is a certain amount of satisfaction with the way the RTE Authority made their submissions, were prepared to listen and to deal with <Col N="396" /> the problem, we still have a very long way to go. I note that between 1981 and 1985 the percentage of women in the higher echelons of RTE went up by something like 6 per cent. It is a very small percentage increase.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the women who have made it into the higher echelons, particularly, those who are fronting on RTE and when you think of how capable and how good they are, how they have proven that women are equal and in some cases, as in all walks of life, are more equal than some men it is distressing to note that the position in 1985 was that with 30 per cent of the workforce in RTE being women you still had a situation where very small percentages, which Senator Michael D. Higgins has already referred to, were in the higher executive places and heads of Departments positions while 82.9 per cent of women were in what we might refer to when discussing discrimination in Northern Ireland, the more menial jobs, the humdrum jobs, the clerical jobs. There is a very serious imbalance.</P>
    <P>When we have regard to those women who have made it to the top in RTE we must realise that the imbalance regarding women in the higher positions cannot be attributed to lack of ability. Neither can it be attributed to a lack of applications by women for jobs in the higher echelons because I note on page 49 that in recruitment and promotion within RTE in 1984, of the total number of applications, 4,143, there were 2,074 female applicants and 2,069 male applicants so there is an equal distribution of applications but yet when it comes down to actual recruitment and promotion female applicants take a steep drop and come down to 33 per cent of the 50 per cent who applied. There still seems to be a problem.</P>
    <P>There is asked towards the end of the report the question of whether RTE's present level of commitment is enough. I just wonder if it is? I would be prepared to be convinced but I think that the best way of convincing people of that is by action. When we see more women fronting programmes and being promoted to senior executive posts in RTE we will be <Col N="397" /> able to say that there is no bias within that media. I am sorry to harp so much on RTE but it is after all the national broadcasting system. If they do not give a lead in this area, it is a poor look out for other voluntary bodies whom we try to goad into action from time to time.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say except to reinforce the point that there is a vicious circle and that unless that vicious circle is broken the inferior status of women will tend to perpetuate itself or at least will be more difficult to deal with. Standards in advertising have a crucial role to play in helping us to come to terms with the need for equality between the sexes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how pleased I am to be in this House for this debate and to say that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights were very well represented by Senators Dooge, Fitzsimons and Higgins who contributed to the debate. Women generally were well served by their contributions.</P>
      <P>I welcome this document. It is well researched. It is reasoned and it is non-party political. It will contribute greatly to, first, creating greater public awareness of the existing defects in this area of the portrayal of women in the media and also to changing attitudes and practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt, as the report indicates, that there is resentment. I would even go further and say there is a great anger among women particularly and among others, too, about the way they are portrayed in sections of the media. Since I was appointed I have been getting letters and phone calls from women. They came from women who one could only describe as very steamed up at a particular advertisement they would have read or seen. They feel very helpless because they feel they are the victims and can do nothing about it. They ask me to intervene and take some action. I am happy to say that I have intervened. I have written to the advertisers for various products and either asked to meet them or put forward the case that would be put to me by a particular woman or women's <Col N="398" /> group. In many instances these advertisers have been very pleased and conciliatory in so far as they would not have thought that their advertisement was either distressing or offensive.</P>
    <P>The women who phone me or who write to the Council for the Status of Women or to somebody else are the ones that are really angry. There is another group who subconsciously are uncomfortable and who may not even articulate this discomfort but they will talk to their friends about it. On a purely financial basis I suggest that it cannot be good for the product if the advertising of certain products is making the consumer, the individual that is supposed to buy on the basis of the advertisement, as uncomfortable and as unhappy as that.</P>
    <P>The report concentrates largely on current images of women in advertising. The efficacy of advertising as a means of selling ensures that it is now an established feature of commercial and business life. But it goes much further in that it comes into all our homes and influences our opinions and those of our children. It is, therefore, appropriate for the joint committee to devote so much of their report to this area and their finding that advertising generally provides a narrow, limited, inaccurate and at times exploitative portrayal of women should be a cause of great concern and their observation that the cumulative effect of this portrayal, through constant repetition, not only fails to mirror current reality in role patterns but is undermining of women, is worthy of the most considered attention.</P>
    <P>The report does not suggest that advertisers set out consciously to produce these effects. On the contrary, it states that while it is true that many members of the industry pride themselves on their professionalism, and find the suggestion that some of their practices are sexist and an embarrassment, many of these professionals appear to have no clear awareness of what constitutes sexism.</P>
    <P>This I find is more disquieting than if a deliberate attempt had been made to undermine the status of women. To be <Col N="399" /> fair to advertisers, this lack of awareness is not confined to them. The joint committee found a need for an increased awareness among editors and journalists to portray women in a realistic fashion and to veer away from the condescending and trite way in which women and their affairs are so often presented in print. In the case of RTE, the transmission of advertisements that are blatantly sexist and offensive is seen as indicative of a general apathy and indifference to the sensitivities of women viewers in particular.</P>
    <P>Looked at in the most charitable light, many of the images, with which we are constantly bombarded, of the women's role in the home, in the workforce, etc. are outdated, if they were ever true.</P>
    <P>But even if the only fault is out-datedness, that fault alone is highly offensive in the context of the great strides which have taken place in the provision of equal status for women in our society through the implementation of wide-ranging, anti-discrimination legislation in the past decade or so. The roles and perceptions of women have, as a result, been changing rapidly and dramatically with the result that very many women, to their advantage, are reappraising their potential, ambitions and aspirations.</P>
    <P>So, should the media not be helping women to broaden their horizons instead of insidiously promoting concepts of women which are detrimental, even if blameworthiness can be attributed only to inertia and ignorance?</P>
    <P>The perpetuation of the concept of male dominance is not always overt. The use of male voice-overs is often sufficient to suggest that women perform their duties subject to male authority. A summary report published recently by the EC Commission on how women are represented on television programmes in the EC points out that these voice-overs imply that men advise and women buy. We find in the same report that Ireland has the highest proportion of male voice-overs in the EC at 94.2 per cent. The research conducted in connection with <Col N="400" /> the joint committee's report found that 82 per cent of radio advertisements for non-domestic products used male voice-overs, thus failing to reflect that over 50 per cent of the population is female.</P>
    <P>The only fail-safe method of guaranteeing balanced advertising is by the involvement of women at all levels of the media business. The EC report to which I have referred concludes that positive action should include &ldquo;all the measures which aim, through a sustained effort, to change the rules of the game&rdquo; in order to eliminate the factors which automatically reproduce inequalities as detrimental to women&rdquo;. They say that this definition embraces the objectives and methods by which changes can be wrought not only in programmes content but also in the institutional bodies, the work environment, attitudes and the cultural and aesthetic standards that apply in our society.</P>
    <P>Substantial emphasis is placed on the involvement of women in management, programme design and direction posts which are held largely by men. According to the report of the Joint Committee, the highest post held in the management structure of RTE by a women is head of department. The committee are convinced that a stronger female presence in mainstream news and current affairs programmes would enhance output and recommend a stronger female presence at all levels, in particular in policy and decision-making positions. There is also room for improvement in the print media and the fact that many women journalists in the national papers have a high profile belies the reality that the Dublin news branch of the NUJ has a female membership of only 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>The committee recommend the introduction of statutory controls for the elimination of sexism in advertising. The point is made that voluntary controls have not proved sufficient and that, therefore, more persuasive control is needed. Statutory controls have already been introduced for advertisements connected with employment under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the <Col N="401" /> extension of that control is being considered in the context of my proposals for an equal status Bill in the broad area of goods, facilities and services which I hope to be in a position to submit to the Government very shortly.</P>
    <P>The committee cite the relevant section from a Norwegian statute governing sexism in advertising and recommend that controls similar to those in Norway be introduced in this country. The section in question requires that an advertisement must not conflict with the inherent equality between the sexes, imply any derogatory judgment of either sex, or portray a man or woman in an offensive manner.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, what is a derogatory judgment or what is an offensive portrayal could give rise to considerable difficulties of interpretation, particularly at a time when the status of women is still undergoing beneficial change. A summary of a paper given to an Independent Broadcasting Authority Conference in 1984 contains some interesting observations:</P>
    <P>The portrayal of women is a majority issue in that there are more women then men and a series of smaller issues in that a wide range of diverse opinions are held, some by the same individuals at different times or in different circumstances. There is no archetypal portrayal of today's women which could or should be the basis of all broadcast advertising.</P>
    <P>The paper points out that while irrelevant nudity certainly gives offence, especially when accompanied by innuendo, a presentation which portrays women as being sexually attractive, relevant to the product being advertised and not tasteless, would make the question as to whether there is offence debatable.</P>
    <P>Advertisers could argue that the majority of products advertised on our screens are not primarily being sold to women in their working role and because it is mainly women who cook and because they cook in their domestic and not in <Col N="402" /> their workplace situations, they are portrayed thus. Whether we like it or not, the argument is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Examples are also given in the paper of how changing the gender of the person shown can change the message. It is a perceptual problem in that to many people a man in front of a keyboard indicates that he is using a computer, whereas a woman shown in the same situation is looked on as a typist. It must be remembered that the people connected with the making of advertisements are masters of the perceptual arena and are acknowledged experts in creating illusions.</P>
    <P>I find it quite surprising that advertisers are not more in tune with women's own perception of their place in modern society. After all, 80 per cent of consumers are women and if advertisers wish to communicate effectively with today's women and capitalise on the massive spending power which they represent, they would be well advised to look into the area of women's self perception and change their tactics accordingly. It amazes me that what has been aptly described as &ldquo;the notion of woman as a sort of scatterbrained domestic prostitute&rdquo; is still very prevalent, particularly in detergent commercials. The advertiser's brief must be to present the client's product in the most favourable light to the potential customer. It must appeal to the target group and if it offends the potential customer, or offends someone who will influence a potential customer, then it is has negative effects.</P>
    <P>Advertisers have no wish to upset anyone and it is reasonable to believe that where mistakes are made they are not made with any malice. Indeed, the effects of mistakes can be costly for both advertisers and the product which they advertise. We had an example earlier this year of a food product commercial which was withdrawn following complaints from the National Grocers' Association. The National Director of RGDATA said at the time that women were as integral a part of food retailing as men &ldquo;and should not be depicted as being unsupportive and unaware and lacking in intelligence&rdquo;. It is this type of public pressure <Col N="403" /> which will force advertisers to adopt a fresh approach.</P>
    <P>The blunders which are made in relation to advertisements could be avoided if sufficient thought went into their production. It is clear that there is no offence intended and awareness programmes for those involved should go a long way towards eliminating these aberrations. The committee's recommendations that media studies to include sexism in advertising be introduced into the secondary curriculum, that a liaison committee be established to work in cooperation with the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland towards the elimination of sexism in advertising, the inclusion of female consumer representation on the ASAI's committee of management and on the RTE copy clearance committee would, I am convinced, bring about significant improvements I am glad to say that the female representation on the copy clearance committee has come about.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the EC report on women in television programmes on the EC. In its conclusions, the report says that &ldquo;while an attempt might be made to control advertisers and advertising agencies by the imposition of regulations, experience has shown that there are plenty of opportunities for circumventing the rules. We have the example of cigarette advertising: where it was banned or restricted, companies produce advertisements showing matches or lighters &ldquo;dressed up&rdquo; in the same packaging as the cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Any steps must be taken by the advertisers and advertising agencies themselves and it is they, therefore, who must be made aware of what is at stake. Their voluntary participation on advertising standards boards where sexual discrimination is one of the elements considered is likely to be far more effective than any form of legislation.</P>
    <P>This having been said, advertisers and their publicity agents could be persuaded first, by the establishment of an award or competition for material which attempts to promote a positive image of women, <Col N="404" /> secondly, by campaigns conducted by consumer associations and womens' organisations in order, for example, to encourage women to use or buy the products of firms striving to promote alternative images of women and, thirdly, making films or sequences which satirise the traditional practice, for example, by making use of role reversal.</P>
    <P>The EC report, in a recommendation similar to that of the joint committee, states that an education campaign should be mounted in teaching establishments aimed at pupils and teachers alike which would help them to develop a critical attitude towards what they see on their television screens.</P>
    <P>While the question of statutory reform in this area is one which will require careful consideration, the very fact that this report has been completed, that it is being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas with the attendant publicity this will bring and that so many Dáil and Seanad Members have obviously contributed much time and effort in preparing this report will guarantee that there will be an immediate improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>To quote once again from the EC summary report: &ldquo;Generally speaking, it seems to us that the chief tool to bring about any change for the better is for people to be made aware of the issues. The mere uncovering of the facts is a prerequisite in improving a situation which until now has been poorly researched, summarised, interpreted and understood&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope time will see the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report. I look forward in particular to seeing a stronger female presence in all sections of the media as it is only then that I feel the elimination of all types of undesirable advertising will be assured. I have no doubt that women themselves at all levels of society would be quick to dispel attitudes and proposals involving outmoded and inaccurate traditional concepts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My case will be very brief. The Minister is a liberal minded man and I hope he will listen to my plea to reverse this decision. Objection has been voiced to it all over the country. On the board in the National Museum is a notice saying that Treasury of Irish Antiquities admission charges to the Treasury will be introduced as and from Wednesday, 24 September 1986: (1) Adult: £1, special rates for groups; (2) Child 30p; (3) Student 50p, over 18 on production of student card; (4) Family ticket £2; (5) Old age pensioners/ unwaged, free. There will be free admission each Tuesday. It was a retrograde and unfortunate decision to make a charge for admission to the treasury area of Irish Antiquities. After all, this is where some of the great examples of our heritage are kept. I got a brochure in the museum which lists some of the most important ones. As I come from Meath, No. 1 on that list would be the Tara Brooch. It also includes The Broighter Hoard, the Ardagh Chalice, <Col N="406" /> the Petrie Crown, the Derrynaflan Chalice and Paten, the Cross of Cong, St. Patrick's Bell and its Shrine, the Crozier of the Abbots of Clonmacnoise, Domnach Airgid Shrine and many more which are listed in &ldquo;Celtic Ireland&rdquo;, another brochure.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that in effect we are preventing people from visiting and examining our heritage. It is unfortunate that at a time when the environment is of such importance, when Bills have come before this House, for instance the Air Pollution Bill, and when we are trying to convince our young people of the importance of being patriotic, we are denying people access to these treasures. That is most unfortunate with regard to schools who have pupils interested in the aesthetics and design of Irish antiquities.</P>
      <P>What income is expected to accrue from these charges and what is the cost of collecting them? One of my major objections is that this is the thin edge of the wedge. Once this has been established and accepted, the next step will be to increase the charges, or perhaps to have a charge for other areas of the museum and this is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure about charges elsewhere in Europe, but I visited most of the major museums in London about two months ago and there were no admission charges into any of them. In the British Museum there was a request for voluntary subscriptions but nobody was kept out if they did not make a subscription. Even if there are admission charges to museums in the rest of Europe, so what? Do we have to follow by having those charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People will suffer a loss by not being able to go to the museum. There is free access on Tuesday so already the museum is rather packed on Tuesdays and there are very few visitors on other days. Special arrangements are made to cater for the public, to give them an opportunity to visit the museum, both in regard to the time and to the days on which it is open. The museum is closed on Monday and is open on Saturday and on all other days for the convenience of the public. It is infortunate, therefore, that this <Col N="407" /> decision has been made. There is disquiet in many other areas where charges are made. I saw a letter in most of the papers last week about admission charges to our national monuments. That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy made the point about VAT on the wax museum although it is an area which should be considered in the general context of tourism and education. By not being able to go to that area of the national Museum, people are losing out. The decision was very wrong. I appeal to the Minister to realise that it was a wrong decision. I am not concerned about this for any ulterior motive, but only from the point of view that the treasures held there are unique. While I anticipate that the Minister will say the charges are not excessive, they have resulted in the museum being almost empty every day of the week, apart from Tuesday when admission is free.</P>
    <P>I honestly feel that the Minister, Deputy Nealon, who is a very liberal minded man was and is genuinely concerned with the arts. Disquiet has been expressed by many people and the Minister is quite aware of this through the media. I do not want to overplay the point but I hope the Minister will agree with me that it was a wrong decision and an unfortunate decision. The amount of money which it will bring in will be minimal. The cost of bringing in that money would, in my view, be more than the overall cost when taking everything into consideration. At this stage it would be easy to reverse the decision. There would be no loss of face. As far as I am concerned it is not a matter of routine. I am genuinely concerned about it and I feel the decision was wrong.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to re-examine the situation with regard to everything I have said, with regard to the treasures that are there and with regard to bringing pupils from different parts of the country. The Minister will understand in regard to groups of school children and people from rural areas coming to Dublin that it is not always possible to come on Tuesday. This would cause problems in schools and other areas. I appeal to the <Col N="408" /> Minister in the light of what I have said and from the information which the Minister will be aware of that the proper procedure now would be to reverse that decision and to give free admission as obtains in all the major museums in London. There is in the British museum provision for voluntary subscriptions from those who want to make that subscription. If they cannot subscribe for one reason or another they are not prevented from visiting the museum. Having regard to the extent of the British museum compared to the size of ours &mdash; leaving aside the value of the heritage &mdash; one could spend a week in the British museum going from one section to another. I would earnestly ask the Minister to reverse the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senator for his contribution and to assure him that although I am deputising for the Minister, Deputy Nealon, he will take serious note of his contribution.</P>
      <P>The condition of the National Museum in Kildare Street has long been a cause of concern to those who care about our heritage. Successive reports of the Board of Visitors of the museum have pointed to the deplorable storage conditions of the collections, the outdated format of the displays and the inadequate staffing levels.</P>
      <P>Since responsibility for the National Museum was transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach in 1984, many new initiatives have been undertaken to improve conditions, including the provision of additional staff and the allocation of a major part of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham for use as a decorative arts museum. A very successful temporary exhibition of &ldquo;Irish Silver&rdquo; is now on display in the Royal Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans are also being drawn up for the renovation of the coachhouses in the RHK and discussions are being held with AnCO regarding a scheme to begin repair of the museum's fine collection of coaches. It is hoped that this work can begin in early 1987. Another important <Col N="409" /> initiative is the undertaking of a social employment scheme to conserve our important national folklife collection, at present in storage in Daingean. Work is proceeding on repairing the artefacts in this collection and the identification of an appropriate permanent home is being urgently examined.</P>
    <P>Another major development will be the expansion of the shop in the museum. A number of new publications were produced for the Treasury opening and an increase in the volume of material on sale and in particular the development of new merchandise such as replica jewellery is being undertaken. It is hoped to see this shop in full operation in summer 1987.</P>
    <P>On the wider administrative front it is intended to set up a statutory board of governors for the museum with control of its own budget. The internal administration of the museum will be strengthened to oversee the day to day arrangements for the running of the museum and, in particular, the move to the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. In the interim a non-statutory board has been appointed to advise on overall policy in relation to the museum.</P>
    <P>Side by side with these proposals for the development of the museum, the question of finance has been carefully considered. All of these new initiatives require considerable additional finance which, in view of the present state of the public finances, would be difficult to fund in full from Exchequer sources. Accordingly, in order to accelerate the pace of expansion and development in the museum, additional revenue must be generated by the museum itself as well as through increased Government spending and sponsorship. The alternative would be for the museum to continue to function as at present, with some marginal improvements. That would clearly be unsatisfactory and the Minister of State with responsibility for arts and culture is determined to see the National Museum develop its full potential and become a more lively cultural institution, with a greater impact on the public consciousness.</P>
    <P>He sees the introduction of museum <Col N="410" /> charges as one way of enabling this development to be funded and would point out that such charges are standard in Europe. He is, of course, aware that it would not be appropriate to levy a large charge, which would seriously deter potential visitors. Accordingly, the scale of charges for the treasury has been pitched at a modest level and unwaged persons and old age pensioners are admitted free of charge. The charges are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) adult, £1, with special rates for groups,</P>
    <P>(2) child, 30p with special rates for groups</P>
    <P>(3) student, 50p over 18 on production of a student card and</P>
    <P>(4) family ticket £2.</P>
    <P>In addition, there will be free admission to the treasury each Tuesday. All of the proceeds from the charges will be retained to develop the museum and the facilities which it offers to the public. The sum that will be collected at this stage has to be a guestimate but on the basis of an attendance of 300,000 persons &mdash; that is adult, children and old age pensioners &mdash; the income could amount to £70,000 or £80,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State thinks it is relevant when considering the question of museum charges to bear in mind that the opening of the treasury gallery marked a new era for the museum with our finest collection of early medieval metalwork being shown to the public in a new and enhanced way. This collection is of major international significance and includes some of the most aesthetically pleasing objects ever made in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The exhibition is divided into three sections: (1) An introductury room illustrating the pagan Celtic background to early Christian Irish art; (2) An audio-visual presentation to explain the historical and archaeological background to the exhibition and to give guidance on how to appreciate the major masterpieces. This programme takes place in a specifically designed room with formal tiered seating and selected exhibits, including sculptures and (3) A major gallery containing masterpieces of Irish art <Col N="411" /> from the 1st century AD to the 16th century, with a special emphasis on religious objects. Among the items being exhibited in this gallery are the Ardagh Chalice, the Tara Brooch, the Derrynaflan hoard and the Moylough Belt-Shrine. Recently acquired material including splendid door furnishings from Moynalty, County Meath and Viking material from Wood Quay is also displayed to the public for the first time.</P>
    <P>The development of this gallery means that the National Museum can now display objects in modern, climate controlled conditions which are on a par with the highest standards of museum presentation throughout Europe. In addition, the National Museum aims, through supporting leaflets, graphics, audio-visual <Col N="412" /> presentations etc. to bring forcefully to public attention the wealth and importance of the national collection of Irish antiquities.</P>
    <P>Investment in this project to date has been considerable and further developments are planned, including the preparation of education material for schools. The Minister of State is confident that, when viewed in this light, the introduction of a modest charge to view this major exhibition and to help in the development of the National Museum will be seen as fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 October 1986.</P>
