      <P>I have notice from Senator Jim Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to approve a slip road as part of the proposal to construct a bypass on the N.17 around Claremorris town.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The need for clarification of the effect of drainage schemes in the County Galway area on the livelihood of small farmers in view of proposals to implement a charge for drainage to move from a direct labour to a contract basis and the imposition of a contribution for maintenance of the existing drainage schemes.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Séamus de Brún of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to reconsider the case of the three All-Irish primary schools, namely, Ring Mahon and Parklands, <Col N="536" /> Cork City, and Cnoc Theas, Limerick, which have been in voluntary operation since last September, with a view to sanctioning all three schools to full recognition under the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jim and Michael D. Higgins and Senator de Brún as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Jim Higgins's matter for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Senators Michael D. Higgins and de Brún may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to order items Nos. 1,2,3 and 4 on today's Order Paper.  Item No. 1 is merely the fixing of a day for Second Stage discussion on a new Bill which is being introduced into this House; No. 2 is the Committee Stage of the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill; No. 3 is the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill; No. 4 is two small regulations in regard to agriculture.</P>
      <P>Since it will be the same Minister and the same spokesmen who will be involved in Nos. 2 and 3, we should leave the question open as to whether we have an adjournment, the presumption being that if time does seem available we would adjourn some time around 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. or some other suitable time but if the business appears to be dragging &mdash; if that is not a criticism of the House &mdash; the adjournment will not be taken.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> The only function we have today is to order the Second Stage of this Bill.  My effort to have Bills introduced into the Seanad is now causing me some embarrassment because of the large number of Bills that have been introduced into the Seanad.  Senators will agree that, with the amount of business we already have in hand, there is no point in ordering Second Stage of this Bill to be taken before we adjourn for the Christmas Recess. Accordingly, I suggest the date of Wednesday, 14 January for Second Stage of the Bill.  It does not mean that either the Bill must necessarily be taken on that day or that the House must necessarily meet.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and the purpose of them is to make it <Col N="538" /> clear that the special voting arrangements for disabled electors can be brought into operation in relation to the register of electors now in force.  During Second Stage debate several Senators &mdash; in fact, I believe every Senator &mdash; expressed the view that these arrangements should be brought into effect for the present register and I fully accept this view, but I explained that the Bill was originally drafted with a view to coming into force in conjunction with next April's register. I take the Senators' view that it should, particularly for the disabled, come into force now and the amendments are designed to make this possible.</P>

      <P>I understood from the Second Stage debate that this list would not come into effect until 14 April and that there would be a special voters' list prepared in addition to the ordinary register of electors.  I would like the Minister to say if there is to be a separate list prepared and will it be in the form of a smaller register that will be in circulation and in the possession of candidates and their agents?  Will the public have access to such a list?  I understood we could not have a voters' list after 14 April because of its publication and its compiling and that people would not be in a position to apply for a vote until an election was declared.  I would like the Minister to give us more information on this special list. Do I take it that when this Bill is passed and signed by the President, any incapacitated voter may apply to the county registrar within his area for a postal vote and that at that time a decision on whether or not he is entitled to a vote will come into play?  Or, must an election be called before this special voters' list is prepared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will start immediately.  There will be a special list compiled for a separate register as we assume that most of these disabled voters are on the register anyway.  To ensure that disabled people have access to postal voting it is the intention that a special list will be set up.  People will apply for a postal vote.  Obviously the position will <Col N="539" /> be checked out and when it is established that they are disabled persons and eligible to go on the list, that list will be compiled and it will be a separate list from the actual main register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>One can then apply for a vote as a disabled person.  In the event of that person ceasing to be disabled when he goes on to the special voting list, will his name be deleted from the ordinary register?  If at any time an election arises and he is then not incapacitated can he go back and vote on the ordinary list of electors in the ordinary way?  I see in the Bill that, if you apply for a vote and you are accepted on the special voters' list, you are then debarred even if your health improves from going back onto the ordinary register of electors and voting in the ordinary way.  That could be a hindrance where there is a temporary rather than permanent disablement, that people would opt to vote in the ordinary way rather than in the presence of a garda síochána or a presiding officer calling at his home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not intended that it would be for temporary disablement. It is intended that when somebody would apply there would be a certificate from a medical person indicating that in his or her opinion the applicant would be a disabled person during the course of that register.  In other words, the register would run for a year. If somebody applies and is accepted it is taken that he is accepted for the duration of that register and if for whatever reason his health improved, he would still be voting by way of postal vote.  He was accepted on the special register of postal voters because it was quite clear on the evidence submitted that he would be incapacitated for the particular period of that register.</P>

      <P>Section 2 says: &ldquo;The registration authority shall prepare as part of the register of electors a separate list...&rdquo; and there is a proposed amendment. I would like to speak for a moment about the preparation of the register of electors before we talk about the disabled aspect of it or the special list.  I have been concerned for a number of years about the preparation of the register of electors in my own constituency.  I am not being politically biased when I say it has been shabbily done for a number of years. People are being included in the register of electors in my constituency who are long since gone from this country.  I have written to the Minister's office on a number of occasions pointing this out. Each time I got courteous but vague replies pointing out that it was a matter for the local authority in the preparation of the registers and that they were investigating it at local authority level. Invariably, the local authority put it on a semi-long finger and it has happened again and again.</P>

      <P>I do not want <Col N="541" /> to interrupt Senator Loughrey again and I want to be fair to every one of my colleagues in the House.  If I could clear the Minister's amendment Senator Loughrey could then speak on the section.  What Senator Loughrey is saying is more relevant to the section.  If we take the Minister's amendments Nos. 1 and 2 we may then discuss the section.  Is amendment No. 1 agreed?</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 15, to delete &ldquo;any other part of the register&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;the register of electors&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says that the registration authority &ldquo;shall prepare as part of the register of electors a separate list (in this Act referred to as the `special voters list') of persons... entitled to vote at an election in accordance with the provisions of this Act without removing the names of the special voters from any other part of the register&rdquo;. We are working on the assumption that they are already on the register in the first instance which brings me back to the point I want to make about the preparation of that register.</P>
      <P>Lest I give a wrong impression I am totally in favour of providing votes to persons who are unable to be present for one reason or another at the polling station on the day.  I would have thought that we might have gone a little further by providing for persons whose jobs necessitate being away from home within the country.  I am concerned about the method of the preparation for register in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator O'Toole at the outset. It is far too serious a matter to be batting it back and forward to see who scores off whom.  Anybody interested in democracy welcomes this Bill and it should be addressed as such.  I am worried about something the Minister of State said, in so far as initially I thought the reasoning behind this was to afford people who are permanently disabled the opportunity to register their vote.  The Minister of State said it is intended that that status could be changed from one electoral register year to another.  It is temporary.  In that sense what Senator Loughrey said about the compilation comes very much into account.  How will that be governed? How will it be regularised in any way if in year one you can be on the register and in year two you are off it?  It seems to be a very loose arrangement and will add to the confusion rather than lessen it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the point I want to make falls within the terms of reference of section 2 in the sense of the special voters' list.  The category I wish to refer to are special in the sense that they are postal voters.  I refer to the Garda Síochána who, when their names are published in the various public places where the lists of electors are carried, carry a &ldquo;P&rdquo; after their names.  I wonder if the Minister would be good enough to give a reaction to the point I want to make that, to the extent that gardaí have &ldquo;P&rdquo; after their names which are posted in public places, this is a means of identification <Col N="543" /> of the people concerned.  We live in unusual times.  I refer, of course, in particular to subversive activity.  The names of gardaí, through the &ldquo;P&rdquo; after their names, can be identified in public places. I wonder, therefore, would the Minister consider dropping postal ballots in the case of gardaí and treating members of the force in the ordinary way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Senator has just made.  I did not get an opportunity to speak on the previous occasion but I will not dwell on that. I welcome the Bill because it gives an opportunity to permanently disabled or even temporarily disabled people to cast their votes on election day.  Perhaps the problem more often applies to some of the younger people in our midst at the moment.  I realise that the Minister has a difficulty here.  As Senator O'Toole mentioned, somebody may apply and get the postal vote and then perhaps on the day of an election be physically fit to vote. I do not think any Minister could legislate for these types of people at all.  We can only hope that all of the people who are physically disabled will be capable of voting on election day.  Apart altogether from their vote, it is something we would all love to see.  In relation to Senator Loughrey's point about the register and certain people who are, for example, on the register and who may have left the country years ago, I find this crops up every time we get an opportunity to sit in with the county registrar to object to, include or exclude, as the case may be, people from the register.  We find county registrars interpret these things in a different way.  Their approach is often one which is acceptable to me, that perhaps it is somebody who is out of the country for most of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken Senator Loughrey to task about that.  I am asking all Senators to stick to the legislation before us.  I accept that it is very hard to distinguish the total register from the register of special people the Minister sees fit to add and rightly so.  I <Col N="544" /> do not want to hassle the House but I cannot let the debate go on to the total register.  I am not protecting anyone.  I want everybody to understand that.  I must stick to the legislation before me as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, I was trying to make that point.  I was merely agreeing with Senator Loughrey about the rest of the register &mdash; that every county registrar has a different way of approaching it. Perhaps we all have our opportunities when those revision courts are held to make our points in relation to people who should be included or excluded from the register.  Perhaps they differ from county to county.  We all have some input to that on revision court day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point Senator Hillery made with regard to the Garda Síochána I wonder if it is absolutely necessary for the &ldquo;P&rdquo; to be included after their name.  During a recent election I came across certain members of the Garda Síochána.  I knew them to be members of the Garda Síochána but &ldquo;P&rdquo; was not after their names.  As Senator Hillery said, for security reasons they did not want to be pinpointed.  I discussed this with one member and he told me he had a postal vote despite the fact that there was no &ldquo;P&rdquo; after his name.  I do not know if this is the general rule, or if it is obligatory for anybody who has a postal vote to have the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; after his name.  Can they have a postal vote without the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; being after their names?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I take it from what the Minister of State said that a special voters' list will be prepared at the same time as the ordinary register but not on this occasion because he indicated that this special voters' list will come into operation as soon as this Bill passes through the two Houses of the Oireachtas and is signed by the President.  An incapacitated voter or a disabled voter can then apply and get on a special voters' list which will be operative from now until 14 April, and that voters' list will recur every year and will run alongside the ordinary register of electors.  Do I take it that we will have two registers, one with the special voters' list and the ordinary register of electors that we had heretofore, and that will be compiled in the same way and at the same time &mdash; after this year &mdash; as the ordinary register of electors?  I would like to have that question answered first and then I have some other questions to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back to the point I was making the section now reads:</P>
      <P>The registration authority shall prepare a separate list... of persons. ...entitled to vote at an election in accordance with the provisions of this Act without removing the names of the special voters from the register of electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in total support of this Minister's &mdash; and indeed the previous Minister's &mdash; efforts to give votes to these categories of people.  I am trying at the same time to protect us from the abuses which did happen in the last election.  We will not make any reference to any side as I am sure all sides had some part in them.  I saw the most blatant abuses.  If somebody should suggest that I am being abusive about other Members of the House, I am not.  I am certainly not as abusive of Members of the House as Members outside of this House have been of disabled <Col N="546" /> persons.  I refer again specifically to my own constituency where there were hundreds of attempts at defrauding as a result of the efforts of the Minister at that time, Deputy Kavanagh, to introduce postal voting.  I cannot understand why prosecutions have not been taken as a result.</P>
    <P>If I talk about the compilation of the register it is to ensure that the register will be compiled in such a way as to ensure that postal voting will not then be used as a way of abusing that very thing which it intends to protect, the right of the disabled to vote.  That is exactly what happened the last time.  The Minister and his Department should give some thought to how the register is being compiled at the moment.  Can it be improved?  Are errors being made?  Persons are being included in the register at the moment who are long since gone.  We have the right to object to them but once persons are included on the original register it is difficult and not nice for anybody to have to object to those persons.  Some of these persons may be disabled and this is where it connects with the section.  They may also be outside that area at that time. There is a better chance of the votes of disabled persons being used at some subsequent election.  I would welcome the Minister's response to some of the suggestions I have made.  If the registers were compiled properly the onus would not be on us as active politicians to try to protect them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a myriad of questions have been raised, some relevant to the section and others not so relevant, that it is difficult to try to address the answers. Senator O'Toole asked for clarification in relation to the special voters' list.  The special voters' list will be compiled and will contain the names of the people deemed eligible to vote under the special voting provisions outlined in later sections of the Bill.  However, their names will also remain on the general register of electors.  It is intended that their names would have a distinguishing <Col N="547" /> mark on the general register to denote the fact that they are not entitled to vote in the normal way at that polling station because of the fact that they are on the special voters' list and would have arrangements made to vote under the other provisions of later sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>That also answers a question raised by another Senator as to what might happen if a person with a temporary disablement recovered during the lifetime of the register and sought to vote in the normal way at the local polling station.  As I have outlined, such persons would not be afforded a vote at the polling station because of the fact that they would already have been visited at home by the special presiding officer and a member of the Garda Síochána and allowed to vote at home under the provisions for the special voter.  The fact that the person might have recovered in what, unfortunately, will be a minority of cases and be in a position to go to vote could not easily be comprehended within the scheme as outlined.</P>
      <P>When the appropriate period for applying to be registered as a special voter in the subsequent year comes around the temporarily disabled voter who has recovered would not have any inclination to go through the procedure of being registered as a special voter. That person's name will then be entered on the general register without any distinguishing mark.  This will entitle such a person to vote with other electors at his or her local polling station.  It is intended that the special voter would apply and that a medical certificate would be issued on an annual basis, indicating that the medical practitioner believes that for the period to be covered by the register in question the person involved would not be in a position to vote in the normal way at a polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some other questions were raised which are a little extraneous to the section and I do not want to pursue them too diligently.  The question of the distinguishing mark which identifies postal voters, such as members of the Garda <Col N="548" /> Síochána and the Defence Forces, has been raised by one or two Senators.  If that creates a problem I will be prepared to look at it.  I am sure Senators will recall my remarks here last week when I said this Bill provides specifically for disabled voters and diplomats serving abroad, but that it is my intention to introduce further legislation dealing with changes in the Electoral Act generally.  In that context, <i>inter alia,</i> it is my intention to introduce changes regarding the method of compilation of the electoral registers and the most appropriate time of the year to have the register compiled to allow people to make observations or to enter appeals against their omission or exclusion from the electoral register.  That aspect, among others, will be dealt with in a general Bill updating the provisions in the Electoral Acts.</P>

      <P>I welcome the intention of the Minister to introduce further legislation. I gathered, from what the Minister said, that the disabled person must register each year.  It is not right that a long term disabled person should have to reapply each year.  I respect what Senator O'Toole said and, therefore, the procedure should be reversed.  Once a person is deemed suitable to be on the special list they should remain thereon until such time as he or she asks to be removed from it.  That would be a fairer system.</P>

      <P>Does the special voters' list being compiled as a result of the passing of this Bill only come into operation after 14 April this year as in the case of the ordinary register being compiled at the moment?  If a voter has an accident during the period of the special voters' list being in operation and is unable to go to a polling booth at any given election, will he or she be unable to get a postal vote?  I understand from the Minister's reply that if a person is not on the special voters' list and becomes incapacitated during the year after the list is compiled he or she will be unable to vote.  I support Senator Loughrey's view that a long term disabled person <Col N="549" /> should not have to apply every year for a medical certificate.</P>

It is not improving even though we have computers and every modern aid.

I take Senator O'Toole's point about temporary illness but we should not broaden this so much that it creates a charter for abuses which nobody in this House will be able to prevent. We must exercise some rationale in relation to the people we allow on it, how they get on it and, more important, how they stay on it.  I suggest caution in that regard.</P>

      <P>To a large extent, Senator Magner has answered a number of the <Col N="550" /> questions raised in the latest contributions and also in earlier ones.  When one comes to address the topic of postal voting there is, of course, a great temptation to include all sorts of groups for what ostensibly appear to be good reasons.  Again, as I outlined to the House last week, the limited experiments that took place in relation to postal voting in local elections in 1974 and again in 1985, the system was largely defeated due to the ingenuity of the Irish.  The cumbersome procedure which has now been introduced is an effort to be a little more ingenious than the Irish.  Consequently, the system has to be very restricted in the groups to whom it might apply. The Senator is also correct in his assumption that, because of the paramount importance of the register in determining who is eligible to vote, it is considered appropriate that persons who wish to be registered on a special voters' list must apply annually as, indeed, there is an annual revision of the electoral registers generally.</P>
      <P>Experience in other countries has shown that where persons or categories who are allowed on to a postal voting list, for example, are allowed to do so without the need for annual review, the postal voting list accretes until it becomes, in some cases, such a substantial proportion of the total register of eligible electors as to arrive at a situation which would be regarded by most practising politicians as a distortion of the electoral process.  The system that has been outlined here has been confined to special groups.  The method whereby they determine their eligibility is clearly outlined to ensure that only those groups are included who, during the currency of the register, can clearly show their inability to vote in the normal way and can show that that is on medical evidence in the case of the disabled or on evidence of their being posted abroad and likely to continue to be posted abroad in the case of diplomats. On those bases they shall be entitled to be entered on the special voters' list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hesitant to pursue Senators into areas outside the scope of section 2 of the Bill, but Senator McDonald is not correct <Col N="551" /> in saying that, heretofore, it has been the responsibility of rate collectors to compile electoral registers.  It was traditionally the responsibility of rate collectors but it was removed from them in recent years with the diminution in the number of rate collectors.  The responsibility for the compiling of this special voters' list is, as the section outlines clearly, placed upon the registration authority.</P>

      <P>I beg the Senator's pardon.  The effect of the two amendments to which the House has just agreed will be that through those drafting changes the registration authorities may now commence immediately to prepare a special voters' list in respect of the disabled.  That special voters' list, within whatever administrative length of time we determine is necessary in order to advertise the availability of the special voters' list and to receive applications and adjudicate upon them and compile the special voters' list, would mean that the special voting list for the disabled will come into effect at the end of that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments were introduced on foot of requests made by Senators, including to my recollection Senator O'Toole, during the Second Stage debate last week when Senators suggested that they were anxious that this provision should be introduced immediately.  I should mention that it will not be possible to do that in the case of diplomats whose names are not registered on the ordinary current register, whereas in the case of the special voters, their names would be registered already but the obligation would be placed upon them to visit their local polling station.  From that point of view it has been found possible to do this in response to the request from Senators <Col N="552" /> in relation to disabled people who are currently registered on the normal register but not in relation to diplomats already posted abroad and who are not registered on their local register.</P>

The period will approximate to the same period as the appeal period for voters in relation to the draft electoral register in connection with the compilation of the register to come into effect from mid-April 1987.</P>

I appreciate the difficulty which the Chair and others have in following discussions on these sections.  As I explained to the House last week, there are a number of topics on which various Members of each House see themselves as having particular expertise, but there is only one topic on which all 60 Members of this House and 166 Members of the other House know that they are the knowledged experts and that is the topic which we are discussing at the moment.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 (a) reads: &ldquo;the nature and extent of the physical illness or physical disability suffered by such applicant,&rdquo;.  Under the Postal Voting (Amendment) Regulations, 1985, <Col N="554" /> medical certificates supplied at that time read:</P>
      <P>I hereby certify that the above named applicant who is under my care is suffering from... and for that reason will be unable to attend at the polling station.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of applications were refused on the grounds that the medical practitioner was not specific in his or her statement of what the person was suffering from.  I am not very familiar with medical jargon but there are some general terms which can be used to cover almost all physical disabilities.  How specific would the Minister require the information to be?</P>
      <P>Section 4 (b) reads: &ldquo;an estimate of the duration of such physical illness or physical disability,&rdquo;.  Why should it be necessary to give an extent or duration and to have it repeated annually if it is very obvious to everybody concerned that the person is suffering from a long term physical disability from which he or she is unlikely to recover?  This seems to be a waste of time.  If it is obvious that the person is suffering from a long term disability, one certificate should suffice for every election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions asked in that section would seem to apply to a general medical practitioner except in the case of (c) which states &ldquo;that the applicant is of sound mind and understanding and is capable of comprehending the act of voting&rdquo;.  There is a procedure laid down, for instance, for committing people to mental institutions &mdash; there is a case before the courts at the moment. I can understand the GP's decision <i>vis-àvis</i> incapacitation from injury or disability but is the Minister satisfied that he will not involve the area of psychiatry as well as general medical practice given that there is already a procedure for deciding, for instance, that a person is not of sound mind and, therefore, should be confined somewhere else?  Is there a conflict there and, if not, could the Minister explain why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to raise the same point for clarification because most of us will have in interest in the operation of this very worthwhile legislation which the Minister is introducing.  Senator Magner touched on an aspect of what I wanted to say.  Will a person who suffers a stroke and is paralysed but able to talk be able to vote with the mobile returning officer?  However, if a person cannot speak, will the returning officer be likely to say that it is not possible to have a conversation with them and that, therefore, they are not of sound mind?  Will that person be able to vote?  A facility already exists for assisted voting for disabled persons and, while the terms of section 4 are very wide, it should be possible to facilitate as many people as possible. Could the Minister say what he and the draftsman had in mind in framing this section in its present fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problems with paragraphs (a) or (b) because the medical profession is highly reputable and will only authenticate certificates to applicants who wish to get on this voters' list.  However, I, too, would like more clarification on paragraph (c) which refers to a person of sound mind.  I take it that if a person is mentally disturbed, either temporarily or permanently, that person would not be of sound mind and, therefore, could not be declared as eligible for the special voters' list.  That is what I would determine as a person of unsound mind but, as Senator McDonald said, numerous people as a result of a stroke will have their accuracy or reasoning impaired and may need assistance in voting.  I ask the Minister to clarify this and, while we may be asking technical questions, we are only trying to help in ensuring that this legislation is the best possible to do away with the systems to which I referred on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical certificate will require the medical practitioner to outline, as section 4 (a) says, the nature and extent of the physical illness or disability of the applicant and in accordance with paragraph (b), the length of time <Col N="556" /> the doctor feels that disability or illness is likely to continue and the doctor should certify that the person is of sound mind and is capable of comprehending the act of voting.</P>
      <P>There is no provision contained within this Bill for the system which is known as companion voting which was referred to by Senator McDonald and which obtains in polling stations generally.  Because of the procedures which are being outlined whereby a special presiding officer will visit the special voters' place of residence with their ballot paper and make the ballot paper available to them, it is important that the special voters are clearly capable of comprehending the act of voting and that they are in a position to indicate their voting preference either physically by marking the ballot paper, or by indicating to the special presiding officer their preference and allowing the special officer to carry out that function on their behalf.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties which arises in relation to the suggestion, for example, of having companion voting occurring in a situation like this is that, in particular circumstances which Senators have alluded to, it would be very difficult for the special presiding officer to ascertain that the voter had conveyed the particular instruction to the companion which the companion was seen to carry out.  In an effort to eliminate abuse to the greatest extent possible, it is important that special voters are in a position either themselves to mark the paper or to indicate their voting preference clearly to the special presiding officer in a way which enables that presiding officer to complete the ballot paper on behalf of the special voter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 4 (b) which states: &ldquo;an estimate of the duration of such physical illness or physical disability&rdquo;, my understanding is that we agreed that this list would be compiled on a positive basis i.e., the person would actually apply for each new register.  So long as the person is incapacitated when the register is being compiled, that should be sufficient.  I wonder why we need this <Col N="557" /> section having agreed what we have just agreed.  It seems to be nonsense.</P>
      <P>The problem with &ldquo;sound mind and understanding&rdquo; is that heretofore if one took a person to the polling station, the presiding officer decided whether the person involved was capable of understanding what he or she was going to do but in this case it is part of a certificate. This is quite a quantum leap away from the traditional way in which we have done our business.  If it were simply the physical disability or ailment of the person that is one thing, but there is <i>in situ</i> in law a method whereby one determines whether or not a person is suffering from mental illness.  That does not come under a normal GP type of visit.  With regard to section 4(c) does the Minister not foresee some difficulties?  Does he not think section 4 (b) is superfluous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not think section 4 (b) is superfluous because at the time of compiling a special voters' list when the person is eligible to apply they might well have an illness which could, in the case of some people, continue for some months and, in the case of other people, might be of a much shorter duration. An extreme example would be where somebody was suffering from a continuing flu now, they might find a medical practitioner who is prepared to say that, in the nature of this flu, they were likely to suffer from it for the next 12 months.  Where somebody is suffering from a broken limb now, at the time the register is being compiled, it is reasonable to assume that they will have returned to full health or be ambulant again by the time the register would come into force which, in the normal way, would be in April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the practitioner be asked to indicate whether the period of physical illness or disability is likely to continue over the duration in force of the register for which the application is being made, in other words, whether it is likely, as the time scale stands at present, to continue in force for a period of some 15 or 16 months.  If it is not, or if the medical practitioner does not indicate that it is <Col N="558" /> likely to continue for that period of time, the registration authority is then in a position either to take the matter up immediately with the applicant voters or to decide to refuse to register them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand if the suggestion were to be pursued of having a medical practitioner's certificate indicating that a person's disability is so long term as to be permanent, if that person were to be included on a permanent basis in the special voters' list, it would be somewhat at variance with the point made earlier by Senator Magner.  It could also result in a variation with the objection voiced by Senator Loughrey earlier in that it would then mean that the special voters' list over a period of time would unfortunately come to contain more and more the names of people who are deceased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify section 4 (c) with regard to &ldquo;sound mind&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 4 (c) it is felt that to give a guidance to the registration authority that the special voters are eligible to have this procedure put in place for them and to have a special presiding officer visit them together with a Garda officer with the special voting papers and then the voters are in a position to indicate their voting preference to the special presiding officer.  The procedure does not envisage companion voting nor does it envisage, for instance, the presence of personation agents on behalf of the candidates.  The system which might normally apply at polling stations where, if a personation agent feels a voter is not capable of clearly indicating his or her preference may well challenge the voter or request that the voter be sworn, is not being provided for in this case for the reasons I outlined to the House last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One reason, among others, is the desire to keep to a minimum the numbers of people who will actually arrive in the voter's place of residence if it happens to be his home.  It is also to keep the pressure on the special voter at a minimum at the time of voting so that those physically <Col N="559" /> present in the room would be the special voter, the special presiding officer, the Garda officer and nobody else.  The special presiding officer then has an obligation upon him to ensure that, if he is acting on behalf of the special voter in marking the paper, he clearly has an indication given to him by the special voter of his voting preference.  There is, in a preliminary way in the compilation of this special voters' list, an obligation on the registration authority to feel satisfied, based on the certificate of a medical practitioner, that the voter whilst being disabled in the physical sense has the mental capacity and will continue to have the mental capacity to be able clearly to indicate a voting choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person's health has deteriorated from the date of application to the time of the arrival of the presiding officer, can the presiding officer refuse that person a vote or does he have to consult with anybody at that stage? That is a very important question because cases like this will arise.  On the other hand the incapacitated or disabled person might be well at the time of arrival but can deteriorate and be unable to vote.  Is it the sole right of the presiding officer to decide that that person is unable to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be the right and the obligation on that presiding officer to make that decision based on his assessment of the voters at the time when he visits them at their places of residence.  I want to mention also, of course, that if a vote is challenged on similar grounds at a normal polling station at present by, say, a personation agent and the presiding officer then puts questions to the voter or asks him to swear, the decision then will also be the decision falling on the special presiding officer.  It falls on all presiding officers to make that decision based upon the answers given to them by the statutory questions and by the swearing process.</P>

      <P>If, for any reason, perhaps this is not under this section but <Col N="560" /> you can correct me if it is not, when the presiding officer arrives the voter is not present, is notice given of the time of arrival?  What happens if the voter is in town, on holidays, or away for any given reason?  Even with regard to a disabled voter, do they return for the vote at a later date, or do they give notice of arrival beforehand by registered letter?  In what way will the voter know of the presiding officer's arrival to give him this opportunity to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The intention is that arrangements will be made for the returning officer to have notice sent in advance to the registered special voters as to the time at which it is expected the special presiding officer will visit them at their places of residence with the ballot paper. If the special voter is not at home, it is not intended that the special presiding officer will return.  If the Senator reflects upon it, this is perhaps reasonable because if the voters have indicated that they are incapable of visiting a polling station it is fairly unlikely that they will be away on a casual basis from the normal places of residence.</P>

I pointed out to the House last week that it is not intended that all of this procedure will take place on the actual normal polling day, but will take place over a period of some days in advance of polling day.

      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the nature and extent of the physical illness.  Some general practitioners, during the implementation of <Col N="561" /> the 1985 regulations, certified as follows: &ldquo;I hereby certify that the above applicant who is under my care is suffering from&rdquo; and wrote in the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo;.  That was not accepted by the returning officer. To what degree would the nature and extent of the physical illness or disability have to be written into the certificate? How much detail is required?  Some medical practitioners refuse to divulge the extent of disability to persons to whom, so far as they are concerned, is not their concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little way of providing for a situation where persons who believe they have a physical disability which is such as to allow them to be registered on the special voters' list for this purpose can be accommodated if they go to their local medical practitioner who refuses, at their request, to complete the certificate to enable them to make the application to the registration authority. The Act does not require that the medical practitioner has to be the normal general practitioner who is attending the special voter although it is, of course, envisaged that in the vast majority of cases that would be the position.  If a medical practitioner refuses, or whatever their own definition of the medical ethics is, to give details at the request of the applicant and their patient for the purpose of facilitating the patient in being able to avail of the fundamental right to exercise their franchise, unless the patient chooses to call upon the service of another medical practitioner, there is very little further that the Legislature or the registration authority could be expected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept absolutely the Minister's intent and the intent of the Legislature in general to provide for disabled persons.  I refer to them again because of abuses in my constituency among others where the returning officer had to be more strict in his interpretation of the completion of the application form as outlined in the 1985 regulations.  One of the reasons for refusing could be that the general practitioner was not specific enough but if the general practitioner <Col N="562" /> simply says he certifies that the person is disabled, will that enable him to vote?</P>

      <P>The Minister says it will not be necessary for the family GP to issue the certificate.  Nonetheless it is unlikely that a stranger, a new doctor, would be able to give an estimate of the duration of a physical illness or disability without seeing the record of the patient. Therefore, will the Minister consider having some discussions with the representatives of the medical profession because it is in their interest &mdash; they live in this democracy although sometimes I doubt it &mdash; to ensure that the system works well and works fairly?  They have a very important role to play.  Would he consider discussing with them some general guidelines regarding the issue of certificates so that the point raised by Senator Loughrey does not arise again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Loughrey is one where a doctor for the most part merely certified that, in his view, the applicant was disabled and the registration authority correctly did not accept that as adequate medical evidence of the eligibility of the voter to the postal voting system that was then being made available.  Under the provisions of this Bill the medical practitioner would be asked to specify the nature and extent of the physical disability and to specify in writing the extent and type of that disability.  If the registration authority are not satisfied with the definition given, it is open to them either to refuse the application or to seek further details.  In relation to the Senator's request that I should open discussions with representatives of the medical profession, the answer is no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the point Senator Loughrey made that in some cases the certificate provided by the medical profession was rejected as being inadequate or whatever, what is the Minister's objection to simply stating reasonable guidelines for such certificates?  His answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; might be very illuminating to him but it tells me absolutely nothing.  Could <Col N="563" /> he tell me why he would not ask the medical profession to co-operate with this very important legislation and could he do so in words of one syllable?</P>

      <P>I have every confidence that the vast majority of doctors would qualify under section 4 (c) and would not in any way want to thwart the objective of their patients in having themselves registered as special voters.  In view of the anxiety expressed by Senators in the House on Second Stage debate on this topic, that this measure should be introduced immediately and should not even wait for the normal procedure to come into effect in April next, I have no intention whatsoever of becoming involved in what is essentially the sphere of another Minister in having discussions on the question of medical ethics with the medical profession.  Those discussions would certainly preclude any attempt to have this Bill introduced prior to 14 April next.</P>

What I am saying is that with the introduction of this legislation the Minister should make an appeal to the medical profession to ensure that these certificates would be filled in in such a way as to make sure that the people they are looking after will be eligible.  That is all; there is no big deal.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for taking up the time of the House and, indeed, the Minister's time.  Probably more appropriately I should have raised the matter under section 2 (3) which states: &ldquo;... shall not be entitled to vote in any other manner.&rdquo;  Somebody close to me is, unfortunately, suffering from a rare <Col N="564" /> disease which, unfortunately again, is becoming more prevalent whereby the person is seriously disabled for about one week in every six or seven weeks.  It is likely to continue for the duration of that person's life.  That person would not like to be technically registered continually as disabled, but it would seem from this legislation that if he or she wishes to be sure he or she will have a vote, that person must apply for a vote under this special list despite the fact that that person would be anything up to 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the time quite as able as you or I.  Even though we have passed the section I want to say that there are people who come down with severe bouts of arthritis or other types of disease who cannot be sure, unless they make an application for the vote, that they will be able to vote on the day.  Yet if they are physically fit and well on the day they cannot dispense with the other type of vote and go ahead and vote.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the period of time.  If further information or documentation is required, that information and documentation must be with the presiding officer within seven days.  I appeal to the Minister to extend that period to 14 days because seven days is a very short period to write out to an applicant who has applied to get on the voters' list and for him to submit further information and documentary evidence to substantiate his claim for a vote.  Seven days is not sufficient time to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I raise the question of people on islands.  Fourteen days may not be sufficient time.  If that information is not forthcoming and an applicant does not furnish it inside the given time, he is deemed as not being entitled to be on that special register.  It is a very short period of time and I appeal to the Minister to extend that time to 14 days.  That <Col N="565" /> was overlooked perhaps when the draftsman was preparing a list.  I do not see the urgency of rushing it through in seven days.  It is not easy to have the information in that short time.  I do not even know what that documentation might consist of, or what further information may be required, but whatever information it is, it is a very short period to get it to the presiding officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation would be that if an application was received together with the medical certificate and the registration authority are satisfied, the name will be entered in the special voters' list.  That person will not then be able to vote at the normal polling stations and will vote throught the special procedure with the special presiding officer visiting him in his place of residence. <Col N="566" /> Under this procedure it is highly unlikely that another person is going to seek to have somebody's name entered on the special voters' list because when presiding officers visit houses they will seek to meet with the special voter and if there is no evidence of disability it will certainly raise their suspicions.  There is a specific provision set out in section 20 of the Bill in relation to offences and penalties where it would be an offence for any person to apply in the name of another person to be entered in the special voters' list.</P>

      <P>Because of the category of electors we are talking about, the way this information is communicated would be very important.  Section 6 (c) says: &ldquo;the times and places at which application forms may be obtained&rdquo;.  I presume we are dealing with a category of people who are not mobile in many cases and, therefore, are unable in the normal way to go to a post office or whatever. What arrangements will be made to post those application forms to the people on the special voters' list?</P>
      <P>The manner in which the information is given should be looked at very closely. For instance, we are dealing with some people who are blind and deaf.  Therefore, the normal newspaper, television and radio advertising may not suffice. Could I suggest to the Minister, at the risk of incurring his wrath again, to appeal &mdash; perhaps we will do it jointly as we did to the medical profession &mdash; to associations dealing with these people who are incapacitated, to ensure that this information is disseminated.  I am thinking, for instance, of talking tapes for the blind and so on which are circulated by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and that type of methodology to communicate the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already had discussions within my Department on the most appropriate methods of informing the particular electors who may be affected by this legislation of their rights. Because of the different categories of disability to which the Senator referred, it will be necessary to seek to enlist the help and support of the many voluntary bodies who deal with the disabled and the various forms of disablement, and possibly the support of the regional health boards and the media and, perhaps in particular, the sound medium in endeavouring to ensure that especially in relation to the initial compilation of the special register as many as possible of the eligible special voters know of the arrangements and are in a position to avail of them.</P>
      <P>Of course, if potential special voters ask to have the application form sent to them it is of course the intention that that would happen because by definition, because of their restricted mobility which would be inherent in their eligibility to be recorded in the special register, it would be important to ensure that the arrangements are easily in place whereby the application forms can be sent by post or in some other form got to the special voters.</P>
      <P>At the risk of trying the patience of Senators, may I gently remind the House that there are also the quite intricate systems available to the political parties and public representatives and I feel sure many of them will also go out of their way to notify the potential special voters of their right to apply under this new system.</P>

      <P>I understand that in general terms the intention is that the system will operate as the Senator has outlined. He will appreciate that there needs to be a set period within which the special voters' list will be compiled by each registration authority.  I invite the House to consider a situation where, even after the voter has been asked to supply the missing information, he or she fails to do so, or continues to do so incorrectly. There will have to come a time within the prescribed time limit when the registration authority in order to close the list will have to make decisions and it is for that reason that that particular part of the subsection is drafted in that way.</P>

      <P>No.  The House will appreciate that in conjunction with this legislation being enacted and the particular rules and dates being prescribed by the Minister as apply with the implementation of the Electoral Acts generally, there will be general guidelines issued to the registration authorities and <Col N="569" /> to returning officers regarding the operation of the compilation and adjudication upon the special voters' list.</P>

      <P>No, on the basis of what I have outlined I do not believe it does, but could I remind the Senator of the discussion we had already on section 5 (2) where the registration authority may require further information or documentation from an applicant?  This is the subsection on which Senator O'Toole was concerned that people living on an island would have sufficient time to return any additional information which might be sought.  The specific provision in that subsection would specifically allow the authority to do that rather than any mandatory initial binding which the Senator was inclined to read into section 8 (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very important section.  An applicant is on the current register and he applies to get on the special voters' list.  He is then refused because he does not comply with the various sections that would deem him entitled to a vote.  At that stage he may fall between two stools if he is not notified in great haste of the decision.  He can then go back and vote in the ordinary way.  But if that decision did not come to his notice before election day then, and especially in this current period, he would lose his vote.  There is a need for the authority, the presiding officers, to ensure that he is notified as soon as possible after the decision is taken that he has been refused so that he can go ahead and <Col N="570" /> vote in the ordinary way because he is now on the other register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but of course the arrangement that will operate under this Bill will be that where special voters apply to have their names registered in the special voters' list, they will in the normal way already be registered on the normal voters' register.  If they are deemed eligible to be entered on this special voters' register they will be entered on that register and an appropriate distinguishing mark will be put against their names on the general register if I may call it that, on the general register of electors.</P>
      <P>If they apply to be deemed a special voter and the registration authority does not accept for whatever reason their claim to be registered as a special voter, that will not at all in any way affect the entry of their name in the general register which, in the vast majority of cases, would be already the situation in force. A special voter is a person whose name is already entered on the general register of electors.  A decision to refuse an application from them to have their names entered also on the special voters' register does not in any affect their eligibility for entry on the normal general register of electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little unsure when the Minister calls it the register proper.  Is it the intention that the authority when finalising the register proper shall put a specific mark on the register indicating those who have applied for and have been sanctioned for disabled persons' votes, or is it the intention of the Minister that, when somebody has applied and been sanctioned for a special vote the register on election day at a specific polling station, prior to its arriving at that specific polling station, will have been marked that X, Y and Z and have already collected and used their votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are actually two separate answers.  The House was anxious last week that we would change section 2 to allow for this system to come into operation prior to the new register <Col N="571" /> of electors coming into force in April next.  Clearly it would not be possible to mark the existing general register of electors in that case.  We have found it possible to do that, subject to the administrative length of time it may take.  In that case, if it were found necessary, there would have to be notification sent to the individual presiding officer by the returning officer in time for an election day procedure, should that possibility arise.</P>
      <P>In the normal way, the intention is that when the special voters' register is compiled, the normal general register of electors will have contained within it a distinguishing mark indicating that the voter, whose name is shown, is the voter who either qualifies to have his name placed on the special voters' list, either as a person who is suffering from a disability likely to continue over a period, or who is a diplomat or a spouse of a diplomat living abroad.  It may be that other special provisions on the general register of electors may be incorporated with those voters in order to give a general distinguishing mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the immediate weaknesses I see in that system is that it covers only those who are deemed to be disabled at the time of the compilation of the register.  It is possible that disabled persons may not be included in the register within that year.  The disabled persons may move, if only to go to live with their in-laws, their relations, or sons, or daughters and for a full year after they arrive in a new constituency that type of person cannot be registered as a special voter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the person is registered as a special voter at the time the special voters' list is being compiled for the constituency in which they are living at the time and they move house to another constituency, they are then in the same position as any other voter who moves to another constituency.  The system will still apply and their eligibility will still obtain in the constituency where they <Col N="572" /> were eligible to vote at the time of election.</P>
      <P>There is a special provision for people who have either a temporary disablement or who have a disability and who choose not to have their name registered on the special register of electorate regarding changing the polling station which they might use within their constituency and which they may do even after an election is called.  We will discuss that on section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the case made was not clear.  It is not the Minister's fault, but my own.  Where somebody becomes disabled after the compilation of the register and will continue to be disabled, he may be disfranchised for a full year in the sense that he is disabled and cannot make his way to the polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically speaking, they may for a full year of their disability continue to be eligible to vote at their normal polling station but because they were not disabled at the time when the special voters' register for their constituency was being compiled, they will not have the benefit of this special provision available to them until the next normal time when that list is being compiled. They will have their eligibility to vote at their normal polling station.  If their disability is less than such as to make them totally non-ambulant, if they find a particular difficulty in using their local polling station because of difficulty of access or whatever, they will have the discretion to have their vote moved to another polling station which better facilitates their type of disability within the constituency.  That is provided for in section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any situation where there are only set prescribed periods for the compiling of electoral registers that will obtain and obtains in relation to people who move house or move constituencies or, indeed, in relation to people who discover that through an error or an omission their name is not contained on the normal voters' register.  As I mentioned earlier, <Col N="573" /> this is one of the matters which I would like to see addressed in a general Bill revising and updating the electoral laws which I would hope to see before the House early in 1987.</P>

      <P>Whenever an application is received by a registration authority after the prescribed date, the application shall be disregarded and the applicant shall be notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>I do not want to bring up the case of the islands continuously.  This is probably the last time we will have an opportunity to do so.  Will the same flexibility prevail that obtains at present where returning officers can name the day of an election, a date which can vary from island to island along the coast?  It has happened that island voting did not take place on the same day due to inclement weather. If a date is fixed and the officers in charge of that election are unable to make the trip to the island, that date may have to be altered.  Will the same flexibility obtain?  Will the presiding officers have that flexibility, when island voters' applications &mdash; for registration on a special voters' list &mdash; arrive late in the post, through no fault of their own, to give them the benefit of the doubt?  Because of the delay that has been caused and because the time prescribed has gone by, he is now ineligible to vote.  Could the Minister guarantee to the Seanad that that same flexibility will obtain, or has he anything in mind whereby islanders would be exempted from the provisions of subsection (3) and of other sections of this Bill, and that it would be left to the discretion of the presiding officer.</P>

      <P>I have to say I am very chary about responding to requests for Minister's guarantees to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The last time I responded positively to such a request from a colleague of the Senator's in another House, he immediately responded as soon as I gave the guarantee by calling a vote.  I am not in a position to give a guarantee on the lines which the Senator has outlined. <Col N="574" /> The prescribed period will be the period during which a person may apply to be entered on the special voters' register.</P>
      <P>In relation to the change which the House has asked me to make to have the special voters' register for the first time compiled relatively immediately, it is envisaged that that period will probably be some three weeks.  In relation to the period which will be available to the special voters to apply, in normal times if the register continues to be compiled on an annual basis, the prescribed period which would be available to the special voter would be approximately six weeks to two months.  Our weather has been somewhat strange of late and has been distorted from time to time by various things such as Hurricane Charlie but I doubt that he is going to plague us for as long as six weeks or two months at a time. I suspect that, even the voters in the most remote of the islands would be in a position to communicate their desire to have their names entered in the special voters' list and to have got an application form and returned it within a period as long as that.</P>
      <P>Indeed, in relation to the initial compiling of the special voters' register, which obviously now will be next month with the intervention of Christmas, I would have thought that a period of three weeks would be sufficient even with inclement weather to allow an island voter to have sought, got and returned an application form to the registration authority.  Even that period of time would be reasonable.  In other years it will be of a much longer duration.  I do not think that an undertaking that prescribed dates would not apply in the case of island voters is either necessary or in this case desirable.</P>

      <P>I take it that the same flexibility will be allowed to apply. Through no intervention of the Minister the flexibility in trying to get the ballot papers to the mainland and holding an election on the islands, should obtain.  I have no doubt whatever that if an election is called there will be another Hurricane Charlie of a different nature with greater <Col N="575" /> force than the one we had the last time. It will be a different Charlie on this occasion.</P>

The flexibility in relation to the holding of an election and, indeed, the arrangements for allowing the island special voter to vote under these arrangements would of course be the same as normally apply, subject to the same proviso that the ballot papers must be returned to reach the presiding officer not later than the close of poll on the day nominated for the holding of the poll on the mainland which is the proviso which obtains at present in relation to island voters.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what type of officers will be appointed?  Do I take it that the same type of presiding officers we have known heretofore will be calling on the special voters?  Will they work normal hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.?  Will they receive travelling expenses?  What system will be in operation?  It is important to know the type of officers and to know if these <Col N="576" /> officers will be appointed in the ordinary way by the county registrar.  Will the same category of people as heretofore be appointed?  It will take a considerable length of time to cover the areas of all the special voters.  In rural Ireland it will entail a vast amount of miles being travelled to get to the different voters.  It will be a time consuming job.  Will there be a number of presiding officers?  Is it the Minister's intention that the work will be completed in the whole area?  Will sufficient staff be appointed to carry out the work?  Or will it be for a period of a fortnight or three weeks?  What period will be allotted to the county registrar to carry out these duties?  It will be physically hard to get round all the areas. I would like to know what method of travelling will be used.  Will it be a squad car or the presiding officer's own transport? Will the presiding officer be given travelling expenses?  What method of transport will be used to carry out this work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The special presiding officer who will visit such houses will have the same authority and rights as a presiding officer in a polling station and therefore he will have certain powers available to him.  The normal presiding officer performs his or her duties in the full glare of publicity and under the eyes of personation agents plus candidates and others and therefore everything is done in the light of day.  The special presiding officer on the other hand is carrying out a very private, although public act, in very private circumstances.  Therefore, it is very necessary that the public should be reassured as to the type of person who would be so employed.  In this case it is the returning officer of the constituency who will actually appoint the presiding officer.  I have some reservations that, without certain guidelines, there may be suggestions that the integrity of that particular system would be open to question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole wants to know what type of officer will be appointed.  They will not be very much different from the normal presiding <Col N="577" /> officers.  The same standards of suitability will be required from them.  It will be suggested to returning officers that the people to be chosen should have a particular sensitivity to and awareness of the difficulties of the disabled.  It would be appropriate that that should be so.  As to the period over which this voting procedure might take place that of course will be determined by each returning officer based upon the numbers on the special voters' list within the particular constituency for which they are responsible. It may well be that this procedure can be satisfactorily carried out in one day in a certain constituency and it may take a period of a week in another.  The numbers of special presiding officers who will need to be appointed will also vary depending not only on the number of people on the special voters' list but also on the geography and topography of the constituency concerned.  In view of the interest being shown in the islands I have a horrid suspicion that those constituencies which have an island electorate will need to have people with particular qualifications, which leads me to the Senator's question regarding methods of transport.</P>
      <P>I had intended to say I would have assumed that the normal method of transport would have been by motor car but, in view of his intense interest in islands, I presume it will be by motor car and boat and whatever the local method of conveyance therein is &mdash; possibly by helicopter but only in the most extreme circumstances. In general it will be a time consuming task and particular sensitivity will be required on the part of the special presiding officers.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Magner's point, it is fair to remind the House that in this instance the special presiding officers, whilst they will be visiting the voter and having the voter conduct the voting process without the normal personation agent present, will be under the supervision of an officer of the Garda Síochána at all times during those procedures.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying there is an obligation on the Garda Síochána <Col N="578" /> member to ensure that the system is adhered to, apart from the general obligation of a Garda officer to ensure that the law is not broken?  Has he another function apart from protecting the ballot envelope, which I presume was the original intention?  Is it also the intention that he is the overseer?</P>

      <P>Has the garda to be present at all times during the carrying out of the voting?  As the Minister said, it is a very sensitive area.  I would go along with Senator Magner's point.  I would have reservations about the type of persons who would be selected as presiding officers.  They should be of the highest calibre.  On section 11 we will be dealing with the fact that the only people present will be the voter, the garda and the presiding officer.  If, for any reason &mdash; I do not want to be political &mdash; the presiding officer and the garda were of the same political affiliation and the voter was incapacitated to a large degree, would the Minister have any worries about that sensitive area?  Would he have any worries about the conduct which would obtain during the voting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the requirements and the obligations of the Garda officer are dealt with in section 11.  Essentially we are dealing here with the requirements of the obligations on the special presiding officer.  My reference to a member of the Garda Síochána being present was in connection with the sanction or stricture which the House felt it would like to see placed on the special presiding officer in the exercise of his or her function.  I think that is well provided for in the subsections to section 11.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a daughter-in-law or a son-in-law said to the presiding officer: &ldquo;That person is too sick at the moment&rdquo;, because they had different <Col N="579" /> political beliefs from the person who was ill.  At what stage can the presiding officer insist that the person should speak for himself?  What powers would there be in that event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried to provide as much as possible, through the emulation even of companion voting, against having any member of the household or staff of an institution, as the case may be, exercising undue influence over the special voter.  There will be a special need for the presiding officer to exercise a particular sensitivity in approaching his or her task.</P>
      <P>If a member of a household refuses to allow him admission it would be very difficult &mdash; perhaps wrong &mdash; for the Legislature to provide that this special presiding officer could insist upon gaining admission to a private house.  I would be more inclined to believe that, if a special voter had gone to the trouble of applying for entry in the special voters' register and had submitted a medical certificate which verified his eligibility for inclusion on that special voters' list &mdash; even with the notification of the time at which the special presiding officer was to arrive at the house &mdash; the special voter would be very anxious to ensure that the presiding officer did arrive.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult for the State &mdash; if not foolhardy &mdash; to endeavour to become involved in what is, in the example put forward by the Senator, an internal family matter.  To suggest that the State would take on the power to allow the returning officer total right of access to and demand entry to a private house might cause considerable difficulty and considerable cost and might create considerable acrimony.  I do not think it could be provided for in this type of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we are all endeavouring to facilitate people who are disabled, who cannot vote in the normal way and who have a genuine desire to exercise their franchise.  To some extent we have to assume the bona fides of most of those who are associated with the disabled. <Col N="580" /> Even though people have differing political views from time to time, it is probably a very extreme case to suggest that a member of the household would turn away a presiding officer with a ballot paper which is there to be filled up by a disabled member of the same household. It is a very extreme example.  That is not to say it cannot or will not happen.  We can only hope that it will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that quite draconian laws would have to be introduced to ensure that.  One would hope that everybody would co-operate in the implementation of this legislation. Section 9 (4) states:</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Acts relating to the right of an elector to request that his ballot paper be marked for him by a companion shall not apply...</P>
      <P>I assume that somebody who is not in a position physically to mark the paper may request that it be marked by the special presiding officer.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the section on which we will have the greatest confrontation.  This section is causing a lot of uneasiness.  A garda will arrive in a rural district with a presiding officer.  I take it that the presiding officers who will be appointed will be recruited from the office of the county registrar.  Perhaps the most suitable people to carry out this work would be people from the county registrar's office with a garda acting as a guide for the presiding officer.  A garda arrives in rural Ireland for one or two reasons, one being to deliver a summons and the other to investigate the occupant of some premises.  A certain scare will be <Col N="581" /> created by the visit of a garda in uniform. Is it necessary to have a uniformed garda calling on this sensitive mission of getting a disabled person to take part in an election? If he arrived without a uniform with a special presiding officer he would not frighten old people or people living alone.  The sight of an officer in uniform will frighten the living daylights out of old people trying to take part in an election. The result will be that many old people will not apply to have their names registered on a special voters' list because of the fear of a visit by a member of the Garda Síochána who will be regarded by them as a stranger both to the house and the locality.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the point where a father, daughter, son, nephew or niece will not be allowed to be present while a disabled or incapacitated person is voting.  That is another weakness in the Bill.  The person trying to vote will be nervous because he will be in the presence of a garda, a stranger to the house, and will not be able to concentrate properly. The Minister should consider amending this Bill either on Report Stage or in the Dáil to provide that the officer may be in plain clothes and some member of the family may be present when the person is voting.  If this is not done there will be many spoiled votes.  This is one reservation I have.  The others were technical but this is very sensitive and will disturb people and frighten them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the two points I have mentioned.  Some close friend of the person should be with him when he is voting.  When the two people arrive to carry out their duties the voter may not be out of bed.  The presence of some member of the family will be required to ensure that the voter is presentable and is ready to vote.  He should not be pushed hurriedly through a process of voting that could give a wrong result at the end of the day.  This is something the Minister will have to consider on section 11 as it is a sensitive area. Some old people living alone may not even answer the door because of the fact that they have not had notice of the arrival of these people.  The Minister said <Col N="582" /> a special notice will be sent out.  In the short days, when darkness falls very early, there may not be much light when these two people arrive.  The door may not be opened to them.  This may no apply as much in the cities as it will in rural areas.  The Minister will have to amend this section, if not on Report Stage in this House, certainly in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate some of the concerns expressed by Senator O'Toole but I feel he has gone overboard. My experience is that old people in particular are very jealous of their privacy in all things concerning money, land and the way they vote.  They would be the first category to object if a nephew, niece, son or daughter who might be of a different political persuasion were entitled to be there.  Settling an old person down or shaking up the duvet on the bed can be done prior to the arrival of the officials to take the vote.  I see no problem there. The visit of the garda and the presiding officer to remote cottages would probably be a very welcome departure from the norm.  The old person would be quite pleased and proud of himself for taking part in one of the most fundamental rights and privileges anyone has in a democracy &mdash; exercising his franchise.  It will be a matter of pride in rural Ireland rather than one of fear or a sense of disgrace if a garda calls.</P>
      <P>The reason I believe a garda should be in uniform, in contrast to the point made by Senator O'Toole is that one of the most reassuring uniforms in the country is that of the Garda.  The chances of getting a door opened at 5 o'clock on a winter's evening to two plainclothes gardaí are zilch.  The fact that the special voter is aware that these people are calling and that one of the people calling is wearing the uniform of the Garda Síochána will ensure that not only is the door opened but the person is satisfied that his safety is assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is adequate.  I am against the idea of a garda officer in mufti appearing <Col N="583" /> with a presiding officer similarly dressed. The Minister would be very wise not to make any alteration to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Magner's point is a fair one.  It would be a sorry day if we came to the stage of suggesting, in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, that voters or members of the public would become frightened by the visit to their home of a Garda officer in uniform.  In the context of elections, it will be well known that this new voting procedure is in place.  The fact that disabled people will have applied in advance and will have their vote brought to them by a special presiding officer, accompanied and protected by a Garda officer in uniform, is part of what I regard as one of the strengths of the system we are introducing.  It is a difficult system and an expensive one.  It is being done so expensively and in this manner, in order to give to incapacitated voters a facility which they do not now have, the facility to vote in the privacy of their own homes and without the influence of any other person being brought to bear upon them.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne already suggested that we could have a situation where a member of a disabled voter's family would endeavour to turn the special presiding officer away from the door and not allow him admittance to the house.  While we hope that is unlikely to occur, is it not all the more likely to occur if a member of the disabled person's family is allowed to be present in the room when the voting is taking place?  They are more likely to influence the special voter by their presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested to the House last week that in the instance where special voters may be living in long-stay institutions members of staff in those institutions do, of course, have a considerable amount of influence over patients because of the fact that those patients are so reliant upon them.  It is better that the voter should conduct the exercise of his or her franchise in private &mdash; and this is the primary reason this whole procedure is being set <Col N="584" /> up &mdash; with a representative of the returning officer, who is the person charged with ensuring that the election is carried out in a fair and impartial way without let or hindrance.  The entire procedure is being supervised by a member of the Garda Síochána.  It is entirely right that a member of the Garda Síochána ought to be in uniform.  I would have thought that if persons were to have apprehensions about a Garda officer arriving at their homes &mdash; this apprehension from their own point of view or a fear as to what their neighbours might believe &mdash; they should be all the more apprehensive to have a Garda officer arrive without wearing a uniform which usually serves to indicate that it is a matter of serious criminal intent which is under investigation by members of the Garda force who serve in plain clothes.</P>
    <P>In relation to all of the points which Senator O'Toole has made on the section, I find myself in disagreement with the views expressed by him.</P>

      <P>Is it true that the person who indicates to the returning officer that he wishes to change his polling station does not require the medical certification that is necessary for those on the special voters' list, that is, an indication of some incapacity?  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is not specifying that that person will necessarily have to provide a medical certificate but merely that he or she should satisfy the returning officer.  This provision will largely be operated based upon the experience of different returning officers as to its feasibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a real improvement from the point of view of disabled people, either those <Col N="585" /> who are suffering temporarily from a disability, or disabled people who, for one reason or another, do not find themselves on, or do not want to go on some special voters' register.  They can nominate a polling station which is much more accessible from the point of view of their own disability, as long as that polling station is within the same Dáil constituency, local electoral area, county or county borough, as the case may be, as between Dáil elections, local elections or European Assembly elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister says and I accept that it is a significant improvement but my concern is with the abuse of the system.  If somebody indicates seven days prior to polling day that they wish to vote in a certain school as opposed to another station, there is nothing to prevent them from exercising their franchise when, in fact, they are registered at polling station No. C.  Would it not be possible in this respect for the returning officer to indicate to the presiding officer of the original polling station that such a change has been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention.  The House will note that the first line of the section specifies that not less than seven days before polling day an elector must apply.  That seven day requirement enables the returning officer to make the arrangement to have the vote made available by the presiding officer in the new polling station being opted for and to notify the presiding officer in the polling station for which the voter is registered. In the case of the former, this person now has a voting eligibility at that station and, in the case of the latter, the voter while being on that register no longer has a voting entitlement at that polling station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Building societies have been the subject of increasing public attention in recent times.  The present Bill is a particularly timely one, I believe, and it deals with several issues which have given rise to some criticism of societies from their members and the public generally. However, it is not a regulatory measure only; it includes a very important provision which will have the effect of giving societies an opportunity to expand the range of services they may offer and it makes a new provision for a consultative group on matters affecting building societies.</P>
      <P>Before going on to discuss them in more detail, I will list briefly the matters dealt with in the Bill:</P>
      <P>Societies will be empowered to provide loans not secured by a mortgage, subject to regulations.  Bridging finance will be the first form of such lending to be permitted but other appropriate types of loan may also be considered;</P>
      <P>Tiered rates will be prohibited on loans taken out before 1 August 1986 where a society did not apply such rates on that date;</P>
      <P>Tiered rates will also be prohibited in the case of all loans taken out on or after 23 October.  However, this will not take effect until some six months after the Act has been passed to allow societies to adjust their investment rate structures as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> The Minister will be empowered to prescribe rules for societies regarding the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  prohibiting or restricting the charging of redemption fees, a practice which I believe to be fundamentally unfair;</P>
    <P>(b)  the making available of valuation reports to the borrower, who is required to bear the cost;</P>
    <P>(c)  the right of the borrower to insure the property with an insurer and through a broker of his or her choice;</P>
    <P>(d)  precluding or restricting a society from passing on its legal costs in the investigation of title, so that the borrower will have to pay only one set of legal fees;</P>
    <P>(e)  the arranging by a society of mortgage protection insurance through an insurer or intermediary nominated by it.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a faster procedure for the coming into effect of rules prescribed under the Building Societies Act, 1976, in relation to the appointment, remuneration and removal of the boards of directors of societies.</P>
    <P>A Building Societies Consultative Council is provided for &mdash; this replaces a somewhat similar provision of the 1976 Act.  Finally, two technical amendments to the 1976 Act have been included, the purpose of which I will refer to later.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the winds of change that are now blowing through the financial marketplaces of the world.  All areas of the financial services industry are going through a period of rapid change as new technology, deregulation and ever more intense competition make their impact felt.</P>
    <P>This scenario of change and development can be seen on many levels.  In a worldwide context, the question of trade in services is one of the major areas to be dealt with in the new round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  At EC level, the member states have committed themselves to working <Col N="588" /> towards the completion of the internal market by 1992, and in that context discussion has commenced at working party level on a draft directive on mortgage credit.  In Britain, there has been not only the much publicised &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; in the City of London, but, of more direct relevance in the present context, the enactment of a lengthy and comprehensive new Building Societies Act.</P>
    <P>The new British legislation not only greatly widens the range of activities in which societies can engage, but will also empower them to operate subsidiaries abroad.  This, together with the EC draft directive to which I have referred, means that Irish building societies can expect, in the years ahead, to face the challenge of increased competition in their home market and to have the opportunity for potential new markets abroad for their own services.</P>
    <P>In this context of rapid change, and having regard also to public concern about some building society practices, an interdepartmental committee was established last year to look at a wide range of issues affecting societies.  It made recommendations both in relation to the types of practice giving rise to criticism of the societies and, in a wider context, on the types of change in the legislation governing societies that would enable them to continue their development in the years ahead to the advantage of their borrowing and investing members and of the general public.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the committee's recommendations, I published a discussion document which was circulated to interested parties, from whom I requested, and received, written submissions. The document itself, together with these submissions, is the starting point for consideration of the future legislative framework within which societies should operate.  I emphasise, as I have done in speaking to the societies themselves, that it is a starting point, and not the last word.  If a strong case can be established, for example, for powers wider than those recommended, I will be prepared to listen and to give due <Col N="589" /> consideration to the weight of the arguments on each issue.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Senators from my remarks that I see the present Bill as a first step only; further legislation will be required and will be brought forward. However, before embarking on the major task of developing wide-ranging new measures &mdash; a task which with the best will in the world cannot be accomplished overnight &mdash; I was anxious to deal with some of the areas in which the societies have, justifiably, come in for a degree of public criticism.  I was disappointed to find that, despite my open attitude on the question of wider powers, which I have just outlined, the main societies were not prepared to co-operate with me by introducing a voluntary code of practice in relation to the practices in question.  For this reason, I have found it necessary to bring forward the present short Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be conscious of a further reason for the introduction of the Bill.  I refer to the move by a major society during the summer to introduce tiered mortgage rates.  It was bad enough that this society &mdash; which for so long had operated most successfully without recourse to tiered rates &mdash; should have taken this step at all, particularly at a time when one might have expected the trend to be away from tiering, but what made it particularly unacceptable to me, as to the members of the society affected, was the application of the change to existing loans.</P>
    <P>Borrowers, who had chosen the society in many cases for the very reason that it did not operate the tiered system, found that the rules were being changed in the middle of the game.  I considered this to be unfair; I said so, and I am dealing with the matter in the present Bill.  I was strengthened in my resolve to proceed with this measure when I was informed by the society in question, in the course of a meeting with the Irish Building Societies Association, that a board decision to introduce tiered rates had been taken six or seven years ago.  I find it extraordinary that no notice of this decision was given to members generally <Col N="590" /> or those members who borrowed from the society subsequent to that unpublicised board decision.</P>
    <P>I now propose to fill in a little more detail regarding the various measures contained in the Bill.  Section 2 makes a quite radical change in building society legislation by redefining the term &ldquo;society&rdquo; as used in the Acts.  In addition to the purposes of raising funds from members for the making of mortgage loans, societies may have the further purpose of making loans with or without security in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 3, then, obviously follows on from this new definition of a society and provides the power for the Minister to make regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the registrar, setting out the purposes of and the conditions &mdash; other than the rate of interest &mdash; for loans not secured in the traditional way by a mortgage.  The Minister is also being empowered to make any consequential changes to the Act that may be required as a result of regulations governing new types of loans.  Such regulations will require a positive resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4) and (5) of the section, which were not included in the Bill as originally published, would enable the Registrar of Building Societies to give a direction to a society or societies prohibiting the making of the type of loans covered by this section.  The registrar in deciding to use this power, is to have regard to the criterion of &ldquo;The Orderly and Proper Regulation of Building Society Business&rdquo;, an expression which occurs frequently in the Building Societies Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>I intend to use the new powers under this section to enable societies to provide bridging finance.  In a submission to me on the discussion document, the Irish Building Societies Association indicated that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There is no reason why this finance should not be offered within the building <Col N="591" /> society system, and at a substantial cost saving to the house buyer.</P>
    <P>Other areas of lending will also be considered &mdash; home improvement loans would be an obvious possibility.</P>
    <P>I must say I am somewhat mystified by the approach of the Irish Building Societies Association to this question of new lending powers.  In the submission from which I have just quoted, dated May 1986, they express a willingness to offer house improvement loans at a substantial reduction on the banks' interest rate.  In a more recent submission, however, they proposed that the Bill should be amended to confine loans under this section to bridging finance. Societies outside the association have, however, expressed an interest in forms of lending other than mortgages and bridging finance.  Any regulations made under the section will, of course, be permissive, that is to say, societies will be under no obligation to avail of the new lending powers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with tiered interest rates, a tiered rate being defined as a rate greater than the lowest one available to members of a society generally and which is determined by reference to the size of the loan, the amount outstanding or the income of the borrower.  This latter element has been included in the definition in case societies would otherwise be tempted to use the criterion of income to replace their existing system of tiered rates.</P>
    <P>Tiered rates will be prohibited in the following cases:</P>
    <P>Where the mortgage was created before 1 August last and a tiered rate was not being charged in respect of the loan on that date; and</P>
    <P>Where the mortgage was created on or after 23 October &mdash; the date of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the latter case, however, for a period of some six months from the passing of the Act societies will be permitted to continue charging tiered rates on the loans.  This is to give them a chance to <Col N="592" /> review their interest rate structures to take account of the prohibiting of tiered rates on the lending side.  Once the six months are up, however, a tiered rate cannot be applied to any loan taken out after the Bill was published.  This spells the end of tiered rates on new loans.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a borrower who is charged a tiered tate in contravention of the preceding section has the right to recover whatever excess amount he may have paid.  Furthermore, a borrower cannot be held to be in contravention of his mortgage contract if he refuses to pay any excess amount demanded by a society charging a tiered rate contrary to the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a key section in the Bill providing, as it does, for the making of regulations by the Minister in relation to several building society practices.  Rules prescribed under this section will come into effect one month after the commencement of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The prohibiting or restricting of the charging of redemption fees is the first matter regarding which rules can be prescribed under subsection (1) of section 6. This practice of charging a penalty which may be up to several months interest to a borrower who wishes to repay a loan early strikes me as very unfair.  I have not been convinced by any of the arguments I have heard in favour of the practice, and I know that borrowers will warmly welcome the regulations which I will make in this regard.</P>
    <P>A valuation report on the property being mortgaged is required under section 79 of the Building Societies Act, 1976.  As many Senators will be aware from their own experience, societies have operated the frustrating practice of charging the cost of this report to the borrower while refusing to give him or her sight of the report.  The Restrictive Practices Commission recommended that an order should be made in relation to this practice but, instead, I propose to deal with it under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended action is the practice by societies of <Col N="593" /> requiring borrowers to insure the mortgaged property with an insurer nominated by the society and through the agency of the society.  Regulations can be made under this section removing or restricting the right of a society to insist on a particular insurer or intermediary.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which societies come in for particular criticism is that of the legal costs of house purchase.  Contrary to the practice elsewhere, Irish building societies insist on having title to the property being mortgaged examined by solicitors nominated by the societies from quite restricted panels.  The fees for this examination of title are charged to the individual borrower, who has also, of course, his own legal fees to pay.  Under this section, I will be in a position to prescribe rules precluding or restricting societies from passing on their legal costs to the borrower.</P>
    <P>Rules can also be prescribed under section 6 in relation to the arranging by a society through an insurer or an intermediary nominated by it for the provision of mortgage protection insurance.  Such arrangements have been made in relation to publicly funded house purchase loans and I believe they can be very worthwhile from the borrowers' point of view.</P>
    <P>I must point out that extensive powers to prescribe rules are already conferred on the Minister under section 10 of the 1976 Act; the powers in section 6 of this Bill are in addition to those already in existence.  However, under the procedures in the 1976 Act, it would take a lengthy period before the prescribed rules could come into operation.  For this reason, I have added a section, section 7, to the Bill to expedite the coming into operation of any rules to be prescribed under the 1976 Act in relation to a particularly important area, that of the appointment, remuneration and removal of the boards of directors of societies. This is an area of the operation of societies that has been the subject of much comment and I believe it is one in which there is considerable scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>Under the new procedure, the registrar will notify a society within one month of <Col N="594" /> the commencement of the regulations if its rules are not consistent with those prescribed.  The rules will come into effect three months after the commencement of the regulations.  A society will have a right of appeal to the High Court before the expiration of that three months period and, where the appeal fails, the rules will take effect from one month after the date of the court's decision.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 10 have also been added to the Bill since it was first published.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment of a Building Societies Consultative Council which will have a duty to advise the Minister on matters referred to it by him and a general right to advise on matters affecting building society business. This section replaces section 96 of the 1976 Act, which is being repealed. The essential differences between the two sections are that there is no specific limit on the number of members and no specific bodies or organisations are referred to in the new provision.  Under the 1976 provision, there was a limit of nine and specific reference was made to having representatives from the Departments of the Environment and Finance, the registrar, the Central Bank and the Irish Building Societies Association.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in view of the rapidly changing situation in the financial services area, to which I have referred, it is better to have a more flexible provision to enable the Minister of the day to decide on the size and composition of the council which is most appropriate to the prevailing circumstances.  The committee provided for under the 1976 Act was never, in fact, appointed.  It seems to me that the appointment of a body truly representative of societies and other interested and competent parties would be particularly appropriate now and that is why I have decided to up-date this provision.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 were originally included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985.  Since they are clearly more appropriate to the present Bill, I have decided to insert them here <Col N="595" /> and to have them deleted from the Housing Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends section 12 of the 1976 Act.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow the registrar the same discretion in relation to the registration of alterations to the rules of societies as he has in registering the rules of societies in the first place.  Under the 1976 Act, the registrar had to register alterations to rules once he was satisfied that they were in accordance with the Acts.  This amendment would enable him to reject an amendment which he considered would be prejudicial to the orderly and proper regulation of building society business.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends section 22 of the 1976 Act by providing specifically that societies may borrow abroad.  Societies have, in the past, borrowed money abroad under the existing provision, but this wording puts it beyond doubt that societies have this right.  It also provides for appropriate control of such borrowing by requiring the authorisation of the registrar with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Building societies have become very important institutions in our national life to which they have made a major contribution by enabling so many people to achieve the goal of home ownership. They can be justly proud of their achievements and it is right that we should acknowledge them.  As legislators, we have a duty to ensure that they operate within a framework that will enable them to continue and to enhance their contribution to the general wellbeing and we also have a duty to ensure that their practices, which affect the lives of so many people in so fundamental a matter as housing, are just and reasonable.  The Bill is, as I have said, a first step on the road to a comprehensive review of building society legislation.  It is an important Bill, and I commend it to Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of the Bill, according to the Minister, are the protection of mortgage holders and the elimination of objectionable practices and also to secure the future for building <Col N="596" /> societies and to regulate and encourage them to do some of the things one would expect in normal market conditions.  I have great doubts about this Bill and cannot see it having any major beneficial effect on the operation of building societies except perhaps in a negative manner and I cannot see it being of any real benefit to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The building society movement has been serving the people of this country for many years.  In general these societies have done a good job throughout times of economic growth and they are still doing a good job in times of economic stagnation.  The societies are a major contributor to the economy representing as they do over 120,000 mortgage holders and approximately 800,000 depositors. Ireland has one of the highest percentages of home ownership in the world and this could not have arisen were it not for the vibrancy, good management and aggressiveness of the building societies.</P>
      <P>Much has been made over the past few months of the amount of money being spent by building societies on advertising. I am not sure there is a need to advertise as much and as often as they do and I often feel that the main beneficiaries of the advertising hard sell are not the advertisers &mdash; in this case the building societies &mdash; but the companies producing the advertisements and also the people who relay them either on TV, radio or in the newspapers.  We hear criticism of advertising by building societies from people who are very slow to criticise companies in the supermarket or food distribution area.  Money generated from advertising by building societies is used for the benefit of the societies and the benefit of the Irish economy, whereas quite a large proportion of the money used by supermarket groups in advertising is used to sell non-Irish goods or to persuade people to buy non-Irish goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that building societies are major contributors to the Irish economy I mean this in a real sense.  There is not a house builder in the country who has not benefited from the operation of building societies and, indeed, there is hardly a <Col N="597" /> building tradesman or a general operative in the building industry who has not had a major part of his income over the years generated by the loans which have come from building societies.  The State has quite a good record in the provision of finance for house purchase through its Department of Environment programmes of local authority house building, through SDA loans and HFA loans. A combination of State funding for house building and private funding from share-holder's funds from banks and building societies is very necessary if we are to provide on a continuing basis adequate housing for our people.</P>
    <P>There are inadequacies in the operations of all means of providing housing and there is no one who could suggest that improvements could not take place in the operations of the building societies. This Bill does not address the societies and their operations for the right reasons or in the right areas.</P>
    <P>Many comments have been made about the differences in management costs between the companies and the building societies and questions have been asked about the remuneration of directors and the expenses they receive. If we check out the remuneration of people in the building societies it is clear that it is not enormous by financial institutions' standards.  The maximum quoted by Deputy Yates in relation to one of these people was £35,000 a year.  If we cannot afford to pay £35,000 to a full time director of a company and if we consider they are not entitled to be paid £35,000 a year, it is time the rest of us left the country because, if we are not prepared to pay for good management, those people will not stay in the country.  There is a mood abroad that people should not be paid for doing a good job.  It is about time we forgot that and tried to pay people to do the job.  We will have better standards of management and if the Senators and TDs were paid a bit more we might get a better standard of TD and Senator although I am not criticising the present Members.</P>

      <P>We have <Col N="598" /> good TDs and Senators but they are not properly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>People compare remuneration and expenses of directors of building societies with normal financial institutions but there is a major difference. No director of a building society can hold equity in a building society because there is no such practice.  They are merely paid their salaries and expenses due.  They cannot pass on shares in a building society in the same manner as directors of banks pass on their shares. The only interest that a director can have apart from his salary or expenses, is from a deposit account and he gets the same rate of interest as any other member of the public.  There is not direct similarity between the remuneration of directors of banks, finance houses and the remuneration of directors of building societies.</P>
      <P>The Bill does nothing to help either side of the equation in relation to the better running of building societies for the benefit of depositors or mortgage holders. We must attempt to protect the overall interest of the people in relation to building societies.  There is a possibility, on the passing of this Bill, that there will be benefits to certain mortgage holders through the abolition of the tiered system but, equally, there is no guarantee that the income lost to the societies as a result of the abolition will be absorbed in saving in the running of the societies.  I will be happy to see the abolition of the tiered systems of interest rates in all financial institutions, including banks, as the benefits of tiered systems go to the larger borrowers and depositors.  In the case of tiered interest rates, there is absolutely no doubt that borrowers from banks suffer because of the system.  The smaller borrower pays a lot more than the larger borrower and this is surely something that should be addressed by the banks as well as addressing it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some merit in the parts of the Bill which purport to do away with restrictive practices such as redemption fees and the requirements to use particular insurance companies and solicitors. To change the rules in these areas <Col N="599" /> might be useful to a certain number of people but I cannot see them making any major financial contribution to the borrower.  I fear that on the changeover any income lost will be inevitably taken up by an increase in overall interest rates. Indeed, when we talk about the restrictive practices involved in terms of solicitors and insurance companies, if the Minister is so worried about the borrowers he should look at the rules of the Department of the Environment regarding the taking out of an SDA or a HFA loan.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment make certain that the county council involved use their own solicitors in the granting of a loan and the borrower must use his own solicitor.  The Department of the Environment will not accept an independent solicitor or allow the borrower to have the solicitor of his choice. If the Minister is serious in terms of regulating the borrower's right in terms of solicitors he should ensure that his own Department apply the same regime.  In relation to insurance, there is now a change in that mortgage protection has to be built into any loan granted by the Department of the Environment but the borrower cannot go to any insurer and look for an independent quote on a mortgage protection policy.  He cannot go to his own insurance broker or insurance company.  The mortgage protection policy is written into the mortgage by the local authority and the borrower has no right to question that, which has meant that interest rates have risen marginally within the public sector because of this imposition by the Department of the Environment.  If that is so within the Department of the Environment, it will apply equally to building societies.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 3 of the Bill which allows new loans to be made by the societies although there should be an upper limit to the amount of societies' funds which could be used for any purpose other than for house loans.  Originally it was not quite specific regarding the area in which these loans could be taken up, but the Minister is quite specific now that they can be only taken up in terms of <Col N="600" /> bridging loan.  I welcome that provision because for the past number of years too many people have had to pay bridging loans for too long at too high a rate through the banks.  The building societies were not holding up proceedings.  In many cases the transfer of title was held up because solicitors were not doing their job properly.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the new provisions now being brought in which will allow the building societies to give out bridging loans will ensure that the borrower will be able to get a bridging loan at a reasonable cost, well below the current bank bridging loan rate of interest which is extremely high.  Of course the reason it is extremely high is that the banks know the borrower is in a very difficult position and if he does not get the bridging loan he will not be able to buy his house. Therefore, they charge whatever they like on these bridging loans.  Of course they do not tell the people that if they go over the length of the term of the bridging loan they are charged excess interest on the loans and they add this excess interest &mdash; sometimes it can be up to 6 per cent &mdash; without notifying the borrower.  This is an area that should be looked at if we are talking in terms of provisional funds for housing because basically building societies are there to provide moneys for housing.</P>
    <P>The other areas of provisional money for housing should also be taken into account and probably one of the weaknesses in this legislation is that it does not go far enough.  It is a very short Bill which was introduced because of the hullabaloo over the tiered system of interest rates brought in by one particular company and at the same time there was an increase of 3 per cent by a specific company.  It is typical to bring in legislation which is seen to be popular but nevertheless we should not bring in Bills like this on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  We should attempt to ensure that a Bill dealing with major financial institutions is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas as legislation is changing throughout Europe in the area of borrowing, lending and investment.  Events will overtake us here very shortly if we <Col N="601" /> do not bring in a Bill which will give some protection to Irish financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The section of the Bill which allows new loans to be made by societies was dealt with, but I said I would not like to see too big a percentage of the funds of societies given out for any purpose other than house loans.  The Minister has suggested bridging loans and, of course, I presume the bridging loan involved here will be a bridging loan on the purchase of a house.  Often bridging loans are given for other purposes and quite a lot of money could be used while people are waiting for documentation or whatever. The business of building societies is to borrow money and to lend it for the purpose of building houses.  The provision for finance for houses should be the main objective of a building society, especially now when there is such major competition for funds from other financial institutions.  In the past few years one of the bigger building societies was taken over by a banking group.  I would like to see building societies engage in banking, insurance and the provision of full financial services but not if these other activities were to the detriment of the main purpose of the building societies, which is the provision of houses.</P>
    <P>Building societies in England, under new legislation, have been allowed to engage in a full range of financial services and, of course, it will apply to building societies here very shortly because of new EC regulations on the opening up of the insurance and financial institutions market.  They will have to stand up to competition from societies which are well known to us here from television advertising. Without going into names, some of them are enormous in their size and scope.  I believe Irish building societies will succeed in competing with these new companies and I am also confident that they will, when allowed, be able to make an input in major EC markets.  Competition for funds and for services will inevitably be enormous in the near future and if, as is suggested, building societies' management costs are too high, then automatically they will not stay in business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> It will be interesting to see what happens in terms of competition when the new societies start coming in here.  Irish banks are small in terms of the British banking system, but they have been extremely successful in their operations in Great Britain.  Allied Irish Banks in terms of the world banking system are extremely small, but apparently small is beautiful when we consider the profits and organisation they have been able to put into their banking system in the United States.  The impact of foreign companies on the building societies can be kept to a minimum and, of course, if their management costs are too high, they will be forced out of business because they will not have funds to lend.</P>
    <P>Like every other mortgage holder, I detest an increase in interest rates when I have a shrinking income.  I agree with speakers who suggested the pinning of rates for a long period as this would enable all mortgage holders to plan their outgoings.  High interest rates here are not caused by the building societies but by a combination of internal and external factors.  The Government must take responsibility for our current high interest rates; there is absolutely no doubt that the imposition of DIRT has had major implications for the financial sectors in that very large amounts of moneys have left the country leaving financial institutions short of funds to give to prospective borrowers.  If the outflow of moneys from this country continues interest rates will rise and, unfortunately, there will not be enough funds in financial institutions to pay for the operation of businesses and building societies will not have the funds to give out to potential borrowers.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that funds are beginning to dry up, that people do not have the money to invest any more in building societies or banks, even though the Government, and indeed many financial institutions suggested there would be a big increase in the amount of moneys people would have to spend this year.  The majority of this money, it has been stated, is now taken up in paying back former borrowings and this leaves <Col N="603" /> very little money in people's pockets for the suggested spending spree before Christmas.  Even if there is a spending spree, unfortunately it will benefit Northern Ireland.  The relevant Minister does not seem to be doing anything to stop the hundreds of buses going over the Border every day.  I cannot see how difficult it would be to stop a bus or to prosecute the person in Newry interviewed by a reporter on the 6 o'clock news bulletin holding up a television set for which he paid £150.  He said he was bringing it back from the North, without paying VAT or duty and a woman also interviewed said she had bought £500 worth of goods. They were identifiable and there is absolutely nothing being done to stop this type of spending.  I cannot see why the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; programme every morning is allowed to have a comparison table on the price of goods in Dublin shops and those over the Border.  There should not be such comparisons.  The reporters do not speak of the cost of getting to the North or various other costs.  Traders in this country should not be &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; by the local television station.</P>

      <P>The Appropriation Bill will not be debated until after Christmas when all our money will be in Newry and Belfast.  The Bill, as I said, does not go far enough.  A number of provisions will possibly help people, such as the suggestion that where a survey is done by a building society on a building, it should be available to the borrower.  There are people who suggest that this is not a good thing, that it might preclude valuers from giving a proper valuation, that they might show up defects in the house and if these were shown to the borrower there might be repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of new sections have been added to the Bill since it was introduced <Col N="604" /> in the Dáil.  In the section which introduces the establishment of the building societies' consultative council, the Minister stated that it will be flexible so we could have a consultative committee of 90 or nine.  The 1976 Act stated that there should be a consultative committee of nine and that is a reasonable number.  To leave it open to the Minister to decide the number, without putting it in the Bill, is a major flaw.  I should not like to see any Bill coming into this House where this or any other Minister takes upon himself the setting up of a consultative council in which he is the only person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always said irrespective of Government.  The Minister is taking unto himself the right to make up a consultative council.  He does not give the numbers or anything else, apart from the fact that it will be set up and that it is overtaking the provisions of the 1976 Act.  If the Minister was so concerned about occurrences within the building societies over the past number of months or years why did he not activitate this consultative commission which the 1976 Act empowered him to do?  If there were major problems the consultative committee could have been brought in and used as an arbitrator between the Minister, the building societies and the borrowers. I am worried about tiered loans as their operation in the banking system benefits that system, the bigger borrower and the bigger lender and are to the detriment of the smaller borrower and lender.  If a substantial amount of income is being got through the tiered system of interest rates through the building societies, the only way they will get it back is by increasing the rate for the smaller borrower and decreasing it for the smaller lender to the building societies.  Building societies, from management costs, will not be able to replace the income from one unless, as I said, they increase the interest rates of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is short and will not make much difference.  It is a PR exercise in <Col N="605" /> the main and its implications will not benefit any section of society &mdash; the building societies are the very people to whom it is supposed to be addressed or the mortgagees of the building societies.</P>

    <P>My contribution will range from a few moments in dealing with Senator Lanigan's contribution to a much more measured speech in relation to the Bill, to certain minor shortcomings in it and to certain aspects of the building society world.  I was a little bit confused by Senator Lanigan's speech and I hope it is not the considered view of both the Leader of this House, and the Leader of the Opposition in the other House.  He started off by saying there was no need for the Bill.  A short time later he said that it had some merit.  Then he said it does not go far enough and also that it will not make any great difference.  I do not really know Senator Lanigan's position on the Bill or if he gave it any time or consideration.  Did he intend to speak here this evening or did he suddenly rush from a more pressing engagement to speak on a Bill which he had not had the opportunity to read?  It is an offence to this House that he should speak in that fashion, particularly when his only concern was to protect the life and lifestyles of directors of building societies.  He mentioned some concern for the building of new homes.  I assume he would also be interested in prospective mortgagees, the house buying public, young couples getting married who intend to buy a house and who are confronted by a degree of <Col N="606" /> self regulations by the building society which, unfortunately, have not been in their interest in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be critical of the building society movement in general, as it has been a tremendously important institution for, in many cases, well over a century.  The building societies were largely founded in the last quarter of the last century and have played an immensely important part in the ability of people to buy their own homes.  There is an extraordinarily high rate of home ownership.  As I understand it, 70.8 per cent of our community own their homes and are assisted to a large degree by building societies in doing so.  That degree of home ownership is on a world level.  It is spectacular and, apart from New Zealand, no country has managed to achieve that degree of home ownership. It is something we should encourage and it is part and parcel historically of the Irish character.  They want to own their homes and to improve them and that is something of which we can be very proud.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a great deal of merit although some of the detailed sections might not be of earth shattering importance. However, to those who face the prospect of buying and selling a house they are of extreme importance.  The section allowing building societies to offer other than the security of a mortgage, the sole activity largely which they are engaged in at present, is an important section in this Bill &mdash; to make loans in other words for other purposes.  The point made by the Minister when he was introducing this Bill that he will allow the building societies to get into the area of bridging finance is very important.</P>
    <P>Prospective house purchasers face the difficulties of getting bridging finance and of adding some considerable extra interest to their purchasing requirements. They have to deal with a whole variety of fees before they ever get to the point of securing a building society loan. There are intervals between the sanction of the loan and the availability of finance. There are intervals of that kind also &mdash; indeed longer periods &mdash; generally affecting <Col N="607" /> HFA and SDA loans and there are difficulties faced by many in relation to where to go.  There are people who do not have a sufficiently developed relationship with their bank manager &mdash; they might not even have a bank manager &mdash; their sole saving might be in the building society, and the difficulties in getting a bridging finance arrangement can often be great.  When they have to come up with it in a hurry and have counted every £50 in purchasing their home, the availability of bridging finance through the building societies is an important aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider what he will do about the applicants for the HFA and SDA loans who face the same problem of bridging finance difficulties.  It is something that needs to be done at local authority level and through his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a development he would like to see taking place by the building societies in the area of home improvement and reconstruction.  He and his Department have been giving great impetus to this at national level recently with the home improvements grant scheme.  The building societies have been co-operating with owners in refinancing houses.  If one finds oneself in a position where one has to face certain improvements they will refinance the house or put the house in at a different figure allowing for the improvements.  That has been going on to a certain degree.  It is something that I benefited from in the past.  The change in relation to tiered rates is a very important and timely change.  I very much welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke earlier about the question of making available to the borrower the valuation report on the property being purchased.  He said he intended by regulation to deal with this matter.  I quote from his speech:</P>
    <P>As many Senators will be aware from their own experience, societies have operated the frustrating practice of charging the cost of this report to the borrower while refusing to give him <Col N="608" /> or her sight of the report.  The Restrictive Practices Commission has recommended that an order should be made in relation to this practice, but, instead, I propose to deal with it under the present Bill.  The valuer's report as we know it relating to the purchase of a house is a very confusing area and perhaps it is one that will need some additional thought in the Department of the Environment in the interest of securing the right remedy.  There are a great variety of people, architects, valuers and so on, who do reports for building societies.  There is no such person I know of who can do a report as a structural person, in other words, a person who will be able to speak on the structure of the house and also able to speak on the value of the house.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in this in trying to come up with the right solution in relation to the kind of person who will give an all embracing report which will deal with both the structure and the value.  We have problems at present with certain building societies using architects and certain building societies using valuers.  The architect goes out, has a look at the house, gives his confidential report to the building society but he would not be attuned to market conditions on the value of that house.  Some of the building societies are using architects for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I happen to be the nominee of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute in this House and for that reason I have a fair knowledge in this area.  I want to make that point because we have to get this structured correctly.  It does not seem that releasing the valuers report is always going to necessarily help the borrower. In the final analysis if we get the right combination of people doing that report it would be helpful.  What is required is a report on the structure and a report on the value and somehow to get that together in a fashion where it could be helpful to the borrower.  In the general area of releasing these reports I am very much in favour of what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other matters concerned <Col N="609" /> with the use of an insurance company suggested by the building society in relation to the question of legal costs paid by the borrower who also, incidentally, pays his own costs with the vendor paying theirs.  It is quite unbelievable that we have a situation like that I welcome the new provision in that regard and also the provision relating to what we were saying a moment ago on insurance affecting mortgage protection.</P>
    <P>One of the more important aspects of this Bill is in relation to redemption fees. It is incontestable that there is a situation where in order to get out of a society and move on to another society &mdash; I had this experience three or four years ago &mdash; you are charged a handsome fee on getting out and a handsome fee on getting in. Those kind of sizeable sums on top of moving house are very severe on individuals. There is no explanation for them. With the level of interest and profits societies earn, that kind of thing should not be allowed.  I very much welcome the provision in the Bill in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on building societies generally.  It has got to be borne in mind in relation to societies that there are some 13 building societies in Ireland with assets ranging from over £100 million down to a few million pounds.  We are dealing with four very large societies &mdash; the big four as they are called.  The directors of those societies seem to have a large degree of power, so much so that it is virtually impossible to have a sufficient voting strength as a depositor to exercise control or even attempt to influence the manner in which the societies are operated.  These thoughts are coming in relation to a Bill that the Minister admits is dealing with an area of building society needs for legislation. The Minister will, I am sure in due course deal with a more expanded need for legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Building societies influence the financial market where their position is more profitable than the banks &mdash; the most profitable financial institutions in the land.  This is at variance with the popular concept of non-profit making organisations. <Col N="610" /> The building societies have got into the financial stage of being in control of hundreds of millions of pounds.  That is an enormous situation for these societies to be in with the level of control that seems to be exercised on them from outside whether by way of their depositors or by way of the State.</P>
    <P>To that degree all of what is being done in this Bill is very welcome.  The top five building societies &mdash; the Irish Permanent, the Educational, the First National, Irish Nationwide and the Irish Civil Service &mdash; control 90 per cent of the assets of building societies and all of them advertise extensively.  They do not advertise just in the printed media but they advertise through television and the cinema.  Anywhere you go you come across advertising by building societies about how friendly they are and how well looked after you would be, both financially and otherwise, by coming in to see them.  The building societies also operate an extensive branch network.  Part and parcel of their branch network are agencies.  I accept fully that not all the signs you see for the Irish Permanent Building Society or the Educational Building Society are branches but they are firms of auctioneers who are agencies for particular building societies. There is nothing wrong with that.  I can think back to ten years ago, looking down on a town in Donegal where apart from a couple of banks, the building societies were the most prominent buildings you would see even from a couple of miles away.  The other day I was driving along Sundrive Road to Kimmage Cross and noted five building societies in that area. They are competing with each other and they operate in very smart premises.</P>
    <P>They have devoted a considerable amount of their profits into expenditure on both advertising and on developing this network of premises throughout the country.  The figures are slightly out of date but in 1982 there were 670 branch banks around the country operated by all the banks.  There are 525 branches and agencies of building societies around the country.  They are almost comparable in the numbers of units of their organisation throughout the country as are the banks <Col N="611" /> and they are more profitable than the banks.  We should examine their activities and also look at other areas in the course of time.</P>
    <P>The building societies provide an immensely important stimulus for the level of home ownership in Ireland where over 70 per cent of the population own their own homes.  The building societies, established as they are for over a century in many cases, have provided an enormous stimulus in that direction.  Many of the societies operate extremely well with very high standards although there are criticisms of some which we are all too well aware of following the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme last week.  In the area of property, shops and agencies there are some merits in the building societies group spreading their wings and opening branches in different parts of the country.  More often than not they are opening these branches in rather secondary shopping arcades that might fall into disuse were it not for the building society or some other type of service organisation moving in.  They play an important role in keeping in business the shopping arcades that have been competing with new major and out-of-town centres.  It gives them a chance to continue trading and it provides local shopping centres for the people.</P>
    <P>The lending and deposit market of building societies increased considerably in the period from 1972 to 1982.  It is clear that in 1982 the total lending market of the building societies was 15.5 per cent and the deposit market was 16.3 per cent. If you compare that with the Associated Banks at 41.4 per cent and 48.7 per cent you will see there has been an enormous increase in the activity of building societies. The building societies have obviously been taking an interest in other areas.  It is quite clear to me that there has been an interest by building societies in the building world outside the building and improvement of their own branch premises. They have been interested in the building world generally.</P>
    <P>Trends in Britain show a diversification by the building societies and there is a <Col N="612" /> challenging period ahead for the building society movement.  It is a challenging period also for other professional activities associated with building or building finance.  I speak here obviously of those engaged as auctioneers and estate agents, of brokers in the area of insurance and agents dealing with the purchase and sale of shares, or stockbrokers as they are more familiarly known.  Given the trend in the United Kingdom, building societies in Ireland will be looking for an increased role in the financial market.  In due course we, as a Government, will have to consider what they do in this area.  Signs are for a much wider role for building societies.  The Minister has taken a major step in allowing them to get into the area of bridging finance and presumably into home improvement.  These are areas which will assist the national Exchequer at a time when there will be a need for curtailing the amount of demand on its resources and spreading the load perhaps to areas where they could assist.</P>
    <P>The building societies operate a very large portion of the home loan provision in Ireland.  I am sure the Minister will have a more up-to-date figure but they financed 74.2 per cent of the home loans in 1980.  Their operations have given a great deal of help to people who want to buy their home.  I am concerned, as I know are many Members of this House, about the cartel operated by the building societies and the fact that it has been very difficult for any innovation to be offered to house buyers by way of mortgages.</P>
    <P>One question I want to mention relates to the type of thing I have come across in practice in the past &mdash; and I am sure is going on to much a lesser degree today than was going on then &mdash; where one could not help but be aware of a certain type of understanding, putting it in its mildest form, between those engaged in the building of certain new housing areas and those providing the finance in striking the market price of the houses.  I do not know if it is going on today to the same extent but the mortgagee would obviously be the person who, in the final analysis, would suffer from a fixed price that was not related to the market.  My <Col N="613" /> comment on this is not intended to deal with all the building societies but there have been instances where that was at least suspected.  Everybody here may suspect it may be going on.  The Minister mentioned the release of the valuation report &mdash; and that will be very important for the protection of the mortgagee.</P>
    <P>I have been talking during the past few minutes about the four big building societies.  In recent weeks we have seen the rise of the mortgage interest rate by 3 per cent.  It has been felt by many &mdash; I know the Minister was not quite in relation to his criticism of this &mdash; that the building societies could have chosen a little less than they chose.  It is felt that perhaps they were a little hard on the mortgagees at this time in raising mortgages to that extent.  The four big building societies are the ones I mentioned earlier. They vary in the manner in which they operate their society, in the assets they own and in the numbers of staff they employ.  It is appropriate that I bring to the attention of this House a certain matter which has come to my notice in the past number of weeks relating to the internal organisation and affairs of the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I do this not just in the interests of the staff in that building society but in the interests of the staffs of other commercial and industrial concerns in Ireland who in some instances may be suffering the exact same plight from the management of their company, or society as in this case.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I was approached in my position as public representative by three individuals on the staff at the headquarters of the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I was told a number of things relating to the internal organisation and operation of that society.  There is no trade union involvement in that society whereas there is in the Irish Permanent and the Educational Building Societies. I believe something of the order of 150 personnel other than management are employed in general in branches.</P>
    <P>In the Nationwide's new headquarters at the corner of Camden Street, where 60 to 70 staff are employed, a movement <Col N="614" /> got under way in October or early November.  The staff felt it was necessary and fruitful for them to meet to discuss areas of mutual interest and concern as staff members and their relationship with the management of that building society. The meeting took place as scheduled. Out of the 60 or 70 members of staff who could have attended this meeting 17 were present.  The arrangement made with the management of that society was that they could meet at 5.30 p.m. provided the discussions were over at 6 p.m.  I am sure Senators will agree, without unnecessarily demonstrating my point, that it seems to be a little out of the ordinary practice of engaging in discussions of any kind to be told before you start that the matter would be so curtailed that you had half an hour and then you would have to leave the building which, as I understand it from a number of sources, is what happened in the Irish Nationwide Building Society.</P>
    <P>A day or two following that meeting a communication &mdash; not by letter &mdash; was made to the staff concerned.  They were told that at no time in the foreseeable future would they be permitted to use staff premises to have meetings of that kind relating to a discussion among themselves on mutual staff interests and concerns members of staffs usually have. Members of this House can meet together as a political group or through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and members of a trade union can hold meetings.</P>
    <P>For example, Senator Shane Ross will get together with other stockbrokers and there will be meetings of those engaged in property, engineering and so on.  An incident where staffs of a major building society &mdash; considered capable of having a major influence on our society &mdash; cannot allow staff to meet or in any sense try to regulate the length of time during which staff could meet seems to be unfortunate. I have also been told that there is a variety of other concerns affecting staff in that organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which not just transcends the building society movement, and perhaps more than one society, but also could be part and parcel of the organisation of other financial or commercial institutions.  That is important enough to be discussed here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Words used to me yesterday were to the effect that that society seem to employ redundant staff frequently, paying them a pittance.  One staff member employed in that society dealing with mortgages for six years is now paid a figure of £100 per week.  It is hard to believe that is the going rate on the market at present for somebody who has had that experience in handling mortgages at the level he is apparently at.</P>
      <P>I mentioned this to make a point concerning the great need, on the one hand, for societies like the Irish Nationwide to bear in mind the balancing situation of not becoming too zealous in the direction of raising interest rates &mdash; which has been happening recently &mdash; or, on the other hand, of not concerning themselves enough with the interests of staff in their societies.  The board of the Irish Nationwide Building Society would do themselves much good in the period ahead by avoiding the prospect of union confrontation which could necessarily be the outcome of the kind of attitude they seem to adopt to normal meetings of mutual interest by staff members.  They should do this before it is too late to avoid the difficulties the Trust Houses seem to be having in operating a concern in Ireland from the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish on that note.  It is very relevant with the hundreds of millions of pounds involved, that a building society such as the one I mentioned would not try to do something about the morale of their own staffs and the organisation of their own company. Staff relations, if Senator Ross does not know it, are an important subject.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled on it and I was about to mention the matter again.  The point is the extraordinarily high charges of building societies and the minimum wages they are paying to their staff &mdash; you have made the point, Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was making, on the one hand the 3 per cent rise in mortagages and, on the other hand, the fact that staff seem to be underpaid. Staff morale is low and they are unable to meet to discuss matters of mutual concern. Allied to that we have the growth in the branch network of the societies generally and the extent of advertising and colourful presentation these societies have.  I hope what I am talking about will be a warning not just to those involved in one society but to any other commercial or industrial concern who may think that is a suitable way of conducting their affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time there is a fair degree of difficulty facing those out of work.  They may find themselves having to accept jobs with terms of remuneration which are not necessarily in their best interests but with little option except a job in X company or Y company.  That is why I instanced this today.  It has a wider application and this House is interested in the wider good <Col N="617" /> of the people of Ireland.  I will have a few things to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make a very brief contribution to the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  Senator FitzGerald was very unfair to Senator Lanigan when he criticised his contribution.  It was wrong to say that Senator Lanigan was more favourably disposed towards the building society than the house builder; it was wrong to say that he had more sympathy for the director than the mortgagee. What Senator Lanigan said is exactly what I want to say and that is that I believe a major review is necessary in this area but not in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion as in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe &mdash; and many people are convinced &mdash; that this Bill was born out of confrontation.  The Minister has been projected in the role of a David fighting Goliath &mdash; the building societies.  An equally valid picture would project the building societies in the role of David fighting the State &mdash; the Goliath.  The reality of the situation is that the building society movement is at war with the Minister or, perhaps, the Minister is at war with the building societies.  But, in any event, this is a very bad situation for housebuilders and for the country.  I believe, as do many people, that legislation conceived from spite could not and will not make good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with some of the points raised by Senator FitzGerald.  I am glad we have such a high level of home ownership in this country.  We are all concerned that that would increase and to do everything in our power towards that end.  Senator FitzGerald has a point with regard to his criticism of the methods of valuation. On the standard form two valuations are given.  One is the replacement value which is relatively easy to estimate; it is simply the building costs with a special fee to cover professional fees, and then there is the valuation in other words, the price which would be realised when a house is sold.  This is a rather subjective thing and even a trained and qualified valuer might not necessarily get it right. <Col N="618" /> There are many factors involved to determine the price that will be paid for it.</P>
    <P>I would like with other members to pay tribute to the building societies.  They should be recognised for their tremendous contribution to housing since the formation of the societies in the early years of this State.  Senator FitzGerald has rightly pointed out the very high level of home ownership which was possible solely because of the building societies. It is fair to say that this Minister and previous Ministers have recommended thrift, they have encouraged young people to invest with the building societies. I hope that continues.  I have great sympathy with those paying high mortgage rates.  When considering the building societies and the borrowers our sympathy must always lean towards the borrower.</P>
    <P>I am grateful, too, for the changes the Minister has announced with regard to the new house grants.  With regard to the house improvement grant it was unfortunate that people who could not afford to employ a contractor were debarred from availing of grants if they used direct labour of their own hands.  To some extent the Minister has redressed that with regard to the new house grants.  The fact that this change was made so soon underlines how wrong the Minister was about making the change in that area.  I am not fully familiar with the changes.  I believe that direct labour is now allowed to a certain extent.  This will have a great effect on building and I welcome it.  I hope the Minister will introduce that in the home improvement grants in the near future as well.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government and not the building societies are responsible for high interest rates.  Societies must offer attractive rates to investors comparable with those which they could obtain elsewhere. High interest rates are a concern for us all, but employment and taxes are equally important.  Where two young people or maybe two not so young people are working there is great difficulty in repaying the mortgage.  If one of those people loses a job it is impossible to repay the mortgage.  That problem would not <Col N="619" /> be as acute if we had less unemployment and lower taxes.  The increase in rates is caused by Government policy.  The building societies are concerned by the whole marketplace approach generally.  Fianna Fáil helped with that mortgage subsidy in the past so that nobody with a mortgage would be penalised.  This was proper because the problem, to a large extent, is caused by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The building societies are concerned by the lack of investment and lack of confidence by investors.  Since the budget in January of this year £1.6 billion has left the country.  The DIRT tax is eating into the savings of people who would invest with building societies, even the modest saver.  There is a lack of goodwill and proper investment climate in Ireland. An atmosphere of good relationship with the Government is necessary and everything that can be done should be done to improve that and to arrive at a situation where profit is not a dirty word.  By and large the building societies work on very narrow profit margins.</P>
    <P>I agree with section 3 which deals with the power of the Minister to prescribe purposes for which loans may be made. As the building societies are in competition in the housing market with other lending agencies, it is only right that they should be allowed to enter into other areas.  In passing, I should like to pay tribute to the other agencies, including banks and firms, who help employees in that area.  Much more could be done in regard to employees getting help from their firms.  I also pay tribute to the credit union which has helped house builders.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with rules relating to appointment etc. of boards of directors. This is an area where very careful handling is necessary because past and present boards have served the building societies and the country very well, despite criticism which was not deserved in many cases.  They have built up an expertise which should not be despised.  It is very important to ask the Minister not to destabilise the situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the Building Societies Consultative Council.  If this <Col N="620" /> council is set up it would require exceptional care in selection of its membership to ensure that persons of competence and knowledge in this area are appointed to this proposed council.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with tiered interest rates.  The banks have tiered interest rates and the building societies, to be put on the same footing as the banks, also must have this facility.  People who invest with the banks get different interest rates according to the amount they invest &mdash; whether it is right or wrong is not for me to say, but that is the situation.  It should apply to the building societies as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome any benefits arising as a result of the Bill.  It is legislation in an area where a major review is necessary. I regret that this major review was not undertaken.  Like other Members of the House, I appreciate and pay tribute to the building societies' work.  When we go around the country and see the enormous housing schemes, we realise the contribution made by the building societies and those who have dedicated their lives in that area.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to deal with the sections in greater detail on Committee Stage.  With those reservations, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the thesis that the Bill has been introduced out of conditions of war or with the motivation of any spite by the Minister of the day.  It is legislation that has been described by the Minister as one of the early sections of a series of pieces of reforming legislation in the whole area of building society control which is agreed by most Members of the House to be long overdue.</P>

    <P>I have listened carefully to the many tributes being paid to the building societies. I, like many others, welcome the fact that houses have been able to be built and that people have provided themselves with shelter.  I might not agree that I have an unreserved admiration for the concept of home ownership and what it tells you of national character and previous speakers.  Be that as it may, the building societies have financed a great <Col N="621" /> deal of house and shelter provision in the concept of home ownership.  Perhaps the more useful figures that will emerge in the debate will be those outlining the position of the borrower in relation to the building societies, to which much of the Bill is addressed.</P>
    <P>Few people realise the high proportion of disposable income which the average mortgage represents.  I may be wrong, but speaking from memory I recall one set of figures that I saw some years ago which suggested that perhaps between 30 per cent and 35 per cent of one's net disposable income in any month goes in servicing a mortgage from a building society.  Obviously in this legislation it would not be relevant to go into the whole question as to why such a high level of mortgage is necessary to purchase shelter. It tells you a good deal about the society that you have to borrow so much to meet one of the basic needs in society. It is, however, directly relevant to the Bill to reflect on the atmosphere which prevailed when the original building society legislation was framed, when building societies formed themselves under legislation that is within the general rubric of friendly societies.  At that stage the emphasis was on the provision of shelter and making it possible for people to build houses.  All the recent discussion, however, has been about interest rates.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who welcomed many of the statements being made here by the Minister, limited as they are as he has correctly pointed out, to one phase of the problem of the reform of the building societies.  However, I want to add at the outset that the fact that an enormous amount of investment has been used in building houses reflects both the high cost of building land and the presence of the morality of speculation in relation to building land.  It is not acceptable in many civilised societies that the basic costs of building, including site cost, would be bid up to the way that they are.</P>
    <P>There is a heavy contrast between those early days of the building societies and what now prevails, where the major groups report profits in recent years far in excess of £25 million and figures quoted <Col N="622" /> for the current year are still quite high. A problem arises here in relation to what is happening.  Are building societies the same as any other borrower on the money market, the money market as referred to in the Minister's speech?  Alternatively, are building societies involved in investment the same as any other investor?  The suggestion made by the previous speaker &mdash; and also in other speeches &mdash; is based on what one might call the climatological view of economics which prevails in the country at the moment, that is that when the atmosphere is right people find money throbbing in their pockets and they rush to invest, but if the atmosphere goes wrong, their little pockets get cold and they cannot invest and so on.</P>
    <P>These kind of simplicities are of no value to us at all.  What is at stake in the Bill is interesting, that is it is pointed out that there will be a degree of control in relation to building societies.  I welcome this.  Also, there is another subterranean point in the Bill &mdash; and I do not think it is necessarily confrontational &mdash; that where self-regualtion is not possible, regulation by legislation is necessary.  It is far beyond time that many organisations and institutions, particularly those involved in credit provision, should be controlled to a far greater degree and be made far more accountable to the public, particularly those who have origins that are based on the provision of shelter and so forth.</P>
    <P>There are technical aspects of the legislation that are to be welcomed.  The Bill goes further along the ground towards having an integrated set of financial services. On purely practical grounds this is to be welcomed.  There are other important points in the Bill also.  The ones which have drawn the most criticism are those that refer to new rules for the building societies.  I doubt if there is anybody in the country who could justify some of the practices which have been referred to both in the Minister's speech and in the report of the interdepartmental committee. If you think again about it, you ask what kind of credit for what purpose should make it so heavily penalised to redeem one's loan &mdash; the loan having <Col N="623" /> been granted?  Surely that is unsustainable?</P>
    <P>Of course, here again people are betraying their own logic.  On the one hand the argument is that the building societies must be free to operate in the marketplace while on the other hand there is the view that once the loan has been given it cannot easily be redeemed, except by imposing some penalties.  That in itself is totally unsatisfactory.  I am worried, as I have said, that the provision of a roof over one's head &mdash; and Irish people have chosen to own it, rather than rent it &mdash; should occupy one-third of net income in any one month.  This tells one a good deal about the kind of society we have.  There should be greater control in this area.  When the Minister goes on to other pieces of legislation there is the case for beginning with colleagues in the Department of Finance and asking the Minister for Finance and those who work in that Department to think in terms of reforming the Central Bank Act to ensure a far better degree of control and accountability in relation to credit provision.</P>
    <P>In relation to the practices which have been referred to, the question of introducing a tiered rate of borrowing after giving an initial loan is hardly the logic even of the marketplace itself.  I notice that a great part of this Bill deals with a row that has emerged in relation to this between the Minister and the building societies.  The Minister should be supported in trying to bring about some kind of accountability in relation to practices that have been noted by the interdepartmental committee and about which many individual borrowers have complained.  As well as that there is a great deal of secrecy.  From the Minister's speech it would seem that this secrecy has been undone and the undoing of that secrecy should be welcomed, for example, the non-availability of valuation reports, the restricted nature of access to legal advice, the manner in which legal costs are calculated and so forth.</P>
    <P>If the building societies want to be in <Col N="624" /> the marketplace, these conditions should be removed.  I am not saying this because I believe that the marketplace should govern the supply of housing.  It is one of the great tragic comments on a society that people looking around the economy find that it is in this area where there is scarcely any risk at all involved that money might be invested.  It reminds me of the general banking system where high interest rates are accompanied by high demands for collateral, little risk-taking and a very short-term horizon.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the Minister's speech is that this will put the building societies into a stronger position in relation to competition once the single market has been introduced in 1992.  On this question there has not been sufficient though at all.  There is not great evidence, for example, of comparable performance between Irish credit provision and European credit provision.  Those who argue for the automatic advantages of this in relation to trade and services in the financial area are really straining the truth.  In relation to section 3 which mentions the making of regulations with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, this is bringing aspects of credit provision within the scrutiny of the public where it will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In both Houses we are elected to legislate in all areas and in relation to credit provision there is nothing mysterious about the marketplace for credit.  The building societies have enjoyed the protection of legislation passed by Parliament. Equally they must welcome it when amending legislation is introduced. In areas where there has been no voluntary response in reaction to publicly aired disquiet in relation to a whole series of practices, including rewards to directors, administrative costs, advertising, the question of duplication of services and so forth, both Houses of the Oireachtas have a responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite modest in its purposes. It is modest because it is part of a whole corpus of legislation of reform.  There is no point in being simple about it.  In <Col N="625" /> relation to the establishment of the consultative council, different expertise will be necessary but on the council there should be represented the voice of borrowers and the experience of borrowers. Borrowers put it in very plain terms when they speak about their difficulties in relation to the credit that a building society loan represents.  They speak about the hidden costs that they do not understand; they speak about the difficulties of ever reducing their total sum borrowed; they speak with wonderment about the total sum that will be repaid.  I often wonder, given the total volume of credit that is borrowed, what is the total risk that is involved.  I was in this House when the Family Home Protection Act 1976 came in.  At that time there was a lobby saying we were interfering with the collateral of the building societies and that we were interfering with their right to repossess a home.  On that occasion speakers from different sections of the House welcomed what we were doing because we were putting the social right to shelter before the unrestrained and unrestricted criterion of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reform of the inner practices of the building societies that this represents.  We will have an opportunity on another occasion to speak about the question of the role of the building societies and their general accountability to the financial supply and the role of the Central Bank in that provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not give the same welcome to this Bill as seems to be coming from the other side of the House.  I am greateful to Senator M. Higgins for the very calm and more ideological criticism of this Bill than the absurd criticisms I heard from Senator FitzGerald this evening. It is wrong that a Bill of this sort should be used by Senators to criticise irrelevant specific and very detailed matters that go on in a specific society.  These are undocumented and unsupported with particular evidence, and I do not think it right that a Bill like this should be used for that sort of purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a political undertone to this Bill which perhaps Members of the political <Col N="626" /> parties in this House are reluctant to talk about.  It is no secret that at least one society and maybe others of the big building societies, is identified positively with a political party.  It is no secret that the public perception of what is going on behind the Bill is partially a party political manoeuvre.  It should be said that the urgency with which this Bill is going through the Houses is suspicious.  Many people feel that this Bill is born out of a political initiative rather than any great concern for the future of the building societies or the future of borrowers.  Bad law emerges out of bitterness.  Bad law emerges out of conflict and the background to the Bill is undoubtedly a situation of confrontation between the Minister and his civil servants on the one hand and the building societies on the other.  Whereas there are good things in this Bill and there are worthy detailed ends to restrictive practices with which I would not quarrel, it seems a great pity that this Bill has been introduced piecemeal as what appears to many and appears to the building societies as a punitive measure for not yielding to the will of the Government on particular issues.</P>
    <P>This is a bad Bill because it is such a piecemeal Bill.  The Minister and the Government have missed a great opportunity in introducing the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill because in detail it is short, it is beneficial and it is right in many of its details, but it could have been a far larger Bill and it could have tackled far greater problems.  Whereas it does tackle those restrictive practices which many of us believe should be tackled, I wonder why the building societies have been singled out by the Government for an attack on restrictive practices because there are many other organisations who practise practices like this.  I can only say I think it was the result of a confrontation with the Minister which I regret.</P>
    <P>The missed opportunity is that the building societies are being treated in this Bill as though in some ways they were still the small societies they were when they originated.  It has to be recognised at this stage in 1986 that building societies <Col N="627" /> are massive significant financial institutions. They have grown into much larger institutions than anybody could possibly have imagined at the time they were set up and, in this time of financial deregulation, of greater financial competition in financial markets throughout the world, this Bill will be seen as a restricting law rather than a law which is in tone with the trend in financial markets throughout the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for agreeing to take this Adjournment matter.  The subject is the need for the Minister for the Environment to look again at the possibility of providing a link road or a slip road off the proposed by-pass of Claremorris town.  It is important <Col N="628" /> that we set the theme in context by pointing out that the town of Claremorris was established in the 13th century by the Prendergast family.  It is an old historic town that traditionally has derived the bulk of its economy from passing traffic. Generally, when it is proposed to provide a by-pass around any town there are initial anxieties, worries and hostilities and this was so in Claremorris.</P>
      <P>Claremorris is a town of 1,700 people. It is a natural crossroads and would be as near to being the ceart lár or the natural crossroads of Connacht as any other town.  It is approximately 40 miles from Sligo, 40 miles from Galway, 40 miles from Westport, 40 miles from Carrick-on-Shannon and so on.  Its strategic importance, therefore, has been cherished and is still cherished by the people of Claremorris today.  It is on the crossroads of two national primary roads, the N17 which is the direct north-south route and the N60 which is the east-west route. There was great jubilation in 1969 when the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kevin Boland, decided to divert the main north-south route through Claremorris, Knock, Ballindine and Mill-town because it was seen as providing a lifeline to the town.</P>
      <P>The people of Claremorris could justifiably point out that down through the years there has been a lot of investment by them in the town.  They can point to the statistic that approximately 520 people make their livelihood by providing services in the economy such as shops, offices, garages, restaurants, cafes, pubs, banks, hair salons, schools, post offices etc.  There has been great investment and modernisation by the people in what they regarded as the safe and sure knowledge that the passing traffic which was so much a part of their lifeline would be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parallel there has also been a commensurate degree of industrial activity, particularly the new industrial estate which provides up to 300 jobs and the traditional bacon factory in Claremorris. There is anxiety of late that, as a result of rationalisation plans for the bacon factory, jobs may and indeed will go at the <Col N="629" /> bacon factory.  It is also felt that if jobs in the industrial sector are of a fluctuating nature people should be able to rely on the service sector as they always have done.  There was a natural hostility as soon as the proposal was first mooted.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we have been doing our best to condition people to realise that by-passes are a fact of life. If we are to achieve a European standard for our roadworks, the minimum requirement is that a minimum speed limit from the North down to Rosslare and from east to west must be maintained and guaranteed and there must not be any impediments, obstacles, slow-downs and so on.  There has been a conditioning process which has been worthwhile because the vested interests such as chambers of commerce, trades groups and so on have seen that it is inevitable.</P>
    <P>An impression which surfaces time and time again in relation to our dialogue with the various vested interests, and which I would like the Minister to clarify for me, is that other by-passes for adjacent towns such as Collooney, Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Oranmore, Gort, Ennis, New-market-on-Fergus and Mullingar will be long fingered and that Claremorris is being asked to make the supreme sacrifice. I do not see the by-pass as a serious sacrifice.  It is very positive development but in Claremorris they would point to the fact that the average daily traffic for the town is 5,395; for Mullingar it is 14,064; for Ballinasloe it is 7,723; for Ennis it is 10,931.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that at the end of the day there will be an equalisation and that all of these towns, most of which have a heavier density of traffic, will also be by-passed in order to ensure that the minimum European standard is achieved.</P>
    <P>Down through the years there has been a lot of investment by the people of Claremorris but equally there has been a lot of investment by this Government and the real development in Claremorris did not begin until this Administration came into power in 1981.  Since that time we have seen a number of eyesores eliminated. On the junction of the N16-N17, what <Col N="630" /> was commonly known as Higgins corner, which was a black spot in the town, has been eliminated, thanks to money provided by this Administration.  On the Ballindine Road, which is part of the N17, there has been an investment from the Department of the Environment of approximately £400,000.  There has been £3 million worth of development on the N17, eliminating a tortuous stretch of snake-like road near Castlemagarret.</P>
    <P>Having listened for years to protestations from chambers of commerce that Claremorris was literally black in the middle, now for the first time we have top quality traffic route lighting through the town.  Other ancillary developments have been provided by this Administration, a new branch library, new schools and so on.  We are proud, as an Administration, of our investment in that town, but we would like to see hand in hand with the acceptance of a by-pass an integrated development plan for the town.  We hope the work started by this Administration will be carried on at such a pace that other concepts of development such as inner relief roads, necessary car parking, off-street car parking, bylaws, footpaths and so on will also be provided.  We are anxious that, in order to allay the fears of the people at local level and in order to meet their main reservation in relation to the by-pass, which is the deprivation to the business sector of the passing traffic, the Minister will consider the possibility of a slip road or a link road giving a more direct route for the by-pass from the N17 to the town. The design section of Mayo County Council examined the merits of the link or connecting road on the basis that the two junctions from the town onto the national primary road will be both at so low a level that it will not be possible to have visibility or a view of the town on arriving there.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was with this in mind that the design section of Mayo County Council forwarded to the Department of the Environment on 30 April 1986 a plan envisaging a new link road.  The Department replied on 4 July 1986 that the link road is not necessary as the existing N17 <Col N="631" /> will serve Claremorris town adequately from the by-pass.  I can appreciate the possibility of setting a precedent by doing this.  I also see the very definite chance of a breakthrough in relation to other proposed by-passes for the County Mayo road plan.  The amount of money involved is in the region of £300,000.  I am not sure what element of this would come from the European Regional Fund. The amount taken in the overall context of the spending on roads in the country, and, indeed in County Mayo, seems to be relatvely small.  The compensation is that it would immediately allay fears, anxieties, worries and hostilities locally.</P>
    <P>I accept, as I said at the outset, that by-passes are a fact of life and that Mayo County Council will be doing everything to ensure that there will be the greatest acceptance possible of the principle of by-passes.  I ask the Minister to have a fresh look at this proposal because in doing so he would be removing anxieties, he would be giving the instant go ahead for a by-pass for Claremorris town and in <Col N="632" /> the overall context would be ensuring that there would be greater spending in the area and a continuation of the spending we have seen during the past four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows, the provision of a slip road on the proposed Claremorris by-pass scheme is considered to be unnecessary and State grants will not be made available for it. Furthermore, as the preparation of the scheme itself for the by-pass involves land acquisition, it will almost certainly involve compulsory acquisition proceedings which would fall to be determined by the Minister for the Environment.  In view of my quasi judicial function in that matter I do not consider it appropriate to make any further comment.</P>
