      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the White Paper entitled &ldquo;Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations&rdquo;: proposals for regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper which this motion asks the Seanad to take note of contains the Government's proposals for the regulations on the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations which are to be made under section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
      <P>The debate here today is the first of two steps which will be required before the regulations are made.  Section 7 of the Act &mdash; as Senators may recall &mdash; differs from the usual procedure for the making of regulations by requiring a draft to be laid before, and to be approved by, each House of the Oireachtas before the regulations can be made.  I will, therefore, also be seeking the approval of the House to the text of the regulations once it has been finalised.  The debate in the Dáil demonstrated a wide measure of agreement in regard to what is being proposed. I would hope that these proposals will be broadly acceptable to this House also.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any great length on the detailed proposals which the White Paper contains.  They are, of their nature, largely self-explanatory. There are, however, some features of the proposals which I should like to mention briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations will be concerned with persons in custody in Garda stations and have no application to persons who may voluntarily attend a station to assist the Garda with their inquiries.  There has <Col N="1479" /> been some confusion regarding this point which may stem from the fact that the head note to regulation 16 refers to &ldquo;persons other than arrested persons&rdquo;.  The persons to whom that regulation applies &mdash; which the regulation itself makes clear &mdash; are persons who are in custody in a Garda station other than those who have been brought there under arrest or who have been arrested in the station.  These would include persons in transit from prisons to the courts or persons remanded into Garda custody by a court or peace commissioner.  It is with this category of prisoner that regulation 16 is concerned. As many of the provisions relating to arrested persons would not be relevant to such persons, that regulation makes the necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions dealing with arrested persons, I should, perhaps, also make it clear that these are not confined to persons detained under section 4 of the 1984 Act.  They will apply equally to persons detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and to persons arrested in the ordinary course but for whom detention under section 4 or section 30 would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the regulations will have no application to persons voluntarily attending at a station.  The enabling provision for the regulations &mdash; section 7(1) of the 1984 Act &mdash; provides specifically that the regulations will deal with persons in custody and any attempt to make provision for persons attending a station voluntarily would, therefore, be <i>ultra vires</i> that provision.  That is not to say that persons who attend a station on that basis should be treated any less favourably.  My intention is to ask the Garda Commissioner to ensure that persons attending a station voluntarily are treated with no less consideration than those who are there under arrest.</P>
    <P>Central to the scheme of the regulations and the safeguards they will provide are the provisions dealing with the member in charge and his responsibilities. The member in charge will usually be of sergeant rank and the regulations <Col N="1480" /> will ensure that he is readily identifiable by requiring a written record to be maintained in each station containing the name and rank of the member in charge at any given time.  He will be responsible for overseeing the application of the regulations in his station.  That responsibility will include such matters as ensuring that a person in custody is informed of his rights and arranging for a solicitor to be contacted or some other person to be notified where a person in custody has decided to exercise those entitlements. The member in charge also has the authority to make decisions in relation to many important matters during the course of a person's detention.  His authority is required before a young person can be interviewed in the absence of a parent or before a person can be questioned between midnight and 8 a.m., for example.</P>
    <P>The regulations will also, subject to some limited exceptions, require the member in charge to visit persons in custody in the station from time to time and to make any necessary inquiries to ensure that the regulations are being complied with.</P>
    <P>Finally, the member in charge will have overall responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the custody record.  The custody record itself is another important element in the scheme of the proposed regulations.  The information which must be recorded will provide a full and detailed account of any period during which a person is in custody in a Garda station.</P>
    <P>The final provisions of the proposals for the regulations which I should like to mention at this stage are those which deal with young persons and the mentally handicapped.  The provision for notifying a parent or guardian that a person under 17 years of age is in custody corresponds to the provisions of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  There is one important difference however.  The regulations will apply to all persons under 17 in custody following arrest, whereas section 5 applies only to those detained under section 4 of the new Act or section 30 of the Offences against the State Act. <Col N="1481" /> The regulations will provide, additionally, for a parent of a young person to be asked to attend at a station and will prohibit questioning of a young person in the absence of a parent or guardian except in certain limited circumstances. Where those circumstances exist and a person under 17 is to be interviewed in the absence of a parent or guardian, arrangements must be made for the attendance of some other adult relative or a responsible adult unless it is not practicable to do so.</P>
    <P>These provisions will also apply to any person in custody whom the member in charge suspects or knows to be mentally handicapped in addition to any other provisions which apply.  The question of making special provision in the regulations for the mentally handicapped was raised in this House in the course of the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill and I believe that the provisions which are proposed in this respect will find general acceptance.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the important features of the present proposals.  I should also mention the extent to which the proposals in the White Paper will implement the recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee report and the more recent report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism on safeguards for persons in custody and for members of the Garda Síochána.  Virtually all the recommendations relevant to the present proposals in both these reports will be given effect in the new regulations although there are, of course, some differences of detail between particular recommendations and the provisions in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Two of the Ó Briain recommendations relevant to the new regulations are not being implemented.  These are that where a person in custody has asked for the attendance of a solicitor, a reasonable time &mdash; which would be between one and two hours in most cases &mdash; should be allowed for the solicitor's attendance before questioning could commence.  The second recommendation not being implemented is that a solicitor should be entitled, as of right, to attend any questioning <Col N="1482" /> of his client as an observer.  The Government are not inclined to accept either of these recommendations for a number of reasons.  There would be practical difficulties involved which will be obvious when it is borne in mind that the recommendations were made in a context where detention for questioning was statutorily permitted only by section 30 of the Offences against the State Act. Under that provision a person may be detained for an initial period of up to 24 hours, whereas under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, the initial detention period permitted is only up to six hours.</P>
    <P>Further to require a reasonable period for the arrival of a solicitor before questioning could commence could throw doubt on admissions volunteered by a person to the Garda during that period. Such a requirement would also fail to take into account circumstances where questioning might be urgently necessary &mdash; where a person's life was endangered for example.</P>
    <P>What the regulations propose in this regard is that the Garda should not be required to delay questioning but rather that a reasonable time for the attendance of a solicitor should be allowed before a person in custody is asked to give a written statement.  This is in accordance with the approach decided on by the Government in office at the time the Ó Briain report was published and corresponds to existing Garda practice.</P>
    <P>The second of the Ó Briain recommendations not being incorporated in the proposed regulations is, as I have mentioned, that a solicitor should be allowed to attend any questioning of a person in custody as an observer.  The Government believe that such a provision is unnecessary. It can only have been intended, in the context of the committee's report, to provide a guarantee against improper questioning or false allegations against the Garda arising from an interview.  The regulations already provide a number of safeguards against such abuses.  In addition, arising from the preparation of the then Criminal Justice Bill, the Government decided that electronic recording of <Col N="1483" /> questioning of suspects should be introduced and section 27 of the Act makes provision for it.  Preparations are being made for field trials in electronic recording which will get under way shortly after the powers of detention under section 4 are brought into force.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, there are only two recommendations for which specific provision is not made in the proposals.  These are that the custodial guardian should certify that the detained person has been treated properly and in accordance with the regulations and that each person, provided there is no risk, should be allowed to retain his or her watch.  The second of these recommendations is unnecessary because the person would be entitled to retain his or her watch in those circumstances under existing law provided, of course, the watch itself was not required as evidence of some offence.</P>
    <P>Requiring the member in charge to certify that the detained person was treated properly is not a practical proposition. The member who acts as member in charge can change over a period of detention: in the case of a person detained for the maximum period under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act &mdash; 20 hours &mdash; there would be at least three different members in charge over that period.  In the case of a person detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, the possibility is that even more members would have acted as members in charge.  Even if each of those members were to certify the proper treatment of the person for the period in respect of which he or she acted as member in charge, such a certificate would be of little value in the event of a dispute.  In those circumstances the member or members in charge would have to give evidence of the matters in question.</P>
    <P>More significant, perhaps, than these limited exceptions are the respects in which the proposals in the White Paper go further than the recommendations contained in both these reports.  The <Col N="1484" /> select committee, for example, recommended that the safeguards which they proposed should apply &mdash; initially at least &mdash; only to persons detained under section 4 of the 1984 Act, whereas the regulations will, as I have indicated, apply to all persons in custody.  The regulations will also deal with a large number of matters which were not the subject of recommendations in either the Ó Briain or the select committee's reports.  These would include the special provisions which are being made for persons under 17 and the mentally handicapped as well as the provisions dealing with searches, the taking of fingerprints, foreign nationals and so on.</P>
    <P>These regulations are not unrelated to other measures which are at present or already have been before this House.  The House will be aware that &mdash; by virtue of section 1 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act &mdash; the detention and related provisions of that Act may not be brought into force until these regulations have been made, the Garda Complaints Bill enacted and the board it proposes to create established and operational.  Together these measures represent a very significant and far-reaching reform.  The Criminal Justice Act itself has been described as one of the most significant reforming measures in the field of criminal law and procedure since the foundation of the State.  These regulations will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive statutory code of conduct for the treatment of persons in Garda custody.  Finally, the Complaints Bill will provide a completely new framework incorporating an independent body for dealing with complaints against the Garda.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the proposals.  As I said at the beginning, our debate today is the first step which is necessary before these regulations can be made, and draft regulations will be laid before the House in due course for its approval as required by section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all recall the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill and the fact that we were very concerned <Col N="1485" /> about certain aspects of the Act, particularly in relation to detention.  It was at that time finally agreed under section 1 (2) of the Act that the detention-related provisions of the Act would not be brought into force until these regulations had been made and the Garda Complaints Bill had been enacted.  The undertaking by the Minister to introduce these regulations and to pass the Complaints Bill did ease the minds of people who were very concerned about some of the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>Looking at these proposals today, I have to say that they are a reasonable attempt to meet the wishes of the Members of the Oireachtas who discussed this matter at the time of the Criminal Justice Act.  Although there are aspects of these regulations or proposals which we might not be entirely in favour of, nevertheless, they do go a long way to meet our requirements.</P>
      <P>It is rather difficult to discuss these proposals by way of making a speech.  It would have been preferable if we could have gone through them regulation by regulation or proposal by proposal.  I hope that when they come back to us again in a few days time we will be able to look at them in that way because they are not really a matter for making a speech about the principles involved.  The principles have been accepted and have, by and large, been implemented in these proposals.  It is the details that we would like to discuss.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on certain aspects of these proposals.  My contribution may be a little patchy because I will have to go through them and refer to certain points in the proposals which are of importance.  First, the concept of a member in charge is important.  It is very important that there is somebody whose concern will be to ensure that people in detention are properly looked after, that their rights are respected and that they have somebody to refer to if they feel they are being victimised or treated in an unfair way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duties of the member in charge are set out in a number of places in these proposals.  They are, by and large, very <Col N="1486" /> useful and comprehensive.  What has not been done &mdash; in a way that goes to the heart of the whole matter &mdash; is that the arrested person or the person who is in custody other than by being arrested is not told that the member in charge is the person to whom he should refer if he has a problem or if he feels that he is not being properly treated.  The duties of the member in charge are set out very fully. If he is a conscientious person he will pick up any problems that will arise, he will become aware of any unfair treatment of the person in custody.  But it is most unlikely that the person in custody &mdash; coming in off the street &mdash; will be aware of these proposals which will ultimately become regulations.  He probably will not even know that there is a person called the member in charge.  He will not know if he feels he is being treated unfairly that he is the man he should send for and ask for protection.  This is a gap in these proposals.  The duties of the member in charge are set out very fully but nowhere does it say that the person in custody shall be told that there is a person called a member in charge to whom he should refer if he feels that he is being treated in a way that he regards as being harsh or in some way unfair.</P>
    <P>Regulation No. 9 subsection 2 refers to the fact that:</P>
    <P>The member in charge shall without delay give the person, or cause him to be given, a notice containing the information set out in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph (1) and such other information as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, may from time to time direct.</P>
    <P>The information which shall be given to the arrested person is, first of all, to inform him in ordinary language of the offence in respect of which he has been arrested; second, that he is entitled to consult a solicitor and that he is entitled to have notification of his whereabouts sent to another person recently named by him or, in the case of a person under the age of 17 years, that a parent or guardian or, if he is married, his spouse is being <Col N="1487" /> given the information required.  Subsection 2 says &ldquo;and such other information as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister of Justice, may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  That notice should include the fact that there is a person called the member in charge and that is the person to whom reference should be made if the arrested person has any complaint to make.  There is a small point under subsection (3): &ldquo;Paragraphs 1 and 2 apply only in relation to the member in charge of the station to which an arrested person is taken on arrest or in which he is arrested.&rdquo; It seems that there is no provision made, not clearly anyhow, if he is arrested in one spot but immediately moved on to somewhere else.  It is not quite clear who is responsible in that case for giving the notice with the information in question.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>Where a person has been transferred to another station or where it is proposed so to transfer him, any person who has been notified or informed under this regulation shall be informed or caused to be informed as soon as is practicable by the member in charge of the transfer or proposed transfer.</P>
    <P>Again, I am not clear as to the situation if the transfer takes place very quickly and nobody has been notified or informed under these regulations where he is in the first place what the responsibility is or what the procedure is when he reaches the station to which he is transferred.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph 11, subsection (3):</P>
    <P>The arrested person may receive a visit from a relative, friend or other person with an interest in his welfare provided that he so wishes and the member in charge is satisfied that the visit can be adequately supervised and that it will not hinder or delay the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>In some cases it is necessary for the member in charge giving authority for certain things to say why he is doing it. As far as I can see, in this case there is no onus on the member in charge to <Col N="1488" /> justify the fact that he is refusing to allow the visit but it may be in the small print and I have not noticed it.  There is the question of interviews, paragraph 12, subsection (3):</P>
    <P>Before the commencement of an interview, the member conducting it shall identify himself and any other member present by name and rank to the person being interviewed.  Not more than two members shall question the person at any one time and not more than four members shall be present at any one time during the interview.</P>
    <P>This is a very good and detailed provision. For the man coming in off the street it is a million to one that he knows of this regulation, that he should be counting the people present, that if a third person starts to question him that person is doing something which is contrary to the regulations, or if more than four people are present at any time during the interview it is a breach of regulations. This is something that in principle is very good but who is going to know that this regulation exists?  Even if a person did by some chance know, he would not be aware that he should send for the member in charge and say that this is contrary to regulation 12, subsection (3).  It is most unlikely that in practice this will be the position.  It is not much good having regulations, no matter how carefully they are drafted, if there is not a reasonable chance that the person arrested is aware of them and knows what to do to ensure that they are observed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of that regulation states:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be interviewed for continuous periods of more than four hours without a reasonable interval between the periods.</P>
    <P>I suggest that four hours is much too much.  Four hours may sound like a relatively short period if watching a television show or something of that nature, but under intensive questioning four hours is a very long time.</P>
    <P>For example, the normal sitting of a <Col N="1489" /> court is two hours with an interval and then another two hours.  The reason for that is that intensive examination and cross-examination of witnesses is a very trying ordeal.  One needs to be able to concentrate and to be at the top of one's form to continue for more than two hours.  The two hour period has been regarded for centuries as the maximum. For a person who has been arrested and whose future is very much in the balance, to be cross-examined intensively by two people for four hours is too much.  I urge the Minister very strongly to say that the maximum period for questioning without a reasonable interval shall be two hours.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph 12, subsection (8):</P>
    <P>A person who is under the influence of drink or drugs to the extent that he is unable to appreciate the significance of questions put to him or his answers shall not be interviewed in that condition except with the authority of the member in charge, which authority shall not be given unless the member has reasonable grounds for believing that to delay interviewing him would involve a risk of injury to persons, serious loss of or damage to property, destruction of or interference with evidence or escape of accomplices.</P>
    <P>I think a case could be made for saying that the interview should take place if there are very serious grounds.  An argument can be made for it.  There are other implications here which are very serious. If a person is under the influence of drink to the extent that he is unable to appreciate the significance of questions put to him or his answers, he may be in a position where he will incriminate himself.  If he does that in such a situation then it is quite contrary to the basis of law.  Very serious exception could be taken to this proposal.  If this question of incrimination can be avoided, what is the purpose of this questioning of somebody who is under the influence of drink or drugs to that extent?  Can this statement be used if it is acknowledged that he is so affected by drink or drugs that he does not appreciate the significance of the questions or the answers?  What purpose is <Col N="1490" /> served by this?  What use could be made of answers given in these circumstances?</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister elaborating on the justification for this subparagraph and dealing with the question of incrimination.  For example, in the case of a kidnapping, a person under the influence may say that the kidnapped person is at a particular house.  That would be extremely important information which could result in the person being rescued, if such answers were to be used for some purpose other than to secure the rescue of a kidnapped person or recovery of stolen money, or something of that kind, they would have to be dealt with very circumspectly.  The same applies to paragraph 13 which provides that arrested persons under 17 years may not be questioned unless a parent or guardian is present.  Nevertheless, it says that the member in charge has reasonable grounds for believing that to delay questioning the person would involve a risk of injury to persons or serious loss of or damage to property, destruction of or interference with the evidence or escape of accomplices, questioning may be authorised.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to put the same questions in relation to this.  The regulations or proposals go a long way to ensure that persons under 17 years are dealt with properly and that they cannot be, generally speaking, questioned unless their guardian or parent is present but nevertheless in special circumstances these protections are removed.  I wonder what was in the mind of the Minister or the person who drew up these proposals in relation to the information given in circumstances where the safeguards have been removed.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 14 dealing with foreign nationals there is a very small point in relation to subparagraph 4(b) which provides that if the foreign national is a political refugee or seeks political asylum, a consular officer shall not be notified of his arrest or given access to or information about him except at his expressed request.  I think that &ldquo;his&rdquo; could be ambiguous.  It is not quite clear whether it is the political refugee or the consular <Col N="1491" /> officer who is referred to in that case. Almost certainly it is the refugee but it might be read the other way.</P>
    <P>If you refer to paragraph 20 it says that no member shall subject a person in custody to ill treatment of any kind or the threat of violence whether against the person himself, his family or any other person connected with him or permit any other person to do so.  Again, I get back to my objection or my query as to the necessity for the arrested person to be aware of his rights.  In any situation where an arrested person or person in custody is being treated unfairly or ill treated or anything of that kind all the precautions and protections provided in these proposals are really almost worthless unless he is aware that he should be immediately calling saying that he wants to see Sergeant McGilligan or whoever the person is.  He should know exactly whom he should be relying on in a situation such as this.</P>
    <P>I think these are really the points I wanted to make about these proposals. They will be coming back to us, I understand, in a few days time.  It is unlikely there will be any big changes in between the proposals and the regulations.  I would like to think that the discussion in the Seanad would result in some points being taken but in any event if they are not taken between now and the time the regulations come before us we will be able to raise them again.  In general terms I think this is a reasonable effort to meet the points made during the discussion of the Criminal Justice Act and it also seems to go a long way to meeting the provisions of the Ó Briain Committee and the Oireachtas committee dealing with detention. So for the moment I think I can only say that this is a reasonable effort to meet the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the initial point made by Senator Ryan that this is a difficult debate in that we are making what is in essence a Second Stage speech in relation to detailed regulations.  We are making a Second Stage speech in relation to what appears to be an ordinary <Col N="1492" /> motion on the Order Paper but in fact when one examines the White Paper one observes that it contains merely the draft regulations.  It is unsatisfactory in that sense that one does not have available within the Standing Orders of this House a facility to have, as it were, a Committee Stage type debate when considering a motion of this nature which is a motion to consider draft regulations.  For that reason I hope the Minister will respond in some detail to the points raised in relation to specific regulations.</P>
      <P>A little over two and a half years ago we were debating the Criminal Justice legislation in this House but it was also being debated in the country at large.  The principal opposition to the basic principle underlying that Bill related to the fact that the Bill conferred too much power on the Garda in relation to persons suspected of crime.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 gave the Garda powers of pre-charge detention in section 4 and also other additional powers in section 6 in relation to detained persons, powers in relation to the demanding of names and addresses, powers in relation to searching, photographing, finger-printing and the carrying out of various types of tests. The allegation was made that these powers were themselves draconian.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is true to say that allegations and suggestions of that nature are understandable in the light of the recent background of allegations that have been made against the Garda.  In the late seventies a considerable number of allegations were made to the effect that members of the Garda in various specific instances had abused persons in custody. Those allegations were refuted but they led to the establishment in the late seventies of the Ó Briain Committee and although that committee were primarily concerned with dealing with the safeguards which should be provided in the case of gardaí dealing with persons in custody it nevertheless addressed itself also to some of the allegations which had been made in relation to alleged abuses of Garda power in the years prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the startling facts that emerged from the submissions to the Ó Briain <Col N="1493" /> Committee was the fact that 80 per cent of convictions obtained in crimes of a serious nature were obtained primarily as a result of confessions made by persons in Garda custody.  That fact alone aroused many fears and perhaps many of these fears are and were justifiable.  The essential point and the point that was made when we considered the Criminal Justice Act in this House and more recently when we considered the Second Stage of the Garda Complaints Bill was that the balance has to be got right, as it were, as between the rights which members of the Garda should have on the one hand and on the other hand ensuring that the constitutional right which a citizen has of his or her liberty should be protected.  We really have to address ourselves, in considering these regulations, to whether within these regulations and bearing in mind the contents of the Criminal Justice Act, and the contents of the Garda Complaints Bill, the overall package gets that balance right.  I believe that one can truly say that in essence the balance is reasonably correct.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are debating these regulations at a time when we are also debating the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill.  It is appropriate that both measures should come before the House at the same time.  It gives us the opportunity of looking, as it were, at both aspects of one side of the scale, the other side being the powers conferred by the Criminal Justice Act of 1984.</P>
    <P>It is true to say at the outset that one should not over-estimate these regulations because these are regulations made under section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  That is a limiting section in the sense that it provides first, that the Minister shall have power to make regulations, second, that the regulations shall include provision for the casting, as it were, of the member in charge.  Most importantly, the section provides that a failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person <Col N="1494" /> or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of that section does also say that a failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to disciplinary proceedings. Whereas section 7, which is the enabling section for these regulations, is limiting, it gets the balance right in the sense that no member can be put in double jeopardy.  On the other hand, the question should be raised at this stage whether, bearing in mind the contents of the Fourth Schedule of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, a complaint can be made under that legislation against a member of the Garda Síochána who acts in breach of these regulations.  It can perhaps be suggested that article 4 of the Fourth Schedule of the Complaints Bill does give that power, but I would like the Minister at the outset to spell out whether the citizen can make a complaint under the Complaints Bill in relation to a breach of these regulations by a member. That is something we should address ourselves to more appropriately on the Complaints Bill but I believe that it should be specifically included in the Fourth Schedule of the Complaints Bill that a member of the public or a concerned person has a right to make a complaint through the complaints procedure established under that legislation in relation to any breach of the regulations specified in the White Paper.  I would be concerned if it should emerge that breaches of these regulations which will not render a member of the Garda liable to criminal or civil proceedings should also be such that a member of the public cannot make a complaint under the complaints procedure and that the only remedy available to a member of the public would be to make a complaint to the Garda under the Garda Síochána internal disciplinary regulations &mdash; that is the regulations which will replace the 1971 regulations.  I would like clarification from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>Coming to the draft regulations, I welcome particularly regulations 3, 12 and 20.  These are the regulations which state <Col N="1495" /> the broad principle of what the Government are attempting to do.  It may be no harm to read into the record regulation 3 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>In carrying out their functions under these regulations members of the Garda Síochána shall at all times act with integrity and with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody (particularly any of them who may be under a physical or mental disability) and their dignity as human persons while complying with the obligation to prevent escapes from custody and continuing to act with diligence and determination in the investigations of crime and the protection and vindication of the personal rights of other persons.</P>
    <P>That sets out clearly the broad principle of what we, in this House, spoke about when considering the Second Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the broad statement in regulation 12 (1) and (2) which is along the same lines.  Regulation 12 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Interviews with an arrested person should be conducted in a fair and humane manner.</P>
    <P>Regulation 20 (1) which is a further statement of the principle contained in regulation 3 states:</P>
    <P>No member shall subject a person in custody to ill-treatment of any kind or the threat of violence (whether against the person himself, his family or any other person connected with him) or permit any other person to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome these very definite statements in these three regulations of what the approach of the Garda should be to persons who have been detained by them, to persons who are in their custody and to persons to whom in a sense they have a certain obligation.</P>
    <P>Having said that I think that the point made by Senator Ryan in relation to regulation 4 is a very valid point.  That point is that whereas we in this House <Col N="1496" /> know that we will shortly have regulations under section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act and the Garda know they will shortly be subject to regulations under this Act &mdash; albeit regulations which are limited by virtue of the very nature of section 7 &mdash; and whereas a limited group of people in the country will be aware of these regulations, it is probably true to say that the criminal population or persons who are suspected of being members of the criminal population or persons who may be detained under the Criminal Justice Act may not be aware of these regulations.  It is quite possible that somebody may be detained in a Garda station and may not be aware of his rights under these regulations.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that a person shall, under regulation 9, be given certain information.  That regulation is welcome &mdash; the fact that a detained person should be told in ordinary language of the offence in respect of which he has been arrested; that a detained person should be told that he is entitled to consult a solicitor, and that a detained person is entitled to have notification of his whereabouts sent to another person named by him.  These are reasonable provisions and are welcome.  These provisions do not get over what I see as the lacuna pointed out by Senator Ryan in regulation 4, that is, that the detained person himself or herself may not be aware that there is a person called &ldquo;the member in charge&rdquo;. The detained person in a time of trauma, difficulty and weakness by virtue of his surroundings and situation, should be made aware that there is a member in charge.  I would ask the Minister to take on board the worries and concerns that have been expressed in that regard. These are draft regulations but I would hope that by the time these regulations come back to this House in a final form they will include a provision, perhaps inserted in regulation 9, to the effect that the detained person shall also be advised first, of the existence of and, second, the duties of the member in charge.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with the concept of the member in charge as defined in the regulations.  I am not happy that the <Col N="1497" /> member in charge may be any member.  I accept that there may be difficulties in different Garda stations.  I accept that the size, location and the physical surroundings of Garda stations may create their own difficulties.  I believe that regulation 4 gives a very wide power to the superintendent in charge of a district to determine who may or may not be a member in charge.  Second, it also envisages a situation in which the member in charge could be a very young and inexperienced member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I make that point because the Minister, in her opening speech, said that the member in charge will usually be of sergeant rank.  While I accept that there is underlying these regulations the concept of a holding station &mdash; the concept of a type of Bridewell &mdash; the facts of the matter are that there are many things which happen in the place to which the person is initially brought.  The member in charge there may be a very young and inexperienced member.  It is something which should be addressed before these regulations reach final form.  I have to admit that I can see certain practical difficulties. There are many stations where there are no members other than very young members.  Some of the duties and functions which devolve upon the member in charge are duties and functions which in many cases can only be properly exercised by a person of maturity and experience.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point before the completion of these regulations.  Hopefully, something more satisfactory may emerge.</P>
    <P>I am also unhappy with the very wide power which the member in charge has to delegate or transfer his duties to another person.  That power is conferred by regulation 5 subsection 4 (a) which reads:</P>
    <P>Where, by reason of the number of persons in custody or other exceptional circumstances, the member in charge is unable to carry out adequately the duty imposed on him by paragraph (i) in relation to visiting persons in custody and making any necessary inquiries, <Col N="1498" /> he may authorise in writing another member to carry out that duty.</P>
    <P>That means that any member who is in charge, who may be a very young and immature member &mdash; I mean that in a professional sense &mdash; and who may be a very inexperienced member, may for what he deems exceptional circumstances delegate his power to somebody else.  I am unhappy with that bearing in mind the fact that the appointment of a member in charge, which is provided for in regulation 4 (2), is a power that lies with the superintendent in charge of a district. Yet, in exceptional circumstances, which may be determined by a very young, immature and inexperienced member of the Garda, that appointment made by a superintendent in charge of a district can be devolved upon another member.  For that reason I am not happy with regulation 5 (4) (a).  If there is to be a transfer of power the transfer or delegation should be effected by somebody of higher rank, of greater experience and, certainly, of greater professional maturity.</P>
    <P>Regulation 6 deals with the custody record.  I welcome this regulation.  It is essential, if these regulations are to operate properly, that there should be such a concept as a custody record.  I note that the custody record is, in effect, to follow the detained person.  In the preparation of documentation which will be used for the keeping of a custody record, could provision not be made for the keeping of a copy also in the station or place where the person was first detained?  Where a person is detained under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act a record of that detention and of what happens should be kept at every place of detainment. There should also be a provision for the record to follow the detained person.</P>
    <P>I welcome regulation 9 which provides that certain information should be given to the arrested person.  It is wise that this regulation should provide as it does. Regulation 12 deals with the interviewing of an arrested person.  I have already referred to regulation 12 (1).</P>
    <P>I also take up the point which Senator <Col N="1499" /> E. Ryan mentioned in relation to regulation 12 (4) which provides that a person shall not be interviewed for continuous periods of more than four hours without a reasonable interval between the periods. Four hours is an excessive period.  Four hours may seem to be a short period in normal circumstances but we are talking about situations where normal circumstances do not apply.  When somebody is arrested and brought to a Garda barracks, normal circumstances do not apply.  Abnormal circumstances apply. Most people would find the experience extremely stressful, worrying and unusual.  Bearing in mind the unusualness of the situation the four hour period is unreasonable and could lead to consequences which were not envisaged when we spoke about these regulations in the course of the debate on the Criminal Justice Act and when certain commitments were given by the then Minister in relation to these regulations.  I would ask the Minister to reduce that period.  Two hours has been suggested and that would not be an unreasonable period.  I would regard it as being a maximum period.  It is amazing the amount of interviewing that can be carried out in a two hour period.  It is also amazing the amount of information and assistance that a person being interviewed can give an interviewing member in that period of time.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular regulation 13 which deals with the specific situation where a person under the age of 17 years is being interviewed.  The balance here is more than right and the provisions are good.  Finally, I want to refer to reguation 15 which deals with charges.  Regulation 15 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a person in custody is charged with an offence, a copy of the charge sheet containing particulars of the offence shall be given to him as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>I do not like the words &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. These are words which appear very frequently in the Road Traffic Act, 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, and they are words which have given rise to certain difficulties.  They are words which have allowed members who operate the provisions of that Act to effect certain abuses, albeit perhaps innocently but, nevertheless, abuses are effected by virtue of the existence of these words.  I prefer the words which are used in regulation 9 which deals with information to be given to an arrested person.  Regulation 9 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>The member in charge shall without delay inform an arrested person or cause him to be informed &mdash;</P>
      <P>I would prefer if regulation 15 (1) were to read: &ldquo;Where a person in custody is charged with an offence a copy of the charge sheet containing particulars of the offence shall be given to him without delay&rdquo;.  That would put a greater onus on the members of the Garda and, indeed, would secure the balance in a way that is overall more reasonable.</P>
      <P>They are my comments on the White Paper entitled Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations.  I hope that the Minister will take on board some of the specific matters that have been mentioned.  I look forward to his response at the end of this debate in relation to these matters.  Overall, the White Paper, with the exception of the matters which I have mentioned, gets the balance right. That is what we are talking about &mdash; getting the balance right as between the rights of the citizens on the one hand and the duties of the Garda on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to this motion on the White Paper.  As the Minister has stated, these regulations provide for the first time a comprehensive statutory code of conduct for the treatment of persons in Garda custody.  They are very comprehensive, and are very welcome.  Also, in a sense they afford protection to the Garda where complaints might be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, as a young boy, reading <Col N="1501" /> about the exploits of the legendary Sherlock Holmes.  It seems that that role appeals to every young person, but it might not have the same appeal if all these bureaucratic conditions applied, as they must at the present time.  As Senator Durcan has said, the Garda have a very difficult role.  On the one hand we must be concerned with not restraining them in that role and making it more difficult than is necessary.  It is very important that we should be concerned about the treatment of people in custody.  It is not easy to get that balance.  Any of us who saw the recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme with regard to the Garda, realise that by and large, very little of their time is spent on actual police work. Much of the work they have to do could be done by people outside the force. Much of their time is spent on patrol work.  People who criticise the Garda might take into consideration that they get little time to do the work for which they are best equipped.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan raised a point with regard to the terminology in the White Paper, for example, &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;, &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; period, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;within a reasonable time&rdquo;.  In a sense these are very indefinite.  Different interpretations by different people could result.  A time limit with regard to hours could be added.  This might help with regard to a dispute about a definition in this regard.  These phrases appear almost on every page.  I am not saying this in a critical sense.  I know it would be very difficult in all cases to put a time constraint but, nevertheless, in many respects it is open ended.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer very briefly to a few points from some of the paragraphs. Paragraph 2 states:</P>
    <P>If and for so long as the member in charge of a station in which a person is in custody has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is not below the age of seventeen years, the provisions of these regulations shall apply as if he has attained that age.</P>
    <P>In many cases there would be great difficulty in this regard.  For about two years <Col N="1502" /> on either side of 17 years it would not be easy for a garda to decide with reasonable confidence that a person was not below the age of 17 years.  I would be concerned about what would be &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;.  Otherwise the balance is not in favour of the person in custody in this section.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 states:</P>
    <P>In carrying out their functions under these regulations members of the Garda Síochána shall at all times act with integrity and with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody (particularly any of them who may be under a physical or mental disability) and their dignity as human persons while complying with the obligation to prevent escapes from custody and continuing to act with diligence and determination in the investigation of crime and the protection and vindication of the personal rights of other presons.</P>
    <P>The Garda have a very tough role to play. On many occasions they come up against desperate individuals.  This tough aspect should be taken into consideration when recruiting gardaí.  The garda also has his profession to look after.  A recruit who could be termed &ldquo;soft&rdquo; would not be suitable.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 deals with the member in charge.  This was raised by other Senators. Could a member in charge leave the station without appointing another member in charge?  This would have serious implications, not alone in terms of paragraph 4 but of paragraph 9 (3).  I am not clear as to whether a member in charge could leave the station at any time.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (3) states:</P>
    <P>As far as practicable the member in charge shall not be a member who is involved in the arrest of any person for the offence in respect of which he is in custody or in the investigation of that offence.</P>
    <P>It was a mistake to close down small Garda stations.  These regulations do not favour the small station.  It would not <Col N="1503" /> be possible to implement this subsection where the small station is concerned.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 deals with the duties of the member in charge.  It states:</P>
    <P>The member in charge of a station shall be responsible for overseeing the application of these regulations in relation to persons in custody in the station and for this purpose shall visit them from time to time and make any necessary inquiries.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (2) qualifies that to some extent:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1) is without prejudice to the responsibilities...of other members.</P>
    <P>From &ldquo;time to time&rdquo; is a vague way of dealing with this responsibility.  A specified time limit might be helpful as is the case in a later paragraph when dealing with persons under the influence of alcohol and where time limits of half an hour and quarter of an hour are specified.  Subparagraph (3) states:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the member in charge that a direction given or action taken by a member of high rank is inconsistent with the proper application of these regulations, he shall inform that member accordingly and, unless the matter is resolved, report it without delay to another member of or above the rank of superintendent.</P>
    <P>There is a time factor here.  In most cases there is the pressure of time.  In most circumstances it might not be possible to comply with this time factor.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (4) (a) gives authority to the member in charge to authorise another member to carry out the duty for him.  &ldquo;Authorise&rdquo; may very well be the proper verb to use, but something stronger would be necessary.  To &ldquo;authorise&rdquo; does not seem to pose any obligation on the other member, whereas an order would.  This might be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Regarding subparagraph (3) of paragraph 6, where a person in custody is <Col N="1504" /> transferred to another station, the member in charge shall send with him the custody record relating to him or a copy of it to the member in charge of that station.  A copy would be more appropriate. It would seem to me that it would be proper to keep the custody record in the station.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 deals with the record of arrest and detention.  Subparagraph (a) states that:</P>
    <P>...a record shall be made of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the date, time and place of arrest and the identity of the arresting member (or other person),</P>
    <P>That would seem to imply that an arrest could be made by other than a member of the Garda Síochána.  This may very well be right.  I wonder if that is what is intended.  It seems to me that the arrest would be by a member of that body and that should be stated in that subparagraph.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8 deals with inquiries and reads:</P>
    <P>Information as to the whereabouts of an arrested person shall be given&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) if the arrested person consents and the member in charge is satisfied that giving the information will not hinder or delay the investigation of crime, in response to an enquiry by any other person.</P>
    <P>Again, this qualification that &ldquo;where the member in charge is satisfied&rdquo; seems a weakness.  We could hardly blame members in doing their duty if they were overcautious.  This qualification seems to me to encourage a member to be overcautious.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (3) relates to notification with regard to where a person resides. It would also seem to me that there could be a difficulty in some cases in determining where somebody actually resides.  This is an area which gives discretion to the Garda.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 deals with information to be given to an arrested person.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1) concludes:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> The information shall be given orally.  The member in charge shall also explain or cause to be explained to the person that, if he does not wish to exercise a right under subparagraph (b) or (c) (i) immediately, this will not preclude him from doing so later.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if, in that situation, there is a time factor.  For example, if somebody did not exercise that right but changed his mind after half an hour or an hour, would that facility be extended to him then?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 deals with visits and communications.</P>
    <P>A consultation with a solicitor may take place in the sight but out of the hearing of a member.</P>
    <P>It would be more satisfactory, where consultations take place, that they would take place with the member out of sight as well as out of hearing.  I am not sure if that is a very important point, but I believe that would be more satisfactory. The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>The arrested person may receive a visit from a relative, friend or other person with an interest in his welfare provided that he so wishes and the member in charge is satisfied that the visit can be adequately supervised and that it will not hinder or delay the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>Again, this gives this qualification and the matter of interpretation.  I am sure that in many instances there will be dispute about this interpretation.  Subparagraph 4 (a) reads:</P>
    <P>The arrested person may make a telephone call or send a letter ... provided that the member in charge is satisfied that it will not hinder or delay the investigation of crime.  A member may listen to any such telephone call and may terminate it if not so satisfied, and he may read any such letter.</P>
    <P>Again it seems to me that the person arrested at this time must be considered innocent until proved guilty.  It would be <Col N="1506" /> more satisfactory if whatever telephone call was made or letter was written would be private and confidential, and treated as such.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Interviews with arrested persons shall be conducted in a fair and humane manner.</P>
    <P>This is something with which we would all agree.  Indeed, as I have said before in my experience over a long number of years as a peace commissioner and in different capacities I have never known a single situation where interviews in special courts were not held in such manner.  It is a great credit to the Garda, under such pressure from every quarter that, in spite of what has been said and in spite of the few situations, unfortunate and serious though they were, that they have been able to conduct themselves in this fair and humane manner.</P>
    <P>According to subparagraph (4):</P>
    <P>A person shall not be interviewed for continuous periods of more than four hours without a reasonable interval between the periods.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Eoin Ryan, I think that four hours is a very long time for somebody under such terrible stress.  A reasonable interval is an arbitrary condition.  The time could be very well reduced to half that.  I feel that it would certainly improve these regulations if the Minister consented to do that.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>A record shall be made of each interview either by the member conducting it or by another member who is present.  It shall include particulars of the time the interview began and ended, any breaks in it, the place of the interview and the names of the members present.</P>
    <P>The next subsection states:</P>
    <P>Where the interview is not recorded by electronic or other similar means, the record shall &mdash; ... be in accordance with other conditions.</P>
    <P>I suppose electronic records are the most <Col N="1507" /> satisfactory.  I gathered from the Minister's introductory speech that this will be the long term objective.  I would agree with it.  There is always the danger in that kind of situation, as we know, that equipment can break down but it seems to me to be perfectly satisfactory and there should be no problem.  In this regard it would be necessary to duplicate equipment.  We would have extra expense, but it would be very much worth while.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13 deals with interviews with persons under 17 years of age.  Subparagraph (c) states:</P>
    <P>An arrested person who is under the age of seventeen years shall not be questioned in relation to an offence or asked to make a written statement in the absence of a parent or guardian except with the authority of the member in charge, which authority shall not be given unless ...</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>... it is not practicable for a parent or guardian to attend within a reasonable time ...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reasonable time&rdquo;, again going back to my original complaint, is not specific. Many homes might not have a telephone. Indeed, I can envisage in some situations the Garda squad car calling to give notice to the parent or guardian.  Many people might not like to go to the station in the squad car.  In the absence of a specific minimum or maximum time to fulfil this obligation, the Garda should be careful to interpret it on the generous side.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 deals with general provisions and states:</P>
    <P>(1)  A member conducting a search shall ensure, so far as practicable, that the person in custody understands the reason for the search and that it is conducted with due respect for the person being searched.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person in custody shall not be searched by a person (other than a doctor) of the opposite sex.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> We all agree with that.  It is quite right and proper.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 19 deals with conditions of custody and states:</P>
    <P>A person shall be kept in custody only in a station which has facilities to enable him to be treated in accordance with these regulations for the period during which he is expected to be in custody in that station.</P>
    <P>That begs the question: are there stations which are unsuitable for that purpose and what kind of stations are they?  It further states that access to toilet facilities shall be provided.  Have all stations proper toilet facilities?  Can somebody go to the toilet if they want to rather than having to get permission and be ushered through part of the station?  Paragraph 19 (b) states:</P>
    <P>Where a person is confined in a cell, a member shall visit him at half-hourly intervals.  A drunken person or a person under the influence of drugs shall be visited and spoken to and if necessary roused for this purpose every fifteen minutes for a period of two hours or longer if his condition warrants it.</P>
    <P>I recall in the not too distant past reports in the papers where if this had been done it might have prevented serious problems from arising.  Subparagraph (7) states:</P>
    <P>A member shall be accompanied when visiting a person of the opposite sex who is alone in a cell.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that a member shall be accompanied by another member, because it does not state that.  Would the condition be fulfilled if the garda had with him a person who was not a member of the Garda Síochána?  This is a very good condition but will it always be practicable?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 20 deals with persons in custody: they should not be illtreated. Senator Eoin Ryan dealt with this.  I will not go into it but it is a very important paragraph.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> Paragraph 21 deals with medical treatment for persons in custody.  Subparagraph (2) states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that paragraph (1) may not apply, medical advice shall be sought if the person in custody has in his possession, or claims to need, medication relating to a heart condition, diabetes, epilepsy or other potentially serious condition.  This paragraph shall not apply where the person is expected to be in custody for a period of less than one hour.</P>
    <P>Why should it not apply?  A person suffering from a heart condition or a problem of that kind would be put under very severe stress.  I see no reason why this should not apply where a person is expected to be in custody for a period of less than one hour because it might happen that, contrary to expectations, this time would be extended.  I should like to see this sentence deleted.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 21 (4) states:</P>
    <P>If a person in custody asks to be examined by a doctor of his choice at his own expense, the member in charge shall, if and as soon as practicable, make arrangements accordingly.  This shall not preclude his examination by another doctor summoned by the member in charge provided that the person in custody consents to the examination.</P>
    <P>If a person in custody asks to be examined by a doctor of his choice, but not at his own expense &mdash; take the case of somebody who could not afford to pay a doctor &mdash; would he be denied that facility?  It is wrong that he should be so denied.  I recall that at one of our meetings on the Oirecahtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, there were representatives from the Rape Crisis Centre and I gathered from the statements they made that when a rape victim is taken to a Garda station she can ask to be examined by her own doctor.  If this request is made it is complied with.  I know that in these regulations we are dealing with people in custody.  I suppose I am out of order in <Col N="1510" /> referring to that.  If that is the case with regard to rape victims, I am very glad.</P>
    <P>Throughout the White Paper the words &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;, &ldquo;reasonable period&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;, &ldquo;within a reasonable time&rdquo;, are used.  In many instances they are not definite enough and some time should be specified.  From the point of view of treatment of persons in custody, these regulations look very comprehensive. I welcome them.  They afford protection as well to the gardaí who are involved in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>I can see the case made by previous speakers who welcomed the publication of statutory regulations for the treatment of persons in custody in the circumstances of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, having now been made law.  I join with them in welcoming the replacement of the voluntary code by a statutory one.  However, we are encouraged both by the Minister of State's introductory speech and also by elementary logic itself to go back to the basic Act which is involved, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  On the occasion of the passing of what was then the Criminal Justice Bill through this House, the Minister for Justice gave an undertaking that sections 4 and 6, which had been the subject of an extensive Committee Stage debate with a number of amendments in my own name and that of Senator Mary Robinson, would come into effect only when the requirements of section 7 had been fulfilled.  The amendments in both Senator Robinson's and my own name at that stage were placed on behalf of the Labour group of Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not debating these regulations and we have in another part of our procedures started to discuss a complaints procedure. So the regulations and the complaints are conditions.  We are encouraged to ask whether they are sufficient for the implementation of sections 4 to 6 of the basic Act.  I expressed a great deal of reservation about the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, when we were discussing it. The Bill was, of course, passed.  My doubts remain in many ways but that is so much water under the bridge.  The <Col N="1511" /> whole purpose for the keeping of people in custody was changed by that Act. Everyone who spoke on Second Stage who followed that kind of logic felt that people were being detained and held in custody for purposes that were quite different from what had prevailed previously. This was debated at some length. Deputy Noonan, the then Minister, replied at one stage that everybody knew that people had been detained in stations before.  That was a very straightforward reply.  I quote column 1193 of the Official Report of 11 July 1984:</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, for many years most people in this country assumed that the Garda had the power to detain suspects for questioning and the Garda acted as if they had.</P>
    <P>The interesting point was made that that was one of the most unusual justifications for the introduction of the new powers under the 1984 Bill, later to become an Act.  A number of judgments, held particularly by Mr. Justice Walsh in the Supreme Court, laid down the clear principles upon which a person could be arrested and detained.</P>
    <P>There was a particular intention behind the Bill.  The purpose of custody was being changed.  It was changed in the direction of investigation.  I recall the circumstances; we were in the middle of the crime panic that had been created in the country.  Only recently we had somebody convicted of a crime of attacking elderly people who lived alone.  The problem of elderly people living alone is one that is being addressed now by the Minister as much as it was addressed by previous Ministers at the time when the peculiar moral panic was created concerning it. The problems and vulnerability of those living alone goes on over a long period of time.  Sometimes the media address it and it creates a problem in the people's minds and so on.  That panic was going on at that time in 1984 and it lent colour to the context in which we were discussing the Bill.  The idea clearly was that we needed to be able to retain people in custody for purposes of investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> I do not find it extraordinary that the Minister made that statement.  The public demanded that there be a response.  Thus in the debate in 1984 many attempts were made to strike what was felt to be a balance between two opposing forces. On one side, you had a fairly hysterically developed crime panic.  I refer to that deliberately because I am using the words &ldquo;crime panic&rdquo; in the sense in which particular words are invented to suit moral panics.  For example, the word &ldquo;mugging&rdquo; which did not exist in the English language was imported from California and was first used about a poor man who had gone to the theatre, come home a little drunk and was &ldquo;rolled&rdquo; to use the other phrase, by a group of youths.  The word &ldquo;mugging&rdquo; crept into English criminology parlance only to be imported here.  People had been getting drunk, going to the theatre and being rolled or assaulted for years.  Fashions come and go in relation to the creation of moral panics about crime and 1984 was a virulent period for hyping crime, particularly in the newspapers.  Crime sold newspapers as I said then.</P>
    <P>One end of the spectrum was communal concern that crimes were being committed and that the capacity did not exist to investigate them.  It was felt that there was a need to change the regulations under which people could be held in custody and crimes investigated.  At the other end of the spectrum was a concern with two different things.  One was concern with individual rights and liberties. This provided the main balance in the argument on the Criminal Justice Act in 1984.  To what extent did the person have rights?  These rights were felt to be the right to be silent, the circumstances in which statements would be made, the right to have professional advice in attendance and so forth.  There was another position in the 1984 debate which argued &mdash; and I will take this as my point of departure for my remarks this afternoon &mdash; that there was another perspective and that one had to look at the relationship between the community and the Garda.  What we have to look for now in 1986, looking at the implementation <Col N="1513" /> of section 7 of the 1984 Act, is what kind of balance we wish to strike in relationships between the community and the police.  That was neglected in the 1984 debate apart from the very significant and valuable speech of Senator Mary Robinson.</P>
    <P>Taking that as my departure point, you will see that the community, looking at the procedures of arrest and the procedures of detention are looking for certain things that are reasonable.  They may be looking for some things that are unreasonable.  Equally in relation to the Garda, they are best served by procedures that are open and that are in themselves satisfactory.  It helps us to enter into a new relationship between the community and the police.</P>
    <P>There are two purposes for having regulations governing people in custody. One of them is that it is in the interest of the Garda so that the good name of the force and of individual gardaí can be protected. Many of the gardaí to whom I have spoken in the community in which I live are very anxious that procedures would be very clear so that their good name, both as a force and individually, would be protected.  The second reason is so that the individuals who are detained would enjoy reasonable protection as citizens before the law.</P>
    <P>What is the position of a person responsible for a breach of community police relations?  Even a person as far removed from the law as I am, can, in reading these regulations, see that great onus that is placed on the member in charge.  If the member in charge is in breach of any one of these regulations what happens at that stage?  I think I am reading it correctly by saying that it becomes a matter for internal police discipline.  If it is, is it therefore exclusively a matter for internal police discipline separate from the complaints procedures which are envisaged in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill? Perhaps I do not see this as clearly as others.  What are its implications in relation to, for example, an individual wanting to pursue a breach under any one of the regulations in terms of the civil law? To what extent would the records <Col N="1514" /> referred to later on be admissible as forms of evidence and as material in a civil case and so on?  There is the problem of having a system that will be seen to be transparent both by the community and the Garda.</P>
    <P>There will be a difficulty in the implementation of these regulations.  I can see one sense in which they are very welcome, that is in the transition from a voluntary to a statutory code.  I have an unreserved welcome and admiration for such a transition.  Equally in application to normal circumstances they might be useful.  There was a set of circumstances which governed the introduction of the basic 1984 Act.  That was that it led to new circumstances for detention and questioning.  Can these regulations be adequately exercised and, at the same time, fulfil the intent of the basic legislation? There is a tension there.  The major case made on Second Stage for the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 was that there were circumstances and crimes which needed to be investigated and which required that certain kinds of measures be taken and that the hands of the gardaí needed to be strengthened and so forth.  Those of us who argued against that said that we should be approaching the crime wave in a slightly different way.  That argument is over now but the stated intention of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and the particular logic and philosophy behind it will cast a certain colour over the implementation of the measures we are looking at here.</P>
    <P>I am not as hooked on the case of individual rights as other contributors were on the Second and Committee Stages of the Criminal Justice Act.  I am much more influenced by the argument that correct procedures in custody can be more easily approached in terms of the implication of all of this for relations between the community and the police. You can look at it from that perspective rather than that of individual rights.  You can satisfy individual rights in a legalistic or formal way but the rights may never be delivered on.  Therefore, there is some merit in points made by previous speakers this afternoon in asking questions <Col N="1515" /> about the form in which these new regulations will be made accessible and available to the people who are affected by them, the people in custody.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that worries me about the language in the regulations.  If I was in custody and I was looking for regulations to guide me I would not be looking for flourishes or for idealistic statements &mdash; maybe it is because of my personality &mdash; but I would be looking for something that rather clearly guaranteed a right.  Thus regulation 3, paragraph 1 says:</P>
    <P>In carrying out their functions under these regulations members of the Garda Síochána shall at all times act with integrity and with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody (particularly any of them who may be under a physical or mental disability) and their dignity as human persons while complying with the obligation to prevent escapes from custody ...</P>
    <P>I readily applaud such a statement but I suggest that what we need to be very clear about are the procedures that will prevail.  I presume the procedures are what would interest people who might find themselves in custody.  For example, they would be interested in seeing what rights they had.  Will a copy of these rights be held before them on a card?  Will a card be handed to them?  Will they be given details in writing rather than verbally of what they are charged with or will they be informed in writing by the time they have been an hour or two in custody what it is that they are being charged with and under what Act and so forth?  People are governed by practical things rather than by knowing they are in the clutches of an idealistic legal system.</P>

      <P>This is not to take from the high-minded, ethical and well-disposed intentions of those who drafted these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Eoin Ryan <Col N="1516" /> had to say earlier about the definition of the member in charge.  I recall a clear example of looking for a member in charge.  It was on the occasion of the arrest of a large number of women in the Phoenix Park under the by-laws which govern the Phoenix Park.  These women had been removed to a Garda station.  I may have asked the more earthy question such as, &ldquo;who is in charge?&rdquo;  A very kindly and co-operative man volunteered to say &ldquo;I am in charge&rdquo;.  I had been invited there by the husband of one of the women who had been detained.  The poor man &mdash; he was very courteous &mdash; was overwhelmed by what was taking place.  There was about 30 women in a small number of overcrowded cells.  They had been arrested at the time of Mr. Reagan's visit to this country.</P>
    <P>The women were in the cells.  People were trying to see them.  The phone was out of order, which brings me to the phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;.  I remember asking if the woman I was visiting had been able to make a phone call.  She wanted to make a call to her husband.  I was told that there was a phone across the yard but that it was not working.  We were in the position &mdash; there were only a small number of cells and about 30 women &mdash; that some of the women had seen solicitors two or three times but more than half of them had seen no solicitor at all.  People were arriving and seeing large numbers of people in the same cell.  No one knew who was visiting who in relation to a professional visit.  It was very interesting because it has stayed in my mind as an example of a practical situation &mdash; perhaps unusual because large numbers of people were involved &mdash; in which these bits of language are put to the test.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 (2) states:</P>
    <P>... the superintendent in charge of a district shall issue instructions in writing from time to time, either generally or by reference to particular members or members of particular ranks or to particular circumstances, as to the member who is to be the member in <Col N="1517" /> charge of each station in the district while the station is open.</P>
    <P>(3) as far as practicable the member in charge shall not be a member who was involved in the arrests of any person for the offence in respect of which he is in custody or in the investigation of that offence.</P>
    <P>I am unsure so I am willing to be guided as to the force of the phrase &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; which is used so extensively throughout these regulations.  If you take it that the appeal for the invocation of these regulations is to be one that is an internal matter within the Garda rather than one of appealing to an appellate authority outside of the Garda, and if you add to that the phrase &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; surely you erode very considerably the impact of these regulations in terms of protecting the people who might be detained.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5 (3) the points I have just been making are made rather pithily:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the member in charge that a direction given or action taken by a member of higher rank is inconsistent with the proper application of these regulations, he shall inform that member accordingly and, unless the matter is resolved, report it without delay to another member of or above the rank of superintendent.</P>
    <P>How practical is that?  It is very easy to write down.  I can tell you from reading cases that the natural tendency of people within a profession is to protect each other.  Such an action is very unlikely to take place in a practical sense.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the question of records in the Seanad during July 1984, there seemed to be a difference of opinion between the sponsors of the legislation and those of us who suggested that as quickly as possibily there should be placed in the hands of the person being arrested or the person being detained in custody a specific statement in writing rather than any oral statement as to the precise offence that the person was supposed to have committed.  That was a <Col N="1518" /> very valid point because it arose in the course of the exchanges at that time.</P>
    <P>Many Senators on both sides of the House spoke about the fact that people had been arrested by the simple formula of saying: &ldquo;I am arresting you under section 30&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am arresting you under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act&rdquo;.  When we raised, on the occasion of that debate, the question of the person being told for what he was being arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, the Minister conceded that it could indeed be made a matter of test as to whether the person had been told what the particular offence was.  It was argued at that time that section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, gave no new powers of arrest so that therefore these considerations did not arise.  What it did lead us to speculate about was the giving to a person as soon as possible a statement in writing about the offence of which the person was accused.  Regulation 6 provides that:</P>
    <P>(1) A custody record shall be kept (2) ...</P>
    <P>(2) The member in charge shall record or cause to be recorded in the custody record as soon as praticable such information as is required by these regulations to be recorded.  Each entry in the record shall be signed or initialled by the member making it.</P>
    <P>May I ask a question here again?  Let me be more brave about it: would it not be better to require the record to be kept and then later perhaps to allow mitigating circumstances to be adduced by the person who was in charge, in other words the person would say: &ldquo;Yes, the duty was on me to do this, but I did not do it because of so and so&rdquo;.  My argument is that by putting in &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; you are creating a circumstance in which the person will be able to say: &ldquo;I did it as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  What is &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and how will that be judged? You can reply, I suppose, by saying that judges have interpreted phrases like this and they have nearly always interpreted this kind of phrase as meaning as soon as was reasonably possible.  I think the <Col N="1519" /> phrase is not an advantage in the regulations by and large.  Let me just say that about it.  I would have spoken about it every place else it occurs.  It occurs equally in relation to 8 (2).  I take Senator Durcan's point that under regulation 9 there is departure from the &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; formula and the phrase &ldquo;shall without delay&rdquo; is used.  I would agree with him that &ldquo;shall without delay&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the record the requirements of keeping the record as one goes is much more important than allowing it to be completed at a later time.  I see in the regulations, but perhaps I am wrong, that a person could comply with the details of the record of custody, at considerable time after a number of the different complying actions had taken place.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to this regulation and all these questions about the phrase, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;, to go back to my experience of the Phoenix Park women, I want to ask whether it would handle the situation of where a telephone was not working and, whether in such circumstances, the regulation could be implemented. I can think of instances in which someone would ask, &ldquo;what did you expect us to do, does this mean that you go out and go to a nearby telephone if your own phone is not working?&rdquo; and so forth. Equally it arises in relation to transfer. Let us say that the person is brought to a particular station that is not the headquarters and therefore is moved at a later stage to some place else.  Regulation 8 (2) says that the relation involved shall be told that as soon as practicable.  If this area can be tightened, that should be done.</P>
    <P>In relation to the information that is to be given to the person in custody, we really have to think very carefully about that.  A previous Senator, I think it was Senator Durcan suggested that while we in the Oireachtas and such people as lawyers and the Garda Síochána may be aware of what these rights are, the criminals may not be so aware.  I do not subscribe to that.  I think that some hard core <Col N="1520" /> criminals will be very aware of their rights within a matter of hours of these regulations being passed but a great number of people from the socially deprived areas who are not hard core criminals but who are coming into conflict with the law for perhaps the first or second time, may not be so aware; likewise, people with literacy problems, and who are subject to other forms of social disadvantage.  I am still concerned, as I was in July 1984 on the occasion of the passing of the Criminal Justice Act, about the section governing children.  May I just add to this question of the six hours detention?  The point has been made already that six hours was too long a period especially when you take that in conjunction with the provision that no questioning shall take place between midnight and 8 a.m., unless the offence has been committed in that time and unless the person has consented or something like that.  If you are in a situation where questioning has begun two hours before midnight, you are facing the reality that the person being questioned will have to remain at the station until morning.  The reality of being there until morning would in itself put powerful pressure on somebody.</P>
    <P>I do not see the advantage of very long periods required for questioning.</P>
    <P>I have a doubt altogether about the use of detention for investigative purposes but even in legal systems where this principle is accepted, I do not think it is being very fruitful.  There is no point in pointing out to places where they can hold people for 36 hours or something like that.  What I am interested in is where it has yielded results that have been accepted as being beneficial in terms of the quality of law. All the questions about the rights of notification to solicitors, to other persons and to relatives was useful but all of these are qualified by this phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  I am at a loss to understand it because I believe that by putting it in like that &mdash; the example was correctly used in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Act in the context of knowing a person's age, as to whether you &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; served drink to a person under the age of 18 &mdash; is really making all of the guaranteed aspect <Col N="1521" /> of the regualtions almost a matter of discretion.  That &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; has proved of great service to publicans for decades.</P>
    <P>I support the regulations regarding visits and communications.  The Minister said she had not accepted one of the recommendations of the Ó Briain report which was that a solicitor be allowed to be present in an observer capacity.  This is disposed of in the Minister's speech by saying that the purpose of such observational presence would be to make sure that no unfair allegations were made against a garda and to guard against improper questioning and in so far as procedures to protect against both of these existed elsewhere in the regulations there was no need to allow for this.  I do not agree.</P>
    <P>In many ways, to go back to my criterion or the test by which I measure this, I think that by the balance of community gain, police behaviour being measured against trying to forge a better relationship with the community, it is another aspect of openness to have the legal representative present in such an observer capacity.  I think it would assist.</P>
    <P>On the question of the charge sheets I said already that I believe that these should be completed as quickly as possible. On the other point in relation to regulation 20 it is again, if I might call it, a 1937 constitutional type of phrase with a flourish:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(1) No member shall subject a person in custody to ill-treatment of any kind or the threat of violence (whether against the person himself, his family or any other person connected with him) or permit any other person to do so.</P>
    <P>And so say all of us.  I certainly agree, I am not being cynical and I do not take from the spirit of it; it is a phrase that we would all agree with.  I wonder about:</P>
    <P>(2) no member shall use force against a person in custody except such reasonable force as is necessary</P>
    <P>(a) in self defence,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> (b) to secure compliance with lawful directions,</P>
    <P>(c) to prevent his escape.</P>
    <P>Perhaps these are taken from other police codes.  How are they ever to be measured, and I am back now to the question with which I began?  If they are ever to be measured or tested or adjudged in terms of their impact on anybody, is it by internal investigation by one own's peers within the police force?  There are implications in that.  Again it raises the question whether the breach of these regulations is outside of internal discipline or not.</P>
    <P>A very interesting point was made initially by Senator Eoin Ryan in relation to the purpose of interviewing a person who is obviously under the influence of drink. Talking to people under the influence of drink is something to which perhaps politicians are condemned but perhaps the Garda need to be.  I agree with those who question the utility of talking to a person under the influence of drink. Does this mean that the person could affect being under the influence of drink. You could imagine that that speaks for a sizeable proportion of the Irish population. How would you know?  Here again the quality of the evidence that is given has implications for the use of any statement a person might make.  Can you envisage a situation in court where a person would ask, &ldquo;was my client drunk? Was my client drunk in a way in which, to use 21 (b), he could not be roused? Was he drunk in a way that he could communicate with people?&rdquo; And so on, and what is the status of the statement that he might have made?</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Senators in welcoming the publication of the regulations and everything I have said, contrary to any impression I might have given, is in an attempt to be positive.  I have said that my attempts to be positive are undoubtedly hampered by the fact that I feel that sections 4 to 6 are a misconstruction of what is necessary in relation to controlling crime at this particular time. In so far as statutory regulations are appearing instead of voluntary ones, I <Col N="1523" /> welcome them, but I would like to think that those regulations could be enforced by appeal to an authority outside of the participants beyond the offenders and beyond those who are in charge of the Garda station.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that even if these questions can be satisfied that the regulations themselves could become basic principles for action that would be welcomed by the Garda themselves as providing guarantees which they can show to the public by which they live as minima, not as things which they are enforced to observe and thus they would create better relations between the Garda and the community.  Equally in relation to the community and particularly the more vulnerable sections of the community &mdash; not the hard core criminals &mdash; who come into contact with the law will know that they are coming into contact with a force that has basic custodial regulations, that they are safe and therefore that a dialogue can take place in conditions of custody which are assisted by these regulations.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my very last point, that I think these conditions cannot be met if the regulations have attached to them language or conditions which take from their guarantee aspect.  If they are made conditional by the phrase &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; or if they are made conditional in the sense that appeal from them will only be an internal matter, I feel they are lessened and I hope that when the regulations come back to us perhaps they may have removed some of the doubts that I have expressed already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that these regulations share with certain people something which has become to be known in this country as a flawed pedigree.  They are really part of the obstacle course established and inserted by the Oireachtas in an attempt to delay and ameliorate the effects of sections 4 to 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. Initially, without reopening old wounds and leaving aside the merits of the proposals themselves because they bring closer <Col N="1524" /> the implementation of these most divisive sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, I cannot welcome it.</P>
      <P>Turning to the regulations themselves, the first thing I would like to ask the Minister is, why are regulations like this or proposals for regulations like this not circulated to Members of the House? None of these proposals were circulated to the Members of this House or the Members of the other House.  It is true to say they were laid in the Library of the House, but no copy of the regulations was circulated to the individual Members.  I think that is quite incorrect.  I think all matters which require an affirmative resolution of this House should be circulated to Members.  We are fed up with getting annual reports of bodies in which many of the Members of the Oireachtas have very little interest as such.  We are inundated with irrelevant pieces of paper and we are not circulated with regulations in respect of which we are expected to give opinions at short notice.</P>
      <P>In this case because the considerations of these matters was delayed over a number of weeks I think most of the Members of the House who wanted to attend to the matter were able to do so.  Had it been taken the first time it appeared on the agenda then very very many Members of this House who were interested, if only interested to the extent of reading them and not participating in the debate, would not have had the opportunity of doing so because the regulations were not available.  When I went to get a copy of the regulations in the Library they were unable to give it to me.  I could only get a photocopy of the regulations and I notice that at least one other Senator was using a photocopy of the regulations today in the consideration of the matter.  Subsequently I did get a copy of the regulations but I do not think it should be necessary to go to that extent. Anything, whether it be draft regulations or proposals for regulations or whatever you call it, which requires an affirmative resolution of this House should as of right be circulated to Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations are being made by the Minister under the power given to <Col N="1525" /> him and subject to the restrictions conferred on him by section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Therefore to look at the regulations in their entirety one has to look at section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act.  Therein lies the most central problem with the regulations as far as I am concerned.  Sections 7 (3) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act contains the problem with the regulations.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to disciplinary proceedings.</P>
    <P>I think that was a mistake by the Houses of the Oireachtas, but that is what the Houses of the Oireachtas have decided and there is no point in my reploughing that land.  The usefulness of the regulations must be considered in the context of a flagrant abuse of them by members of the Garda Síochána which will not render the members, in respect of that failure to observe any of the regulations, open to criminal or civil proceedings. They may, of course, be open to criminal or civil proceedings for some other reason but not as a result of the making of the regulations.  It must be unique that regulations become part of the law of the land.  This imposes a duty on a person but there is no criminal sanction in respect of the person who does not adhere to the regulations.  That seems to be very strange.</P>
    <P>When these regulations are implemented it will become the duty of the member in charge to do the various things that are outlined in the regulations.  That actually will be part of the law of the <Col N="1526" /> land.  It is not just an internal matter, it is part of the law in precisely the same way, as is displaying your tax disc or not parking on a double yellow line.  Almost uniquely with regard to these regulations there will be no sanction in respect of the people who break the law.  That appears to me to be quite grotesque.  I do not think the House has properly considered or understood that these are not like internal regulations.  These are part of the law of the land.  There will be a duty on the member in charge to advise the person in the various ways set out in the regulations.  If he fails to do that he will have broken the law, but he will not be subject to the law in respect of that failure.  That makes no sense at all.  Surely it must be unique that we are passing a law by way of regulations because that is what it is.  This is the law in precisely the same way as the Finance Act or anything else.  People who break the law will not be subject to the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any other regulations which are so structured that they impose obligations on people in certain circumstances and impose no criminal sanction in respect of those people who do not live up to those sanctions.  That appears to be quite an extraordinary matter and is proof or an indication of the very strong lobby which is represented by the forces behind these regulations &mdash; that a law imposing duty on people to do certain things would be enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas with no provision for punishment if that law is ignored.  There may be punishment if somebody mistreats a person in another way.  Members of the Garda Síochána or those in custody and all parties concerned including solicitors will all be subject to the normal punishment but not in respect of the duties imposed on people under these regulations.  That appears to be an extraordinary omission.  For that reason I cannot welcome that aspect of the regulations, no matter how good the regulations are themselves.  By and large the regulations are fairly good.  I cannot really accept that things could be put into law with no sanction on those who choose to ignore it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> It seems very doubtful to what extent a member who ignores his duties under these regulations will be subject to the new complaints procedure, for example, a member in charge who fails to give people the things in writing they are supposed to get, fails to read the particular notice to them, or fails to make the entries in the books or fails to contact a solicitor when it is suggested he should contact a solicitor.  The new complaints procedure is such that it is splitting the disciplinary offences within the Garda Síochána into two sections.  It is quite right in doing that.  Unless a disciplinary offence is actually within the Act, it falls to be dealt with internally.  The only way it can be within the Act is if it is recited within the Act.  There are certain things that are recited.  There are certain things which you might be able to interpret as including a failure to do some duty which is imposed under the regulations.  One of them is the abuse of authority.  That abuse of authority is only defined in respect of two particular aspects, oppressive conduct towards a member of the public including without sufficient cause making an arrest or using unnecessary violence towards any person.  If it falls outside that definition or other similar definitions it will not be capable of being investigated except internally within the Garda Síochána. That is a failure of the regulations and in that regard they fail to back up with sufficiently strong disciplinary procedures, the onerous duties which they put on the members of the force.  The disciplinary procedures which one can expect in those circumstances will be less than satisfactory, because they are internal, and not because anybody is going to act deliberately &mdash; certainly not anybody within the hierarchy of the Garda Síochána.  These matters should be settled long before they go to the hierarchy of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is true to say &mdash; and the Minister made copious references to it &mdash; that the regulations will not apply to those voluntarily attending at the station. Those who voluntarily attend at the Garda station are an extraordinary group of <Col N="1528" /> individuals.  They are people whose thirst for justice is so strong that they are suddenly impelled to give up free time to go to Garda stations to help the members of the Garda Síochána in a voluntary capacity with regard to unsolved crimes. The Minister said that to apply the regulations to such persons would be <i>ultra vires</i> the legislation.  That is true but it is a disingenuous argument to say that it is <i>ultra vires</i> the legislation which is to say: it is <i>ultra vires</i> the legislation which I drafted myself.  If the Minister requires an additional piece of legislation, he will get our co-operation to ensure that these relevant portions of these regulations, or some of them which would be relevant, should apply to those who voluntarily attend a station.  A problem does exist in this area, which the Minister is well aware of.  He could hardly fail to be aware of the problem when he considers the excellent report of the Tribunal Of Inquiry into &ldquo;The Kerry Babies Case&rdquo;.  In chapter 32 headed &ldquo;Freedom?&rdquo;, it was quite clearly stated by the tribunal that the members of the Hayes family were not free in any real sense of the word to leave the Garda station even though they had not been arrested in a formal sense.  There is a necessity for the Minister to clarify to a far greater extent than has been done &mdash; I do not want to go into that in great detail, we will have another day on that &mdash; the extent to which he proposes to grant aid and support to those who attend a Garda station on a voluntary basis.  No doubt a considerable number of people will continue to do so on a voluntary basis.  How will their rights be protected bearing in mind the new sets of discipline that will be in place in respect of those who are in custody?  While it is accurate for the Minister to say that he cannot do this under present law, he is not limited to making regulations under this power. He can always make regulations under other power and if he has not got the power, he can get himself the power.  He can certainly make internal regulations which mirror image these regulations and impose similar disciplinary obligations on the members of the Garda Síochána who are fortunate enough to have neighbours <Col N="1529" /> and friends who voluntarily come to the Garda station from time to time.</P>
    <P>I shall not go through the regulations one by one but Regulation 9 is an important one as it deals with the information to be given to an arrested person about his entitlement to consult a solicitor and the facilities laid out being made available to him.  The Minister raised the problem that the postponing of the questioning until the arrival of the solicitor would more or less eat into the six hours.  Those are not the exact words he used but that was certainly the import of what he said.</P>
    <P>If a person was entitled to the attendance of a solicitor at all times during his questioning, I am sure the Minister would find Members of this House very open to a suggestion that the six hours should commence until the arrival of the solicitor. The detained person should be left on his own or left unquestioned until the arrival of the solicitor and let the six hours start then.  I do not think that that would give rise to a major problem and I do not want to refight old fights but I think the Minister raises the problem that the attendance of a solicitor is impractical.  I do not think that the attendance of a solicitor is impractical in so far as the vast majority of cases are concerned.  The attendance of a solicitor during questioning, far from giving rise to any of the problems which the Minister seems to anticipate would, in fact, be a positive matter and I would not mind if that was coupled with imposing an obligation on people to answer questions in a structured way, but I do object to this furtive questioning which is such an essential part of the structure we are now putting into operation.</P>
    <P>In Regulation 12 the Minister talks about four hours as being the period of time beyond which persons should not be continually questioned.  I share totally with the other Members of the House the objection to four hours as a period of time for continuous questioning.  The presence of four members of the Garda Síochána and the participation of two such members in the questioning on a rota basis over a four hour period, is enough <Col N="1530" /> to break the will of even the most determined person.  If the Kerry Babies tribunal report proves anything, it is that a person with a guilty conscience will, without bullying or without actual or even threatened violence from the gardaí admit to crimes that they did not commit. That will be a very significant problem if the period of questioning is four hours. Four hours is far too long a period of questioning.  A much more appropriate length of time would be two hours with two hours off and the remaining two hours of the six hour period if it was necessary.  That would be far more appropriate than four hours followed by four uninterrupted hours.  I will not go into that in any further detail because the Minister knows my views on those matters.</P>
    <P>There are, however, two drafting points that I want to bring to the Minister's attention.  Paragraph 12, subparagraph (4) seems to be rather peculiarly drafted.  It relates to the length of time to which a person may be interviewed.  It says:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be interviewed for continuous periods of more than four hours without a reasonable interval between the periods.</P>
    <P>That could be interpreted as applying only where there is more than one period. It refers to &ldquo;continuous periods&rdquo;.  What happens if there is only one period of five hours?  A better draft of that would be: a person shall not be interviewed for a continuous period or periods of more than four hours.  &ldquo;Continuous periods&rdquo; would suggest that a break-up into sections comprises the four hours but, obviously, what the Minister has in mind is that that triggers it, and also where a person is being questioned for a continuous period of four hours.  That is inaccurately drafted and is capable of incorrect interpretation.  I could argue if I was put to it that a person who was interviewed for five hours continuously was only interviewed for one period of five hours and was not interviewed for continuous periods of five hours.  The Minister should <Col N="1531" /> examine this before making the regulation. Just to prove that I did read this: on the last page there is a misprint.  Paragraph 24 (1) relates to preservation of custody records and states:</P>
    <P>Custody records shall be preserved for at least twelve months or, if any proceedings to which a custody record would be relevant are instituted of any complaint....</P>
    <P>What is &ldquo;of any complaint&rdquo;?  Surely this should be &ldquo;or any complaint&rdquo;?  It goes on:</P>
    <P>...is made in respect of the conduct or a member...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Or a member&rdquo; should read &ldquo;of a member&rdquo;. The Minister may have to take advice as to whether he will have to come back to us with these regulations printed correctly and that might delay the introduction of the obnoxious section 4 even longer.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the House has made its decision with regard to these matters and I will not quibble at that. However, while the regulations, as drafted by the Minister and produced here in the form of a White Paper conform with section 7 of the Act, there are extremely foolish omissions from the regulations, particularly the lack of certainty in respect of those who deliberately flout the regulations.  I realise, of course, that in running any institution from time to time things may happen which are not exactly according to the book.  I understand that.  What concerns me is that if there are continuous minor breaches of these regulations &mdash; when they become regulations &mdash; and nothing happens as a result of it, as I believe nothing would happen in the vast majority of cases, over a period of time these regulations, because they do not specifically have any penalty attaching to them, will become more honoured in the breach than in the observance or will be performed in a manner which is inconsistent with the spirit behind the regulations.  For these reasons, while I recognise the attempts made by the Minister to introduce a degree of humanity and sanity into the <Col N="1532" /> proposals until the proposed operation of the Criminal Justice Act, I would be untrue to myself if I did not continue to place on record my most fundamental objections to the legislation for which these proposals for regulations are designed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for a very thorough examination of the contents of this White Paper.  If I may be forgiven for replying immediately to a point raised by Senator O'Leary at the end, it is with the greatest of pleasure that I can give Senator O'Leary full satisfaction in saying to him that I will have to come back to the House with these regulations properly printed because what we have before us is a White Paper, a device&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which I deliberately adopted so that we could have this kind of debate in circumstances where I could listen to the House and change my mind if I were so persuaded by the arguments of the House.  These are not the draft regulations.  This is a White Paper setting out what I intend to put into the draft regulations.  They will be before the House again for formal approval.  I can assure the Senator that at the very minimum all three of the textual amendments he has identified as being necessary will be implemented.  I know the Senator would be insulted if I were even to suggest that in any way I were to congratulate him or commend him for having arrived on his reading of the document to the end of regulation 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points raised cover all the main concerns we must have about the treatment of persons in custody.  To take up the point raised by a number of Members during the course of the debate, these proposed regulations apply to the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations. The Minister of State and I have made it quite clear in this House that I will be asking the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the same kind of treatment is afforded to persons in Garda stations <Col N="1533" /> who are there voluntarily and not in Garda custody.  I am persuaded by the kinds of considerations that Senator O'Leary and others have developed to the effect that that should be so.</P>
    <P>Might I make one brief remark out of sequence to Senator O'Leary?  I would ask him to reflect whether he would prefer the truth to be ingenuous or disingenuous. That is an argument we might reserve for another part of this House at a time when we have more leisure to examine it in detail.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan raised a number of detailed points.  He began by suggesting that the arrested person, the person in custody, might not know who is the person to whom he should complain if he feels that he is being harshly treated and suggested that there is no provision here for telling that person to go to the member in charge.  He suggested that this information might be included in the notice of rights to be given to each person in custody.  That is a perfectly justified and reasonable suggestion.  I will ask the commissioner to include it in the notice of rights to be given to the person.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision in regulation 12 (9) for complaints to be made either during an interview or in regualtion 20 (7) for a general complaint about conduct from the moment of arrest.  Those complaints will be handled under the new statutory complaints procedure and will be subject to all of the safeguards that are provided for in that procedure.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan asked if a person were brought on arrest to one station and then immediately transferred to another station, who would give that person the information provided for in regulation 9. Once the member in charge of the first station is made aware that a person has been brought on arrest to his station he must give that person the information required under regulation 9 before any transfer can take place.  It is at the station to which the person is first brought that that information must be given to him.</P>
    <P>In relation to regulation 11 (3), Senator Eoin Ryan suggested that the member in charge must have reasons for refusing a visit of that kind, but that elsewhere he <Col N="1534" /> has to explain himself differently.  The member in charge is the one who is most clearly in the best position to satisfy himself as to whether the visit could be adequately supervised.  That would depend on the number of gardaí available, the number of persons making visits and also whether a visit would hinder the investigation of the crime.  It is true that the decision is being left to the judgment of the member in charge and to his judgement alone.  There is no way of avoiding that in the operation of circumstance.  The judgment as to whether to permit a visit is being left to the member in charge and only to the member in charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that in other cases he had to record the reasons why he would not allow such thing to happen but does not have to record it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In that particualr circumstance, as I was about to point out, we are leaving the judgment to the member in charge because he is the only one operationally who can make that judgment. If the member is acting unreasonably and it can be shown that he is acting unreasonably, there is a sanction against the member in charge.  The person who is being refused the ability to make the visit, can go to the complaints board or can complain about the matter on the spot.  If a complaint is made on the spot, it has to be recorded and it would then be sent to the complaints board for investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation 12 (3) in Senator Eoin Ryan's view is very good in principle, that is the requirement that the member conducting the interview identify himself and that not more than two members may question the person in custody at any given time.  The Senator asked would the person know about this, what would happen, for example, if three members were questioning at one and the same time.  It goes without saying that numbers of persons might not know or will not know about the details of the regulations. I would make the point that they can <Col N="1535" /> complain afterwards.  They can complain or take the matter up when they speak to their legal advisers or to their friends. The way is open to them to make a complaint to the Garda Complaints Board. The regulation in question sets the standard. It is up to the members of the force to observe that standard and given the provisions set out in relation to complaints, they would ignore it only at their own risk.  The breaches there would be proper subjects for complaint afterwards either by the person in custody or by somebody acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>In relation to regulation 12 (4) there has been some debate, particularly about the question as to whether a period of four hours is too long during which to subject a person to questioning.  Senator Durcan, Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator O'Leary took up this point.  It is always difficult to provide for a single fixed time limit where the circumstances can vary widely from case to case.  Four hours was selected because that is the period specified in the present Garda instructions which, in turn, were based on the recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee. The Ó Briain recommendation was that at most four hours of questioning should be allowed followed by a break of one hour or a break of two hours if that break were a period during which a meal would be provided.  I fully recognise that what might be oppressive for a young and inexperienced person might not be at all oppressive for a more mature or more experienced, not to say a more hardened, person.  There might be cases where a period of less than four hours would be oppressive in the one case and a period of more than four hours might not be oppressive in another.</P>
    <P>On balance &mdash; and this is the only way we can deal with it in a case like this &mdash; a period of four hours is a reasonable compromise bearing in mind the fact that it is always subject to scrutiny by the courts in a particular case.  The court itself could decide that a lesser period in a particular case could be held to be oppressive.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 12 (8) and 13 (1) (d) make <Col N="1536" /> provision for questioning on the authority of the member in charge if it is his opinion that to delay questioning would involve a risk of injury to persons or destruction of evidence.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan asked for clarification and suggested that the ban on questioning could be circumvented easily enough by invoking this provision.  This provision is necessary, as had been pointed out during the introduction of the debate, to deal with the situation where the rights of other persons come into conflict, or could come into conflict, with the rights of the person in custody. An extreme example would be where a person was suspected of having placed a bomb and it was believed that he knew where that bomb, or even another bomb, would be.  There is a danger then to the rights of other persons.  We have a constitutional obligation to defend and vindicate the rights of other persons also and in such circumstances if we were simply to say that there could be no questioning, we could render that guarantee of the rights of other persons ineffective.  If that provision is unreasonably invoked, the aggrieved person can complain about the conduct of the member in charge.  I am right in saying that a complaint which was held to be well-founded on grounds of that kind would be a matter which would be taken into account by a court.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan asked if the regulations should not provide that the member in charge should not be a young or inexperienced member of the force.  It would not be appropriate to include a specific provision to that effect in the regulations because one cannot foresee in advance all of the circumstances that might arise in particular cases.  It would certainly happen only very rarely, if at all, that an inexperienced member of the force would be the member in charge.  But, of course, I readily concede that we cannot absolutely rule out cases where in smaller stations in particular that might happen. It would be a matter for detailed implementation by the Garda to try to ensure as far as possible that that kind of situation would not arise.  There would be an interest from the Garda authorities' point <Col N="1537" /> of view in avoiding such a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with these particular regulations.</P>
    <P>Senators Durcan and Michael D. Higgins referred to regulation 15 (1) which provides that a person should be given a copy of a charge sheet as soon as practicable. They suggested that they would prefer to have this done without delay. It does not always follow that &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; is always quicker than &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  If it is practicable to do the thing immediately, then &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; is exactly the same thing as &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;&mdash; it is immediately.  The term &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; relates more to the realities of the situations that we will meet in practice, as Senator Michael D. Higgins referred to, a situation, for example, that could arise in any Garda station where it would not, in fact, be practical for perfectly good reasons to give a charge sheet to everybody on the spot, to all persons in custody.  In the case in which the Senator mentioned, for example, I cannot imagine that we would often find circumstances in which 30 people could be brought all together into a Garda station and find that there was enough Garda manpower and elbow power around to give each one of those persons a charge sheet, without delay.  If there are abuses in that regard, they would come into the category of matters about which complaints could be made.</P>
    <P>Commenting on regulation 21 (2), Senator Fitzsimons suggested that this should apply irrespective of the period during which the person had been in custody, and that the reference to a period of less than one hour should be deleted.  I am glad to be in a position to say that I can agree to that.  It is a modification which will be incorporated in the draft regulations when they come before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons asked about facilities at Garda stations.  He pointed out that not all stations would have adequate facilities for the detention of persons for anything more than very short periods or for the detention of persons overnight. Where persons have to be detained for <Col N="1538" /> longer periods, or for an overnight period, they will be detained in designated stations which will have the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that we are fairly well advanced in a programme of providing the required facilities in a number of locations throughout the country; at all divisional headquarters and in larger Garda stations that are not divisional headquarters.  We will be pressing ahead with that and, indeed, I narrowly escaped being photographed in one group of such facilities in the divisional headquarters in Galway in the company of the Bishop who seemed to be reluctant to come into the cell with me.  I cannot imagine why because when the two of us were in it there was some chance that we would both get out of it again.  Had we gone in separately the situation might have been somewhat different.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons asked if there is a time limit on the exercise by an arrested person of his entitlement to request the presence of a solicitor or to have a person notified of his detention.  There is no time limit in that connection.</P>
    <P>Again, Senator Fitzsimons wondered whether a member in charge could leave the Garda station without somebody else replacing him.  The answer to that is no; there must be a member in charge at all times and the custody record must be kept in each case.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael D. Higgins asked if the custody record would be admissible evidence in subsequent civil proceedings against a member of the Garda.  Strictly speaking, the custody record would not be evidence unless both sides agreed that they would treat it as such.  The person in question could certainly summon the members involved to give evidence, including evidence related to the matters contained in the custody record.  In this connection I would remind the House that the custody record must be given to the person who is being held in custody or to his legal representative within 12 months of his leaving custody.</P>
    <P>Senators Michael D. Higgins and O'Leary asked what would be the position <Col N="1539" /> of a member if he breaches the regulations. Such a member could be liable to criminal prosecution if the grounds for a criminal prosecution were there; he may also be liable to civil proceedings if the person in custody chooses to pursue an action against him.  It is clear beyond doubt that nothing in these regulations for the treatment of persons in custody detracts in any way from the rights of such persons before the law.</P>
    <P>A member of the force in breach of the regulations might also be subject to discipline by the Garda Complaints Board if a complaint is made by a member of the public, or under the Garda discipline regulations if the breach with which he is charged is one that falls to be dealt with under the Garda discipline regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan asked that the custody record be kept in each station in which a person is detained.  I can confirm that that is the intention.  Regulation 6, paragraph 3 provides that even where a person is transferred to another station the custody record or a copy of it shall be sent with him.  That is flexible enough to allow the original record to be sent.  But that is to cover the case where a copy could not conveniently be provided, in which case the original would be sent.  Obviously, good management requires that a record be preserved in each station and that will be done.  The Garda authorities, with whom we have discussed this particular point, would prefer that the original record should be kept in the original station. But the Senator will agree that we need to have perhaps a little flexibility in that regard in order to ensure that a copy can be kept in every station.  It is not a matter that would arise very often, but the Senator's concern is a well placed one which I would want to meet.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins asked how effective regulation 5 (3); that is the one which provides that where it appears to the member in charge that a member of higher rank is acting contrary to the regulations he must tell that member so and unless the matter is resolved report it to a member of at least superintendent rank. <Col N="1540" /> That provision deals with a very difficult situation that can arise in a disciplined force with a chain of command.  First of all, the member in charge would make an effort to resolve the matter by taking it up with the superior officer concerned, pointing out the respects in which he is contravening the regulations.  It is only if that fails that he would report it to a superior officer.</P>
    <P>Of course there would be problems for a particular member in a case like that, but if the problem is not faced up to the member involved might find himself answering a complaint made to the complaints board and it would be no excuse for him to say that he knew that the superior was contravening regulations but he thought that in the circumstances he should do nothing about it.  These regulations put a number of specific duties on members of the force in relation to the way in which they must treat persons in custody.  In that regard I was a little taken aback, I must confess, by Senator Michael D. Higgins alleging &mdash; I will not say accusing &mdash; that the regulations were written with an unnecessary flourish.  I am not quite sure just what he has in mind, but in relation to specific questions that he asked it seemed to me to be very difficult to imagine a different way in which could express what was intended.  For example, Senator Higgins missed a bit of regulation 20 which is on page 22, but I cannot, rereading the regulation, think of a clearer or more direct way of stating the obligation that is there, by using different language.  It might perhaps be put in racier language, but the language that is used here is very clear and is no more and no less than is required to convey very clearly what we want to convey to the members of the Garda force, to people in custody and people who act on behalf of people in custody.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to follow Senator O'Leary in other remarks that he made which have more to do with the Criminal Justice Act than with these regulations themselves.  I take his point about his own feelings about the Criminal Justice Act. I do not share those and this is not the first <Col N="1541" /> time I have said that to Senator O'Leary. There is a very clear injunction on me in the Criminal Justice Act to put forward these regulations.  I think the tenor of the debate in this House, as indeed elsewhere, has been that the regulations cover what we require to be covered in as reasonable, direct and forceful a way as we require.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is simply to seek clarification of the new section 15 (1) (a) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as inserted by section 1 (1) of this Bill.  That provides that:</P>
      <P>Whenever a debt is due on foot of a judgment, order or decree of a competent court by a person (in this Part of this Act referred to as &ldquo;the debtor&rdquo;) to another person (in this Part of this Act referred to as &ldquo;the creditor&rdquo;) the creditor may avail of the facilities of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is simply to seek clarification as to whether the <Col N="1542" /> word &ldquo;person&rdquo; excludes or includes a limited liability company.  A debt may be due to a limited liability company.  Am I right in saying that the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts are only available to individuals and are not available to a limited liability company?  If they are available to a limited liability company as creditor should that not be inserted in this section?</P>

      <P>The Enforcement of Court Orders Act provisions are designed, as I said on Committee Stage, to apply to natural persons and not to companies.  The law as it stands makes quite separate provision as to the manner in which debts may be enforced against a company, and separately for the appointment of a receiver and the liquidation of the company in cases where that is appropriate.  The statute in question here is specifically designed in relation to natural persons.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which was raised on Committee Stage.  We did not have the benefit of Senator Durcan at that Stage, and it is good to have him now.  I see the point that Senator Durcan is making about this matter.  What is proposed to be introduced is a new section, <Col N="1543" /> Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926. It refers to &ldquo;where a debt is due by a person to another person...&rdquo; That person, in my opinion, is subject to statutory definition.  That person, being the creditor includes a company unless it is excluded.  That was the way I interpreted it, that the person being the creditor, is a person in the way in which persons are normally used by a Parliamentary Draftsman to include a company.  I may be wrong in that.  That was my interpretation of it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 12, after &ldquo;place&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a true copy thereof shall be served on the creditor or his solicitor within the said period of time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is simply to extend somewhat the scope of the new section 15 (1) (4) of the 1926 Act.  The subsection as drafted reads:</P>
      <P>The statement of means shall, not less than one week before the sitting of the District Court in which the examination is to take place, be lodged with the District CourtClerk for the District Court Area wherein the debtor's examination is to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> The purpose of this amendment is to give the creditor an opportunity of considering the means and the calculations of means which the debtor relies on.  If this is not done and if the creditor does not have the opportunity, before coming into court, of considering the means which the debtor relies on, if the creditor does not have the opportunity of investigating those means, than the creditor may very well have to seek an adjournment.  My understanding of this entire new section was that it was an attempt to speed up the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.  If my amendment is not accepted, then the motive behind this section, as I see it, will be circumvented.  If the creditor does not have the opportunity of knowing what the means of the debtor are, then he will have to investigate and that takes time.</P>
    <P>The provision in subsection (5) to the effect that the creditor should be entitled on the payment of the prescribed fee, to inspect and take or obtain copies of the statement of means, when lodged, does not get over the difficulty either.  To suggest that it does get over the difficulty means that the creditor or his solicitor would have to, before court go to the office of the District Court Clerk and ascertain whether a statement of means had been filed or not.  A statement of means may have been filed or a statement of means may not have been filed.  As the Bill stands the onus is now on the creditor, before the court hearing and within a time span of seven days, to go to the District Court Clerk's office and to obtain a copy of something that may or may not be there.  That is time-consuming from the point of view of the District Court Clerk's office, where there are already staffing difficulties and where there is already a considerable overwork load.  It is also time-consuming from the point of view of the creditor.  But in terms of the practicality of it, if a court document is filed by one party with a court officer, then a copy of that document should be filed or served on the other side.  If one examines the accepted practice existing in all our courts in relation to the service of documents which contain <Col N="1545" /> information upon which people rely, one finds that a copy is always served on the other side.</P>
    <P>Here we have in this Bill, in a sense an attempt to depart from that practice.  The Minister may say he is not departing from the practice, that the practice does not exist in relation to statements of means procedure, but the whole procedure can be made more meaningful.  The excess work which will be involved can be cut out if the amendment is accepted.  It is an amendment which does not impose any difficulty from the point of view of the courts administration if accepted, other than to ease the burden that they are faced with.  From the point of view of practice in terms of a creditor or the solicitor of a creditor &mdash; and a creditor will generally have a solicitor &mdash; it certainly would make the practical dealing with these applications much easier.  If the amendment I have proposed is not accepted, then it would drag out these proceedings in the District Court.  It will waste time in the Court Clerk's Office; it will waste time in solicitors' offices; it will waste time for creditors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the purpose of section 1 here is to simplify the preliminary procedure for the enforcement of a judgment debt.  It simplifies it in this case as proposed here, by eliminating a separate hearing that under section 15 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, as it stands, must be held so that an order can be made for the attendance of a debtor so that he may be examined as to his means and also to order a lodgment by him of a statement of means.  We are eliminating a hearing and simplifying it. As things stand at the moment, the debtor has no notice of the proceedings under section 15 as it stands; he does not appear in those proceedings.  He is not heard at the hearing that is being dispensed with.  Therefore we are eliminating <Col N="1546" /> that step.  In a way that does not alter the balance between the debtor and the creditor.  The amendments which have been put forward would alter the balance between the debtor and the creditor and would therefore go further than the straightforward simplification of a procedure, which is the intent of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 15, after &ldquo;was&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in section 4 (3) of the Bill.  This is the subsection which creates an offence where a licensee for the purpose of renewing his licence under the new procedure furnishes false or misleading information.  I believe the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be inserted here by virtue of the nature of this offence, that is, an offence which lies within the administrative capacity of an individual. It is not an offence which relates to the conduct or management of a licensed house.  If the section stands as it is it may arise that information which is false or misleading may be given unintentionally and somebody may be prosecuted on that basis.  Under those circumstances it would be wrong to record the conviction. <Col N="1547" /> For that reason I move this amendment which would suit those particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>I regret to say that I oppose the amendment.  Subsection (3) is designed to cater for a situation where false or misleading information is supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by a person seeking the automatic renewal of his licence under the new procedure which is set out in section 4.  The court will have power to impose a fine not exceeding £300 where a licence is renewed on the basis of such false and misleading information. Under subsection (4) the court would have a discretionary power to order forfeiture where there has been a conviction.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in this subsection would make it virtually unenforceable.  Both Senator Durcan and his seconder will know perfectly well what I mean when I refer to the difficulties that have arisen in other areas with the use of that word.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage of this Bill I accepted the case which was made, that there was a necessity for suitable provisions to deal with powers of <Col N="1549" /> enforcement of District Court orders in relation to the jurisdiction under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, conferred on it by section 15 of the Courts Act, 1981.  I expressed doubts at that stage about the completeness of the approach advocated by Senator O'Leary and Senator McGuinness, which covered only orders made under section 11 of the 1964 Act.  I have discussed the matter with the draftsman and I am proposing an amendment here which would cover the enforcement of orders made by the District Court under the 1964 Act, covering orders under section 7 or section 11 &mdash; that is, containing a direction regarding the custody of an infant or the right of access to an infant &mdash; and orders for maintenance under section 7 (6) or section 11 (2) (b) and any variation order under section 12 in relation to such a maintenance order.  I am putting forward this amendment in order to meet the main substance of the amendment put down in the names of Senator O'Leary and Senator McGuinness.  I hope that the House will find that we have dealt with the matter in an adequate fashion.  I am glad to be able to say that I take fully the point that underlaid the amendment originally proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 is proposed following a long discussion which we had here at Committee Stage about <Col N="1551" /> the situation in relation to endorsable offences and the consequences that can follow in relation to such endorsable offences.</P>
      <P>An amendment was put forward by Senators Howard, Durcan and Cregan at Committee Stage to deal with their concern in this regard.  I have to say, as I indicated at Committee Stage, that I was very impressed by the arguments put forward by the Senators who spoke on that amendment &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;impressed&rdquo; as much in its physical sense as in its intellectual sense.  Great emphasis was placed, quite rightly, on the severity of the present provision.  It was pointed out that a liquor licence may be forfeited because of offences relating to prohibited hours on occasions when the licence holder, in spite of his best efforts, may not be able to clear his premises before the end of permitted hours.</P>
      <P>I have thought very long and deeply about the arguments put forward at Committee Stage and I have decided to accept the principle of the amendment.  But I would consider that its effects should be confined to offences relating to prohibited hours.  Apart from anything else, that was the context in which the amendment was first put forward and that is the central concern which has to be met.  That matter is covered in amendment No. 7. This proposes that on conviction of an offence relating to prohibited hours, the District Court will have discretion as to whether or not to endorse the conviction of the licence.  There is already provision in section 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, under which an appeal lies to the Circuit Court against conviction of an endorsable offence.  In view of the discretion as to endorsement now proposed to be given to the District Court I consider that it would be appropriate to give a corresponding discretion to the Circuit Court when conviction of the offence comes before that court on appeal. That is the reason for amendment No. 8, which makes the corresponding provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 9, which also relates to endorsements, has been submitted <Col N="1552" /> by Senators Durcan and Howard.  It is similar to the amendment which they put forward at Committee Stage and I think, if I may say so without offending the Senators, that amendments Nos. 7 and 8 which I have put forward deal more specifically and clearly with the concern we discussed at Committee Stage.  I would hope, therefore, that amendment No. 9 could be withdrawn in favour of amendments Nos. 7 and 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin by saying that Senator Durcan and I willingly agree to withdraw amendment No. 9?  I very willingly accept the Minister's amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  He has told us what the effect of both these amendments will be, that they meet in large part &mdash; almost in its entirety &mdash; the spirit of our amendment No. 9.  That is, they have the effect, in No. 7, of restoring discretion to the District Court, and in No. 8 of extending that discretion also to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I want to sincerely thank the Minister for having met our case in such a straightforward manner.  I would like to compliment him on three specific points.  First, I thank him for responding so positively to the Seanad debate at Committee Stage on 27 May.  Secondly, I thank him for recognising that a need existed to rectify and to eliminate what was an unreasonable penalty.  Thirdly, I thank him for acting to restore justice in what is a very sensitive area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might very briefly outline the effects of the Minister's amendment.  Heretofore, the position was that a publican having people on his premises outside specified times could be summoned and could be brought to court, and if convicted there would obtain an automatic endorsement on his licence.  Three such endorsements led to automatic forfeiture.  The District Court and, indeed, the Circuit Court had no discretion.  After the District Court virtually no appeal existed once the offence was proved.  The particularly savage aspect of the penalty was that once a licence was forfeited neither the house to which it applied nor the person who held that licence could again <Col N="1553" /> obtain one.  Therefore, we had the situation where a lifetime spent in building up a business could lie in ruins, and the hardship consequent on that could, in fact, involve a family.  That position has existed from 1960.  A number of licences have been lost in the past 26 years.  A number of others are presently at risk. As a result of the Minister's decision now, the position will that a publican can be summonsed, convicted and fined.  He can also have his licence endorsed if the court thinks that the nature of the offence deserves such a penalty.  Three endorsements will still lead to forfeiture but that can only happen if a publican is obviously, consistently and regularly abusing the law.  I can say that where these circumstances prevail forfeiture could, indeed, be deserved.  The important thing is that the courts will have discretion.  I am sure they will bear in mind the circumstances and the events that relate to or surround the particular offence.  I am sure they will also have regard to the record and the character of the publican when deciding whether, in relation to a particular offence, that an endorsement is justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put in the additional safety factor there of permitting appeal to the Circuit Court which, as he says, will also have discretion in relation to imposing an endorsement.</P>
    <P>I wish to make two other brief points. The first one is that during the nine years I have been in this House I have attempted to persuade five of the Minister's predecessors of the need and the desirability of taking the step he has now taken.  All I want to say is that if success can be measured by results, full credit must go to the Minister for Justice, who is with us here this evening.  He has been a short time in this particular office but he has faced up to the situation and despite many other pressing matters decided that the wrong which existed had to be put right.  He has done that.  The other aspect &mdash; and I commented on it briefly on the last occasion when we discussed this &mdash; relates to, perhaps, the capacity and the integrity of this House to influence legislation. Many of us feel with justification <Col N="1554" /> that we are unfairly attacked and villified on many occasions.  The sum total of a lot of the criticism that is levelled at this House is that it is not a very worthwhile institution and that it can have little or no effect on legislation.  The acceptance by the Minister of the point of view that was so forcibly put forward here a months ago is proof that this House has the capacity to fulfil its constitutional role. The livelihoods, the living and the security of 11,000 publican families in this country were at serious risk until the Minister moved his amendments here this evening.  The risk to these people was recognised in this Chamber.  The commitment of the Members of this House, plus the action of a fair minded Minister, has corrected this wrong.</P>
    <P>The final observation I want to make in relation to this particular result is this: it is well known that three Government backbenchers signed the original amendment. Its intent is similar to what the Minister has now brought forward.  Our purpose was to right a wrong there.  Our purpose was, through having that amendment on the Order Paper, to persuade the Minister that justice required that he would respond in a positive manner to what we were proposing.  I am quite sure that people from other parties in the House would also have willingly signed. We were three Government backbenchers there.  We put forward that proposal with no embarrassment to us or to the Government.  The Minister listened to the debate here.  He saw the validity of our case and that there was support from all sides for it.  He has acted in response to the honest arguments put forward here.  The outcome is a credit to the Members of this House who supported the idea and to the Minister who responded so magnificently.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that, as is well known, I am here on a vocational nomination from a body representative of public opinion.  I represent the views, the feelings and the expectations of 11,000 publicans throughout the country. I feel I can with justification convey to the Minister and to the House the satisfaction and thanks from all of these on the result <Col N="1555" /> that has been achieved from the Minister's amendments.</P>

      <P>As the co-sponsor with Senator Howard I concur with him in withdrawing the amendment.  In doing so I, too, would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Minister for his willingness to take on board the idea we enunciated here both at Second Stage and again at Committee Stage.  We appreciate very much the fact that the Minister has taken the principle on board and that it now becomes part of the already complex licensing code.</P>
      <P>Back in March 1985 I signed, with Senator Cregan and Senator Howard, a Private Members' Bill which, if circulated and published, would have had the effect of what we are trying to do.  It was a Private Members' Bill which contained provisions very similar to the provision which we put forward at Committee Stage and again at Report Stage.  The fact, Minister, that you have agreed the principle underlying that is something which is appreciated.  As Senator Howard said, the existing law contained a Draconian measure in so far as licensees were concerned.  It certainly was unreasonable that a District Court had no power and no control over a sanction which could have very far-reaching effects.  It was a sanction which could prevent an individual from ever again holding a licence and a sanction which could prevent a particular house being licensed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that both our District and Circuit Courts have discretion in that regard.  I cannot disagree or quibble with the limitation imposed by the Minister to the effect that the discretion would only operate in relation to after hours offences.  It is wise that our courts should have this type of discretion. Our district justices and our Circuit Court judges have a grasp and a knowledge of a particular area and, indeed, have a grasp and a knowledge of people in a particular area.  I believe it is right that this discretion should be conferred on them in relation to licensing matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Howard has said we have <Col N="1556" /> seen in the past many individuals lose their licences.  We have seen the trauma and the effect it can have on somebody who has built up a substantial business over a great number of years.  This amendment is reasonable.  It is one which can be implemented in a reasonable way by giving discretion to the courts, while at the same time giving the courts the power to apply the ultimate sanction if they so wish.  I join with Senator Howard in thanking the Minister for withdrawing amendment No. 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I briefly join with the other Members in dealing with this amendment. Publicans throughout the country have invested huge amounts of money in buying property, on extensive renovations, in building up their trade and working for their families.  After all that, the situation has been that the publican's licence will be forfeited for a few minor offences over which he has little control. Customers nowadays tend to go to the licensed premises late in the night.  It has been a feature of life in public houses over the years that there will always be some customers who will be difficult to get off the premises.  Once a licence is lost neither the publican nor the premises can ever be licensed again.  The position up to now has been that the justice has no discretion, once he convicts a publican he must endorse the licence.</P>
      <P>This is an important and welcome change.  The important thing now is that the courts have discretion.  This change must be seen and welcomed by all publicans as something which they have been anxious to achieve over the years.  I would like to thank the Minister and congratulate him for examining this serious problem and for coming back, not fully, but very nearly, with what most of the Members of this House were trying to achieve.</P>

Like Senator Howard, I congratulate the <Col N="1557" /> Minister on his work during the short period of time he has been in this office. The Minister is very conscious of what is going on.  We are very proud that this has been done in this House rather than in the other House.  The impression that this House is only here for its own good is not true.  I would hope that from this we can proceed further.  We do not like the idea of people drinking after hours.  It is very much appreciated that the Minister has recognised this.  I would like to thank the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <P>I will reply briefly to the remarks that have been made.  I am not going to rehearse the argument again.  It has been very clearly set out.  The fact remains that this is an important change we are making.  It is important from several points of view.</P>
      <P>At the slight risk of being disorderly, I want to refer briefly to the fact that I intend to bring forward in the autumn a further Bill concerning liquor licensing which will deal with some of the other concerns which I know are shared by this House.  Those measures, together with what is here today, will themselves constitute a fairly significant change in the corpus of the licensing laws.  For that reason this House should agree with me. I strongly recommend to the House &mdash; and it is my intention to follow up on this &mdash; that we should look at the operation of the provision that we are now discussing after a period of, say, three years in order to see what the effect of it has been in the context of the other changes to be made in the licensing laws over that period.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the changes that were made in section 1 in the other House.  There is a later amendment in the name of Senator Durcan.  One of the changes which struck me as being of particular significance is that specific references to the Garda Síochána (Discipline Regulations) 1971 have been deleted from section 1.  The definition of breach of discipline has been changed.  Previously a breach of discipline was defined as meaning an act or omission standing specified for the time being as such in the regulations or in any of the other regulations made under section 14 of the Act of 1925.  I understood that to mean that all breaches of discipline in respect of regulations made under the Act of 1925, which included the 1961 regulations, were all covered by this complaints procedure and by the definition of breach of discipline.  That has now been changed to include only those items specified in the Fourth Schedule. The Fourth Schedule is only a limited list of items.  Would the Minister like to comment on that point?  Did it refer to all breaches of discipline at one stage and is it now confined only to those in the Fourth Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>A breach of discipline is defined to mean either conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule and all types of conduct specified there, non-compliance with a direction to furnish information in accordance with section 7 subsection (9), and a conviction by a court for an offence which was the subject of a complaint to the board.  As Senator O'Leary has pointed out, the Fourth Schedule was added to the Bill by way of a Committee Stage amendment in the other House. An admissible complaint is now defined by reference to that Schedule in section 4 (3) (a) (iii).  Up to now a breach of <Col N="1561" /> discipline was defined by reference to the Garda discipline regulations of 1971.  The new approach, which is adopted in the Bill as now before us, has a number of advantages.  It makes for easy reference since a member of the public or anybody acting on his behalf, or somebody advising him, will get all the relevant information in the Bill.  He does not have to look any further than the Bill for the information.  It also makes it possible to exclude certain breaches of discipline which are of purely internal concern to the force, for example, disobedience of orders which are now covered by the Schedule to the 1971 discipline regulations.</P>
      <P>Another important feature of the new definition is that the definition itself, and not the Fourth Schedule, includes the existing disciplinary offence of a conviction by a court for an offence.  That change in itself has two effects.  A member of the public cannot now complain to the board about a conviction per se but the board will have power to deal with the issue of a member's continued suitability for retention in the force when a complaint has been originally made to the board and the subsequent investigation leads to a criminal conviction.</P>

      <P>I would like to follow up on the point Senator O'Leary has just raised in relation to breaches of the regulations applicable when persons are in Garda custody.  If there is a breach of these regulations &mdash; and this is a point I raised when we were discussing the regulations earlier &mdash; will the affected person, if he makes a complaint, have that complaint dealt with under this Bill or will he have the complaint dealt with under the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations, 1971, or under the new regulations which are to supersede them in due course?  It seems to me that the only section of the Fourth Schedule of this Bill which would be applicable is paragraph 4.  That is the paragraph which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Abuse of authority, that is to say, oppressive conduct towards a member of the public including (a) or (b).</P>
      <P>It would appear to me that a member could be in breach of the regulations that we discussed earlier.  The member might not be guilty of oppressive conduct towards a member of the public.  I am a little worried as to whether we should write into the Fourth Schedule of this Bill specifically &ldquo;a breach of the regulations governing persons in Garda custody&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Senator Durcan to have a look at the rest of the Fourth Schedule.  The Fourth Schedule defines the breaches of discipline.  Number 1 is discourtesy, that is to say, failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public.  Everybody is a member of the public.  Number 2 is neglect of duty, that is to say without good and sufficient cause failing promptly to do anything which it is his duty as a member to do.  The regulations we discussed earlier lay certain obligations on <Col N="1563" /> members of the force and it becomes their duty to do those things and in the manner they are described.  If they fail to do those things or fail to do them in the manner they are described it is a breach of discipline.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where a complaint has been made orally it shall be the duty of the Chief Executive Officer to provide, from the information sent to the Board, a summary of the complaint to the person who has made the complaint. No further action shall be taken on the complaint until the summary is acknowledged as accurate by the signature or mark of the person making the complaint.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 deals with complaints to the board and obviously establishes in a quite detailed way the manner in which these complaints are to be dealt with.  It lays <Col N="1564" /> down various statutory limits and that sort of thing.  We can discuss them later. The main thrust of my amendment is to ensure that in all cases there will be a written document available which will be accepted by the person making the complaint as being the document and the substance of that complaint.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring complete certainty into what is being investigated.  I think we owe it to the members of the Garda Síochána in respect of whom complaints will be made.  A complaint being made in respect of the Garda will be a most serious matter.  It will have the most serious consequences, and consequences which will certainly have a far reaching effect on the member's life and future prospects and good name.  For that reason while the general system in the Bill is very tortuous and very complicated, I can understand the reason people sought to bring about such a carefully documented procedure. I think the least we owe to the people against whom complaints will be made is to ensure that they will always be reduced to writing.  The Minister quite rightly envisages that some complaints may be made orally or verbally.  I think that is quite right.  It is right and proper.  I think, of course, it will be preferable where a person commits the complaint to writing but, of course, we have to legislate also for those people who cannot write or who, for one reason or another, are not in a position to commit themselves to paper.  I think in those cases, and recognising that the Minister has a duty to provide for those people and to have their complaints catered for, it is important that these oral complaints would be reduced to writing as is envisaged in the Act.  Having been reduced to writing in the Act as is suggested &mdash; reduced to writing by the person who is receiving the complaint &mdash; I want to make sure that nobody is under any misapprehension that that is the correct summary of the complaint and that the complaint does not go ahead on the basis of what is subsequently alleged to be an inaccurate summary of the complaint that was made. Everybody, even those who cannot write, <Col N="1565" /> must ultimately be faced with the position that their complaint has been reduced to writing and they must acknowledge it. They must say: yes, that is what I am complaining about.  If they are not satisfied with the result of the investigation afterwards they cannot say the reason they are not satisfied is that &ldquo;the garda who took down my complaint only took down half of it and in addition to getting a beating around the head, I also got a kick in the ass&rdquo; or whatever the additional ground of complaint would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and hope it will get adequate hearing in the time available to us.  I sincerely hope that no effort is being made to rush this Bill through.  I am glad the Minister took the trouble to go into detail in her presentation of the Bill here last week.</P>
      <P>The danger of pollution occupies all our minds.  In all areas of life today our great fear is that whatever product we are using will affect, to some extent, amenities or other products which are there for our use and enjoyment.  I must comment on the efforts now being made by the Minister for the Environment to clean up the countryside.  Many of us in this House and in the other House have been emphasising the need for such efforts for a number of years.  Some local authorities made little effort while others made a great effort to clean up their areas and make them less objectionable for these who have to live in or pass through them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's efforts will assist in some way with regard to lowering the amount of air pollution.  This Bill is intended specifically to deal with the <Col N="1566" /> problem of air pollution which, thank God, we have had very little of to date, but who knows what the future holds in that regard?  Here I would sound a note of warning for fear that the present Minister or indeed any future holder of the office would rush into measures unnecessarily. It is one matter to be prepared for something that might happen but it is another to jump ahead of the happening and take measures that might prove to be unnecessary and which might cause hardship.  I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>First, I will deal with the built-up areas of Cork and Limerick, the larger towns and, of course, my own city of Dublin. Much can be done to reduce the amount of air pollution in and around Dublin which is probably the area most likely to have a rise in air pollution in the future. We have not paid sufficient attention over the years to this problem and I regret that Dublin has never examined the possibility of an underground system of transport. If we had an underground system it would make a major contribution to cleaner air around our streets and in and around our houses.  The greatest problem with air pollution is not from our houses or from industry but from the traffic on the streets.  If there was an underground transport system in the city, not only would it help improve the traffic problems but it would also help in having cleaner air.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to be too critical of a public body who give to the best of their ability, a public service.  I refer to CIE but I have to fault them in their contribution to air pollution.  I do not have to illustrate to anyone in this House the amount of pollution one can witness coming from the exhausts of buses when stopped at traffic lights or in traffic.  Of course, other vehicles also make a contribution to this and steps have been taken in the recent past to reduce the amount of pollution from vehicles run on petrol. I had occasion last winter to leave this House at approximately 8 p.m. and go to St. Stephen's Green to wait for a bus to Terenure.  I could not get away from St. Stephen's Green quickly enough.  It is not the worst location in the city to be <Col N="1567" /> standing at a bus stop nor is 8 p.m.  the worst time but it was as bad a polluting air as I would ever want to witness.  If there were buildings on the other side of the street it would have been even worse.</P>
    <P>I regret having to say that CIE have made very little effort to reduce the pollution coming from buses.  A number of taxis also contribute to air pollution. While the majority of taxis are well run and serviced, some vehicles are run down to such an extent that they give off pollution into the air.  The people of Dublin deserve better than that.</P>
    <P>The rapid rail system from Bray to Howth has made a contribution to reducing air pollution.  I regret that we have not made greater progress with regard to the provision of a similar rapid rail system from Tallaght to the city centre.  If we are to have an extension of the rapid rail system, Tallaght has been ear marked.  It has been investigated and CIE have issued a lengthy report.  They have indicated that they would be prepared to go ahead with this development if the finance was made available.  I urge the Minister to make this finance available. It has been pointed out in other reports that it would be uneconomic to extend the rapid rail system because the one now in operation operates through the most densely populated area.  To extend the service to the county, where the density of population is far less than on the eastern side of the city, would be uneconomical. I am not saying that such a rail system should pay.  If it is possible it should but are we to measure the economics of it in that way?</P>
    <P>If it made a major contribution towards reducing air pollution, consideration should be given to providing such a system even if it meant subsidising it.  If air pollution increases it will cost money to eliminate it.  A recommendation has been made to make the polluter pay.  I am in favour of that but it is not always possible.  Where there is a combination of factors polluting the air, it would be very difficult to apportion the amount of <Col N="1568" /> money one should pay towards eliminating that pollution.  I do not regard air pollution here as a serious problem because of our low density housing and the spread and nature of our industry. With a little care we will never reach the limits laid down by the EC.</P>
    <P>No attention has been give to the development of open spaces or spaces available within built up areas where trees could be planted.  Attention should be given to the type of trees planted in such areas.  Other countries such as France and Germany, give particular attention not only to the quantity of trees planted and where they are planted, but also the type of tree they plant.  Trees can reduce air pollution and indeed reduce noise.  We do not pay enough attention to this kind of development.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in recent times air pollution in my own area, Tallaght, has decreased.  I received a report today where the EC limit of 250 microgrammes per cubic metre for smoke is determined in two ways: if the returns show readings in excess of 250 microgrammes or more on more than three consecutive days or if the returns are in excess of 250 microgrammes on more than 2 per cent of the days sampled in any year ending 31 March, the year April to March being the standard year for the purpose of this calculation throughout the EC.  It is worth noting that the annual average in the Tallaght area shows no pattern and, in fact, decreased in 1985-86, having increased in 1984-85 as against 1983-84.  The factors contributing to this decrease should be examined.  Is it as a result of the fall-off in industry?  It cannot be said that the people in the area have burned less fuel as there are far more houses occupied in Tallaght this year than there was in the years when air pollution increased.  Despite the increase in house occupation, the smoke volumes in the area have decreased.</P>
    <P>I am fearful that the powers that would be given to local authorities would enable them to take unnecessary action.  I cannot find anything in the Bill to prevent a local authority, on the advice of an engineer, <Col N="1569" /> from taking action where it is not necessary. The Minister should hold a rein at all times on the actions to be taken by the various local authorities.  While we all have great faith in our professional staff and in the collective action of local authorities, it sometimes happens that a pressure group in an area would draw attention to a problem, in this instance air pollution, and could influence, say, an engineer or those who are responsible for monitoring air pollution.  They in turn would report to the local authority and outline action that would be necessary, in their view, but which might prove to be totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>There is great fear among the manufacturers of fireplaces and the suppliers of fuels for open fires that action may be taken in the future.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that whatever powers are given to local authorities, this kind of action will only be taken if necessary. There is a high labour content involved in the provision of fireplaces and fuels for open fires.</P>
    <P>It has not been proved to any great extent that there has been an increase in air pollution.  The reverse is the case especially in Tallaght where we have had an increase in population and in house occupancy.  Despite this the air pollution for last year, when we had one of the worst winters as far as burning fuel is concerned, has decreased.  If open fires make a significant contribution to the polluting of air that should have happened in Tallaght.  As is outlined in the report, there has been a decrease in pollution in that area.  The Minister should allay the fears of those engaged in house building and say, that no action will be taken irresponsibly.  He should tighten up the regulations within the Bill to ensure that no crazy nut will put before a local authority a report which would be so convincing as to have that local authority take measures that are not necessary.  It should be borne in mind that if such an action were taken, a lot of hardship would be caused to many families who rely for heat on open fires.</P>
    <P>A few years ago we attempted to build <Col N="1570" /> houses without open fireplaces for whatever reason &mdash; perhaps to save the housewife from dirtying her hands, or indeed the husband for that matter, when cleaning out the fireplace &mdash; but that was a mistake.  Hundreds of houses in the Dublin area were built without fireplaces. It was discovered later that the people could not live in them.  An open fireplace is not only desirable but is necessary to give adequate ventilation.</P>
    <P>There are bodies who lobby to try to convince people that air pollution is getting out of hand.  Of course we all want to keep the air clean and ensure that the air we breathe does not contain pollutants. We want to have as healthy and as long a life as possible.  Unfortunately we get pressure groups who are well intentioned but who, perhaps as a result of reading articles in newspapers &mdash; I do not have to elaborate on how newspapers can escalate these items in telling us that certain things are going certain ways and when the poll is taken it goes directly the other way &mdash; get hysterical about something that might never happen.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not take action to have a smoke-free zone where it is unnecessary.  They are in existence in other countries where the density of population is far greater.  I hope we never get to a stage where we have to ask a family to close up their fireplace or to buy a house that has not an open fireplace within it.  As a public representative for Dublin south and Dublin south-west, I have had my fill so far as houses built without open fires are concerned.  I do not want ever again to see houses being built like that.  I say this because of the discomfort the lack of a fireplace causes to a family, in terms of dampness and so on.  Many of these families living in the Dublin area, who are living from week to week, pay for their fuel as they have been paying for it for years, that is, on a weekly basis.  If we force them to use other means of heating their homes, by oil or gas, for instance, where they would receive monthly or quarterly bills, they will never forgive us for it.  Many of them could not rise to that.  Every care should <Col N="1571" /> be taken to ensure, not only that the air of the country and city is pure, but that we do not come down on the housewife, the householder or the family living within the city or indeed in the sprawling suburbs in a way that would be unfair to them.</P>
    <P>It can be suggested that there is a direct relationship between air quality and industrialisation. It might be no harm to go further into the monitoring of the air in my own area where, despite a reduction in industry, and an increase in the population we have had a reduction in air pollution.</P>
    <P>I would like to see &mdash; and this has been suggested in the Bill &mdash; that there would be three year reviews.  I hope that whatever regulations are laid down in this Bill will be reviewed from time to time by the Government because if we arrive at the situation where a local authority are being pressurised by some group, however well intentioned, there is a likelihood that action might be taken causing some severe hardship on some citizens that would be proved to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is intended to finish this Bill in this session, but I hope not.  I hope that many other Senators who are prepared to make a contribution will be given the opportunity to do so and that adequate consideration will be given to all aspects of the Bill.  There are a number of other items which I would hope to deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope that when enacted this Bill will leave us prepared to meet any EC directive, though I do not believe that we will ever be at the stage where these directives can be called in.  If we take reasonable action now pollution of the air here should not rise to such an extent that we would be looking at these EC directives. Hopefully, we will be looked upon as one of the cleaner air countries.  We have a golden opportunity to take reasonable measures to ensure that our air remains as clean as it is.  We do not have any near neighbours with heavy industries.  There is no activity near our shores or our boundaries, as might be the case in other countries in Europe, that we might fear. <Col N="1572" /> We are in an adequate position to protect our air, to ensure that we never have a serious problem and that consequently there will be no need to get excited about the whole matter of air cleanliness.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the acid rain problem.  We have a report in that regard before us.  Again I do not see any reason for getting excited about this problem either because to date we have not had acid rain to any great extent.  If it was there at all, it was scarcely noticeable. Unlike other continental countries, we need not have any great fear on that score.  However, I am glad to see the report and to note its warnings so that we can give some attention to this question and be prepared for acid rain should it ever come our way.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Bill which I hope to deal with at a later stage but I will and on the note of thanking God for the clear air we have and by urging all concerned to approach this problem with a reasonable attitude to ensure that should the unforeseen happen, we will be prepared for it.  In the meantime, let us not lose our cool or cause any unnecessary hardship to any section of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give some attention to the hard words I have had to say about CIE because I will be repeating them on another appropriate occasion.  I hope that some corrective action will be taken by CIE in this matter of pollution because I believe they are today the greatest polluters in the city of Dublin.  I regret to have to say that but it is my honest opinion and it is a conclusion that I have not reached lightly.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for the Environment will give some consideration to providing an extension to the rapid rail system and give us that line to Tallaght which would help in giving us clearer air.  I hope the Minister will give some attention also to giving us an underground. Many people may say that Dublin is too small for an underground, but there are smaller cities in Europe with undergrounds.  Oslo is one that comes to mind.  An underground system has been recently installed there.  I would see an <Col N="1573" /> underground here as making a major contribution. If we can sort out the traffic problem then it will be easy enough to deal with pollution from domestic sources and from industry.</P>
    <P>Having said all that I would be prepared to admit that there are some people in the industrial area &mdash; some cowboys whom I am not going to mention here, but they are quite well known to those who are interested &mdash; who have been moving from one site to another salvaging material which has been encased in plastic or rubber.  These people work indiscriminately from one area to another.  As the local authorities make chase or threaten to take them to court they pretend they have gone out of the business but merely move on, mostly to the mountain areas, to burn the plastic or rubber off other materials that are encased therein.  They are causing great pollution of the air.</P>
    <P>This kind of operation should be stopped and should be stopped pretty quickly.  The Minister may, of course, say there are regulations whereby it can be stopped but I say they are inoperable. When these people are threatened with prosecution they move on and in a few weeks time they start burning this material in another area.  Ninety-nine per cent of industrialists are responsible people who would be prepared to meet local authority requirements with regard to reducing pollution of the air.  People engaged in the building industry and in the manufacture of fireplaces are reasonable people and would be prepared to meet the local authority or anybody authorised by the Minister to investigate ways and means of reducing pollution caused by smoke, which, in my estimation, is not polluting the air to the extent that some sources have claimed in the past.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take note of my remarks regarding the Tallaght figures and to get those figures from the local authority so that my point can be proved. The vast majority of people engaged in any industry where there may be a risk of pollution are reasonable people and are prepared to take some measures and <Col N="1574" /> go to some expense to ensure that the air is kept clear.  Those people are living here and they want clean air just like the rest of us.  I ask that there be full consultation with all interested parties, manufacturers and indeed with the building industry to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to reduce the pollution in the air.  Without this consultation no severe action would be taken by the Department of the Environment to ensure that a local authority would not take unreasonable action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The world we live in now lends itself to air pollution.  As has been said by the previous speaker, the smoke from our own private dwellings, industrial buildings, power generating stations, the cars we travel the roads of Ireland in and the aeroplanes we travel abroad in are all factors which are causing obvious air pollution.  Clearly it is a problem for us at present and will be for the future.</P>
      <P>The effects of air pollution are well known.  It may cause direct damage to structural metals, surface coatings, fabrics and other materials.  This damage could be in many forms such as weight loss, fading, loss of strength, loss of gloss or cracking.  We have the same situation in relation to agricultural produce.  It is well known that much of our food and crops have been shown in the past to be susceptible to air pollution.  Examples would range from stunting of growth of crops, decrease in size, leaf damage and so on.  The level of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the air which cause health effects on humans is a problem and is well known.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the Bill will confer on local authorities the necessary powers to ensure the protection of air quality in their areas and will confer on the Minister for the Environment power to set standards and issue directions and policy guidelines so as to secure the necessary degree of consistency in implementation throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the role of the local authority is all important in this important Bill.  I assure the Minister that local authorities would welcome proper devolution of powers and the right to be fully involved <Col N="1575" /> in the social and economic development of their areas.  For years, as the Minister knows, the local authorities have been directly, and through their representative associations, urging various Ministers to devolve adequate powers and functions and, of course, finances to local authorities. Various Governments have assured us of their commitment to elevate the powers and the functions of local authorities and elected representatives to a satisfactory level.  Equally, nothing has happened except that more functions have been assigned in recent years but, unfortunately, without the resources to implement them.  Obvious examples of these over the past few years are the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, the Casual Trading Act, 1980, the Litter Act, 1982 and the Animals Bill, 1985.  There have been also numerous EC Directives.  All these pieces of legislation call for the increased involvement of local authorities in carrying out duties and functions in order to make the legislation effective.</P>
    <P>This involvement of local authorities, however, cannot be properly or adequately implemented without the provision of extra resources to local authorities to allow them to provide the services that are expected of them.  It must be noted that this happened not at a time when local authority finances were static but at a time when local authority finances were cut back over all and in real terms.  I am certain local authorities are neither negative nor defeatist.  They must gain the resources in order to carry out their functions.  It is a simple fact of life. It is not sufficient to say that the functions of local authorities are extended in this important Air Pollution Bill without giving them the resources to implement the legislation.  Otherwise, I suggest we are dealing with a mere cosmetic exercise.</P>
    <P>The present legislation confers further powers on local authorities in this important area.  I represent not just one but two local authorities.  The question which could be asked by elected members of local authorities who are being savagely <Col N="1576" /> affected by the restriction on local government finances is where will the resources to implement this proposed Air Pollution Bill come from?  The Explanatory Memorandum gives very little clue as to where the money is coming from because it says:</P>
    <P>Because the Bill is largely a framework for regular action and because the commencement of its sections and their application to different areas is likely to be on a phased basis specific staffing and other cost implications are difficult to estimate at this stage.  The costs arising under the Bill for the Department of the Environment, for local authorities and for anybody exercising functions by reason of section 21 are likely to relate mainly to staffing and monitoring equipment.</P>
    <P>This is very important.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be implemented with due regard to Government policy and public service employment.</P>
    <P>We all know what that means at present in terms of Government policy, the general thrust of the present Government and indeed Governments generally.  That is a factual statement.  The Bill will be implemented with due regard to Government policy on public service employment. Finance is not mentioned in the Bill.  There is an absolute and total lack of financial commitment in the Bill for the work we are expected to do under this Air Pollution Bill.  I and many other members of various local authorities once again ask the Minister to bring forward a proper structure for local authorities and give them the resource to do the job.  It is no longer acceptable for the Minister to say to local authorities that they are free to strike their own rates, to improve their services, when the basis on which these assumptions are made are on a very narrow premise.  Resources have been drastically reduced in recent years. Without increased revenue, services will be extremely limited, if not curtailed entirely.  This will call for positive developments by the Minister to come up with <Col N="1577" /> a blueprint which will give to local authorities both the opportunity to exercise adequate powers and functions and the right to raise their own resources with a guaranteed minimum income in order to adequately develop their own services. Year in year out we are faced with the impossible situation of increasing demands for services, when the revenue to meet such demand is restricted or is not there.  In January 1985 the Minister for the Environment said:</P>
    <P>The need for reorganisation in the local government system has been recognised by successive Governments and the question has been under examination intermittently for several years. The local authority structure has not been changed fundamentally in this century.  In that time there have been major changes in the functions of local authorities and in the social and economic environment in which they operate. The system has not been adapted to those changes for the growth in population and urbanisation.  The Government are embarking on a programme of action to strengthen the system of local government and to extend its functions in matters affecting the welfare of local communities.  This will involve, extensively, reforms in the organisation, functions and financing of local authorities and considerable legislation.</P>
    <P>In the same speech the Minister refers to the fact that farm tax will be passed on to the local authorities and, further on, he refers to the NESC study on local authority financing.  Given that that statement was made by the Minister for the Environment over 18 months ago we know that no fundamental changes have been brought forward which will give to the local authorities adequate sources of funds to carry out the various tasks which are expected of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister may appreciate my concern in this matter when he realises that in my county alone the funds provided from our own resources for road maintenance amount to over £1 million and that <Col N="1578" /> the local authority will need to be provided with almost a further £1 million to maintain the road network to the standard required.  Under the present system this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>There are other examples I can give. With regard to public lighting we require another £50,000 simply to turn on lights which are already erected but which had to be turned off.  A further £630,000 is needed for work under local improvement schemes, provided that the Minister makes these resources available to us in the current year's allocation.  With regard to public conveniences we require an extra £10,000 to meet fully our existing commitments.  With regard to industrial estates we require an extra £40,000 to bring them to a standard which we would like for 1986.  To effectively continue the fight against pollution we estimate another £50,000 is required.  These are a few typical examples.  They could be explained in greater detail.  The same problems exist for every local authority. We are now involved in a clean-up week. We join with the Minister in his campaign to clean up Ireland and we will be as positive as any other local authority in relation to this joint venture.  But again, an extra £50,000 would be very welcome if we were to carry out an overall effective campaign.</P>
    <P>In my county we have a shortfall of £600,000 for existing drainage schemes, as well as £363,000 for the Boyne drainage demand which is now imminent and which is not provided for in our 1986 Estimates.</P>
    <P>What I am relating is typical of every local authority in Ireland.  They can produce figures much worse than those I mentioned.  How can we proceed with a Bill to do a lot of extra work when the finances are not being provided?  I say to the Minister that local authorities cannot continue to ignore figures such as those I have given and their impact on local authorities.  It is a miracle that they have managed to survive and still maintain a reasonable level of services for our people.</P>
    <P>We have reached the end of the road &mdash; literally as well as figuratively because <Col N="1579" /> our road system all over the country is disintegrating at an increasing level.  I do not think we are in a position to take on extra legislation without the proper finance being given to us.  I appeal to the Minister to consider once more the present situation in relation to the functions and the finances of local authorities, to wake up and to realise that if something is not done soon then the present system will collapse very quickly indeed.</P>
    <P>It is my view that until finances are provided we should not proceed with the type of Bill we have before us &mdash; important though it is.  I am not just saying this about this Bill but of other Bills and further legislation which the Government are going to heap on us without proper financing.  It will have to stop.</P>
    <P>It is hoped &mdash; I am reading from the explanatory memorandum &mdash; that this Bill will provide a comprehensive framework to deal with existing and emerging air pollution problems.  I feel that it does not and cannot go the full way, for the reasons I have given, to effectively control air pollution.  What is needed is legislation which firmly directs local authorities, imposes rules and regulations which have to be observed and for which the proper finances are provided from Government.  This is a very vital part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very fortunate generally in this country, especially the great counties of Galway, Kerry and, indeed, Westmeath.  I could mention quite a few more.  The counties I mention do not have a problem of a high incidence of air pollution.  Most of the country is not part of the large urban sprawl.  Air pollution exists to a large degree in Dublin city and county and in the bigger urban areas in other parts of the country. Cork is an obvious centre where there is an air pollution problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is addressed to environmental protection, protection of public health, plant life and buildings.  Let me get to the point quickly, a point which my colleague, Senator McMahon, was making a <Col N="1580" /> few minutes ago.  I do not suggest &mdash; although some commentators in the media and elsewhere may have gone along that road &mdash; that we have a smog problem similar to that which existed in London and Manchester in the fifties which, indeed, have benefited by the introduction of the clean air zones to such an extent that the population in those cities have enjoyed as much as a 75 per cent increase in winter sunshine over the past 30 years.  I do not for a moment suggest that the position in Dublin in the 1980s is in any way comparable to what existed in London in those times.  The Minister said on Second Stage that the most serious breach of daily smoke standards of 250 microgrammes per cubic metre which occurred in 1984-85 involved a figure of 738 microgrammes per cubic metre at one of the monitoring stations.</P>
    <P>This level is clearly unacceptable but in order to put the matter into perspective I should mention that the levels of smog recorded in London in 1952 were of the order of 7,000 to 8,000 microgrammes per cubic metre and the level of 4,500 microgrammes per cubic metre was reached at the London monitoring station in December, 1962.  I am making the point in a general way that the difference between the problem that existed in London in the fifties and what has been prevalent in Dublin in the course of the last year are of two totally different orders, two totally different scales and they are not in any sense to be compared. That, of course, does not mean that we have not got a problem in relation to air quality and the cleanliness of air conditions in many urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the smoke problem that exists in Dublin in recent years has had a very variable pattern.  Smoke declined, as I understand it, in the early seventies to rise by 60 per cent between 1975 and 1980.  Of course, we reached a period in 1981-82 when there was a very serious problem as measured in the City of Dublin.  I quote from a book by John Blackwell and Frank J. Convery from The Resource and Environmental Policy Centre of University College Dublin which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The number of sites exceeding these limit values between 1973/74 to 1981/82 are given in Table 3.3.  The deterioration in air quality is clearly evident in 1981/82 compared to the late 1970s when only one or two sites breached daily limit values.  Eight out of the 13 sites failed to comply with the directive with seven sites recording a daily 98 per cent tile smoke level of more than mg/m³ One such site also exceeded the limit value given for daily sulphur dioxide levels and the annual limit values were breached at two city centre sites.</P>
    <P>The position in 1981-82 was very dramatically different from what had been experienced certainly in the early seventies and largely through the seventies.  Of course, we were dealing with a special situation at that time.  As I understand it, low inversion conditions existed when we had a problem with cold weather and calm wind.  I remember the particular winter we are talking about when we had snow on the ground and, as I say, the calm and cold conditions brought about that disimprovement in air quality.</P>
    <P>In the years since then there has been a continuing variation of air quality.  In the last two years there has been a marked improvement in air quality in the Dublin area and I should like at this point to thank the Chief Environmental Health Officer for the City of Dublin who has gone to great trouble in recent years in not just producing his annual report but going further to analyse month by month the position as between atmospheric smoke and smoke and sulphur dioxide and, of course, going on to look at elements of other air pollution.  The report &mdash; we are talking of the period 1 April 1984 to 31 March 1985 &mdash; attributes 60 per cent of existing smoke levels to domestic services.  That compares with 80 per cent in previous years.  There has been a marked improvement in recent years.</P>
    <P>The report attributes 15 per cent to vehicle emissions and 25 per cent to industrial and commercial sources.  The reason for this is, of course, the advent of natural gas into the Greater Dublin <Col N="1582" /> area which is not just being used by domestic consumers but resources have been taken up by the industry and we are aware that the Guinness concern has been using natural gas recently.  It had a conversion to natural gas.  Estates, like Ballymun in the North city, are now using natural gas. There has been a move in that direction. What the Bill is intended to do is not to immediately set guidelines but to bring to the attention of local authorities the existence of the EC Directive and to enable them to move in on situations where there is a marked deterioration over a period of time in the air quality conditions which those using an area and particularly residents had to put up with.</P>
    <P>This enabling Bill is important.  It is essential that we have this mechanism to deal with areas which have been showing in periods of low inversion a marked deterioration and to be in a position to deal with the problems that arise in those situations.  I do feel &mdash; and this point has been made strongly by the Coal Information Services and, among others, those involved in the manufacture of fireplaces &mdash; that what is important is that when the local authority decide to act they have some scientific basis for their actions, that they do not simply rely on the measurements that are got through the monitoring stations, that they go to some trouble to establish the cause from one area to another of that pollution and deal with it then in an ordered way rather than to expect in an area where there is a problem that the answer is to apply the problem to everyone without isolating where it particularly emanated from.</P>
    <P>It is very important in the period ahead, with enabling powers available to local authorities when this Bill is passed, to ensure that there is a greater use of solid, smokeless fuels using appliances that burn with a lesser element of smoke escaping into the atmosphere.  These solid fuels, it will be suggested, can be expensive and sometimes there is a variation in the availability of such fuels.  There is no doubt about it that appliances are available and are being developed to enable householders to use smoke reducing fuels or to have fuels used in a fire that <Col N="1583" /> would be smoke reducing thus adding another method of trying to control the emission to smoke into the atmosphere. There is a great deal of ingenuity in this area and much attention is being given to what can be achieved in relation to the level of smoke allowed to filter into the atmosphere in some areas of high concentration of residential housing.  I am thinking in particular of areas like Ballyfermot, Cabra and Rathmines in Dublin.</P>
    <P>To run into an area of low inversion one can be frightened by the extent to which the carpet of smoke can be seen by the naked eye.  We need to ensure that those involved in the manufacture of not just fuels but also appliances are given as much assistance as possible to improve the air quality rather than remove from the many thousands that might be involved the availability of the open fire which has its own appeal.  Much research can be encouraged in the future to ensuring that every attempt is made to find the answer to this problem.</P>
    <P>I noticed from the Minister's Second Stage speech that some progress was being made in relation to a problem that was referred to also by Senator McMahon, the problem of emissions from motor vehicles.  The Minister mentioned on Second Stage that regulations to reduce the maximum lead content of petrol from 0.40 to 0.15 grams per litre came into operation on 1 April last giving a reduction of some 60 per cent in lead emissions from motor vehicles.  While that is to be welcomed, it is important to say that the Bill does not contain enough in consideration of the fact that 50 per cent of all city smoke, 12 per cent of sulphur dioxide and most of the city's noise, atmospheric lead and the other pollutants to which I referred cause major emissions into the atmosphere. As I understand it, legislative control in regard to traffic smoke, fumes and noise is contained in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations), 1953.  The Garda are the designated enforcement authority, <Col N="1584" /> not the local authority.  These regulations have not been repealed or updated.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give some indication as to why we are not going for wider powers in relation to emissions from motor vehicles as of now.  This Bill would seem the appropriate time for dealing with it and I would ask that she give a little more elucidation as to why we are not going somewhat further in relation to control in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enabling powers being given to the local authority in this Bill.  I think they are important for the whole environmental quality of large tracts of urban areas particularly in the centre of Dublin.  It may be that Tallaght and other places are safe enough but there are parts of the greater Dublin area which do have problems that need to be faced up to.  I hope they are faced up to based on scientific data and that we will give sufficient time to those involved in the design and redesign of the best form of fuels and equipment to come forward with their suggestions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not before us at a time when there are unlimited resources available, unlike the position in Britain at the time of the introduction of the Clean Air Act there when there was a great deal more resources available to that country, comparatively speaking, than would be the case here.  They did attempt to bring in their Bill at a time when they could act and move towards much greater realisation of their intentions on conversion. Here we have got to move gradually and, of course, this enabling power would only be introduced area by area.  It would not be intended at any stage that any local authority would adopt a clean air zone throughout their local authority area. They would move slowly to identify where the problem is and then ensure that steps are taken to deal with the most hazardous situations while at the same time from this point on giving every encouragement to those whose ability it is to design and those who are involved in the construction area to adopt ways of confronting this problem now.  I do not believe that we should be contemplating building homes that do not attempt to <Col N="1585" /> recognise, especially in the built up areas of Dublin and Cork, that there is a problem and that the form of heating that is used, be it solid fuels or otherwise, is not taken into account in designing the burning equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to make my contribution to this Bill.  It is an important Bill and I am particularly glad that it has been introduced in the Seanad.  It is a Bill to which we can do more justice on Committee Stage.  We will be introducing many amendments at that time.</P>
      <P>Earlier this evening Senator Howard made a very spirited defence of this House.  He spoke very eloquently, as Senator Howard invariably does, about the commitment of the Members of this House.  He was speaking in relation to a very important amendment which the Minister for Justice introduced at the request of the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, in passing, with regard to the criticism of this House and its Members, that we do not have the facilities that we should have when examining Bills of this nature.  Over the last while very important Bills have come before this House.  Anybody who was interested and who wanted to make a meaningful contribution had to spend a considerable amount of time on research in examining those Bills.  With regard to this Bill which requires expertise of a very special kind, which is in the domain of the experts, we are very inhibited in that respect.  It is unfortunate.  I know and realise from personal experience that the research staff which we have in the Library are of great help and are very committed people.  In some areas when reports are ready, unfortunately, typing facilities are not available.  In order to make a meaningful contribution to a Bill of this kind, it is important to be properly briefed, to be familiar with the subject. We have not got that kind of support and it is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is important.  Members or anybody who takes an interest in what I say will know that I do not criticise any Bill for the sake of being critical.  I like to <Col N="1586" /> approach everything on its merits in an objective way.  That is the way I am approaching this Bill.  However, any Bill that comes before the House can be improved and many Bills are improved here.  This one is no exception.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the matters raised by Senator A. FitzGerald which I had intended to raise.  One of them is control of traffic pollution in respect of which there is a very serious defect in the Bill.  On Committee Stage we will be introducing amendments.  This is a very specialised area and it is not easy to frame amendments to cover something which has been omitted.  However, we will have the recess which will give us an opportunity to do more research before we table amendments.</P>
    <P>It is particularly significant and unfortunate that there has been this omission. We know from various reports that there is considerable criticism with regard to emissions from domestic premises, because of low chimneys in areas of high density where there is terraced housing. The emissions in those areas are far above the emissions of traffic pollution.  By and large, they are also confined to very cold winter periods.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic pollution my understanding from the An Foras Forbartha report, Air Quality in Ireland, is that in the Dublin area sulphur dioxide traffic pollution accounts for 3 per cent; transport is responsible for 14 per cent of smoke.  The emissions are just about or below breathing level.  There could be no comparison in my view.  Throughout the year on cold days, hot days, through the winter and summer there are these emissions through the city and particularly in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>While I suppose we do not have the inversion situations in the summer time that Senator A. FitzGerald referred to, nevertheless, we have calm periods. There is this concentration all the time.  In my view, there is a very serious omission from the Bill which should be rectified before the Bill passes this House.  The noise problem could have been dealt with in this Bill.  It may not be easy to consider noise in relation to pollution.  At the same <Col N="1587" /> time, it is an area covered by the Dublin Corporation environmental pollution reports.  We would all like to see a higher standard in this area.  We are very much concerned about the environment and clean air and any matter which interferes with enjoyment of the environment.  We have noise from air traffic, traffic on the roads.  Many people at times have referred to the tourist situation in this country.  By and large, people like to go on holidays to quiet areas.  It is important from that point of view also and from the point of view that noise brings stress into people's lives.  It is unfortunate that noise was not included.  Perhaps, before the Bill is finalised in this House, this deficiency will be made good.  This is an enabling Bill.  It provides no finance, which is very important.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in passing with regard to fires in domestic dwellings that some attempt should have been made many years ago to provide grants and incentives to influence people and convince them that it is in their own interest to provide appliances for the burning of fuel and I regret that this has not been done. It would be a mistake if people were to feel that because we have this legislation on our Statute Book the problem will be brought under control.  There are many areas which I could point out where this is not so.  For example, in the Water Pollution Act, 1977 which was regarded as up-to-date and important legislation at the time, provision was made to give power to local authorities to make water quality management plans for rivers and lakes in their areas and to date I understand that only one such plan has been made.  But, more important, since then we have had greater pollution problems.</P>
    <P>In County Meath we have carried out a very comprehensive survey on overdeveloped rural areas contiguous to the Dublin region.  There is a very serious water pollution problem there as there is in many of the areas surrounding Dublin where there is an overspill from the capital. We have legislation to deal with that. It was considered farseeing at that time <Col N="1588" /> and even now I suppose it has the capacity to deal with the problem if finances were available but apparently finance is not available.  At a time when local authorities have a serious problem in running their day-to-day business this Bill will create further problems for them.  It is a mistake to think that legislation in itself will cure these problems.</P>
    <P>Under the Planning Act of 1963 there is provision to make three preservation orders and I believe that this has not been availed of by Dublin Corporation or throughout the country as a whole.  With regard to listing for preservation of important plasterwork ceilings, for example, Frank McDonald has pointed out that not one order has been made.  Also, with regard to factory regulations, where we have the most comprehensive legislation in Europe I read in the <i>Irish Indepdendent</i> of Monday 23 June 1986 that 29 people were killed at work in the period covering 1983-84 according to a Department of Labour report published that day.  It says that the total number of reported accidents during the same two years was 7,699 while provisional figures for 1985 suggest 18 deaths and 3,573 accidents. That is in a situation where we are supposed to have the most up-to-date legislation in Europe regarding control of factories, building sites and all that area. Clearly, legislation in itself is not enough.</P>
    <P>Education is necessary in this regard. The carrot is far better and far more effective than the stick and in the past a serious mistake was made in not trying to influence people to use stoves or special appliances for domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>We have comprehensive laws dealing with the litter problem but in my estimation the situation is becoming far worse throughout the country.  Only yesterday as I was driving along a lady in a car in front of me travelling at about 40 miles per hour opened the door of her car and threw out a bundle of rubbish &mdash; obviously she wanted to have a very clean car and she did not think any further. That is a sad situation and I am not sure what the answer to it is but it certainly must be long term.  There are more ways of getting people to behave in a socially <Col N="1589" /> acceptable manner than through legislation.</P>
    <P>There should have been a Green Paper to set out the broad parameters of policy. That would have given those who have a vested interest or special interest in that area an opportunity of making representations at that stage.  It is important that people with vested interests get an opportunity to make their case.  They have a right and a duty to do so.  It is unfortunate in a sense that this Bill was sprung on us and that that opportunity was not given. Also, a White Paper should have been produced.  This opportunity was missed also.  On many occasions in the past I have spoken of the benefit of bringing the people with us in whatever we want to do.  It is much easier to do that than to drag people.  We cannot drag people.</P>
    <P>I have misgivings with regard to this Bill, particularly where no money is provided in a situation where money is so scarce and where the local authorities obviously will have to foot the bill.  Home owners will find an escalation of their heating costs.  It is not simply a matter of replacing the open fire with an appliance &mdash; and I am very conscious of the place of the open fire in our culture and tradition. In rural areas particularly the fireside was the focal point.  I grew up in the tradition that a family that had fire and food for the winter &mdash; in other words the clamp of turf and the pit of potatoes &mdash; was very happy, contented and self-sufficient. Even though things have changed in many ways, and unfortunately not always for the better, that tradition dies hard.  The fire has been a great influence in Irish history both for song and story.  People met around the fire and recounted tales of other days and told stories.  Even in the design of present day houses the fireplace is very important.  It is unfortunate that we are coming up against the situation which this Bill attempts to grapple with at a time when through advances in techniques, in science and application, we are reaching a stage where greater efficiency even with the open fireplace is attainable by <Col N="1590" /> restricting flues to a minimum, by providing under-floor ventilation which nowadays in most houses is mandatory at least from the point of view of conservation of heat.  We are reaching a situation of greater efficiency but the whole impetus of the attempt by the Government, through grants and incentives, to provide fireplaces seems to be undermined to a large extent by this Bill.</P>
    <P>When we come to deciding whether we have a serious problem, the position is not as clearcut as I would like it to be. Overall, it seems from the reports by Dublin Corporation and the environment pollution section that we do not have a major problem.  I would like to congratulate Dublin Corporation and Mr. Patrick O'Reilly, the supervising environment health officer, for the standard of those reports which are presented in a very simple and understandable way.</P>
    <P>In considering the pollution problem and in looking through the various treaties, booklets and works dealing with pollution, there are various descriptions used.  I will deal with those later.  For the moment I will deal with the pollution problem as I understand it from the 1984-85 report of Dublin Corporation.  It is also unfortunate when we are dealing with this important Bill on Second Stage that the 1985-86 report is not available.  I hope it will be printed before we reach Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am not clear whether the periodic breaches which are identified &mdash; they are few in number in this report &mdash; are more important than the yearly average figures given in a later section.  In other words, I am saying we can look at two situations, for example, the daily median over a yearly period, and if we compare that with the following year or all the years for which a survey has been carrried out and see that the graph is rising or falling, we can come to a certain conclusion.  If I see that the graph is rising with regard to the number of micrograms per cubic metre I come to a conclusion that there is a deterioration in the position.  We can have that without a breach of EC rules.</P>
    <P>There is the other area, the area which obviously spurred on this legislation and <Col N="1591" /> the area where this problem should have been taken in hand in time.  This legislation would not have been necessary if proper provision had been made and encouragement given to people in problem areas.  If we look at those areas where there were periodic breaches, they are few in number.  Which of those situations is more important?  Is it where we have the periodic breaches or where we are concerned with the daily median?  It seems to me, and I hope I am coming to the correct conclusion, that it is more important that the overall trend should be stabilised or going downwards rather than be unduly influenced by the periodic breaches.  When we look at the graph in that publication by the environmental pollution section in the 1984-1985 report, we see with regard to sulphur dioxide and suspended particulate matter which is smoke, the trend is, by and large, downwards with the exception of a period in 1981-1982 when we had unusual conditions which are unlikely to arise again.</P>
    <P>The trend seems to be totally downwards. The conclusion I would come to from examining this graph over the period 1972-1984 is that we have no serious problem.  In fairness to the Minister she dealt with that in some considerable detail and came to the same conclusion.  I quote from the Minister's introductory speech.  She said:</P>
    <P>For the record, therefore, I should point out that the EEC smoke standards are being breached, not just in parts of Dublin but also in large population centres, in France, Federal Germany and Italy, and Britain and Northern Ireland.  The most serious breach of the daily smoke standard of 250 micrograms per cubic metre which occurred in 1984-1985 involved a figure of 738 micrograms per cubic metre at one of the monitoring stations.  This level is clearly unacceptable but, in order to put it in perspective, I should mention that the levels recorded in the London smog of 1952 were of the order of 7,000 to 8,000 micrograms per cubic <Col N="1592" /> metre and that a level of 4,550 micrograms per cubic metre was reached at a London monitoring station in December, 1962.</P>
    <P>The Minister then stated and I would emphasise what she said:</P>
    <P>Let us therefore, maintain a sense of proportion in discussing the smoke levels in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we would have a sense of proportion.  The graph clearly shows that except for one particular year, we had a downward trend.</P>
    <P>With regard to other breaches, I do not think that these are a great cause for concern.  I will refer briefly to the situation as it is recorded on page 101 of the report.  The values which are quoted are in micrograms per cubic metre.  As I understand it, according to the EC Directive, the year median of daily values is set at 80 if the smoke is greater than 40 and at 120 if the smoke is equal to or less than 40.  The number of stations meeting the value is 14 and the number of stations not meeting the value is none.  In winter &mdash; that is from 1 October to 31 March, &mdash; the median of daily winter values is 130 if the smoke is greater than 60, 180 if the smoke is equal to or less than 60. There are 14 stations and again not one of them breached that standard.  The year 98 per cent dial or daily values is 250 if the smoke is greater than 150; 350 if the smoke is equal to or less than 150.  There are 14 stations and again not one of them exceeded that value.</P>
    <P>That was for smoke and sulphur dioxide. The limit value for smoke only was slightly different.  The year median of daily values is fixed at 80; 14 stations carried out tests over the year and there were no breaches.  In winter period, from October to 31 March, the limit value for smoke is 130 and in the 14 stations there was no breach.  The year 98 per cent dial of daily values is set at 250; eight stations carried out tests and there were six breaches. Again, as I understand it &mdash; and of course I am subject to correction &mdash; this is a particularly strict test where the seven day &mdash; 98 per cent dial refers to <Col N="1593" /> seven days &mdash; do not have to be consecutive; they could be at different times and over an extended period.  Then, with regard to that 250 value it is stated that member states must take all appropriate steps to ensure that this value, that is 250 microgrammes per cubic metre is not exceeded for more than three consecutive days.  Moreover, member states must endeavour to prevent and reduce such incidences in which this value is exceeded.  Of the ten stations four of them exceeded this value and two of these stations breached the value on two occasions.</P>
    <P>Overall, I think that the picture is certainly not alarming.  It is clear that this legislation is a result of the EC Directive and many people would ask is it necessary that the EC should influence legislation at this time when we have so many more important areas to look after; the areas of unemployment, of health and indeed many others that I could mention.  I suppose many people would say that it is a good thing that the EC has this influence at present.</P>
    <P>However, before I leave that area I would like to restate that it appears to me from the picture that is painted by these reports and indeed by the latest report from Dublin Corporation to cover the last month of this winter that the situation is improving all the time.  This report I am considering now is the March 1986 report.  With regard to that report the Coal Information Services have pointed out that the third monthly bulletin on atmospheric pollution issued by Dublin Corporation shows that the March median smoke levels in Dublin are 35.4 per cent lower than in the corresponding period last year.  The figures are based on data obtained at the corporation's official monitoring stations.  The Coal Information Services Report says that the figures confirm the continuing decline in pollution levels in Dublin's air. It is hard to contradict that.  Clearly, that statement is made having regard to the figures and graphs in the latest report.  It is important to remember this.  Smoke levels for the winter period were 60 per <Col N="1594" /> cent below EC limits.  That is a considerable amount having regard to what the Minister has stated in her report.</P>
    <P>The report of the Coal Information Service referred to the reasons for this improvement in the figures &mdash; the spread of the population from the inner city to the suburbs; a wider choice of fuels; the increased availability and usage of smokeless fuels; the development of more efficient fuel burning appliances and their increasingly widespread use.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider all these and in the light of that again it appears to be unfortunate that a serious attempt, or some attempt, was not made a long time back to influence people to use appliances. That opportunity is gone; it is lost now and there is no point in regretting it. Even at this stage I feel that it would be possible to do without this Bill.  In the densely-populated portions of the city where this problem has reached what might be considered serious proportions, if an attempt were made to provide financial help in the form of grants and other ways to people to change over to a system which would use smokeless fuels, this legislation would not be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue here this evening.  I should like also to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, for coming here and listening to what I have to say.  Hopefully, he will be able to offer some useful advice when he replies later on.  I take this opportunity of wishing the Minister every success in his new appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I put down this motion two weeks ago the situation has changed somewhat in that I have been notified by the Minister of State during the week that tenders are being invited.  This is a step in the right <Col N="1595" /> direction and proves that my motion, to a certain extent, has been successful.</P>
    <P>The extension planned for this, the Lavally school, Tuam, County Galway is urgently required.  It is urgently required to allay the frustrations of the teachers, parents and pupils.  It is impossible to teach children in the overcrowded, cramped conditions that obtain at this school. To illustrate the overcrowding I would remind the House that some years ago there were 85 pupils on the rolls and three teachers.  Now there are 155 pupils and five teachers, and no additional accommodation. There are five teachers with 155 pupils and only three classrooms.  The overcrowding has been brought about by the amalgamation of Ardgloragh national school at Lavally.  The parents and teachers of Ardgloragh were given a commitment at that time that proper facilities would be provided at Lavally.  But, unfortunately, to date the Department have not honoured that commitment.</P>
    <P>The extension required, which includes three new classrooms and renovation work to the existing school, has been costed by the Department at £180,000. The board of management were asked to contribute £20,000.  They raised this three years ago through a series of fund raising events in the parish.  This commitment from the parents is an indication of their determination to have the necessary works carried out.  Unfortunately, their determination to have the work carried out has not been matched by the Department.  I would appeal to the Minister today to cut the red tape and proceed with the work immediately.  It is imperative that that should be done now so that work could proceed during the summer holidays.  In that way there would be no further disruption of classes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have a proper playground provided.  I hope that this could be included in the extension plans.  The playground is very wet and occasionally it becomes flooded.  This, coupled with the overcrowded conditions in the school, is not the right environment for children during the most important <Col N="1596" /> years of their lives.  Every public representative in the area has been involved in this project.  We have met the parents, individually and collectively, and the teachers.  They are very concerned and anxious that work should proceed on the extension to this school.</P>
    <P>All the facts are with the Department. All that remains now is that the go ahead be given as soon as possible.  I am confident that the Minister, who understands the problem, will accede to my request and that the work will be put in motion during the summer holidays, if at all possible. In that way there will be very little disruption of the classes at that school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to respond positively on this occasion to Senator Hussey and to thank him for placing his motion on the Seanad agenda.  I have had an interest in Lavally school for some time in that I was trained with the vice-principal there, Master McHugh, and I have had some personal contact with him about the situation.  I have also had numerous representations from the political representatives in Galway.  I was trained there, along with Deputy Kitt, who has been fairly vociferous in this matter also.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to visit Lavally school in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, quite recently.  I met the board of management and teachers there and saw for myself at first hand the very poor conditions under which the students, staff and everybody else concerned have to conduct their business. I was glad, therefore, to be able to formally inform the political people and everybody else concerned in Galway that I had decided to release Lavally school for the invitation of tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say on what precise date in July, 1986 the advertisements will appear in the newspapers but the Senator can take it for granted that that will take place.  I cannot then prejudice what contractors will apply for a tender in this case.  One has to go through the mechanics of the tender process before a contract can be placed.  There is, therefore, no <Col N="1597" /> possibility of the work actually starting this summer.  I have made that perfectly clear to the parents and board of management. The Senator can rest assured that when the tenders have been invited, examined and approved, I will endeavour to place a contract with the chosen contractor at the earliest possible time.  I will, of course, consult with Senator Hussey and his parliamentary colleagues in East Galway about that matter.  This is one of 4,000 schools with which we are dealing <Col N="1598" /> in the Department of Education.  To have reached the step of invitation to tenders is a major advancement indeed.  I trust that there will be no difficulties with the contractors who tender and that the people of Lavally will have, at the earliest opportunity, a school fitting for their needs in an educational sense.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 July 1986.</P>
