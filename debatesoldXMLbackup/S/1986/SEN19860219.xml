      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2 and 5 in that order.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for tea; and, in view of the decision of the House to take the emergency motion of Senator Lanigan concerning Sellafield, the Fine Gael group have generously agreed, after consultation, to defer the continuing debate on their Motion No. 6 until next week.  Next week I will propose that we allow them to have the two hours together instead of spreading it over two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding No. 1, this is a matter of some urgency and, as there are time and date factors involved, I look for the cooperation of the House to get through as much as possible today.  If we get through <Col N="581" /> all the Second Stage, I propose that we take the Committee Stage at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow, if the House agrees.  The Order of Business is 1, 2, 5 and the emergency debate at 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach and the House for acceding to my wish to debate the Sellafield matter.  I feel we are inhibited in this House at times, because we do not have a Question Time and because of the rules of this House, in that we are not allowed to raise matters of urgency.  I am delighted that this debate is being allowed.  If anybody else had intended bringing it up on the Adjournment, I apologise to them for raising it in this manner; but it would have inhibited us in the sense that it would have been only a half-hour debate.  It is something that deserves more than a half-hour and it is the only way we have of bringing this matter forward.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, in regard to the Valuation Bill, I believe we are restricted by a time scale and, given the number of speakers and so on we will accede to the wishes of the Deputy Leader of the House that Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask, in regard to the National Development Corporation Bill, are we going to take only the Second Stage as far as is possible and, if so, is it intended that we would go on to the Second Stage again tomorrow, and when is it intended, if we finish tomorrow on that Bill, to take the Committee Stage?</P>
      <P>The Air Transport Bill and the Air Pollution Bill are two important matters that have to come before us.  Is it intended that these two Bills will take priority over anything else in next week's Order of Business.  They are Bills that we should give a lot of thought to and I feel the House should be notified at this stage if they will be taken next week or put on the long finger.</P>

No doubt, my colleague who is interested in show business will have some excellent singers at the wedding such as the McGuigans and so on.  I suppose we should congratulate him on that initiative.  Without being out of order on the Order of Business, as everybody seems to be in a frivolous mood today, I would like to confirm that it is intended that if the Second Stage of the National Development Corporation Bill is not completed today, we should make an <Col N="583" /> effort to complete it tomorrow after the Committee Stage of the Valuation Bill, 1985.  We hope to have completed Committee Stage and all other Stages of the National Development Corporation Bill next week.  It is an important piece of legislation.  I am trying to hasten it down the road without precluding anybody from contributing on it.  Following that, it would be our intention, having had discussions with the Ministers concerned, that the Air Transport Bill, 1984, would be next in line for discussion by the House.  This legislation has already been passed by Dáil Éireann and I am anxious to clear the air, so to speak before the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I at the outset thank you and indeed my colleagues from all parties in the Seanad for their good wishes on my arrival here today.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to clarify and reinforce some provisions and concepts of rating valuation law in order to protect the valuation base which, as Senators will know, is the most significant source of locally raised revenue for local authorities.</P>
      <P>The principal provision of this Bill, section 7, arises from certain recent interpretations placed by the courts on the application of section 7 of the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1860.  Section 7 of the Act of 1860 stipulates that in valuing any mill, manufactory or other industrial buildings the commissioner of valuation shall not value machinery except such as is used for the production of motive power. With the increasing automation of manufacturing processes, which has blurred the old clear-cut distinction between what is and what is not machinery, there have been more and more frequent attempts made through the courts to have many items of fixed plant, associated with a maufacturing process and which traditionally were liable to valuation, treated as machinery.  Examples of the plant which have been treated as machinery by the courts, and thus declared to be exempt from valuation, are industrial silos and other storage plant, brewery vats and bakery ovens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of the Valuation Acts plant is now defined for the first time in section 1.  Section 7 proposes to amend the Act of 1860 in order to clarify the distinction between plant and machinery and to confirm the traditional practice with regard to the rateability of plant. Section 8 gives a schedule of categories of plant whose rateability has in recent <Col N="585" /> times been called into question, to which section 7 applies.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil it was asserted by some Deputies that what is conventionally known as process plant could be liable to valuation under section 8 of the Bill.  This is not the case.  Such plant, despite its name, is for valuation purposes generally treated as machinery.  However, to allay the fears expressed and in the interests of clarity the Dáil passed an amendment to section 8 which expressly excludes from the valuation code constructions designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in substances.  Senators need have no fears with regard to any extension of the valuation code: what is provided for under this Bill is merely the preservation of the existing valuation base &mdash; it does not add new categories of property to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a similar provision relating to certain types of fixed property, other than plant, which hitherto have been valued in accordance with the Valuation Acts though not specifically referred to in that legislation.  Some of these types of property did not exist or were not of practical significance when the code was established in the last century.  A typical example of such property would be car parks.  These are at present being valued but of course were not specifically referred to in the original valuation legislation which is over 120 years old.  The categories of fixed property involved are listed in the schedule to section 3.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in addition, provides statutory authority for the long estblished practice of fixing valuations of rateable hereditaments by reference to the valuation of similar hereditaments already valued.  This practice is necessary because the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, prescribes that the valuation of buildings shall be based upon an estimate of the net annual letting value.  Letting values have, of course, undergone radical changes in the course of time due particularly to the effects of inflation but, in the absence of a general revaluation, the changes have not been reflected in property valuations generally.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, to prevent distortions <Col N="586" /> and inequities arising as between old and new valuations and to preserve relativities, the practice has been to determine the rateable valuation by reducing the estimated current letting value to a figure consistent with the valuation of comparable properties already rated.  This is referred to as &lsquo;maintaining the tone of the valuation list&rsquo;, that is, it preserves a reasonable relationship between valuations within and between rating areas.  It has been decided to avail of the present Bill to put the practice which has been in operation for a long time on a formal legal basis.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Seanad that the Bill does not represent any change in valuation or rating policy.  It does not seek to extend the type of properties to be valued and rated and it does not change current practice with regard to the method of valuation.  On the contrary, it will merely help to preserve the traditional valuation base and remove doubts about the interpretation of some existing provisions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to join in the congratulations to the new Minister for State, Mrs. Doyle, and to wish her a very happy tenure of office.  I suppose she might have preferred to come to office in different circumstances.  We have all had those experiences.  I am quite sure she will bring to bear her own individual talents on the matters pertaining to her duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather a pity that the debate on the Bill, which was introduced in the Dáil almost a year ago was allowed to develop and create the kind of scare in the business community which could have been allayed by the Government if the amendment which was passed in the Dáil quite recently had been agreed to many months previously.  We are dealing here with a Valuation Act which, as the Minister told the House, is more than one hundred years old.  Naturally, with changing technologies and different developments in the industrial, business and commercial world it is unlikely that all of what was <Col N="587" /> incorporated in the original Act would meet present-day requirements.  Therefore, we have no great objection at any time to a Government introducing measures which bring up to date Acts which are in need of amendment.</P>
    <P>In this particular instance the CII and groups within the industrial and commercial sphere gave different estimates of the overall additional cost that would be involved in the passage of this Bill.  I think that the Minister, in replying to the Second Stage, should indicate to the House what, in precise financial terms, will be the difference to the sole remaining ratepaying community arising from the passage of this Bill.  If projections are given in relation to the additional rates which will have to be paid and are indicated to this House and sustained, all of us will have much more credibility in regard to Bills of this nature.</P>
    <P>We are living in a time when the whole commercial and industrial world is faced with mounting economic problems. Almost 3,000 companies have closed down in this country in the last three years.  We do not want to indicate that the reason for this was the amount of rates that had to be paid.  In many cases it can be written off against income tax liabilities.  I certainly would not want to raise it as being one of the major questions. Nevertheless, it is important to indicate to entrepreneurs and people engaged in business that in no way are the Government in any hidden way trying, through the passage of this Bill, to extract more money by way of rates from this dwindling community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Valuation Act itself, it is fair to say that it has stood well the test of time.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay a compliment to the people in the Valuation Office who, down through the years, have interpreted this Act in a very broad and reasonably fair way as far as my experience goes.  The practice which was undertaken by the Minister for Finance during the last year in visiting processing plants both in the dairying and sugar areas to allay fears in these areas with regard to the question <Col N="588" /> of the types of machinery and plant that would be embraced by the new Bill, was a very worthwhile exercise and helped to allay some of the unease which prevailed heretofore.  During the course of the past year &mdash; although this is an aside I would like to ask the Minister to investigate it &mdash; I have had representations from individuals who house antiquities, old pieces of machinery which have taken a lot of time to assemble.  Most of this work is done as a hobby but it enables voluntary organisations to have access to these pieces of antiquity to raise funds for very necessary projects.  The preservation of antiquities of this nature &mdash; old threshing mills and so on &mdash; and maintaining them so that future generations would have access to the types of machinery and equipment used in earlier times is a very worthwhile exercise.  Under the present law the Valuation Office have to consider accommodation used for the preservation of antiquities of this nature in the normal way even though the owners enjoy no income whatsoever from their use of maintenance and in many cases undertake fairly considerable expense in bringing them together and finding parts in different areas of the country for them. I know that it is not directly relevant to this Bill but I mentioned it because anomalies of this kind arise.  Perhaps in the context of a future measure &mdash; the Minister for Finance did indicate that he would be considering a more comprehensive Bill at a later stage &mdash; matters of this kind would be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is no argument against trying to assist local authorities in preserving the base for rates which they presently enjoy. It is already very greatly reduced since rates are no longer paid on domestic property and local authorities everywhere have very considerable financial problems.  If, in the light of experience in our courts, some industries or commercial entities are able to exclude, for valuation purposes and subsequently payment of rates, plant which in the normal way should carry the burden of rates, it is only fair that the traditional system should be maintained.  In so far as this Bill is an effort to maintain that base I have no <Col N="589" /> hesitation in giving it my support, but I am asking the Minister to clarify the position in her reply by indicating to this House that the amount of money which we raise through rates under this system, allowing for inflation and allowing for the normal annual increases which will be passed by local authorities, will be no greater than either the rate of inflation or that which the local authorities apply. If we are able to receive that kind of assurance from the Minister we will not oppose a Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to extend a very warm welcome to our colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, and to wish her well.  We seldom have the opportunity to welcome new Ministers to the House and it is nice to find that, the House can welcome, in this important position, a Minister of the new generation so to speak.  I wish her well in her work.</P>
      <P>I want to welcome the Valuation Bill, 1985.  It certainly clarifies and brings into the present decade legislation that was passed a long time ago in 1852 and 1860.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the sections of the Bill whereby the Minister proposes to amend the schedules by order.  The unusual part of this is that it is provided that whenever an order is proposed to be made under section 3 and section 8, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  The old formula was that the Minister would just make the order, lay it on the Table of the House and after a period of 21 sitting days the order would pass.  Here, we are certainly introducing a very democratic criterion into the ministerial orders, which must be welcomed. Also, because the Minister is providing that facility it cannot in any way be taken that the Government have any ulterior motives either by way of endeavouring to increase valuations or to extend the categories of property under the schedules to the Valuations Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of relatively recent court actions we have had the valuations on <Col N="590" /> agricultural lands dropped and being proved unconstitutional from the point of view of the local authority making a raid.  The only people who are subject to rates now are the industrial and commercial establishments.  While it is important that local authorities should be left with some means of providing their own revenue, it might be a good idea to look at the entire system of raising local finances now, because in many counties the industrial and manufacturing valuation is so small that the yield from it is hardly worthwhile and the contribution to the costs of running services at county level is very small.  Perhaps the time has come to look at the valuation system as an equitable means for raising local finance more especially if you take the business person and the small shopkeeper.  They are very often caught on the double.  They are forced to pay rates on the valuation of their commercial property and at the same time they have to pay the water charges and the refuse collection charges and so on on the portion of the house they live in.  Some families can justifiably say that they are being penalised by having to pay twice for the same service.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a difficulty there for the county managers but for some people, especially those at the lower end of the scale, there is an anomaly there, and perhaps the Minister would look at that problem from the county councils' point of view.  In the last few weeks most counties have been dealing with the striking of rates and each year it is getting more and more difficult by virtue of the fact that some politicians and councillors for the past year or so have been publicly recommending that people should not pay some water or council charges.  This, of course, reduces the yield to the local authorities.  There will have to be deeper thinking so that the people engaged in the administration of local government should have their minds clear on exactly what is required and the best possible way of financing the activities of urban councils and county councils.  It is important that there should be adequate finances for that.  The Principal Act has <Col N="591" /> been in force here, has been utilised by the Valuation Office for almost a century and a quarter and it will continue to do so indefinitely.  When this amending legislation was introduced I could see exactly the improvements which the Minister is making.  If more concentrated effort had been made to bring in greater equity, it would have been very welcome.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and the Minister's aims in implementing this legislation.  I want to wish the Minister well in her new post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to take this opportunity of welcoming Deputy Doyle.  It is very nice to have a glamorous Minister for a change and for that reason, if for no other, I hope she comes before us often.  I had the pleasure of working with Deputy Doyle on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land.  As I mentioned in the House previously, I had a very good record of attendance and, indeed, all the main members had.  Perhaps Deputy Doyle's membership could be responsible to some extent for that.  I must also say that Deputy Doyle proved that she has brains as well as beauty.  I sincerely welcome her to the House.</P>
      <P>The Acts which are referred to in this Bill are two very old Acts, those of 1852 and 1854.  I feel that what is required is a completely new Act.  It is very difficult to build, in accordance with modern requirements, on an antiquated Bill of that kind.  I also find it difficult to accept what the Minister has told us &mdash; that the Bill does not represent any change in valuation or rating policy.  Perhaps, strictly speaking, this may be so.  The net result is that we will have higher valuations. That is the whole purpose.  The problems, apparently, which initiated this Bill were that machinery was outside the scope of valuation.  Now, to some extent, this will be included.</P>
      <P>To put the background in some perspective in regard to the out-of-date methods in those old Acts, I could refer very briefly to the 1852 Act and just give the basis on which some of the valuations are made.  They are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> Wheat at the general average price of 7s. 6d per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Oats at the general average price of 4s. 10d per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Barley at the general average price of 5s. 6d per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Flax at the general average price of 52s. per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Butter at the general average price of 65s. 4d per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Beef at the general average price of 35s. 6d per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Mutton at the general average price of 41s. per cwt. of 112 lbs.  Pork at the general average price of 32s. per cwt. of 112 lbs.</P>
    <P>These are completely unrealistic and totally out-of-date, and in that situation a new Bill is essential.  Having said that, I know the problems that would be involved in a completely new method of valuation. The 1852 and the 1854 valuations were very comprehensive ones.  One of the very good effects and bonuses attached to those valuations was the completion of the Ordnance Survey.  The Ordnance Survey was primarily intended to give help for valuation purposes and to get a unified method of valuation.  Much work was involved in completing the six-inch maps &mdash; maps to the scale of six-inches to a mile.  The survey was started in 1825 and completed in 1836.  That survey has given us a basis for the poor law valuation, or what is known as Griffith's Valuation.  I think I should mention in passing that through that survey we have preserved our townland names.  We have preserved a record of where our historic monuments are.  In the actual valuation we have preserved a record of all the hereditaments, all the houses and the types of houses.  For example, we are able to determine from that valuation the type of house and whether it was slated or thatched.  This is very important.  Although the key to decoding it is a very difficult one and is only available, as far as I know, in the Public Record Office, nevertheless, we have that marvellous record, which is attributable to Griffith's Valuation.  What I am trying to say is that it was an enormous task.  I have no doubt that to arrive at a comparable valuation attuned to the <Col N="593" /> present situation would be an equally major task.  Nevertheless, I feel that it is necessary.  On the basis of the Acts and what I have said about them I think it is impossible to get an acceptable system of valuation based on such outmoded methods.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry has many times expressed concern about this Bill.  In their <i>Newsletter</i> of 11 June 1985 it states:</P>
    <P>During recent weeks many firms have become concerned about the implications of the Valuation Bill 1985 which could add considerably to rates charges on the manufacturing sector. The Bill proposes to impose rates on plant which is used to contain or transmit a substance.</P>
    <P>It also states in the <i>Newsletter:</i></P>
    <P>The widening of the base on which industrial rates are charged in this manner could, depending on legal interpretation....</P>
    <P>Again, I emphasise that legal interpretation is impossible because what many people were saying was that through the loophole it was possible to evade valuation. Legal interpretation will be important, but it would result in a doubling or trebling of the rates bill on a manufacturing industry, which is currently about £80 million annually.  I think it is unrealistic at this time, when we have such a major problem with unemployment and then factories are closing down, to add this extra charge which will result in more factories closing down.  As I said earlier, it is hard to understand it is so important that this Bill should be pushed through without any further delay having waited so long for it and it having been based on Acts which are totally out of date, 130 years old.</P>
    <P>The <i>Newsletter</i> continues:</P>
    <P>The expansion of the base as envisaged by the Commission on Taxation would result in a more equitable sharing of the burden of local authority <Col N="594" /> finances among the various sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>The Confederation would strongly recommend that the effective base for the levying of rates or charges on manufacturing industry should be confined to buildings and attachments forming an integral part of the fabric of buildings on a site which imposes a cost on local authorities in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>The points made by the Confederation are most important and should be taken into consideration.  This has not been the case.  In volume 43, 2 July, 1985, the Confederation of Irish Industry <i>Newsletter</i> stated that a survey was carried out in manufacturing industry by the federation and this confirmed the view of the serious cost implications which the Bill would have for the manufacturing sector. It gives a number of examples.  These are as follows:</P>
    <P>A major dairy co-operative estimate that the value of plant which would become rateable would be as high as the value of buildings thus doubling the rates chargeable.  A major pharmaceutical manufacturer estimates the value of plant as two and a half times the value of buildings thus more than trebling the rates chargeable.</P>
    <P>A major building materials firms estimates the value of plant as 2.6 times that of buildings thus more than trebling the rates chargeable.</P>
    <P>A number of food processing firms estimate the value of plant at about 75 per cent the value of buildings thus almost doubling the rates chargeable.</P>
    <P>A major chemical manufacturer estimates the value of plant at more than three and a half times the value of buildings thus more than quadrupling the rates chargeable.</P>
    <P>A drink manufacturer estimates the value of plant at one and a quarter times the value of its buildings thus more than doubling the rates chargeable.</P>
    <P>It also refers to the fact that the Minister may by order add a category of plant or vary the description of any such category to bring them within the scope of the <Col N="595" /> legislation, thus giving extraordinary power to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Finally, in its <i>Newsletter</i> of 1 October 1985, volume 43, No. 21, in reference to the Valuation Bill, there are a number of suggestions made and I will not go into all of them.  I would like to refer briefly to them.  It refers to Schedule 3 (1), Schedule reference No. 3, and asks for a specific change to add the words &ldquo;the easement or an analogue therefore in respect of all cables.&rdquo;  There is no change in that section.</P>
    <P>In Schedule 3 (1), Schedule reference No. 5, the CII are seeking an appropriate change in wording here which would clearly show that buildings only are in question and not machinery.  There is no change in the section.</P>
    <P>It then refers to Schedule 3 (2):</P>
    <P>CII believes that changes in the Schedule to the Act of 1852 have an effect similar to the enactment of a Finance Act, and CII also believes that new impositions of tax should be by means of a Bill presented for formal discussion by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Confederation is seeking an assurance that it is not possible legislatively to use this mechanism to extend the base of valuation within the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the section.</P>
    <P>With regard to Schedule 5 (2), it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Confederation believes that reference to valuations &ldquo;which have been made and revised within a recent period&rdquo; will tend to reinforce the discrimination against manufacturing industry unless made in the context of a general revaluation.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the section.</P>
    <P>With regard to Schedule 7, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Confederation believes that in the case of these Subsections and in all other places in the Bill, the use should be made only of two concepts which are buildings which are acknowledged to be within the scope of valuation, and machinery which is not within the scope of valuation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> There is no change in the section.</P>
    <P>With reference to Schedule 8 (1), Reference No. 1, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Confederation believes that the intention of the Bill would be more clearly stated by referring to &ldquo;constructions of a fixed nature which are deemed to be an integral part of the fabric of a building but excluding all process plant which is technically and conceptually separate from the premises comprising a mill, manufactory or building...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The important change is made here.  This is the only change in the Bill which was initiated.  I am satisfied that those who have argued for this change are satisfied with it.  I accept that this does cover the essential changes that were required in the Bill.  There are other aspects I could refer to but I do not think it would be appropriate at this time.  Some of the matters could be raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, the present valuation method of maintaining the tone of the valuation list is difficult to understand because in that situation, while it is a very catching phrase, it is neither fish nor flesh.  I am not sure if in that situation it can be scientific; but it is leaning towards that arbitrary method, as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a new Bill is needed in order to have a new approach and to take modern conditions into consideration.  At that time, we were 100 years into the era of the Industrial Revolution and it is difficult to understand why this differentiation was not included.  It is difficult to understand why we should try to modernise an Act so old, bearing in mind that, even in our own lifetime, we have seen more changes than previously took place in a period of 1,000 years.  In that kind of situation it is hard to understand how a simple amendment can update an Act sufficiently.  There are many who are concerned with the situation.  They have cause to be concerned because the effect of the Bill is to increase the valuation and the amount of money to be paid by these <Col N="597" /> firms who, by and large, are in desperate straits at the moment.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that those who raised those objections seemed to be satisfied, I also welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is fair to say that, when one tries to amend an Act as old as this, one will have difficulties. There is nothing wrong with the Act but its age.  During the period of 126 years since it was enacted in the House of Parliament, there have been great technological changes.  The valuation which was placed on very many assets at that time has undergone a radical change.  It was inevitable that there would be some anomalies under the old Act.  It is for that very purpose that this updating Bill or amending legislation was brought in, first of all to protect the valuation base which is vital for local authorities if they are to survive.  It was also to ensure that that base would apply to the year 1987 onwards until such time as we enact what Senator Fitzsimons has talked about, new legislation which would be more definitive and more in keeping with the technological era in which we now live.</P>
      <P>Since the time of the original Valuation Bill in the 1800's, plant and machinery, as they were known at that time, have changed so much that there could be different interpretations in the valuer's mind of what is plant or machinery.  It is for that very purpose that the Bill is being brought to the House, to ensure that there is as much definition as possible of what is to be valued for rateable valuation purposes.  It is for the very purpose of the reservations expressed by the CII and other people that the Minister initiated an amendment in the other House.  It was an important amendment in that it defined the areas that the CII were concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ratepayers are becoming an extinct race in this country from various political actions of various Governments down the years.  There are very few of them left. Naturally, those that are left, particularly in the industrial field, are worried in case any changes initiated by way of legislation would be a disincentive to them to continue. <Col N="598" /> I welcomed the contributions from the CII.  I read them.  I made representations to the Minister while the legislation was in the other House just to satisfy myself that what we were doing was not adding another penalty to that section, but defining it in such a way that nobody could misrepresent what was plant and what was machinery.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in using that very feminine description of preserving the tone of the valuation list &mdash; which is lovely phraseology &mdash; helped us to understand what she means.  It means that we are preserving the base.  Senator Fitzsimons defined it precisely.  We are trying to define what is included in the legislation so that the wrong interpretation cannot be given on the ground that would cause industry to worry.  The Minister, in inserting section 8 in the other House by way of an amendment, has now defined what the categories of plant are, which can leave no doubt at all in anybody's mind, so that the Valuation Office in Ely Place will know exactly what we mean by plant to be excluded for valuation purposes.  That schedule on page 4 of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>1.  All constructions affixed to the premises comprising a mill, manufactory or building (whether on or below the ground) and used for the containment of a substance or for the transmission of a substance or electric current, including any such constructions which are designed or used primarily for storage or containment (whether or not the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or a chemical process to take place), but excluding any such constructions which are designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained or transmitted</P>
    <P>2.  All fixed furnaces, boilers, ovens and kilns.</P>
    <P>3.  All ponds and reservoirs.</P>
    <P>By setting down a category in that schedule of excluded plant, the Minister is eliminating any area of doubt or misrepresentation. <Col N="599" /> The fact that the Minister has the power under the Act to bring an amending order before the House to add or exclude any other type of plant, is something that we welcome.  Otherwise we would have amendments coming back here, maybe not in 100 years but in an age of fast-growing technology and we could have amendments being required very quickly.  The Minister will have the power to bring in such an order, which will be subject to debate in the House and will be subject to the agreement of the House.  There cannot be any underhand work in adding to or taking from this category of plant.  We welcome that.</P>
    <P>Some of the categories of fixed properties which the Minister has referred to in her speech and which are outlined on page 3 of the Bill are also worthy of mention.  I want to mention one that has been excluded and which because of its very nature, had to be excluded.  I would prompt the Minister into considering it as a possibility in the future, particularly when we are trying to raise revenue.  That is not what this Bill is about.  This Bill is about definitions to protect the existing code.  The categories are listed: construction affixed to lands or tenements, other than buildings referred to in section 14; lands developed for any purpose other than agriculture, horticulture, forestry or sport, irrespective of whether or not such land is surfaced &mdash; that would include car parks, it also includes any constructions affixed thereto which pertain to the development.  The Schedule also refers to cables, pipelines and all the other things that go with the transmission of power.</P>
    <P>The Schedule goes on in Reference 4 to refer to all fixed moorings, piers and docks.&rdquo;  I would have liked if it had referred to yachts, which are quite moveable objects.  They do require a service. They require facilities.  They are generally owned by people who are opulent and people who rarely pay a contribution towards the maintenance of any of the facilities that they want, whether provided by harbour commissioners or by anybody else involved in piers and other <Col N="600" /> facilities.  It is a pity because everybody else, including the motorist, has to pay his fair share towards the cost of providing services, whereas yachts and yacht owners seem to be exclusively able to enjoy total exemption.  It would be inappropriate to include it in that particular section but when I saw &ldquo;fixed moorings, piers and docks&rdquo; I could not restrain myself from suggesting that possibly the Minister for Finance might at some stage in the future treat the owners of yachts and the registration of them as a source of revenue for the State which could be used for the benefit of the less well-off people in our society.  I would suggest that for consideration by the Minister or her senior Minister in the Department of Finance in the future.  There are quite a few yachts around the country.  That is a source of income that has been untapped up to now.  God knows all the other sources have been looked at and shuffled around quite a lot.  Let us look at some new places where we might get some revenue.</P>
    <P>The Bill, generally speaking, removes any anomalies.  The Minister's amendments remove the worry of the CII.  I cannot see any contention in it now.  I agree it is a vital piece of legislation particularly for local authorities to service the base which will be used for their 1987 income year.  It is to be welcomed for that reason.  I realise how important it is to have rateable valuations correctly and legally defined so that county managers have powers to levy rates on property. If we implement that, together with the waiver scheme which we have still in the rateable system, any cases of hardship can easily be dealt with by the county manager at that level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a pity that it has to be done in this way and not, as Senator Fitzsimons said, by way of new legislation.  That could only be done if there was something to protect the existing format which would ensure an income for the local authorities in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary for me to welcome the Minister, as the Minister <Col N="601" /> is aware that she is welcome in this House.  The Minister is, I am sure, highly delighted with the similarities in the speech which she has given today and the speech which was given by the Minister so long ago in the Dáil when he introduced the earlier version of this Bill.  No doubt it is a coincidence that the Minister arrives at the same conclusions in precisely the same order as the former Minister for Finance and did not receive a brief from a similar source.  I bring it to the Minister's attention as a warning that briefs from officials should be looked upon with the greatest suspicion.</P>
      <P>Senator Smith raised quite an important point, that this Valuation Bill was first presented by the Minister for Finance on 11 March 1985; it was passed in the other House last week.  That it should be presented to this House today in the expectation that it will be passed into law towmorrow is a disgrace.  Indeed it tempts one to lend support to the view which was expressed today in a newspaper that the abolition of this House is called for.  If the Government do not treat us with respect it is impossible to treat ourselves with respect.  If we do not get the respect of our fellow parliamentarians it is impossible to expect that they will provoke from us an adequate response to the legislation which is put before us. This is the kind of legislation for which a reasonable length of time should be allowed for consideration of the various issues in this House.  The Members will no doubt be aware that the two measures we are proposing to change during the course of today and tomorrow are very ancient and have been much changed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Members will no doubt be aware that the text of the existing legislation can be found in the invaluable book, <i>Local Government</i> by H.A. Street, where the Valuation Act, 1852, in so far as it still exists, can be found in its entirety, together with the 1860 Act.  This Act is referred to by the Minister as the 1860 Act but is really the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1860.  The Members will be interested to know the original purpose <Col N="602" /> of that Act, what we call the short title of the Act.  It is an Act to enable the treasury to defray one moiety of the expense of the annual revision of valuation of rateable property in Ireland out of the consolidated fund.  In other words it was temporary legislation to cater for a position which arose in one year.  This is legislation which is the basis of our charging rates year by year.</P>
    <P>An examination of that Act that is still extant will show that there are large gaps because it has been long repealed.  Only certain sections of that Act are still law. Neither of these Acts is very long.  This House is expected to change these ancient enactments in a hotch potch way when ample time was available for the parliamentary draftsman to consolidate the 1852 and the 1860 Acts &mdash; even if he left all the other little changes that have been taking place since &mdash; into new legislation with the proposed amendments.  It would have been the least that this House and the other House could have expected by way of explanation of the importance of the changes which are proposed during the course of the consideration of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Valuation Office and the successive Ministers should learn a lesson from this Bill.  Sometimes Ministers consider that they are performing a public service by doing nothing, by ignoring problems and pretending that they do not exist.  If you ignore problems and do not tackle them when they arise what happens is that concessions which are run by ratepayers or taxpayers by way of exception to the general rule become, in their minds, a matter of entitlement.  That is what has happened in this case.  Legalistic definitions, which I accept as being necessary, of plant and machinery, and legalistic definitions of what was rateable and what was not rateable, enabled substantial industries like, for example, certain creameries, processing industries, breweries, distilleries and refineries to take a substantial portion of their buildings &mdash; you could not in ordinary language call them anything else &mdash; out of the rateable valuation system.  It was ignored for such a long time by successive Ministers that <Col N="603" /> now they have the cheek to think that they are entitled to the exception.  Indeed they flaunt the good fortune which they have gained at the expense of other ratepayers over the years and used this exception which they have gained as justification for continued discrimination in their favour.  That is indeed an incorrect result of the inactivity by politicians in these areas.  There is a lesson in that for us all.</P>
    <P>As regards the publicity which I and other Members of this House have received from people like the Confederation of Irish Industry, it was done in such a way as to create an impression and mass hysteria with regard to the future cost structure of various industries.  Does everybody in Ireland think they should not pay tax?  Is every pressure group to be in some way exceptional and to be kept outside the net of having to make their fair contribution to the tax-gathering system.  I know we can have responses from certain parties, particularly parties in opposition.  You can pretend to people that you can have lower rates, you can have no service charges, you can lower the income tax rate all at once and still maintain the same level or increased level of public spending.  That is irresponsible politics.  We in the Seanad should be above the consideration of important matters of policy on such a glib basis.</P>
    <P>Before talking about what is in the Bill I would like to talk about what is not in the Bill and which in my opinion should be in the Bill.  A problem has arisen, and it is the kind of problem which will in future give rise to other problems, with regard to the proper interpretation of section 14 of the 1852 Act.  This is one of the Acts we are amending.  I do not expect the Minister's response to this question during her Second Stage reply. It would be quite unreasonable to expect it.  I say it for the record and for the purpose of alerting those in authority about the problem which no doubt they know exists.  Something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>Any improvement to agricultural holdings are exempt from rates.  A problem <Col N="604" /> has arisen with regard to whether or not the intensive rearing of pigs and poultry falls within the exception envisaged by section 14 of the 1852 Act.  It has been decided by the Supreme Court that in a particular case where a farmer is farming land and is also engaged in intensive poultry raising that person should not, in respect of the poultry buildings, be rateable. What has not been decided &mdash; I know the matter will be decided in the reasonably near future &mdash; is whether a person who has no other connection with farming but is merely in the business of intensively rearing farm animals, whether poultry, pigs or any other farm animals, can rely on the same exemption.  That is a decision which the courts will have to take on the basis of this ancient section which we are leaving unamended.  Of course, the court must arrive at whatever is the right decision on the basis of section 14.  But that is the kind of policy decision that politicians should be taking and not leaving it to the court to decide whether or not in the future such buildings should or should not be rateable.</P>
    <P>In general the Bill has my support, and in its twin objectives it should have the support of all of us.  It is seeking to revert to the normal position which it was intended to obtain with regard to the valuation of what you and I would normally understand to be buildings and what you and I would understand to be plant but which, as a result of a series of judicial decisions, were not felt to fall within the definitions of the 1852 and 1860 Acts. Consequently a reduced valuation list had to be made in a number of counties and higher rates had to be paid by other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking to do two things.  In sections 2 and 3 the Minister is seeking to amend the 1852 Act in order to expand the categories of fixed property which is capable of being or liable to be rateable.  In other words, it is amending section 12 of the 1852 Act by adding a Schedule, which is contained in section 3 of this Bill.  Having created a new category of rateable property, the Minister is then seeking to extend the provisions of the 1860 Act to that category.  The <Col N="605" /> 1860 Act appears to be the charging Act. As distinct from saying &ldquo;It is liable to be rated&rdquo;, it says &ldquo;Rates will be paid in it for the particular year&rdquo;.  I do not understand why the Minister is using apparently different and contradictory definitions of plant in the 1852 Act and the 1860 Act. I realise this is a matter which is probably more suitable for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I would be very happy for the Minister to respond to it on Committee Stage rather than on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>It appears that the definition of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; which is contained in the definition section, section 1, is wider than the actual categories of plant included in the Schedule inserted in the 1860 Act by virtue of section 8 of this Bill.  I wonder whether the difference in that definition will lead to a situation where there will be substantial contention as to whether or not particular items of plant fall within the second definition.  If it does not fall within the definition contained in the new Schedule to the 1860 Act, rates will not be payable in respect of it in a particular year.  That would appear to be the actual effect of the section.  While it would be rateable as such, the commissioners of valuation would not have the authority to actually rate the plant unless it falls within the definition contained in the 1860 Act as distinct from the 1852 Act. It is the conflict between the 1860 Act and the definition &ldquo;plant&rdquo; contained in section 1 of this Bill that appears to have the seed of a potential problem.</P>
    <P>The second problem I would like to bring to the Minister's attention is whether the Minister is happy with the exclusion contained in section 8 of this Bill which has already been read into the record by Senator Ferris and from which I will read a section:</P>
    <P>...excluding any such constructions which are designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained or transmitted.</P>
    <P>For example, one of the things the Minister mentions as being excluded as a result of judicial decision is brewery vats.  Will a brewery vat be considered by the courts to be a vessel primarily for the storage of <Col N="606" /> products or primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained within the container?  The Minister should consider that.  It appears to me that brewery vats are being left in a no-man's-land which will mean further judicial interpretation.  That, to say the least, is a less certain way to establish the parameters of the law than to introduce proper amendments in Seanad Éireann</P>
    <P>I can also see quite a substantial number of other problems.  I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with the process industries as such.  Let us look at people like Pfizers, the refinery, where a substantial portion of their storage capacity would consist, particularly perhaps in regard to the other cases I mentioned rather than the refinery, of storage during the process of change as distinct from storage of the raw material and storage of the finished product.  This would seem to be clearly within the definition of plant to be valued on the enactment of this legislation.  The essential element I would like to bring to the Minister's attention is this.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is within the new Schedule contained in section 8 of this Bill, a definition which will enable the Valuation Office to value property with certainty and which will enable the people who have received the valuation to accept it without the necessity for individual applications in respect of every individual property to the Circuit Court? I am not satisfied that the Minister has acheived that with the amendments which were introduced in the other House.  These are the kinds of considerations I would consider it our duty in this House to examine.  The proper examination of these and the proper receipt of representations from various sections of the community during the legislative process means that the length of time for the consideration of this Bill is inadequate and does not reflect credit on this House or on the Government.  It is becoming increasingly normal practice that where legislation is introduced which gives rise to problems &mdash; for example, the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill and the local radio stations Bill, consultations take place outside the Houses of the <Col N="607" /> Oireachtas and all the necessary amendments are agreed before it comes back to both Houses of the Oireachtas for the rubber stamping.</P>
    <P>Instead the Houses of the Oireachtas should be treated as chambers of the Oireachtas for the examination and the changing of legislation in the common good.  I do not consider that the public perception or indeed the work of this Government would be one whit diminished if this Seanad decided that, in the interest of achieving the objective which I think we all share, we found it necessary to amend some portion of this legislation. As long as this House is treated as if an amendment made by it is a matter of defeat for the Government, this House will deserve the contempt of the people. We cannot do our job unless we are given the freedom of action within the confines of the policy which we accept, of course, to amend legislation and not to change the principle of the Bill which is not our business but to make its implementation more effective.  Because I accept the principle of the Bill the Minister will be pleased to know that I intend supporting the Second Stage of this Bill and we will see about the rest later.</P>

      <P>I too would like to compliment and congratulate Deputy Avril Doyle on her appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with particular responsibility for the Board of Works.  She takes up appointment in a very interesting office, one which has ministerial responsibility over a very ancient body and a body which has wideranging powers and functions in relation to this State.  She also moves to one of the most delightful suites of offices that any Minister can have and I know that she will bring to them not merely the natural graciousness that she possesses but also that talent, ability and determination which she has shown since entering the Houses of the Oireachtas three and a half years ago.  I wish the Minister success in every area of the wide functions that she will have to carry out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak not out of any great conviction <Col N="608" /> in relation to the Bill but I support the twin objectives of it.  It is good that we as legislators are introducing a little clarity into the valuation code.  In particular I welcome the definition contained in section 1 which will help to alleviate the difficulties which have arisen recently in our courts in terms of determining what is plant as distinct from machinery.  This will make it easier to value such hereditaments as premises.  It is extremely important that within the valuation code, which is the basis of an aspect of our tax system, there should be certainty.  I welcome those sections of the Bill which introduce that type of certainty.  I also welcome section 5 of the Bill which is the section that puts into statutory form the practice that has been carried out and adopted in the past of comparing buildings with other structures in the vicinity of like character.  The Minister referred to it as maintaining the tone of the valuation list. It is extremely important that that practice which of necessity had to be adopted by the commissioners and their officers has now to be put into legislative form and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>In effect I welcome the contents of the Bill.  I would not be speaking here today if I were merely to welcome the effect of this Bill.  I want to voice certain criticisms. The first criticism is the amendment of our valuation code.  Once again we have a Government responding in a willy nilly manner, to the decisions of our courts. There is no thought-out pattern, which would bring our valuation system into the eighties but rather a response to a particular situation.  On the one hand that response is in great measure due to the impetus of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  On the other hand I am glad to see that the Government will at least respond when asked by a body as important and responsible as the CII.  Indeed it is only fair that a tribute should be paid to the CII for their input into this Bill.</P>
    <P>The basic fact that must be recognised is the total failure of this Government to come to grips in terms of one area of our taxation system and in terms of codifying the entire valuation laws.  They have totally failed to take on board any of the <Col N="609" /> recommendations of the Fourth Report of the Committee on Taxation in this regard.  We must point fingers, not at the Minister because she has only had a few days of responsibility, but at this Government specifically for failing to take on board a complete reform of the valuation code.  I say that as a Government supporter. If we are to bring the certainty that this Bill specifies in two areas into the overall valuation system then there must be a complete codification of the existing legislation and also a recognition of the interpretation of that legislation by our courts.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill with which I am appalled, that is the provisions contained in sections 3 and 8 of the Bill which allow the Minister, by order, to amend or revoke the amended schedules that we are introducing.  It seems that other people who will stand in this Chamber in the future will be prevented from voicing the kind of criticism I am voicing here today.  We will have Ministers of all parties, all persuasions and all opinions in the future, simply by order, under their seal of office, amending the valuation code.  It is wrong that the basis of one aspect of our tax system can be amended by ministerial order.  Orders must be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas but I wonder how aware will bodies like the CII and people who are paying rates be that the whole basis of one important aspect of the tax system is being amended simply by ministerial order.  I would ask the Minister to consider these two points.  Firstly, there should be an overall codification of the valuation system and, secondly, we should not give to the Minister power to amend the valuation code by ministerial order.  To do so would be extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one other aspect of the valuation code which has been and will continue to be the subject of much interpretation by our courts, that is the question of premises, buildings, hereditaments or tenements used for public purposes. It seems that there are a number of conflicting decisions of all courts in relation to buildings of this nature.  My <Col N="610" /> understanding is that, for example, county council offices are rated.  It has been decided by the courts that rates must be paid on those buildings.  During the past week it has been held by the Circuit Court that the headquarters of a fisheries board is a totally exempt hereditament. This is one area where clarification is needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it clarifies and introduces certainty into an area of the valuation code.  In welcoming it, my welcome is guarded and limited because the Bill goes a very small way and does not introduce the overall clarity and the overall certainty that is lacking in the valuation code.  I hope the new Minister, with the responsibility she is taking on and with the determination and ability that she has, will use those qualities to see that that kind of codification is achieved during her term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Members for their good wishes and their gracious welcome to me this afternoon.  As I stated in my opening speech, and perhaps it would be no harm to reiterate the point that appears to be causing greatest concern, Senators need have no fears with regard to any extension of the valuation code.  What is provided for under this Bill is merely the preservation of the existing valuation base.  It does not add any new categories of property to it.  Several Senators, starting with Senator Smith, expressed their fears in relation to that issue in particular. There is, therefore, no question of an increase in the rates burden on any sector of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fear that was broadly voiced was in relation to the position concerning the valuation legislation generally.  At the moment there is an ongoing review in relation to the valuation code.  This is being undertaken by the Department of Finance and the Valuation Office.  It is, perhaps, regrettable that the business before us today and the reviewed code could not be discussed at one and the same time.  But the House will appreciate <Col N="611" /> that to prevent any further erosion of the financial basis for local authorities the matter being dealt with today has to take precedence in the event of the other revision not being ready yet to come before either the other House or the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with a few specific points. In reply to Senator Fitzsimons, machines are not being included in this Bill.  They are, in fact, expressly excluded from valuation by section 7 (1) of the Bill, as they have always been.  Senator Fitzsimons also referred to the CII.  They have indicated that they are now happy with this Bill and that the Bill itself will not produce any increase in valuations.  The CII now concede that those dire forecasts, as quoted by Senator Fitzsimons, made last year are without foundation.  The Senator referred to the desirability of the review of the valuation code and it is agreed that such a revision is eminently necessary, and is, as I say, afoot.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to local authority financing and about the Government being very concerned about the matter.  This is being reviewed as part of the examination of public expenditure as a whole and it is a matter we all share his concern on.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary's general point was in relation to the updating of the valuation code as a whole to which I have referred. As I have said, we agree, and this matter is being pursued.  His other points I will deal with on Committee Stage hopefully tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered all the points raised by the different contributors and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Questions again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at some <Col N="612" /> length on the last occasion the Bill was before the House.  I do not intend to speak too long today.  I said during my speech that I had great faith in the success and the contribution that would be made to the economic well-being of the Irish nation when this legislation was implemented. I trust that my confidence in the ability of the corporation is not misplaced. Job creation is vitally necessary &mdash; firstly, for the unemployed and, secondly, for the well-being of the Irish economy.  Nevertheless, the difficulties are twofold.  One, the operations of the corporation are to be carried out in those areas where venture capital is not risked; and, two, future dislocation and diminution of the labour force by technological change and the rationalisation consequent upon these changes.</P>
      <P>The corporation must of necessity depend on research and development to assist in identifying projects which appear to be viable and profitable in the commercial sense.  Profits, or indeed the projects themselves, may be sold off to provide the funding for other viable projects, or projects that appear to be viable.  This, in fact, is the dynamic centre or the keystone to continuous job creation: the revolving fund to establish new projects and to establish new jobs.  This feature of the Bill is most encouraging provided it works, since the true intent is a continuous provision of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of those who have expressed doubts about the role of the State as set out in this progressive Bill, I would point to the experience in New England in the United States of America, a free marketeer country.  Ten years ago this area was written off as a dying area in serious economic decline.  It had double the national average rate of unemployment and had major industries closing. Today that area has the fourth highest <i>per capita</i> income in the United States of America and one of the lowest levels of unemployment in America.  The explanation lies in the decision to establish public agencies:(1) the Community Development Finance Corporation, a <Col N="613" /> public sector venture capital fund provider for local companies; and (2) a technology development corporation beamed at high technology companies, state agencies operating successfully in the freest market economy and environment in the world.</P>
    <P>The other example I would point to is the Roosevelt New Deal after the most serious recession in western civilisation in America after the thirties.  There are other factors &mdash; I am not denying that &mdash; but it is clear that the public and private sectors' influences were welded together as major factors contributing to the provision of jobs.  The creation of jobs, I want to emphasise, was an internal operation distinct from dependence on outside companies, American or multinational. It was a do-it-ourselves operation. I would almost call it a Sinn Féin operation.  What they did was to concentrate on their local arena, and they did it within that arena.  Our National Development Corporation, even under the scrutiny of the most prejudiced observer, must admit a striking similarity to the American experiment.</P>
    <P>Attention is rightly paid in the Bill to efficiency, productivity and profitability. I would say that the role of the workers and their trade unions become of paramount importance in this context.  The projects to be established by the corporation will require, and should get, the fullest co-operation of the trade unions and the workers involved.  There is too much at stake to allow for failure.  The failure rate &mdash; and I admit there is nearly bound to be some failures &mdash; must be kept to a minimum.  That is the challenge, as I see it, to the corporation personnel, whoever is going to be appointed; to the management and workers in the established projects; to the research and development centres; to the retraining and educational centres &mdash; all combining to make a major contribution to the Irish people and the economy.</P>
    <P>In regard to the broad picture of unemployment, may I, first of all, say that we live in a tough, competitive world? Nobody will buy our goods because they are Irish.  They have to be produced and <Col N="614" /> sold at competitive prices.  The place to ensure that is done is at the place of work &mdash; the factory floor, the farm and throughout our distributive outlets.  Management, workers and their unions should seek the basis of a new partnership to replace areas of conflict and to establish real industrial democracy in which the workers are seen to participate intelligently and effectively.  All this is to be aimed at reducing unemployment by the expansion of Irish industry to absorb the unemployed workers.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation is a move in the right direction.  I will conclude by saying that, if all concerned at every level of operation in the projects set up &mdash; from the top team to the factory floor &mdash; play their part, it will succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity to welcome Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan to the House and to congratulate him on his new office as Minister of State?  Although we are politically opposed, I want to congratulate a fellow Munster man and wish him well in his new office.</P>
      <P>Turning now to the National Development Corporation Bill, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism at the time, Deputy Bruton, has said in his opening address that the main duty of the corporation would be to assist, by means of investment in industry, in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  The primary target of this Bill therefore is the creation of more jobs.  Any legislative proposal that promises some improvement in the employment level and a return to the Irish taxpayer for the money invested must be considered seriously. This begs the question, however, as to whether the Government are going about these objectives in the right way with the establishment of the NDC.  I will argue that it is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that most businesses are starved of investment funds in the form of share capital.  Simultaneously, however, the financial sector is currently awash with funds available <Col N="615" /> for investment.  Why then do people and institutions not choose to invest adequately in Irish industry?  The problem, of course, is a shortage of viable commercial projects.  These can only be generated if the climate for enterprise is right and if there is the opportunity to earn an adequate profit to compensate for commercial risks.</P>
    <P>Investors must have the incentive to keep wealth within the country and invest it here.  The crushing burden of direct and indirect taxes, the highest in the EC, which prevail in this country only serve to kill enterprise and incentive rather than to stimulate them.</P>
    <P>Taxation continues to be exceptionally high and is a disincentive to initiative, effort and to the taking of additional responsibilities.</P>
    <P>At company level, it is estimated that there is a need to raise £300 million in equity investment each year.  However, the average investment is only £80 million per annum by way of the equity finance which has been raised in the Dublin Stock Exchange in recent years.</P>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, the reference in the Minister's speech to the potential development of an over-the-counter market to facilitate trading in the shares of smaller enterprises and to the initiative which the Stock Exchange proposes to take in meeting this need.</P>
    <P>I must, however, again make the point that the burden of direct and indirect taxes constitute the biggest single obstacle to investment.  Therefore, the reform of the taxation system is as urgent as ever.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I hold the view that the NDC is a step in the wrong direction.  What we need is less State involvement and not more.  There is, of course, a place for State sponsored commercial enterprise but, surely, the primary job of Government is to act as a catalyst in relation to industrial development and then to leave the main operational aspects to the private sector?</P>
    <P>Members of the Coalition parties, expecially in the Labour Party, argue that the private sector has failed to provide the necessary level of jobs.  I argue that <Col N="616" /> the creation of a climate for enterprise in investment, which is largely absent under present Government policies, will provide the main spur for private sector investment.</P>
    <P>In any case, £2 out of every £3 spent in this country are already spent by the State.  We still have nearly 250,000 people unemployed.  Government at all levels now control about 70 per cent of gross domestic product.  The highest previously on record in any western democracy at our level of real gross domestic product <i>per capita</i> was France in 1965 where the figure was as low as 37 per cent.</P>
    <P>A further criticism that has been made about the National Development Corporation is that it is another layer of bureaucracy.  The Government's White Paper on industrial development lists no fewer than 23 State enterprises which are involved in industrial development.  Now it is proposed to add another.  In 1983, according to the White Paper, the expenditure of these 23 bodies amounted to £433 million.  Before the creation of another bureaucratic layer in the form of the NDC, an analysis should have been made of the performance of the 23 existing State agencies with a view to assessing how meaningful and relevant their objectives and operations are at this point in time and whether, indeed, they provide value for the taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>For example, looking at the range of State agencies which assist industrial development, it is clear that the IDA are of considerable assistance at the start-up stage.  Fóir Teoranta, for example, are in turn of considerable assistance when companies are threatened with closure. The life cycle of companies which fail, however, shows that working capital can be a very acute problem and the primary reason why companies go broke.  There is scope for providing grant aid and interest subsidies for companies for working capital to meet working needs and provide funds for expansion.  Despite the plethora of 23 State bodies, there is not enough aid available for companies in their middle years.  If I may draw an analogy with the human cycle, Government agencies provide grant aid at the &ldquo;pram&rdquo; stage and <Col N="617" /> they help when an undertaker is needed on the scene but, in between, there is a need for Government assistance to companies through the existing agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge, therefore, that a position audit be taken of the 23 State agencies for industrial development and I am raising a serious question mark over the need for the NDC.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister in his view that funding is required to support the process of innovation in Ireland through research and development.  New products to meet specialised niches in national and international markets require investment of those kind of funds that have to wait for a profit while the product is being developed and tested.  There is a need for this type of investment in commercial enterprises which are based on the results of research and development activity. The question I want to raise is whether it is necessary to establish a new body in the form of NDC to fulfil this function of equity for the R&amp;D type company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to the question of board membership for the National Development Corporation. This is something I feel strongly about and I raised it in the context of the Appropriations Bill a few weeks ago.  Given the Government's majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas, this Bill will become law, and that is reality.  The Government, therefore, will soon be appointing a board of directors for the NDC.  The fact that the corporation will be starting from scratch provides the Government with the opportunity to carefully select people with proven expertise in the commercial arena for appointment to the board of the NDC.  All political parties need to exercise more care in the selection of board members for State enterprises.  I would urge that only the best qualified people, irrespective of political allegiance, be appointed to the board of the NDC. Indeed, the Minister, in his opening speech, has said that it is the Government's intention that members of <Col N="618" /> the board will not be appointed because of their political or ideological views.  I welcome that.  I look forward to and will carefully note the board appointments when they are made to ensure that the Government's intention is fulfilled.  I wish, however, in the context of board membership, to make a further point.  If the right people with proven records are willing to serve on this board, then they should be remunerated in a realistic way. The pittance which applies to board membership of State-sponsored bodies at the present time is grossly inadequate.  If the directors of the NDC are to make a worthwhile contribution to the affairs of the corporation, this will necessitate time and commitment on their part and, therefore, realistic fees should be paid to them.</P>
    <P>A further point I want to raise is this. I want to say that I agree with the Minister that the selection of a suitable person for the post of managing director of the NDC will be of particular importance. The Minister makes that point that the actual salary rates for this job and the terms and conditions of employment of the appointment of the managing director will be matters for determination between himself and the Minister for the Public Service.  I would urge the Minister, that is, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to discard the Devlin restrictions on pay in the case of the managing director for the NDC.  I also think that the time is overdue for the abolition of the Devlin restrictions on all chief executive salaries in the commercial State-sponsored bodies sector.  The remuneration package of the chief executive should be based on performance.  At present chief executives of State-sponsored bodies are placed on set predictable scales, whether the organisations make or lose money. Chief executives should be paid competitive salaries and be appointed on contracts for a limited period, not for life, but for, say, five years, renewable if their performance justifies it.  There should also be bonus and share option schemes designed to motivate them to achieve maximum performance and results.  I would hope that the Minister would take this timely opportunity to ensure that the <Col N="619" /> chief executive of the NDC, together with chief executives of other State commercial enterprises, are realistically remunerated and that the Devlin guidelines should now be abolished.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it will be evident from what I have said that I do not regard the NDC a suitable vehicle for making a serious impact on our unemployment problem.  The focus, as I have argued, should instead be placed on a genuine reform of the taxation system and on the creation of a climate for enterprise, where investors will have the disposable income and opportunity to earn an adequate profit to compensate for commercial risks.  I am opposed to the Bill, but I have to say, now that it will become law with the Government's majority, I can only hope &mdash; and we can all only hope &mdash; that it will make a serious dent in the key economic and social problem facing the country at present, namely, unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me, first of all, extend my warm congratulations to Deputy O'Sullivan on his appointment as Minister of State and welcome him here this evening.  I welcome the decision to establish the National Development Corporation. Let me also pick up a few points made by Senator Hillery which puts in very clear perspective the different attitudes towards this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hillery indicated that he was opposed to this but recognising at the same time that it would become a reality in the very near future.  The alternative in his book would be a reform of the tax system so as to encourage risk taking by the private sector in job creation.  I have always regarded myself to some degree as a representative of the private sector, at least somebody with close contact with them.  Nevertheless, I have to say that experience has shown that in the position we find ourselves at the present time, as a nation with over 200,000 people unemployed, the private sector have not the capacity to deliver what Senator Hillery would expect them to deliver within the time scale required.  I would find myself <Col N="620" /> in agreement with him when he spoke of the need to remunerate and to pay a salary scale to the chief executive and some others at top management level there which would be sufficient to attract the best and, having attracted the best, to retain them.  I do not wish to further comment on my Clare-born colleague's contributions, but I will continue with the points I have to make here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to establish the National Development Corporation and I regard it as an essential element in the employment creation programme of the Government.  I feel that it fills an important gap that very clearly exists in the industrial activity of our country.  It is necessary and, indeed, I could point out that there are similar organisations and similar corporations in existence in many other European countries which are working successfully and are achieving results.  I do not think it is necessary for me to detail where these are located but the reality is that they are there.  We have the example and the experience from them.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation, as we have been told, will provide crucial financial support and, more particularly, I would hope, through that financial support, the motivation that industrial development and job creation quite clearly requires.  There are many promising enterprises that never reached their potential through lack of both capital and motivation.  It is in these crucial areas that I can see the National Development Corporation being successful. There are many political industries that are inhibited from achieving their potential by a serious imbalance in the equity and the borrowings of these companies. Where that imbalance is very heavily towards borrowing, the constraints imposed on these companies in regard to expansion and development through the payment of interest and repayment constantly and regularly inhibit the capacity of these companies to expand and to develop.  The problem has been recognised by the Minister and the Government.  It is part of their policy, in attempting to resolve the unemployment <Col N="621" /> situation and to meet the need for additional jobs in this country, to ensure that there can be, through this vehicle, direct State participation in the equity of companies, those that I have referred to and, indeed, similar companies as well.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation can and will invest in enterprises that would not otherwise develop.  They can invest in suitable projects that have the capacity to achieve substantial and viable employment in enterprises that would not otherwise develop.  The corporation, as I see it, provides an investment potential that does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>My colleague referred to the fact that already we have a plethora of State agencies involved in industrial promotion and he mentioned a figure of 23.  I believe that the National Development Corporation will complement the activities of these organisations and agencies that are involved in industrial promotion but it will be substantially different.  It will complement their work.  The Minister has indicated that there are crucial areas in which the National Development Corporation can involve itself.  For example, agricultural produce and food procesing have been mentioned.  I could never understand how the primary national resource of ours has never been properly harvested or harvested to its potential.  Is it lack of capital?  Is it lack of motivation?  Is it lack of know-how?  There has been an absence of real progress in that area of our primary national resource and it is a condemnation of all who have been associated with it that the achievements in realising the potential of food processing and the produce of agriculture have been so lamentably poor.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the availability of the National Development Corporation's involvement in this particular area will provide the inspiration which is needed to achieve satisfactory results there.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not suggesting &mdash; and I doubt if anybody on this side of the House would suggest it &mdash; that the National Development Corporation <Col N="622" /> should get involved in lame duck operations.  Very clearly that cannot be the case.</P>
    <P>Another area is the provision of services to groups of small industries, services in the area of marketing and of research and development.  There is a general acceptance that the capacity of small industries can often be severely inhibited by their inability to fully develop marketing and research because their scale of operations is not large enough to justify the expenditure involved and the resources that are available to them are not sufficient to permit the successful involvement of these smaller industries in market research and development. I believe that this will, in time, prove to be a worthwhile field in the work of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a very important industry that has been clearly starved of the capital it needs for expansion and development. I have no doubt that profitable and worthwhile investment by the National Development Corporation can take place in tourism and affiliated enterprises.  I never want to see the National Development Corporation, and indeed that is not intended, becoming a rescue vehicle for ailing and hopeless operations.  I want to see it as a source of capital injection, capital availability and &mdash; I will emphasise again &mdash; motivation.  Where the commercial capacity of an industry can respond successfully and positively to that participation then it is obvious that we need an organisation such as the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that an obligation on the NDC will be the creation of a revolving fund for employment.  I support the concept of the roll-over on resources. I want to ask why should the NDC settle into a cosy position and sit comfortably on groups of successfully operating concerns? That is not its job.  There must be a challenge and the challenge must continue to be a motivating force to promote successfully, to move out to promote again and to release their investments and to invest again.  I believe that the concept is excellent.  There are <Col N="623" /> successful examples from other countries which can give us encouragment in accepting that the Government are on the right road in this issue.  I welcome the establishment of the NDC and I look forward with confidence to its success in the role that has been assigned to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to warmly welcome Minister O'Sullivan and to wish him well regardless of parties.  He will find, after a while &mdash; I do not know how long he will be here &mdash; that we are a little bit more orderly here although by the time I have finished with the NDC he might have other ideas.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the speeches on the other side &mdash; I suppose I might be making them there myself in a short time &mdash; one realises how many different slants we can get on a piece of legislation.  I ask what will the NDC achieve?  What jobs will it create?  Disregarding what happened last week and this week in the Government, it is well known that Minister Bruton did not want this piece of legislation.  Eventually he just had to row in, but now he is gone and I cannot address my remarks on this matter to him.  Everybody has spoken about more jobs.  I cannot find in the Bill where all these jobs are going to come from.  Like Senator Hillery, I would have preferred if the Minister took a closer look at all other agencies and tried to see if we could deal with employment that way.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the good days are gone.  It is now a matter of the survival of the fittest in industry in this nation. Good companies have come through the recession but they are not any more making profit &mdash; in many cases for good reasons.  I repeat I do not immediately see this Bill providing a remedy.  Perhaps other people on the Government side will make me think differently when more contributions have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that the NDC would support companies which will have an unfair trading advantage over others in the same sector.  Where the State is known to be a significant shareholder the company is likely to secure better credit <Col N="624" /> terms from suppliers and stronger customer support to the detriment of independent competitors in the private sector.  In addition, the State through the NDC should not back companies to compete with other businesses in the private sector.  The Bill suggests that there will be a time limit fixed for each investment. In practice it is impossible to define the duration of a minority equity investment as the sale of the investment will depend, among other things, on the existence of a willing purchaser.  It is proposed to ensure a turnover of investment, but how will the NDC sell a minority shareholding to a private company and who will buy it?  There could be a danger that the NDC becomes a rescue agency for troubled State-sponsored commercial enterprises as it is specifically stated that it will assist, manage or act as a holding company for any State-sponsored enterprise established after the corporation itself.  Will there be pressure to absorb the lame ducks or head up rescue operations? In a lot of legislation coming before us in recent times the Minister has to give this specific approval all the way along. If you set up an agency of the type and composition which I hope the Minister and the Government will do why does it always have to have this instant approval and the watchful eye?</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the NDC value companies on a competitive commercial basis for investment purposes they should be obliged, in most cases, to syndicate their investments with other venture capital companies or investing institutions. The NDC role should be to identify and to lead the way into new investment areas which, later on, will be taken up by the private sector, national resources and the capital for research projects or new high technology enterprises.  Will the NDC try to attract experienced investment personnel to the staff &mdash; Senator Hillery also spoke about this but I think he was referring to the board &mdash; so that the right persons would be on the board and they would have the right staff to ensure that it will work.  Some of my colleagues might say: &ldquo;If you were there you would do the same thing&rdquo; but I hope <Col N="625" /> that the members of this board will not have to have party cards in their pockets to get a place on the board.  This has has been said also by other Senators.  We are, I suppose all at fault in this respect.  If this is to work it would be better that at least the top persons would not have to have party cards in their inside pockets. The board of the NDC should be made up of non-Government, non-civil servant personnel and should consist of professional industrialists.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard confused me when he said that the private sector had failed.  I have no block about whether it should be all private sector or all public sector.  With the state of unemployment as it is in this nation, whether it is half-and-half or three-quarters of one and one-quarter of another, we should not be making these general statements that right across the board the private sector has not worked. That same accusation was made in the other House when ths Bill was going through.  It is wrong to say that the private sector has not worked.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying that this legislation is not overlapping bodies such as the IDA, CII, the Irish Goods Council and others.  I think we have overlapping here.  I would have no trouble &mdash; no matter what the party Whips say to me &mdash; if, listening to the Minister or listening to any of my colleagues on the Government side I could be as convinced as they seem to be that the NDC will create all this employment.  Remember it is the taxpayer who pays in the end, for whatever agencies we decide to add on to the already overcrowded list of agencies.</P>
    <P>There is talk about £300 million for this agency.  Perhaps I am not able to find it but I cannot see any money put aside for this agency in the budget which has just been passed.  Perhaps I cannot switch on where finance is concerned because it is easy to shift the amount I have.  I would love to know how much money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can do without Senator Ferris's interruption.  The Minister stated in his speech that the corporation are to invest only in enterprises which are both profitable and efficient and that furthermore, the corporation have a general duty under section 13 of the Bill to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of employment in the State and to earn a reasonable return for any investment made by it.  It is clashing there again with the IDA.</P>
      <P>We come again to the question of the approval of the Minister.  It is awkward when you change Ministers during the Second Stage of a Bill.  There is a new Minister now.  Every time you look up there is a different Minister.  I wonder why the Minister who has now gone to Finance decided to do away with the National Enterprise Agency while he spoke in his speech of the valuable contribution they had given over the past two years.  Yet when he sets up this NDC the National Enterprise Agency is gone. Senator Michael O'Higgins says there is £900 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also said in his speech that, while the Minister of the day would be empowered to give directives to the corporation under <Col N="627" /> section 31 of the Bill, he would not be empowered to issue such directives in regard to any particular investment in which the NDC is, or is likely to become involved.  I welcome that.  At least he is not going to interfere at that level.</P>
      <P>Further on he said that it is widely recognised in Ireland that there is a shortage of both private and public seed capital for projects.  I have a terrible worry here and I think that Senator Hillery shares it also.  I know that this legislation is going to go through and I would not be so dogmatic as to where my heart is if it gives jobs to people.  But there is nothing in it &mdash; perhaps it will come on stream &mdash; to encourage people.  Let us be honest about it.  We are asking people to invest money to make the NDC workable.  In today's environment, with money so scarce, people who invest funds will have to be sure that there will be some return. We will have to convince them from day one that this is going to work and that the money they invest will give a return. There are still people prepared to invest in this nation a certain amount of money and not look for a great return from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is still important to some people &mdash; perhaps not too many &mdash; but we are asking people to invest money in something and they have a horror of all the agencies.  Perhaps people have arrived at this horribly cynical attitude towards all of us as legislators and see this as another agency and for that reason will not invest their money in it.  It is like the 1 per cent levy and the 2 per cent levy &mdash; people did not see the job creation resulting from those levies.  They saw us as legislators moving money from one Department to another and they are worried that perhaps this is not as sound an idea as it should be.  After some time, when it has proved itself, they may have confidence in it; but it is in the early stages that money will have to be invested in the NDC to make it a success.  I worry about the members of the board.  This Government &mdash; because of the two partners in Government &mdash; have been even <Col N="628" /> worse than we were, and maybe we were bad enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government decided that this appointment as a judge is to be Fine Gael and this appointment of somebody else is Labour.  The NDC, I suppose, is the heart and soul of Labour Party thinking and the Labour Party's input into this Coalition Government; but I bet that the managing director and all the rest will be half and half.  That would be tragic, because the people throughout the country who might be prepared to back a Labour project might not be prepared to back it if they see that sort of composition of a board, which this Government are quite capable of coming up with.  That will be the end of the NDC. I hope that I have got my message across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a whole lot of agencies and now we have the NDC.  I hope that it works, but it certainly is going to clash with some of the agencies already there.  I do not know why the NDC had to push aside the National Enterprise Agency.  There is also a worry with Aer Rianta and all the State bodies about who is going to be talking to whom on the telephone when this legislation goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all convinced that this is going to create jobs.  I wish I could feel as strongly as some of the Senators on the Government side that this NDC is a masterpiece of thinking.  I wish that the Fine Gael people were as convinced as the Labour people that it is going to be a success.  Senator Higgins might state the amount of money &mdash; he obviously knows, I do not &mdash; that will be there after this legislation comes on stream.  Could he say exactly how much money was provided in the last budget for the NDC to be set up? If he is waiting for money to come in <Col N="629" /> from outside I would worry about it.  I am opposed to the NDC because it is duplication of several agencies already there.  Senator Howard seems to have decided that the private sector is finished and gone for scallops&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>

But I can only see another big office and another bunch of managing directors and a board driving around in big cars.  I cannot see how the NDC will create other jobs.  In fact, in fairness to Minister Desmond, he is going to do away with something that we made a mistake in creating and that is the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said what I wanted to say about the NDC.  I am sorry that they did not decide to take on the other agencies and try to combine them rather than create another body, the National Development Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by making a political point that I hope will be of some assistance to historians of the National Development Corporation. Speakers from the opposite side, and indeed speakers from the Opposition in the Dáil, have used the name of the Labour Party more often in connection with this Bill than they have used it in any legislation that I have read in recent years.  That is perfectly correct and predictable. It is a Labour Party proposal for many years now that there be a National <Col N="630" /> Development Corporation.  Having said that, it is also my personal wish, not only as an elected Senator but as a political scientist as well, that there would be far more open discussion of the debates that take place in Cabinet, because if there had been a Labour Party majority in this country and a Labour Government in office I have no doubt that the Bill presently before this House would be in an entirely different form from the Bill which is currently before us.  Honesty behoves me to say that.  It is interesting to tease out the reason for this.  I say it in the fullest respect to the principled people who have become converted to the case for supporting the National Development Corporation in the other House as it passed through and the people who have spoken in favour of it in this House this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In considering the Bill we are asked to place our faith in one of two directions. One of those directions could be roughly called the &ldquo;school of climatology&rdquo;, which has many adherents.  It is rather like in the nineteenth century, when there were people who believed that the major cycles of economic recovery and collapse could be explained by moving sunspots. There are people in the country at present who use this phrase &ldquo;creating a climate for investment&rdquo;.  The chain of logic which they seem to advocate is one that if you somehow or other change the climate reluctant capital &mdash; and remember we have just been told by Senator Professor Brian Hillery that this country was awash with capital and funds seeking investment &mdash; will then automatically find its investment slot.  The assumption is that after these investment slots have been filled we will be witnessing another Industrial Revolution, creating the jobs that our young people want, creating the income which is necessary to be expended in order to create the service jobs, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This &ldquo;school of climatology&rdquo; has many adherents.  They come mostly from the right.  It was not accidental that in the other House one of the sources of information <Col N="631" /> quoted with more frequency than our own Economic and Social Research Institute was, in fact, the Trade Policy Research Institute in London.  Its papers were quoted by several speakers.  It is the one that has been producing this new orthodoxy.  In a review &mdash; and I will come back to this in my speech &mdash; of a number of European economies the London Institute suggested &ldquo;Let us go back to the supremacy of the market place and let us create competitiveness and in time the jobs will come&rdquo;.  I want to say that I find this thinking to be the most dangerous thinking in the social sciences since the great economic collapse of the 1930s. Certainly, it is the exact same thinking which has on several occasions underpinned the preparation for the resolution of economic difficulties through the mechanism of war.</P>
    <P>The second perspective is that we would approach our economic difficulties and our human problems from the perspective of planning.  We have, indeed&mdash; and I think speakers from both sides in both Houses are correct in identifying a problem in this regard &mdash; in this country a hostility to the planning process.  I was not yet a student when the first document which came out of the discussions and the work of the late Mr. Seán Lemass and Dr. T.K. Whitaker, then a senior civil servant &mdash; and a young one &mdash; produced the First Programme for Economic Expansion.  The word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; was used rather than the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo;. Indeed, lurking behind that choice of the word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; was an antipathy to the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; which had gone across all aspects of Irish culture.  We were after two decades during which, for example, when fighting the mother and child scheme in 1951 people had developed the strongest ideological right wing opposition in modern European history to the role of the State.  We were restrained from this because of the enormity of emigration, the change which took place in the transition in Government in 1958, and the whole idea of opening up the economy with certain consequences &mdash; which I will come back to.  The fact was <Col N="632" /> that we inherited an antipathy to the State.  It was to some extent of our own choosing.  We went ahead in our republic and set up, not a general health system but a private system that was not really private except in so far as it was consumed. With the additional money in your pocket you could live off the State, use tax-payer-provided hospitals, doctors and services.  You could pay to be different like you could in the same way in the trains if you had the additional money.  You could not invent a train or provide a train, but you could be in a different part of the train because you could use private money to establish a difference between yourself and others in transport.  There was a comprehensive hostility to the State.  As well as that, there was a social teaching of the major Church which stressed the principle of subsidiarity which makes it difficult even today, for example, for the battered child or the child who is being neglected to secure individual rights in relation to the State's protection, because you have to get past the two great buttressing points of this bourgeois statelet that had called itself a republic &mdash; the family and the market place.</P>
    <P>All of these transitions and this ideology underpinned most of our thinking. In his distinguished history of the Department of Finance Dr. Fanning stressed the importance of the continuity of the orthodox thinking in fiscal and financial management between the British-administered State and the Irish State.  I have looked at these different areas and I have been watching this where it has manifested itself.  What was it made these peasants who had thrown off their empire, unique in Europe in not trusting the State?  It is, of course, to be answered by historians.  What made them amenable to authoritarianism?  Why did they need to be told about everything, from a matter of their salvation, to their experence of spirituality, to why they should be grateful to go to a dispensary and consume health service?  What was this distrust of the State?  It is a good question to ask.</P>
    <P>I want to lay the first point about this Bill <Col N="633" /> right where it belongs.  This Bill raises a question of ideology, a very fundamental question of ideology, the pervasive ideology of the Right in this country.  The people who are opposing this Bill are, I think, from a mixture of motives telling us correctly their worries about different ways in which there might be duplication, and so on.  Why did this Bill come so late?  Opponents of the Labour Party have asked that.  Why did we insist on it? Why did we keep on about it?  I remember very well when the first memo about the National Development Corporation was written.  I remember the people who opposed it.  I remember each vested point of interest that opposed the memo that was prepared in the first Coalition, 1973-77, seeking to bring the National Development Corporation into existence.  The people who opposed it were opposed to the planning process.  They themselves were inheritors of all of this voodoo about the State which has condemned us like voodoo does, to the sickness of an unmanaged economy, a country that had failed its people.  They ran from the country in the boat, some driven, some choosing to go to become a burden on the hospitals, educational institutions and the other services that were being provided by the neighbouring island that we mocked and that was developing a welfare state.  Many a mother followed her children to get her dental care in the island that we were supposed to be at war with &mdash; at least in our hearts &mdash; because they had developed the welfare state.</P>
    <P>What is very interesting now is to see the Trade Policy Research Centre in London churning out the material that in Britain would roll back the welfare state and the health care system, and it has reproduced tuberculosis in Britain by abolishing separate wards for TB.  It is that body which collects statistics that are misleading.  I will come to the quotations used.  They are misleading and dishonest. I must say, as a practising academic, that I would be ashamed to put my name to the documents quoted in the other House.  For example, they ignore countries like Finland; they ignore the Austrian figures; they are totally selective <Col N="634" /> and the figures are distorted where they are presented.</P>
    <P>To come back to our task here, let us listen to the two models we have.  We must make a fundamental choice in this country.  Senator Honan is right about the crisis that exists in relation to confidence in the political and in the economic system.  People are questioning the ability of the political system to respond to the immense social problem that has been created, the ability to provide work, or the ability to provide income for those who now fill the country.  Another colleague stated that emigration has returned &mdash; an indictment again.  It is an indictment of a country that still goes on with this nonsense that the State must be opposed.</P>
    <P>Why would they roll back the State? There are three rough models of the State that one can have.  There is the residual model of the State about which we heard some comments this afternoon and about which we heard a great deal more in the other House, that is, its notion of the deserving poor.  For example, there was the notion in the nineteenth century that conditions should always be a little worse inside the workhouse than they were outside so that there would not be a run on the workhouse and the poor law rate would go up.  There is this kind of residual State with minimal interventions.</P>
    <P>All around the place the lights are going on.  People are saying that the State is wasteful and helping the sick too much. I was reared on this as a child.  I remember such statements being made in the fifties when they were opposing people like Dr. Noel Browne and talking about women in Britain who were supposed to have four sets of false teeth and two pairs of spectacles.  Later on, I read about the origin of the British welfare state and about the Labour socialist politics that took the children out of the mines.  If I had a choice between a woman who had to go blind and toothless or could have two sets of teeth and three pairs of spectacles she could have them all.  There is misery about this State that has now found new focal points in practically every sphere of life.  It is about time it was taken on.  I remember these discussions <Col N="635" /> very well.  When we suggested the National Development Corporation, we had a role for it.  We saw it as a vehicle of State investment in the context of a planned economy.  In the first memo we presented on the document we spoke about different sub-planning commissions which would identify sectoral targets in different parts of the economy and achieve them.  We stressed the importance of their not being in conflict with one another, so that, for example, what one would seek to achieve through the use of agencies in the food processing sector would not conflict with other agencies that were already in existence there.</P>
    <P>The opponents of this Bill are right to an extent.  It is rather like asking converts to become pietistic.  The point is that the Irish public have not given a mandate to a Government to plan their economy in the interest of using resources so as to provide employment.  It has produced a curious amalgam of populisms.  It has now added to these a new foreign-type notion that we will get someone to say what everyone is really feeling in their heart, which is that because I am working and pay tax I should get a little more and retain more of my tax, while ignoring the plight of the unemployed.  That feeling is in the country at present.  This is what is called progress and democracy or progressive democracy.  It is neither.  It is regressive, selfish, mindless and backward-looking.</P>
    <P>When we come to dealing with problems that are facing us at present, we have to make choices.  There is a fundamental difficulty in that regard.  If there is no philosophic commitment to the idea of the social and if, for example, we feel that it is not our responsibility to be concerned about the children of the unemployed father who lives next door to us, but that we are talking about the provision of my job, and if we are talking about the education of children next door or down the road, is it not a backwardness in ourselves that we have no concept of the social?</P>
    <P>At present, all the speeches on this Bill have a message ringing loud and clear &mdash;<Col N="636" /> the private, the private, the private.  It is about the privatisation of experience and behind the phrase &ldquo;Let the market dictate&rdquo;, it is the rule of the strong.  Behind phrases such as &ldquo;The market place&rdquo; and &ldquo;When the climate has been restored and investment takes place&rdquo; is the idea that, once again, we are in a preplanning phase.  At the end of the nineteenth century everyone was supposed to be planners. We are leaving all of the destinies of the people and of the children to chance. Why do we do that?  Because those who will be left to chance will not be the elite who will take this decision, because they have the time to sip their gins and ask the question &ldquo;Perhaps the market place is best?&rdquo; I know people in the Trade Policy Research Centre in London and I know many of these other agencies.  They are not the people who come from the coal faces or from the poor, but very often they are people with limited intelligence who are the inheritors of privilege in Britain. It is the same kind of people who are coming out with this nonsense here.</P>
    <P>When we proposed the National Development Corporation we did so because we believed that we should, even if we did not get political support for it, make the case for the planned economy. It has been shortened by recent events. Let us think of what is at stake around the world at present.  This Bill has focussed a discussion on what we can do ourselves. There are external constraints on the Irish economy that are very real.  There are external constraints in relation to aid, debt, trade and credit.  For example, 65 per cent of the total export earnings of the Mexican economy will go to pay and service the international debt of Mexico. It is a source of wonder to parliamentarians, those of us who have visited Mexico, when, we look down from a window of a hotel at the slums that surround that city, the most urbanised centre in the world, and consider that 65 per cent of their export earnings go to service their debt, not to repay it.  That is reality.  It is not my function here this evening to argue. There is a version of economics at stake which argues for the centrality of the existing modes of relationship of aid, <Col N="637" /> debt, trade and credit in the world at present.  Unless within the next ten years we have a major international conference on the whole question of debt and of restructuring trade, and on changing the nature of credit institutions, there is no prospect for world recovery.  There will be even further debts.  There will be a collapse in most of the development aid programmes.  We could fall back on the classic conservative market-led response to international economic problems of war and famine.  What are we doing in setting up bogey hostilities to the idea of the State taking an initiative in the economy is taking unto ourselves this illness from abroad.  The newspapers write, for example, about another State agency. This is the hysteria that has been created. I repeat, to the point of tedium, that this constitutes an ideology which has stood in the way of progress in this country for so long.</P>
    <P>There are a number of State agencies mentioned.  What is on offer if you do not agree with the National Development Corporation?  My distinguished friend and fellow Clareman, Senator Hillery, stated that the country is awash with funds.  Yet people do not invest.  I could assist him there by suggesting placing a tax on funds that are not invested in industry.  Would he support it?  There is the shortage of viable projects, but we have 23 agencies assisting the intelligence of Irish private industry.  It is said that there must be opportunities for profit.  We have been told that the climate for taxation must be put right.  I agree that there must be changes in taxation.  What will motivate the individualist to think in social terms?  What will motivate people who need all this and much more &mdash; the dis-establishment of the State?  When they have the corpses of the economy around the place they will then be moved to be patriotic and to build up a new Ireland.  Some of them may have the brazen cheek to call it a New Republic, making a mockery of even more words than have been used before.  If you believe in a sane, rational approach towards the economy, you would need a <Col N="638" /> stronger Bill than this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill such as it is.  It needs to be very clearly structured from the very beginning to this question which is reasonably asked: &ldquo;Where will it clash with existing agencies?&rdquo; The National Development Corporation was always seen not as part of the State infrastructure but as an entity in its own right, with the right and capacity to innovate, to identify niches in the international traded sector, where, for a number of reasons, the private sector had shown neither historically nor now any indication of its capacity to become involved.  The private sector is limited by its own tardiness and by the relationship that the financial institutions have with it.  If you like, both have a time horizon that is short, a time horizon that will not take risks both equally in relation to the kind of security and collateral which they require for borrowing in credit.  They have attitudes which are quite different to other countries in Europe and will not expand and move into these niches.  Let us take some of these into account.</P>
    <P>Let us turn the question of our youthful population around.  Let us say that instead of it being a social problem, it could be turned into an asset.  One should be investing in intelligence and taking from that intelligence specialisms that constitute new opportunities.  It is not unreasonable to see the National Development Corporation &mdash; if it is properly envisaged &mdash; buying an entire piece of technological innovation.  What Irish company could do that?  Look at the Irish companies which have become regarded as the most successful.  Part of my existential depression has been the admiration and adulation given to those dreadful Diarmuid MacMorroughs of the &ldquo;Irish Business World&rdquo; who have bought shell companies, wrecked good businesses, speculated on the shares, realised their assets and established themselves as some kind of litany of successes in the Irish business world.  I should like to name some of them, for example, the Fitzwilton Group.  Where are the jobs?  I can tell you where the jobs were.  Who had to pick up the bill when one job after <Col N="639" /> another went when the companies were realised?  The State, of course.  There was no question of rolling back the State then to pay the social welfare that these former working people had, who went to work one morning and were told: &ldquo;Your life is now changed, not that it has changed but we are no longer trading.  We are not manufacturing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What were they doing?  They were speculating.  The whole record of the Irish business sector in this regard has been that if it wanted to clean up its own stable there was a lot of manure it could have shifted in relation to selling itself as something interested in a viable Irish economy. All the incentives of the State were thrown at these people.  The adulation of the media was given to them.  They were interviewed on how they reared their children, what kind of wives they liked to marry and what kind of plane they liked to fly.  There was grossness in personal behaviour and ignorance &mdash; all of this because it had been managed on a &ldquo;trick of the loop&rdquo; operation on the Irish stock market, leading, as I have so often quoted, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, a former distinguished member of the House, to express publicly his concern at what was happening to the Irish Stock Exchange in the seventies because of the operation of these people.</P>
    <P>That is an aside and it took from my main argument.  My argument is that the Irish private sector has not the resources, it has not the borrowing capacity and it has not the equity infrastructural support to become involved in the trading activities, one of which I have mentioned, in the technological sector.  Neither has it the marketing expertise nor has it the time horizon which is most important &mdash; that is, the ability to be able to last out in a market place in which you want to establish a centre of excellence and a sufficient length of time to perform and to provide the jobs.</P>
    <P>To turn away from that sector, there are endless opportunities to which the NDC, when it was originally envisaged, should turn itself.  Some of these have <Col N="640" /> been mentioned.  The scandal, for example, of exporting our agricultural produce in a raw state with very little value added. There are examples like this staring us in the face.  That was not in the trade policy of Denmark which has a State company that now becomes a net importer of food, sending it out again in finished form, for example, sausage meats, cheese products, powdered products.  These are all possibilities whereby the scale of the investment &mdash; the research and development and the marketing &mdash; can be provided by the State with a different time horizon and with a different relationship to equity investment than the private investor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have adopted an unusual procedure this evening in the sense that it is very seldom that we move the Adjournment of the Seanad for matters which are considered to be important. The matter that is under discussion this evening is a matter of grave concern not alone to us in this House, not alone to people in the other House, not alone to people who are alive in Ireland today, but indeed I consider that it is of importance that we have a full debate on the activities of this plant in as much as it might concern the unborn.  I am not an <Col N="641" /> expert in the nuclear area; unfortunately, there seems to be very few experts in that area.  Again, unfortunately, those who consider themselves to be experts seem to disagree as to the element of danger involved in the organisation and management of a nuclear plant.  But whatever our concerns are about the organisation and methodology of the running of a nuclear plant, it appears that Sellafield is badly run, badly organised and is a health hazard, not alone for people in this country but equally for people in England.  It would also appear that, unfortunately, one of the only reasons that that plant is kept in production is because of the fact that a large number of people are employed there.</P>
      <P>British Nuclear Fuels Limited, who run the plant, seem to feel that because they are major contributors to the social, economic and cultural life of the area surrounding that plant they can do whatever they like and it does not make any difference what happens as a result of what they do.  It is interesting to read on the front page of the <i>New Statesman</i> in its edition of 19 September 1984:</P>
      <P>The Sellafield connection &mdash; BNFL welcomes you to Sellafield.  Do not bathe.  Do not touch any man made object.  Do not breathe too deeply.</P>
      <P>It is equally extremely interesting to read that BNFL are very involved in &ldquo;enviromental protection&rdquo;.  BNFL admitted to the membership of the Cumbria Tourist Board that, nestling at the edge of the country's foremost national park amid spectacular scenery, according to the tourist board information, is a unique nuclear attraction for tourists.  The chairman of the tourist board was, and still is, Labour Councillor, Tony Hildrop, employed at Sellafield on the advanced gas-cooled reactor.  Again not a word of condemnation has been uttered by the tourist board over the November contamination incident and the consequent collapse of the coastal tourist trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that nobody goes to visit the beaches around Cumbria.  We have heard in this country over the last number of years doctors, scientists and <Col N="642" /> interested people suggesting that there may be causation factors in medical problems from the Sellafield project.  We have heard of a very high incidence of stillbirth in areas on the east coast of Ireland which could possibly be as a result of the wind drift from Sellafield.  We have heard of the possible consequences of deformity in children.  We have heard of high instances of radiation in fish and of radioactive levels in the Irish Sea in areas where there is no doubt that Sellafield could be a causation factor.  Radioactivity near the plant is reckoned to be higher than in other areas on the west coast of England.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the consequences of radioactivity.  We have been advised that the radioactivity levels as a result of the mismanagement of that plant have been high, but no higher than one would get from the natural environment surrounding an area in which there was not a nuclear plant.  But, however there is no doubt but that this plant, which has been in operation since the fifties, is outdated and badly run.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that we in this House should support the Minister in his efforts to have a full and frank investigation made as to what happens in that plant.  We should ensure that there is a full and frank discussion at EC level, not alone about this plant, but about other plants which are out of date, which are badly managed and which are supported by a Government which do not seem to care what happens to either the people in their area or on this side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The official report about the latest Sellafield incident suggests that the wind was coming from the east so that there would have been no damage behind the wind. But of course there would not have been very much damage because the wind was blowing towards Ireland.  Any difficulties that would have come about, if there are difficulties, would have come across to Ireland rather than have been a problem in England.  There is no regular monitoring. We cannot control the monitoring because Sellafield are giving false information. <Col N="643" /> They have given out false information to the Black committee which reported on that plant.  They gave false information last week when they suggested that only two people might have been contaminated and it turned out that at least 11 people were contaminated; and one of them had more than the level of contamination that would be acceptable in a year's radiation factor.</P>
    <P>In this House this evening I sincerely hope that we can just add to the voice of the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy and our MEPs who are raising this matter in Europe to ensure that that plant is properly monitored.  I would suggest that the plant be closed down.  I would suggest that, if we get a proper monitoring body in the EC, it would end up in a total closure.  It is easy to be flippant about this matter.  It is easy to suggest that it is not a matter of major urgency because it does not effect us today.  I have six children and I sincerely hope that not one of them comes into contact with a radioactivity level which is man made.  If there is a radioactivity level in this country which is naturally there, there is nothing we can do about it.  But we should have some control over the unnatural emission from a plant which is badly managed and in which the management tell lies all along the line.  They tell lies not alone to the EC but also to the Black committee.  I will quote from a report of a debate in the House of Commons in 1983:</P>
    <P>The discharges followed the washing out of the reprocessing plant in the course of annual maintenance.  Following a management error in the operation of that plant,</P>
    <P>They admit that there is a management error.</P>
    <P>radioactive liquids including solvent, and particulate matter of higher than normal activity, were transferred to a sea tank.  Attempts were made to transfer the more active material to another storage tank.  This was only partially successful and a significant <Col N="644" /> quantity of radioactivity was discharged to the sea.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 there have been more significant emissions which have not been properly monitored.  I am afraid that I have no further confidence in the management of that plant.  Not alone that but I have no confidence in the British Government in their monitoring of the management of that plant.  The debate also stated:</P>
    <P>Real anger and concern felt by the community in west Cumbria and people much further afield about this incident, which is widely regarded as something that simply should not have happened...it calls into question the competence of management at the plant and that public acceptance of the nuclear industry's operations has thus been unnecessarily damaged.</P>
    <P>We have all watched films of what can happen if there is a nuclear discharge in an area.  We always see, and it has been put across very well by the operators of nuclear plants, that they provide very necessary employment in areas of high unemployment.  The reason some of these plants go into these areas is that no other plant would go in there anyway. Therefore they put what is an unnecessary plant, a plant which is unsafe, into an area of high unemployment and they get away with it.  I sincerely hope that that is something that we, in this country, would not accept.  We are in the wind drift of that plant.  We are in the sea drift of that plant and as a result we seem to be the people who will ultimately have to bear the brunt of the problems associated with it, whether these problems are health or otherwise.  It is unfortunate that we do not have the results of major studies that are being carried out into cancer, stillbirth and Downs Syndrome problems. The number of problems that are being investigated as a result of the operation of that plant which have not yet been brought back are too numerous to mention.</P>
    <P>Apparently not only the French were pursuing Greenpeace.  BNFL pursued Greenpeace for contempt of court and as <Col N="645" /> a result Greenpeace were fined £50,000 for producing a report which said that BNFL were producing emissions which were higher than normal.  If that is justice I am a Dutchman.  When I say Dutchman I do not mean that in a pejorative sense. As far as emission standards from Sellafield are concerned we have nothing but glowing reports, and the glow is all from the radiation which the people who have been in contact with it have felt.  Sellafield is likely to be raised in the European Parliament and I hope it is.  I think that Sellafield should be closed down.  It has been accepted in most areas that it would have been closed down were it not for the high employment content in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be over-alarmist. When I walk out the door I do not know whether I breathe air which has a lot of radiation in it.  Maybe there is natural radiation in the air outside and if that is so, so be it.  I do not want to walk out into an atmosphere which is being polluted artificially by a factory which is being badly managed and which does not have the type of control that anyone would consider to be normal in a factory which has chemical or nuclear possibilities.</P>
    <P>One paper stated that a Dundalk doctor is worried by the stillbirth rate. Anybody who watched the programme on stillbirths on RTE some time ago in which a study was done by a group of school children from a particular area around Dundalk on a group of girls who had gone to a school in Dundalk, would realise that there was an abnormally high stillbirth rate among the girls who went to that school during the time of emissions from Sellafield in the late fifties.  It stated that what is particularly worrying is that we are still getting a high number of stillbirths among first time pregnancies. One group of 57 had two or more miscarriages and 312 pregnancies between them.  Out of that figure they had a total of 163 miscarriages.  That is according to Dr. Mary Grehan at a meeting of the Irish College of General Practitioners, and that to me was more startling.  If someone had a miscarriage one would hope they would be luckier the next time. The normal rate is only 11 per cent to 26 <Col N="646" /> per cent for a subsequent miscarriage. This group had a figure of 52.2 per cent. There is no generalisation in this.  It is suggested that the high stillbirth rate is due to a badly managed nuclear plant.</P>
    <P>To allow other speakers to contribute to this debate I do not intend to go any further except to say to the Tánaiste when he goes to speak at either European or British level that that plant should be closed down.  He should say that and say it categorically.  If it is ever reopened it should reopen with every possible management technique to ensure that no emissions are allowed into the Irish Sea. Even if it means that there will be a higher than normal unemployment level in that area we must ensure that even the remotest possibility of problems in Ireland is eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to commend Senator Lanigan for affording this House the opportunity of debating this most urgent and crucial issue.  I am cognisant of the fact that many Senators from all sides of the House wish to contribute on it, and I will keep my own remarks as brief as possible so that the full crossparty feelings of the House on this issue are on the record in support of the Tánaiste's actions in underlining the point to BNFL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in the whole nuclear industry goes back quite some time to the proposal in the later part of the seventies to establish a nuclear power facility in this country at Carnsore Point, some 12 miles from my own home.  That project was heartily welcomed by the people of Wexford in the beginning because it afforded some hope to an area which was at that time beginning to feel the brunt of unemployment.  The Wexford council of trade unions and the workers of Wexford looked foward with relish to the jobs that would be the spin-off from that facility.  However, as the people of Wexford dug deeper and deeper into the workings of this proposed facility and the sister facilities around the world, we learned slowly and carefully of the dangers that this plant would pose to the Irish people and to the people of Wexford in <Col N="647" /> particular.  We organised ourselves and the culmination of the determined will of the people of Wexford and the people of Ireland was that no such facility was ever built, to the eternal credit of this country.</P>
    <P>I had the dubious privilege two years ago of visiting Sellafield at the invitation of BNFL to view the marvellous facilities they had there.  Certainly, every effort was made by the employees to convince us of the soundness of the facility and those operating it and of the care with which they carried out their duties.  However, I for one was not convinced.  The delegation involved all three major parties and none of the delegation went away happy from that visit.</P>
    <P>The history of Sellafield, formerly Windscale, is a straighforward one. Windscale was originally established not as an integral part of the British energy programme but more an integral part of the British military programme.  It was an integral part of the nuclear deterrent that Britain was determined to have in the post-war phase.  The whole history of radiation and the dangers of radiation are very recent.  The first man-made atomic explosion took place during the Second World War, so the history of man-made radiation is some forty-odd years old.  We have learned a lot in that 40 years but every year that passes teaches us more. Every year that passes warns us of the safety standards that we have and requires those in the industry to constantly modify and reduce the acceptable level of radiation to which citizens are exposed. The standards that were in place 30 years ago bear no resemblance to the standards in place now.  I believe firmly that the standards that are in place now as acceptable will be modified beyond all reason in the future because there is obviously no level of radiation that is acceptable.  This facility across the Irish Sea poses a threat to the entire population of this country.</P>
    <P>Sellafield poses a problem when it is working normally.  It gives off emissions of radioactive effluent into the Irish Sea making it, many contend, one of the most radioactive polluted seas in the world. <Col N="648" /> But when it has one of its so-called incidents &mdash; a euphemism used in the nuclear industry for accidents and for mishaps &mdash; obviously the threat to the Irish people is multiplied by an enormous factor.  That is the situation in the short term.  In the long term the dangers imposed on the Irish and the British people by this facility include disposal of the high level of waste which is currently stored on land within the Sellafield complex.  There is no adequate solution to the waste storage problem.  Scientists within the nuclear industry have spent year after year devising new strategies for disposing of this high level of waste.  The theories they have come up with so far have ranged from encasing it in concrete and dumping it in the sea to encasing it in glass and burying it in geologically stable rock formations on land.  Neither is a particularly desirable legacy to leave to future generations. This business is unhealthy, unsafe and a liability for countless generations to come.</P>
    <P>From the Irish perspective we have had as I said the Carnsore experience.  We have had the benefit of the debate that the Carnsore proposal engendered in Ireland. We know the cost and we have rejected that.  We have said as a people, that we will not accept the nuclear option. But like it or not we are faced with the threat of nuclear contamination, not from a facility operated to the benefit of the Irish people but from a facility which gives us no benefit whatsoever.  It is wholly and totally unacceptable that the Irish people should be adversely and directly affected by a facility such as this.</P>
    <P>Another factor I would like to put on record of the House is the danger posed not only from the operation of the plant itself but because of the associated dangers with this facility.  It is one of only two reprocessing facilities in Western Europe.  The other one is at Cape de la Hage in France.  Other nuclear facilities around the world use Windscale as a dumping ground for their nuclear waste. They are quite happy to pay BNFL who have a very healthy profit margin at the end of the year.  They are quite happy to be the nuclear dustbin of the world.  The <Col N="649" /> nuclear rubbish passes frequently up and down the Irish coast in vessels on their way to dock at facilities near Cumbria. Standing at Carnsore point, the wouldbe site of the first Irish nuclear facility, one can actually see vessels moving up St. George's Channel, hugging the coast on their way to Cumbria with their deadly cargoes.  God help us if there is ever an accident on board one of those vessels, which obviously would be another major source of contamination for the Irish Sea and the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>That is the situation.  What are we going to do about it as a people?  It is a fact that we have been more than tolerant of this facility. Those of us who have been involved in monitoring this issue over many years have never demanded before that the facility should close.  We were aware that 11,000 people, a staggering number, are employed in the facility and associated companies from the Cumbrian region.  We said that we could not demand that it should close.  But now we have reached the stage, with three significant admitted accidents in as many weeks, where we can tolerate no more.  I now call for it to be closed.  I ask the Tánaiste when he goes to meet his British counterparts not simply to ask for increased information or increased monitoring. We know the damage it is doing. It must close.  It must no longer pose a major threat to Irish people, born and unborn.  I would ask the Attorney General to advise the Government on what legal redress is open to the Irish people to take action to protect themselves from this menace.  I make no apology for calling it that now.  The lovely phrase used by the industry itself is that they want to reduce emissions to what they call ALARA, which means as low as reasonably achievable.  As far as I am concerned no level is low enough to satisfy me.  No level is acceptable to me and I urge and request the Tánaiste, with the support of the Government, to immediately demand the closure of this facility and the removal of this threat, which hangs as a giant nuclear shadow over us all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also welcome the speed with which the Seanad has been allowed to debate this very serious subject and also the unanimity with which the parties this evening have approached it?  That is in some way in contrast to what happened in the other House yesterday because this is too serious an issue to make party political points about.  It is an issue which affects us all.  It is not an issue about which anybody should be in any way frivolous.</P>
      <P>We have a common interest with the British Government in what happens at Sellafield and I am not sure that we are right in this House in an outright condemnation of the British Government at this stage because it is in the British Government's interest as well that nothing goes wrong in Sellafield, that there is no leakage of nuclear waste.  I hope that in the spirit, if not as part of the institutional structure of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, representations made on this to the British Government are listened to and acted upon.  It will be a significant factor to see what response we get on an issue of this sort, which affects us all.</P>
      <P>Like the other speakers in this House, I am technically very deficient on matters to do with nuclear energy.  We are not, as far as I know, in any immediate danger as a result of what happened yesterday and the series of events, but that is irrelevant because what we are talking about is a principle and we could easily be in immediate danger if something far more serious had happened in Sellafield over the years.  Unfortunately, there could be a much greater catastrophe in Sellafield and we are lucky I suspect that the series of relatively minor events have given us a warning and leave us prepared for something much worse that could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why it is right that this debate was allowed today, as it is a matter of urgent national interest because of its potential danger.  On a very basic level it is a civil right and a civil liberty of every citizen of this country and of Great Britain that we should not be exposed to contamination from nuclear waste.  That is why it is important.  That is why I think <Col N="651" /> it may be, as was said yesterday in the other House, a matter for the European Commission on Human Rights.  It is an infringement of citizens' civil rights that they should be contaminated by nuclear energy against their wishes, leaving them helpless.  We know very little because the release of information has been so scarce and misleading but what we do know about Sellafield is that there is something seriously wrong there.</P>
    <P>The series of events that have happened are not a total coincidence I suggest. There are too many of them in the last month for us not to know that something is wrong, at least with the safety procedures or with the monitoring in Sellafield and we have a right &mdash; and it is no interference with the British Government's position &mdash; to ask what is wrong and to demand that it is put right. In practical terms, it is unrealistic for us to say that we demand that Sellafield be closed.  In practical terms I suspect that Sellafield will not be closed but we do know that on 5 February radioactive plutonium gas escaped.  We do know that 11 men were affected and, as Senator Lanigan said, one to the maximum limits of what a man is allowed to be affected in this position and we do know that BNFL issued a totally misleading statement about it.  When we are getting misleading information on a matter as serious as that.  We know that there is a cover up going on and it must be investigated.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, again, we had a similar situation and I do not believe that any statements from BNFL on yesterday have any credibility any more.  Sellafield is, to say the very least, a highly accident prone situation and there is no point in speculating on the theories of what is happening. What we do know is that we will have to demand an investigation to see that the monitoring procedures are right.  It is also alarming to have read about a <i>Sunday Times</i> report which said that earlier in the history of nuclear energy a statement was issued, which is now being exposed, which shows that the exposure to radiation was 40 times greater than what was revealed at the time.  When we are dealing <Col N="652" /> with such a sensitive issue as this, we know that we have consistently been misled.</P>
    <P>I do not know the best solution to this; but I suspect it is not, as has been suggested, that an Irish presence specifically be put in Sellafield.  As Senator Lanigan said, this matter is so serious that not just a debate here will bring it to the attention of BNFL, but it should be taken into the European arena.  Whether it is debated in the European Parliament or not &mdash; and it appears that this item for some reason has been moved down the agenda &mdash; I believe there is an unanswerable case for putting in inspectors or a European commission to investigate what is going on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this not as a scientist but simply as a citizen of this country getting slightly alarmed at the way things are going.  Reference has already been made to the standards by which Sellafield must work, this ALARA principle, which is as low as reasonably achievable.  For something as serious as Sellafield to talk about as low as reasonably achievable &mdash; what &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; means I do not know and what is reasonable at this stage could be a disaster in ten years' time.  If they added &ldquo;M&rdquo; to it and made it &ldquo;alarm&rdquo; and decided that it should be to allow the least amount of radioactive material, they might be getting much nearer to the point.</P>
      <P>When I consider that reports which were given back in 1954 and 1955 were wrong and that the leakages and the radioactivity was 40 times stronger than they actually said, it makes me wonder what exactly is going on in that establishment. When there is radioactive plutonium escaping and workers contaminated and the workers there going on a half day strike, it makes me much more worried than I normally would be, because they are the people inside this plant.  They know what is going on.  They obviously can see danger to themselves and, therefore, they are taking an active part in making sure that there is some improvement on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many contradictions on this that it is hard to know what the <Col N="653" /> real story is.  The Dundalk babies were mentioned already, and the suggestion was that this escape did not help them. The Black report said that leukaemia was not caused by Sellafield, so it is very hard to know what exactly is going on.  I read in today's edition of the paper that about 250 gallons of contaminated water escaped from a broken drain pipe into an open trench and the authorities at the complex admitted to this.  If in some place as serious as that a broken drain pipe can allow radioactive material to escape then we are really at the pits because any of us who have houses of our own would not have drain pipes leaking.  We would be embarrassed from a pride point of view alone, but if that statement which is attributed to the authorities is true then it is an absolute disaster.  It seems to me like a place that is kept together with strings and pieces of wire, a thing of shreds and patches or a type of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but with far more danger.  Regardless of the employment that is given there, we may have a far more serious happening here than unemployment if something goes wrong there. I am not a scientist and do not really know what could go wrong over there but, reading what we have at the moment leaves you wondering quite a lot about what could happen over there.</P>
    <P>I will not call on the Minister to do anything because I trust the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach.  They are over there today meeting the people involved.  I hope they know exactly what is going on there and I will leave it to their judgment.  I am glad they are meeting their counterparts in England because this problem is something we may regret very much in ten years' time.  We do not know.  What is being dumped at the moment may be far too strong and perhaps it will not disappear as it is supposed to.  We could be hanging a time bomb around our necks.  The stronger the line we take on it the better, because our future could be at stake and certainly the future of our children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about this matter at a time when the Seanad is about <Col N="654" /> to debate the Air Pollution Bill which I know is a totally different matter.  It is a totally different form of pollution.  Nonetheless, not for the first time we can say that pollution of some kind or other is something than concerns all of us.  This nuclear plant at Sellafield is causing problems not for the first time.  For the second time in two weeks it has again caused real problems and concern for many people.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne referred to the most recent leak, that of 20 gallons of contaminated water which escaped, as he said, from a broken drain pipe into an open trench, seemingly all taken very casually. Surely this would not happen on an ordinary farm.  It seems to me that that particular event and, indeed, the leakage of the radioactive plutonium gas which escaped into a building of the plant on 5 February, is taken far too easily and casually.  Senator Browne referred to the fact that so many hundreds of workers, employees of the plant, decided that they should strike for proper safety regulations. This further highlights the fact that it is a very, very serious matter indeed.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that massive untruths, massive coverups, massive doubts have been expressed right across the board in regard to this serious problem.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Department of Health in England and British Nuclear Fuels Limited, who are the people who run the plant, are playing down this very important matter.  If it is such a serious matter, as we all know it is, why are they continuing to play down the matter?  It appears to me very strongly that we are not being told the truth, that the workers are not being told, that people close by are not being fully informed of the real dangers that exist in this area.  We have lost total confidence in the full safety regulations of that plant.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the Greenpeace people.  I can recall them saying some years ago warning that Sellafield was the single most polluted nuclear establishment in the world.  That is something we should consider and if it is, certainly very strict safety measures must be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people on the east coast of this <Col N="655" /> country are concerned.  As we all know, north County Dublin and County Meath area on the east coast are areas renowned for potato growing and for major food products generally.  The Irish Sea continues to be a potential time bomb.  It should not be, as it seems to be now, in some way a nuclear tiphead for any other nation in the world.  Obviously, the EC have a role to play also.  The EC are a very responsible forum in regard to this type of problem.  We should demand from them a full inquiry into all the safety aspects of Sellafield.  The public fears of the people of Ireland and, indeed, of England in regard to the safety precautions must be allayed at all costs.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are in England today.  I understand from a radio interview that the Taoiseach said our people were concerned and, of course, he is correct.  On the same radio bulletin the British Environment Minister said that the record in Sellafield has been good.  Again, there is confusion.  There seems to be a playing down by the British of this terrible problem.  If the safety standards continue to be defective, then we and the EC must call for the closure of this plant irrespective of the consequences.  I am very much aware that there are 11,000 people working there and that is something we must consider.  Living in the nuclear age many young people are quite concerned about the whole nuclear problem.  I can recall seeing a film approximately one year ago &mdash;&ldquo;D Day&rdquo;&mdash; it was the talk of the country for about a month afterwards.  We saw horrific sights on that film.  Our young people are more concerned with nuclear problems than with any other.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I do not profess to be an expert but, if leakages of nuclear waste continue at Sellafield, that must spell out great danger for our planet.  It has been said that the plant in Sellafield is badly managed.  We know that it can be a health hazard causing problems like cancer, Down's syndrome in children, and so on.  It is a potential time bomb.  It is a highly accident prone area.  If those <Col N="656" /> problems continue, irrespective of the amount of employment it creates in England, our Government and the EC have no other choice than to call for the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem we are faced with in this debate is that all of us are expressing the concern that we should rightly express particularly having regard to the widespread concern of people throughout the country irrespective of whether they are living on the east coast or in the centre of the country.  All of them feel that if they are in line with the prevailing winds somehow their lives and the lives of their children are endangered. None of us is competent to tell them whether or not this is true.  All we can do is use the House of the Oireachtas in support of the Government, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach who are in London today with the Prime Minister.  The Minister for State, Deputy Collins is present and I understand that the Tánaiste will reply to the debate.  We can only be supportive of them in their actions in trying to ensure that the authorities with responsibility for Sellafield are fully aware of our concern and the concern that has been expressed to us by our constituents.  In doing that, none of us wants to create mass hysteria but we have a bounden duty, as legislators, to ensure that when we want to express concern we do it in this House in a reasonable way.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Lanigan for having initiated this emergency debate and because of this that I was one of the first to stand today with him in agreeing that the House should avail of the opportunity of expressing this concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, first of all, because the type of information we have got from the management of this plant has been questioned.  The level of information has been questionable and its reliability is also in question.  There is no doubt from comparisons with what they said in the beginning and what they said later, even to the Black report, that it must be an indication that even in their minds &mdash; and this plant was established in 1952 &mdash; there <Col N="657" /> is some doubt as to what information is to be released or not on how valid the information is or the level of damage being done to the environment, the sea, the inhabitants or the workers in the plant.  They seem to be unsure.  They tell us in a reassuring kind of way that a length of time must elapse between an unplanned incident, as they call it, and the fullest research they want to carry out before they can give us the full information.</P>
    <P>I know that when the Tánaiste was Minister for the Environment he set up a United Kingdom/Ireland contact group dealing with nuclear matters in 1984 with Mr. Jenkin.  I should like to congratulate him on the initiative.  We have now at least an agreement that they will tell us when something goes wrong, even if they still are reassuring us that it was a minor incident &mdash; for example, that the spillage was still contained, that it was not in an open pipe but it was within the plant. Senator Howlin has been to Sellafield and the only ones I saw were seven or eight years ago in Sweden.  Even then they had a referendum there to close them.  They had no problems.  Why should we not be concerned with plants that do have problems?  At least we are getting the information quickly.  Yesterday's incident was communicated to the Government formally within 20 minutes of its happening, which is to be welcomed.  At least they are confiding in us.  They have an open invitation for us to visit them.</P>
    <P>It is because of the age of this plant, going back to the fifties, that we realise much of it needs to be replaced.  If in the replacement process this creates further problems about leakage into the sea or emissions into the air or spillages, accidental or otherwise, obviously we have a major environmental problem on our doorstep that we must address and we must support the Government in any steps considered necessary, whether at Anglo-Irish inter-parliamentary level, the European Parliament or whatever else.  It is important that all the avenues should be explored to ensure that cognisance is taken by the British of the concern that all of us are now expressing. <Col N="658" /> Many of us live closer to Sellafield than many other people in Britain do.  They happen to be on the same land mass.  All of us are living in the downstream of it and we are living in the prevailing wind flow from that country.  This must be a cause of concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>Whether these discussions will lead to the closure, the phasing out or the replacement of part of the plant, I do not know.  Nobody knows whether the levels are minute or acceptable.  If they build up into a problem or if it accumulates in some way, we do not know.  If the people involved in it, cannot give us the information, then some steps will have to be taken to stop it being used as a dumping ground for the reprocessing of everybody else's nuclear waste, which is what is happening now.</P>
    <P>Because of the employment situation the British Government might perhaps be slow to do something about it.  Possibly we would be, too.  The overall implications for all of us are so serious that all of us in this House want to support the Government and the Ministers in any actions that are required to be taken to ensure that, even if it is outside of our jurisdiction, we should bring pressure to bear on them because they have a bounden responsibility to all of us as well as to themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when half of the world's population suffer from varying degrees of hunger and when thousands die every minute through starvation and when at the same time super powers and other powers pursue developments in nuclear power the misuse of which creates such a fear in the public mind, it is only right that this House this evening, in the light of the events in Sellafield that have been portrayed in recent times through the news media and other sources, should express its gravest concern at a classic sample of how far the official authorities will go in concealing from the public what are the real facts of this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the level of incompetence and the fact that the authorities, in the face of what has been a public outcry &mdash; in <Col N="659" /> Britain in the first instance over a very prolonged period and now developing in this country &mdash; at the manner in which this plant is being operated and the fear it creates among the people in England and here.  How can we believe that even the facts or the figures in relation to discharges are accurate and are of a proportion not to harm the atmosphere or our seas and create a public health danger? How can we have any accurate assessment of what has happened in the last month or couple of months when only now we are discovering the real facts about what took place 30 years ago?  If one was driving an old car which was giving the amount of trouble which this plant has given in the last couple of months, that car would not be road worthy.  When one is dealing with a plant, the malmanagement of which could have such lethal consequences for the people of the UK and of this country, it is just hard to imagine that those in authority would conceal from the public the facts about it or would not respond with the technology that is available, with the skills that are available today, in a way which would ensure that these leaks would not take place.  Having had that experience on one occasion, one would assume that they would immediately provide whatever Government resources were necessary and whatever skills were required to ensure that this would not be repeated.  Yet, we have a procession of events not just one month after another but now we have had three leaks in the course of a few days.  Yesterday we had yet a further leak.  This is creating a sense of fear in the people here and across the water about the future.  We would be wrong not to publicise this and to bring it before the Government.  I understand from the news media that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State have been endeavouring to grapple with this to the best of their ability.  It is not something that can be left to the British Government.  The consequences of the malmanagement of Sellafield have repercussions which do not reside alone in the <Col N="660" /> United Kingdom; they have consequences which are far-reaching.</P>
    <P>Most Senators have re-emphasised the fact that the Black report hid from the public mind very significant facts and that the amount of discharge was as much as 40 times greater than what was disclosed at the time.  We have varying medical reports here with regard to stillbirths, miscarriages which are double the normal rate, cancer and leukaemia in young people.  All of this may not be in the least attributable to Sellafield; we do not know.  We need to have the facts established on the firmest basis.  We need to have the best available talent in these disciplines brought together, both from our point of view and from a European point of view, so that the mistakes that have been made, the consequences of which we probably do not know, will now end and will not be repeated in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, but there are some important points which have not been made.  Among those is the fact that nuclear power has been one of the historic discoveries and developments of this century.  This is both for good and evil.  The population in the main are thinking of it more from an evil point of view.  However, successive Irish Governments have championed the cause of nuclear disarmament.  Frank Aiken spoke of little else year after year for 20 years.  The present Government have continued the same policy.  I should like to compliment the Tánaiste and the Minister of State for Energy in this regard for their diligence and constant communication with their counterparts in the United Kingdom and also with Commissioner Clinton Davies in Brussels. I cannot think of any other area of policy or trade where there is such close co-operation. This is rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate if people react to the problems being experienced in the plant in Sellafield.  I regret that some Members feel that it should be closed down.  Our scientists must redouble their efforts to harness successfully and safely this great invention, which is atomic energy.  The weight of development should be <Col N="661" /> directed towards ensuring the use of atomic power for peaceful purposes.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Tánaiste what the situation is regarding the European Community's JET programme, which, I understand, is based in the United Kingdom. That concerns nuclear fusion rather than the fission that causes all these problems. Ten years ago there was great hope for this development as the answer to the fall-out and the dangers that nuclear energy has caused and the fears that are embedded in people's minds.  This has emanated, I suppose, from the bombs that were dropped at the end of the last war.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Leader of the Opposition in the House for putting down this motion and giving the House an opportunity of focusing attention on the problem.  I hope that the Tánaiste will allay the fears of many people in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity which has been given to us by the Leader of the Opposition in the House to discuss this matter.  I welcome this debate.  Like my colleague, Senator Ross, I also welcome the unanimity throughout the House on the subject. This is something which transcends any party lines.  It is a cause of concern for Irish people, whatever their political opinions may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole atmosphere surrounding the plant at Sellafield is one of what might be described as &ldquo;newspeak,&rdquo; if one remembers George Orwell's <i>Ninteen Eighty Four.</i>  The people, who run Sellafield think that if they call it something else it will stop being dangerous or it will stop being a threat.  It used be called Windscale, and we remember that as a threat.  Then Windscale got to be an unpopular name because too many things happened and there were too many threats and so on.  So, low and behold, the name was changed to Sellafield and Sellafield is a new, clean and untouched name where there is no danger at all.  Therefore, we are led to believe that everything is all right.  Now, more and more, we get things happening at Sellafield.  Perhaps <Col N="662" /> any day now we may find that Sellafield has ceased to be; that the &ldquo;Ministry of Truth&rdquo; has moved in on Sellafield as well and we will have it called something else entirely and we start all over again.</P>
    <P>The attention of the House has been drawn by a previous speaker to the use of the word &ldquo;incident&rdquo; to cover these things which happen.  An &ldquo;incident&rdquo; is a harmless sort of thing which might happen to a bishop.  This is not an incident. These are negligent errors that are happening in the management of Sellafield. They are not just accidents; these are things that should not happen. Whether they are highly dangerous to us or whether they are not, most of us are not qualified to say.  Nevertheless, anyone who is interested in safety in industry would be trying to prevent this kind of negligent error.  Therefore, we have to blame the management in Sellafield and, at a distance, the British Government, who allow Sellafield to go on, for the recurrence of these negligent errors.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about this is that we do not know how dangerous it is.  Perhaps it is not dangerous and perhaps it is; but we cannot be sure.  We have been fed over the years false or questionable information about what is happening.  In the last few days we have had the announcement that only two workers were affected and then there was an admission that perhaps it was 11 and that one man, unfortunately, had a near-overdose of radiation and had to be removed from any radiation in future.  How can we trust what is being said to us when it changes from day to day?  Perhaps our fears are groundless. It is difficult to feel that this is so.  Once we start interfering with our environment and the surroundings of the earth, with the air and the sea, we cannot tell what chain of events we are starting off and where that chain of events will end.</P>
    <P>This was one of the things that motivated the people Senator Howlin was referring to who campaigned against the establishment of a nuclear power station in Carnsore Point.  Perhaps we were in a way lucky that the demand for electricity in this country did not increase as rapidly as was anticipated and therefore, the <Col N="663" /> need for Carnsore Point receded and the need for this kind of plant ceased to be such an important matter.  Therefore, we were let off the hook.  We have a good tradition in this country, from Mr. Aiken as Minister for Foreign Affairs onwards to perhaps people like Veronica Kelly who have been imprisoned abroad for protests against nuclear arms and the dangers of nuclear power to the world,</P>
    <P>We must keep up this tradition and put forward our protest not only as the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and the Minister have done in negotiations with the British but also at European level where we need a whole system for dealing with all sorts of pollution of our environment ranging from the acid rain that is destroying the Black Forest to the nuclear escapes at Sellafield, to all sort of different misuses of the environment that we have been given to live in.  I would ask the Tánaiste to try not only to bring home to the British what difficulties and dangers we may be facing about this problem but also to put forward, in conjunction with the European Parliment, a whole plan for co-operation within Europe on this issue and on the ensuring of safety in the use of nuclear power throughout all the countries of the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of replying to this debate here in the Seanad.  At the outset, I should seek to clarify the Government's position, as both the Taoiseach and myself have been doing for the last number of days, in relation to recent events and occurrences at Sellafield and indeed recent disclosures in relation to past events.  The Government is opposed to any radioactive discharge from Sellafield to the Irish Sea and have called for these discharges to be minimised and to be eliminated as soon as possible.  This position has been stated at every opportunity in contact with the British authorities and at all appropriate international fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is well aware of the Government's concern at the recent incidents at Sellafield, and of the statement <Col N="664" /> by the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday that he intended raising the matter with the British Prime Minister in London, which he did this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I consider that the safety record at Sellafield has been less than satisfactory and the frequency of recent accidents poses the possibility of the occurrence of an accident in the future which could have consequences for the country.  This concern is heightened by the recent revelation in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 16 February regarding the errors in the information on radioactive discharges supplied to the Black inquiry.  I am also aware of the increasing public concern at the continued operation of the plant.  This concern must also be shared by the British public.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Ireland-UK Contact Group on 14 February last, officials of my Department conveyed our grave concern at the recent incidents at Sellafield and our annoyance at the inadequate notification procedures.  In the case of the uranium and plutonium incidents the British authorities assured my officials that the radiological emission to the environment of these incidents were insignificant.  Full information about the Drigg fire incident was not available at the meeting.  However the British authorites state that it appeared to have no off-site implications.  A prompt notification procedure was agreed at the meeting and notification of the most recent incident yesterday was practically immediate.</P>
    <P>I am informed that in yesterday's incident, which involved a break in a drainpipe, 250 gallons of water containing low level radioactivity was discharged into a purpose-built containment trench.  I am also informed that initial monitoring by BNFL showed little potential hazard to the workforce and that it had no off-site significance.  The pipe in question was speedily repaired.  However, I am awaiting full and final reports on each of the four recent incidents.</P>
    <P>At another level our Department of health has set up a steering committee to examine the incidence of childhood leukaemia since 1970 and of Down's Syndrome in the under 25's.  The committee <Col N="665" /> will also undertake a critical examination of the Black report.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording that the Nuclear Energy Board is engaged in a continuous monitoring programme which monitors radioactivity levels in fish, seawater, seaweed and sediment taken from the Irish Sea.  Independent research programmes are also undertaken by the environmental radioactivity laboratories of University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin.  The results of these monitoring programmes have clearly shown that contamination has occurred in the Irish Sea as a result of discharges from Sellafield.  However, the radiation dose to the Irish population resulting from Sellafield is very small and would be, on average, less than 1 per cent of the limits advised by the International Commission for Radiological Protection and by the European community.</P>
    <P>A joint Irish-Spanish research cruise is planned for this year to monitor levels and distribution of caesium 134 and caesium 137 in the area bounded by the north-east Atlantic dumpsite, the south-west coast of Ireland and the north-east coast of Spain.  This will include an examination of the extent to which discharges from Sellafield and Cap de la Hague have now penetrated these more southerly waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens if there is now contamination as a result of the caesium levels in the sea from both these plants?  What is the point in coming along in ten years' time and saying that there are problems because of the caesium level.  Dumping should be stopped now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude and the Government's attitude in relation to all dumping off the south-west coast have been very clear and we have not changed our attitude.  That has been the Government's position quite consistently for the last number of years &mdash; to bring about the halting of dumping in the Atlantic.  We still hold that position.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy <Col N="666" /> Board, with the assistance of the meteorological service of the Department of Communications, also monitors radioactivity levels in air, rainfall and drinking water samples.  I am assured by the Nuclear Energy Board that the level of artificially produced radioactivity in the atmosphere and in the environment are low and do not constitute a health hazard to the Irish public.</P>
      <P>The monitoring system operated by the Nuclear Energy Board has been adequate to determine the level of radioactivity which has occurrred to date.  However, in the light of these recent incidents I propose to have the monitoring procedures reviewed in consultation with the NEB, with a view to establishing whether monitoring requires any modification.  I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we will continue to be in a position to accurately measure future radioactivity levels.  I might also add that the Nuclear Energy Board published a report in 1984 on their monitoring programme, copies of which are available in the Library.  A more recent report will be published shortly and will also be available in the Library.</P>
      <P>In November 1983 a British TV programme claimed that there was an excess of young people with leukemia and other cancers in the neighbourhood of Sellafield.  A public inquiry was set up and its report, known as the Black report, concluded that the evidence available did not establish a link between the cancer and Sellafield.</P>
      <P>However, the Black report did make certain recommendations regarding further studies to be carried out.  The Black report also recommended review of the discharge authorisations and a reduction of routine discharges from the plant.  The UK Department of the Environment is in the process of carrying out a review of these discharge authorisations.  My Department will be consulted during this review.  It is expected that the new authorisations will be introduced later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Times</i> reported on 16 February, <Col N="667" /> that a nuclear scientist, Dr. Jakeman, formerly employed at Sellafield has now revealed that the figures given to the Black inquiry on radioactive discharges in the 1950s were inaccurate.  The article states that BNFL have now admitted that the levels were actually 40 times greater than stated to the Black inquiry. It is also reported that the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Douglas Black, has commented that he considers that he will not be altering his conclusions.  It has been confirmed with the UK DHSS that <i>The Sunday Times</i> report is substantially correct.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, further studies are currently being undertaken by the UK authorities on the basis of the Black report recommendations.  These include an increase in the number of children originally studied and on re-analysis of data by the Northern Children's Cancer Registry.  A UK Department of Health Committee will re-assess that part of the Black report which is concerned with discharges in the light of recent disclosures by BNFL that the figures provided to the Black Advisory Group were apparently up to 40 times too low.  This health committee will advise within six months as to whether the revised discharge figures should effect any change in Black's conclusions.</P>
    <P>Most people in this House, and the public, will obviously be concerned at what future action can and will be taken. As the House is aware, the Taoiseach has raised our concerns at a meeting which he had with the British Prime Minister today when he conveyed to her that the number of incidents, notwithstanding that they may be described as being of negligible radiological significance, has caused a loss of confidence in Ireland in the safety of the reprocessing of nuclear material at Sellafield.  In the light of all this, he urged the Prime Minister that there should be a thorough review of safety procedures at the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>In recent years this Government, through the contact group established with the UK, and by other means, has taken steps designed to ensure that we <Col N="668" /> would be kept well abreast of all developments at Sellafield.  But because of our dissatisfaction with the information we have been given, it is our intention to seek a full meeting of officials of all relevant Departments and bodies in the UK and the Republic.  We consider that this would contribute to greater cohesion in and prompt receipt of the information being made available.  We see this as a necessary improvement to the working of the contact group established by Irish and UK Ministers in 1984.</P>
    <P>Several articles of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community <i>(Euratom)</i>, to which of course we belong, give the Commission several rights with regard to the control and monitoring of radioactive emissions from nuclear installations in member states. The Government will be examining in detail how the treaty can be applied in relation to Sellafield to press for greater control by the Community.  Ministerial discussion in Brussels on the subject will be sought with a view to establishment of a Community inspection force to monitor activities such as those at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>For my own part, I have been in contact today with Commissioner Clinton Davies with a view to having an early meeting to discuss the joint approach by ourselves and by the Commission.  I must say, for the record of this House, that his approach is one of total co-operation because he recognises the Irish interest in the activities at Sellafield.  Some questions have been asked in relation to the BNFL expansion programme.  Perhaps one should clarify what is involved.  There are two elements.  Firstly there is the question of THORP.  BNFL plan to have in operation by the 1990's a new thermal oxide reprocessing plant &mdash; THORP &mdash; costing £1,300 million, which will process uranium oxide fuel from advanced gas cooled reactors and other oxide fuels. Magnox power stations are no longer being built and the Magnox reprocessing plant at Sellafield will therefore cease operation at the end of the century.  While we are assured by the British authorities that the THORP plant is not likely to <Col N="669" /> increase discharges, under the procedures of article 37 of the EURATOM Treaty, the European Commission, advised by a group of experts from member states, has the opportunity to give an opinion on the implications for neighbouring member states of proposed nuclear developments.  We have stated at Commission level that we were particularly concerned at the development of the THORP project and wish to be kept informed of all aspects of its development. We have also indicated to the Commission that greater attention and urgency should be given to the problem of radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second aspect of their development, there are measures to reduce discharges.  Their programme includes measures designed to effect significant reductions in radioactive discharges at Sellafield.  £350 million is being spent on a new complex, to be known as Pond 5, incorporating new technology designed to reduce discharge levels from the storage of the spent fuel before it goes to a chemical plant on the site for processing.  This is at present being commissioned. There is £200 million for a new vitrification plant which will turn radioactive waste left after reprocessing into inert glass bricks, and £130 million for a new water treatment plant, which is now in operation and which will reduce routine radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea.  One hundred and fifty million pounds is being spent for a floc precipitation plant, to be operational by 1991, which will reduce discharges of long-lived alpha radiation; and a further water treatment plant in the form of a salt evaporator to reduce the volume of liquid radioactive waste.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste, in view of the enormous amount of money proposed to be spent, is that not an indication that the present system of monitoring is totally and utterly inadequate? You have talked about figures in excess of £700 million and these are figures given, I presume by BNFL&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not necessarily the correct conclusion.  Not being a scientist myself or claiming any great knowledge in that area, I would have to say that the whole understanding of the nuclear area is developing on a constant basis.  With that development and with the sophistication of the nuclear industry new plant is also being commissioned to cope with the new developments.  In fact in any other plant, irrespective of risks at the plant and incidents at the plant, there would be a continual updating of equipment and large expenditure would be taking place.  In effect, I cannot support the conclusion reached by the Senator.  I think that it is in an overall long term development of the industry that these expenditures are going to be undertaken anyway.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and would be, I am sure, supported by the British authorities. Some people have called for the straight closure of the plant.  I have to say, as I said last evening, that closure of the plant is not as simple as it seems. Firstly, there is already an amount of highly radioactive materials stored at present at Sellafield even if further reprocessing is not carried out.  We would not rule out the possibility of closure in due course; but, if satisfactory standards of safety are seen to be operating and if we can have confidence in the safe operation of the plant without fear of endangering the Irish public, the operation of the plant <Col N="671" /> could not be opposed.  However, the total elimination of all discharges from Sellafield, through the use of the best available technology, will continue to be the Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that within the past hour or so the British authorities have announced that it has appointed a team of 12 inspectors who will immediately commence an investigation into Sellafield.  I further understand that this work will take in the region of six months to complete.  I must say that I welcome this move by the British Government.  We will obviously have <Col N="672" /> to await further details and the terms of reference of the investigation team before we would make any further comment other than to welcome this move which, I assume, in part is in direct response to the firm representations we have been making because of the concern which there has been in this country for quite a long time and a concern which has, indeed, been highlighted through the lack of confidence in the safety of the plant in the last number of days.</P>
