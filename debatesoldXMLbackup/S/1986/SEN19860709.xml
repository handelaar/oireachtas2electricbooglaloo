      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Lynch that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the progress to date in the renovation work to the Garda Barracks, Oldcastle, County Meath, since the matter was raised in the House on 20 November 1985.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme in west Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the speed limits on roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Lynch's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Kiely and Daly may give notice for <Col N="2114" /> another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to takes Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in that order.  It has already been agreed that we will take No. 5 between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., or earlier if the other business is completed before that.  The agreement reached on that motion allows for ten minutes from each group representative and that can be one or two speakers, depending on what the group decides.  Members will speak first and the Minister will reply to the debate. Agreement has been reached about the taking of the Status of Children Bill and I should like to thank Members from all sides for agreeing to the process for initiating the Second Stage debate on that Bill.  It is agreed also that we will have one speaker from each group and that the Minister will introduce the Bill.  It is suggested that Report Stage of No. 1 should be taken and, if Members so wish, we can allow some time to elapse between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  If Members want that to happen we will take Report Stage of No. 2 immediately after Committee Stage of No. 1.  The question of breaking for lunch or tea has been left open until we see how business progresses but if we complete a Bill in or about an appropriate time for a break we will have one.</P>

      <P>This might be an appropriate morning to raise another matter again on the Order of Business.  Senator Ferris has anticipated the point I want to make.  Arising from the acceptance by the House of the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in relation to the roof of the Chamber on 27 May <Col N="2115" /> last, I understood that there was a firm commitment that progress would be made during the summer months.  Have you, a Chathaoirleach, made arrangements to ensure that there will be satisfactory progress between now and our return?</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Lanigan, I should like to state that I agree that we should have no lunch break, if that is what is required.  We will work through lunch, and tea if necessary.  I should like to tell Senator O'Toole that agreement has been reached to complete Nos. 1 to 5.  If we complete them by 5 p.m. well and good, but if not we will sit on to complete them.  When I say complete, I mean in the format that has been agreed.  With regard to the Status of Children Bill there will be one speaker from each side and the Minister will introduce it.  The Second Stage debate on that Bill will be adjourned.  Item No. 5 will be completed within an hour as has been agreed.  All these items will have to be completed before the House rises for the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister define what is meant by other organisations?

      <P>The explanatory memorandum says: &ldquo;...damage caused by riot and by the activities of unlawful organisations and certain other organisations as referred to in paragraph 4 below.  Paragraph 4 does not spell out exactly what type of organisations.

      <P>This point does not arise on section 1.  We are referring to organisations from outside the State.  Section 2 (1) (a) (iii) provides that damage caused as a result of an act committed maliciously by a person acting on behalf of or in connection with an organisation outside the State that engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the use of violence for purposes related to the conduct or administration of the affairs of the State or Northern Ireland will come within the scope of the revised scheme.</P>

      <Col N="2117" /> SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, I got your note, a Chathaoirligh, that amendments Nos. 1 to 7 are out of order on the grounds which you have described and therefore I am not in a position to move them.  I understand that I can comment on them.  The purpose in putting down this set of amendments is to draw attention to the implications of the Bill for specific categories.  In that context I would like the Minister to consider introducing amendments to meet the needs of these special categories on which I will elaborate on Report Stage.  The basic problem is a breakdown in law and order which has led to vandalism, arson, burglaries and so on.  In the Second Stage debate the Minister acknowledged that there is a serious problem of vandalism and related problems in relation to educational establishments, particularly schools.  The intention behind the amendments is that schools should continue to enjoy compensation entitlement in accordance with the Malicious Injuries Acts.  There is no question but that schools have come under severe attacks from vandals and thieves especially in crime prone urban areas in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.</P>
      <P>It is predicted by the insurance industry that insurance premiums in the major urban areas will increase by 45 per cent for primary schools and by 30 per cent for post primary schools.  This additional premium cost will be on top of a very severe increase in insurance premiums in the Dublin area.  Since 1982 insurance premiums for schools have been loaded by up to 100 per cent already.  In the case of primary schools there will be a further 45 per cent increase on top of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the next amendment and the impact of this Bill on recreational or sporting facilities, again the basic problem is crime.  Malicious injuries claims arise because of vandalism, arson and <Col N="2118" /> burglaries.  One of the most effective ways of countering crime, which is the kernal of the problem, is to provide sporting and recreational facilities for our young people.  I have listed a small number of organisations that are affected: the GAA, the Football Association of Ireland, the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Golfing Union of Ireland. A host of other sporting and recreational organisations provide invaluable physical activity for young people to keep them occupied in useful activities of that kind. These voluntary and sporting organisations are providing an invaluable service to the community through the provisions of these facilities.  Not alone do they keep people out of trouble by providing the opportunity for physical activity, but these activities in turn lead to an approach to discipline and they generate a community spirit.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider for Report Stage an amendment giving exemption to recreational and sporting facilities from the provisions of the Bill. These organisations are making a valuable contribution to community life. Sport and recreation provide an important antidote to crime and are a valuable source for countering crime.  They are conducted by people who give voluntarily of their services.  They make a contribution to tackling the crime problem which is the kernal of the malicious injuries problem.</P>
    <P>The third amendment relates to the consequences of the breakdown in law and order for religious, charitable or voluntary services.  Community centres and churches, for example, have been subjected to vandalism and arson.  It is estimated in the case of churches and community centres that, following this Bill, insurance premiums will rise by at least 12½ per cent in urban areas.  The breakdown in law and order is such that some churches have to be locked up completely in the day time to protect their property.  Community centres are under severe pressure because insurance costs are already so high on these voluntary groups.  My information is that the insurance on an average community <Col N="2119" /> centre amounts to £2,000 per annum. This is a very substantial imposition.  It is now envisaged in urban areas that there will be a 12½ per cent increase on that. The people who run community centres do so voluntarily by giving generously of their spare time.  They are making a valuable contribution to society by acting as an antidote to crime which is the key problem.  Surely these centres deserve special consideration and therefore should be entitled to compensation under this law.</P>
    <P>I referred on Second Stage to another vulnerable area, cars and motor cycles. The insurance industry have predicted that following the implementation of the Bill, a 5 per cent increase will be imposed on those with comprehensive cover with higher premiums for those with third party cover.  An undesirable by-product of this is that high premiums already are contributing to the severe uninsured driving problem &mdash; it is estimated that 20 per cent of those driving vehicles are uninsured. Further additional premium increase will put insurance further out of reach.</P>
    <P>Talking about people being able to afford to run vehicles, the Irish motorist is the most highly taxed in Europe, and considering that already he makes a considerable contribution to the Exchequer he should not have to bear the additional increase in cover in respect of damage and theft of cars.  Because of the current scale of crime there is a special case for exempting cars and motor cycles from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 refers to the impact of the removal of protection for malicious injuries from the farming community. Farmers are good at making their case and have been through the decades, but they are under considerable pressure on a variety of fronts &mdash; weather, prices and so on.  I based my amendment on the case farmers have to make.  Protection of farmers under the 1981 Act is being removed and considering farmers' difficulties, they deserve special consideration.</P>
    <P>I will turn to amendment No. 7, relating specifically to local authorities who are being put in an anomalous and unfair <Col N="2120" /> position in regard to malicious injury claims.  They should be entitled to seek compensation like everybody else for malicious acts by illegal organisations. For instance, the ESB and Telecom Éireann can continue to claim in the case of riots or acts by illegal organisations, when their properties are damaged.  This is not so in the case of local authorities. Those in Border counties in particular are very vulnerable.  A case in point is the burning of Monaghan Courthouse. The Department of Justice contributed to the cost of restoring the building, but the balance of the bill was carried by the county council.  Local authorities are unable to claim when their properties are damaged.  Courthouses and town halls could be damaged during peaceful protests which end up in riots.  Unfortunately, this is not a remote possibility any more.  For example, the recent skirmishes during the Orange marches in Rossnowlagh in Donegal are a case in point; it could have spilled over and caused damage to public property.  The burning of the British Embassy some years ago in Dublin is another case. Council property, being a symbol of order and authority in the community, could be targets for riots or malicious acts by illegal organisations. Therefore council property should be covered like that of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Hillery.  I do not want to be parrot-like, so I will merely point out that in the Bill we are transferring liability from local authorities to property owners and, in turn, to insurance companies.  Last year we paid out £20 million and of that £12.5 million was paid out in Dublin.  It is only reasonable to expect that, if insurance companies have to carry the £20 million in addition to the ever-increasing amount that will be in the pipeline this year, insurance policies will go up by the percentages given by Senator Hillery.  These projections seem to be accurate, so when sums like £20 million are to be paid out by insurance companies there will be continuing increases in insurance premiums. <Col N="2121" /> Worse still, when claims begin to come in it will be very hard for people to get cover as is the case now in regard to motor vehicles, especially those driven by young motorists.</P>
      <P>Have the Department been thinking of pegging insurance premiums in future so that there will be assurance given to injured parties that in the next five years insurance cover will rise by only a given percentage?  At the moment we have a dangerous, open-ended position whereby insurance increases are being governed by claims.  Damage to property in the future against which there will be either intolerable premiums or no insurance cover at all will mean that people will be put out of business.  The same applies to schools and the other possible victims referred to by Senator Hillery.  I should like to hear an assurance from the Minister that the entire insurance industry will be examined so that some legislation might be introduced for control, because the transfer of liability proposed by the Bill will cause massive hardship to property owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the amendments which have been ruled out of order make up the main thrust of what Senators Hillery and O'Toole said.  The amendments would stand this Bill on its head.  On Second Stage we accepted that this Bill proposes to abolish malicious injury liability but we do not want the Bill to apply to interest groups of one kind or another.  There is no reason why the GAA or the IRFU should be regarded as being more meritorious than hundreds of other groups, social, political or commercial.  That kind of genuflection to the chalky gods of Irish society by Senator Hillery does not impress me at all.  It is a genuflection to chalky gods. You set up the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Football Association of Ireland to show that you are not in favour of the ban.  You put all these worthy organisations in together.  Then, you throw religion in as well, because, of course, in Ireland you must have religion in everything.  Then, you have to think of <Col N="2122" /> the farmers.  So, you throw the farmers in as well.  Then, as an awful lot of fellows have motor cars, you throw motor cars in as well along with motorbikes and all mechanically propelled vehicles.  The real area of difficulty is left untouched. Senator Hillery knows what the real area of difficulty is.  The real and only area of difficulty and the only argument in favour of retaining any section of it is in areas of the inner city where getting insurance would be difficult at any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be putting down an amendment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To solve that problem &mdash; and he recognises it is a problem &mdash; he throws another amendment in which says that, where a court thinks that you could not get insurance or that insurance would be too expensive, that would be covered as well.  That is nonsense.  Who would not fall within some or other of those definitions?  Anybody could then say that it would have been uninsurable because it would cost too much or his means were not sufficient to be able to afford the insurance premium.  That is not reasonable.  Section 2 strikes what I consider to be an appropriate balance. I am not concerned about the Gaelic Athletic Association or the religious organisations.  They can look after themselves. They can well afford to insure if they have to insure.  The only case I heard against the abolition of the malicious injuries code is in respect of certain areas of the inner city where getting insurance at all is going to be difficult.  That is a fair point and I would like to bring it to the Minister's attention.  I know that is one of the things behind the other amendment of Senator Hillery.  I agree with the purpose behind the amendment.  However, it cannot be drafted so widely that anyone who goes into court and says that the cost of insurance will be too high, and who is able to persuade a local judge that that is the situation, he or she is automatically entitled to cover under the malicious injuries code.  That kind of law would lead to a situation where there would be tremendous uncertainty in each <Col N="2123" /> and every case as to who would or would not be entitled to malicious injuries compensation. That kind of uncertainty is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Section 2 properly seeks to amend section 5 of the Principal Act and I support it.  I would like the Minister to explain subsection (2), which seeks to define &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; a little bit differently than heretofore.  Would the Minister like to explain how subsection 2, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) change the present definition of &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; in the malicious injuries code to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the comments of Senators Hillery and O'Toole.  My main comment will be in some way to refute the point made by the Minister on Second Stage that the cost of insurance for the average citizen is unlikely to be noticeably affected, whether in respect of house or motor insurance.  I would make this point.  At present there is a Courts Bill, in regard to the trial by jury system, going through the Dáil which, the Government hope will reduce the liability in respect of motor insurance premiums.  It can be positively said that this Bill will increase the insurance bill for every single person who has an insurance policy whether it be a simple fire policy, a household or car insurance policy, employer's or public liability insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation will clearly state that across the board at present they would reckon on a 10 per cent to 12 per cent increase in premiums. Obviously, in some areas such as schools and community halls premiums will increase much higher than that figure. Senator O'Leary referred to the problems of inner city insurance, which we all know to be not just expensive but difficult to get at present.  Certainly, it will be much higher there than the figures I have mentioned.  Generally, it can be said without any shadow of doubt that the insurance premiums of the public will increase by 12 per cent or thereabouts. They can rise in the future as a result of this legislation.  That is understandable <Col N="2124" /> because within every insurance policy there is a subrogation clause.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  I had, unfortunately, a claim under my &ldquo;plate glass&rdquo; policy, a compact business type policy. Seven or eight windows in the area were broken by vandals and I lodged a claim with my insurance company.  I indicated that because I was chairman of the Urban District Council I was reluctant to put forward a malicious injuries claim but the company, without even telling me as was their right under their policy, put forward a claim and received some money back as a result.  In other words, it cut their losses.  While that subrogation policy is there insurance companies will do it as is their right.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, if that avenue for extra finance as a result of a claim is no longer to be there for them, premiums will increase as a result.  It is as well to put on the record, straight and fair, that insurance premiums will escalate as a result of this legislation.  As I said, the figures suggest that across the board it could be as high as 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the amendment which Senator Hillery has put down.  Quite honestly, I was not aware that it was put down.  Senator Mullooly and I have put down a similar amendment on section 6. The amendment relates to the problem the local authorities now find themselves in, an apparent anomalous situation which is totally wrong and unfair to the local authorities.  At present the position is that, while the various Departments of State, Bord Telecom, ESB, CIE and so on have the right to claim in the event of a riot situation, a local authority cannot claim for damage to their own property under this Bill.  That is most unfair. Indeed, I have no doubt we are going to have a situation in the future where in a public play area &mdash; for example, the Phoenix Park &mdash; a riot might develop.  It would be most unfair if the local authority could not seek compensation from the State in the event of a riot taking place or in the event of a local authority building being burnt down.  An obvious example, as Senator Hillery said, would be a courthouse, which might be more of a target <Col N="2125" /> than anything else.  It happened in Monaghan. If a courthouse were to be damaged by an unlawful group or damaged as a result of a riot, it seems unfair that the local authority cannot recoup the money for the repair of that building in the same way as all of the other bodies I have mentioned.  The Minister must examine this.  The Minister will probably say that the local authority cannot sue themselves, but in most cases surely it will not be a case of proceeding that far, that settlements occur much earlier.  I am wondering in that situation what the position is.  Can the Minister say that under some ministerial directive or signature the local authorities can claim from central funds?  It is very unfair and the local authorities will find it very difficult for the future.  They might have to endeavour to get some form of riot insurance.  That in itself might be difficult and certainly if it is available it will be quite expensive.  To eliminate this, the local authority should be put on an equal level with the other semi-State bodies who have the right to claim from the central Exchequer through the local authority and recoup whatever compensation is required.  I hope the Minister can make a statement on that, or perhaps introduce an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I want to express reservations about some of the comments Senator Fallon has made.  I respect his view and he is an expert in the insurance field. Section 2 is just about rightly balanced. Every year at the rates estimates meeting, we had a heading for malicious injuries, against which the county council could not indemnify themselves by way of paying an insurance premium.  They just had a heading and by law they had to meet it.  There was an extraordinary case in north Tipperary where there was a malicious injury claim against the council that they were unable to meet.  Certain regulations had to be brought in putting a ceiling on the amount for which local authorities were responsible.  There is the anomaly that the local authorities are <Col N="2126" /> unable to contest a malicious injuries claim if it is proven; they could contest it but they would lose it.  They could not indemnify themselves against it with an ordinary insurance policy, but they can insure their own premises, in the same way as anybody else and have their own insurance policies for any accident which might occur with them or any negligence by the county council in the working of their enterprise.  That is legitimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>What is being suggested is that the principle of collective responsibility should apply.  There are very few people left as ratepayers now, except a few shopkeepers in towns.  They are now collectively responsible, it is being suggested, for all the malicious injuries which will take place within their area of jurisdiction.  It is being suggested that we should not change the law in this regard. Most of the money paid in malicious injuries comes back as a charge on the rates and a charge on the State.  I have heard managers saying in response to criticism from members each year that this is an area in which they have no jurisdiction.  They have their obligations to meet claims under the Malicious Injuries Act.  They had to contest it, but many claims have been successful.  Senator Fallon's example is a typical one.  He did not want, as chairman of the council, to make a claim on his own council, but his insurance company did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>And who paid for it?  It was paid for on the basis of collective responsibility.  This is an insurance problem. People should be insured correctly and the insurance business should meet the claims.  It is inevitable that it will create an increase in premiums since there will be an increase in claims.  Who should be paying?  Is it the person who needs insurance, the insurance company or the public at large, who have no responsibility directly or indirectly in creating the situation which caused the <Col N="2127" /> claim?  It is a moot point, but there is somebody down the road, the PAYE payer, the ratepayer and all these other people who put money into the common coffers.  The insurance companies can make claims on that fund.  It is an unusual system of accountability.  I would have reservations about not proceeding to change that law.  It is about time we did. I am only speaking as a member of a local authority, with the experience which I have had, and not as a person who has ever had to make a claim under this heading.</P>

      <P>I simply made the point that despite what the Minister said in the Second Stage speech, insurance premiums clearly and positively will increase.  That has been established.  That was my big point.  My second major point was that in regard to recoupment the local authorities should be put on the same level as semi-State bodies and similiar groups.  I do not think there is anything wrong with those two firm, strong points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying to the points raised, I would like to remind Senators that in the Second Stage speech notice was given that no amendments could be supported which would actually involve expenditure because this is an Exchequer saving Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hillery is seeking to retain the existing malicious injuries scheme in the case of damage to schools, recreational facilities, churches, property of charitable and voluntary organisations, cars, motor cycles and bicycles, hay barns and in the case of damage to any property where a court is satisfied that it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to have it insured.  This would involve considerable cost.  While we are aware that schools in certain areas face particular problems &mdash; the centre city in Dublin was referred to with regard to vandalism &mdash; this does not justify maintaining the existing scheme for educational institutions. The Department of Education are working closely with those schools to improve <Col N="2128" /> security by such measures as the installation of burglar alarms, improved fencing and unbreakable glass.  Grants are available for these measures in primary schools, and in certain circumstances in post primary schools.  In the case of primary schools the <i>per capita</i> grant of £24 from the Department of Education, together with the local contribution of £6, is intended to cover operating costs including insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Similarly the effect of the Bill overall in the case of recreational and sporting facilities and on religious, charitable and volunatary organisation will not be great. The question of making special provision for agriculture property was referred to. There is no particular problem in obtaining insurance cover for agricultural property. In addition agrarian disputes which might involve malicious damage are no longer a common feature.</P>
    <P>Senators Fallon and Hillery spoke about malicious damage to local authority property.  Local authorities have never been in a position to claim compensation in respect of malicious damage to their own properties.  This is because the malicious injuries scheme is based on recovery of malicious damage compensation from local authorities.  Local authorities cannot sue themselves.  The difficulty in dealing with this matter in the Bill is that the existing scheme is not appropriate for the reasons I have mentioned.  A separate mechanism is required to deal with local authority claims.  Since what essentially is at issue here is how the cost of repairing damage to local authority property should be met, the Minister for Justice has been in communication with the Ministers for Finance and the Environment on this question.  While it has been decided that this Bill is not the appropriate place to deal with this matter, the whole question is being considered further by the Ministers for Finance and the Environment at present.</P>
    <P>The question of difficulty with insurance was raised by Senators O'Toole, Hillery and O'Leary.  Speakers have drawn attention to the problems which may arise if insurance companies <Col N="2129" /> refuse to give malicious damage cover, particularly to commercial concerns in what are regarded as high risk areas.  In my introductory remarks on the Second Stage I said that the Minister for Justice had taken up this matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see if anything could be done to deal with any possible vacuum which might result from the passing of this Bill.  I believe there will not be any great change or great problems in the rest of the country, but it is recognised there may be a problem in Dublin city centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, who has responsibility in the insurance area, is having the matter taken up with the insurance industry to see if any practical ways can be found to alleviate any problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, the definition of &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; is different in this Bill from the 1981 Act, which was queried by Senator O'Leary. Subsection (2), following the definition of the 1981 Act, provides that: the act shall be taken to be committed maliciously for the purpose of subsection (1) (a), (2) and (3) if it is damage caused by certain organisations; if it is a wrongful act committed intentionally without just cause or excuse; if it is committed wantonly; or committed in the course of, whether or not for the purpose of, the commission of a crime against the property damaged.  The definition is basically the same as that in section 5 (2) of the 1981 Act, the only difference being that in the 1981 Act, section 5 (2) (c) makes provision for riot damage.  As damage caused by riot is being specifically provided for in the new subsection, there is no need to include it in the definition here.  It is just a very small point.  The 1981 Act defined &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; as including riot, but it is being taken separately in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that this question of the local authorities and the problems dealing with riot claims and so on cannot be dealt with in this Bill but that it is being actively pursued by the Minister for the Environment and the <Col N="2130" /> Minister for Finance.  May we assume that some statement will be issued on that matter in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that a statement will be issued from the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance but two insurance companies with considerable association with local authorities are not aware of that.  At present if an ordinary property owner has his property damaged he can claim from the local authority, but under this Bill a property owner must prove that the damage was caused by a riot or by an unlawful organisation.  If he can do so, he can claim compensation from the said local authority.  Under this Bill the local authority can recoup from the Minister for the Environment all that has been paid out in compensation.  However, if the property of the local authority &mdash; and this has been said &mdash; is damaged by a riot they cannot sue themselves; therefore they cannot get compensation and therefore they cannot recoup the loss from the Minister.</P>
      <P>My concern here is that local authorities themselves cannot recover compensation for malicious damage to their property.  Local authority property is particularly vulnerable to concerted attack from riot or unlawful organisations.  This is a serious problem for local authorities. In the Minister's reply she has stated that this has been taken in hand and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers are going to deal with it; but one senior insurance company and a second insurance company who have a lot of dealings with local government and local authorities are not aware that that is so.  The body I am talking about had discussions with members of the Minister's Department or some Minister's Department and they did not come away with the idea that local authorities in future would be able to compensate themselves.  There is a gap here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for passing the buck to another Bill on another day, I have seen so much of this recently in legislation that it worries me intensely and Senators who have close <Col N="2131" /> associations with local government and local authorities are deeply concerned about this matter.  Senator O'Toole has a long record in local government, as have Senators Ferris and Fallon.  I would like to hear the Minister's statement again because I do not think that the bodies I have talked to consider the case to be as the Minister has indicated.  There is a deep worry there for local authorities and for insurance companies associated with the local authorities about damage done to their property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is an appropriate time for me to come in before the Minister replies.  In addressing amendments Nos. 1 to 7, I went to some length to highlight the implications of this Bill for a variety of categories, including local authorities, which have been subsequently referred to.  There is no doubt that in the case of schools and community centres the increased insurance premiums will create severe hardship for these groups and they are deserving of special attention.</P>
      <P>I know that I have not got any distance, given the Minister's reply, but I want to follow it up by saying that if the level of crime, vandalism, arson and so on were very considerably lower I would not be making these points with the same strength.  It is precisely because the level of crime is still very high and that schools and community centres in particular continue to be particularly vulnerable.  That vulnerability, in return, is reflected in increased premiums.  It is in that context that I re-emphasise the vulnerability of certain groups following the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic problem is law and order and the scale of crime.  That scale of crime in turn is reflected in damage and injury to a variety of categories.  I think it is entirely inappropriate to remove the protection of the Malicious Injuries Acts at this juncture when the scale of crime is still so high.  Again, I want to make the point in the case of community centres that they contribute to addressing the crime problem by providing an antidote for criminal <Col N="2132" /> behaviour.  That should be recognised in turn in relation to the imposition that is now being placed on them through increased premiums under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to local authorities and the clarification of that situation &mdash; the Minister mentioned specifically the Department of Finance and Environment &mdash; I am glad the problem is being addressed. I know that functionally she can say that it does not come up properly under this Bill.  To be honest, it is very frustrating for us contributing to various debates here to hear a Minister with particular functions saying that certain matters are not quite his responsibility but that he will draw them to the attention of another Department.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday, in the context of the Harbours Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications was making the point that the issue in relation to the extension of the worker participation legislation to harbours is really a matter for the Minister for Labour.  I would make a plea for greater co-ordination among Departments, who are serving in the same Government, to come in with the most up-to-date information and with conclusions when introducing Bills here.  While the Minister has a case, on a functional basis, to say that it is not his responsibility, we are getting tired of being fobbed off in that manner.  A Government should be a cohesive group and should come in with a co-ordinated position on a variety of Bills.  It is not peculiar to the Department of Justice; it is going on all the time.  Needless to say, exclusion is a very important issue for the local authorities.  They are discriminated against because they are excluded, unlike the ESB and Bord Telecom, from redress in the case of malicious damage.  Furthermore, local authority property represents the established order and authority.  Such public buildings under local authorities are tempting targets for subversive organisations and for riotous behaviour.  Local authorities have a strong genuine case for equal treatment, like other organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the final point <Col N="2133" /> on which most of the discussion centred, which is damage to local authority property, I should like to assure all Senators that it is not a question of their being fobbed off.  In many instances in debates, particularly on Committee Stage, queries arise about issues or sections of a Bill which do not constitute the actual functional area of the Minister or of his Department.  Far from their being ignored, they are noted.  This point came up in debate at all Stages in the Dáil.  I realise that there is concern about damage to local authority property.  I should say that there are not that many instances on record.  While accepting the point that they could appear to be vulnerable sites or buildings in the context of subversive organisations, there have not been that many instances of damage done.  Nonetheless, it is not appropriate to deal with that area in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan inquired about the discussions or negotiations which were taking place.  It would be unlikely that the companies concerned would know at this point what was going on.  Certainly, because of the debate, the concern expressed and the clear awareness that there is a need to regularise the position, it is a matter which the Minister for the Environment is discussing and attempting to come to an arrangement with the Minister for Finance.  It does not have to come into the House as legislation.  It can be dealt with in another way.  I assure Senators that the remarks, just as those in the other House, will be noted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(a)  There shall stand established a fund to be known as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.</P>
    <P>(b) The fund shall comprise monies contributed in such sums as shall be agreed between the Minister and any interested business or commercial parties.</P>
    <P>(b) The Minister may by regulations provide for the payment of awards from the fund to interested businesses or commercial parties who would not otherwise be entitled to compensation under the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the essence of what we have in mind here, this amendment is intended to highlight the insurance problems facing businesses particularly in inner city areas.  Despite Senator O'Leary's criticisms of the valid cases I believe I was making in relation to various categories, he did say that in his view the core problem related to businesses and their vulnerability to crime in crime-torn inner city areas.  This problem of insurance for high risk businesses is addressed in the Fifth Report of the all-party Joint Committee on Small Businesses on the insurance problems of small businesses.  In their recommendations under the heading of &ldquo;Business Security&rdquo; the committee had this to say at paragraph 2.9.1, under the further heading of &ldquo;Malicious Damages Fund&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>We feel that the burden of Property insurance in high risk areas should be shared by the community as a whole, in conjunction with the insurance companies, with the ultimate objective of ensuring that business continues in these areas.</P>
    <P>We see that the right of businesses to Property insurance in these high risk areas as being just as important for urban renewal as the existing high levels of Local Authority expenditure on new housing in many of these areas <Col N="2135" /> and the urban renewal incentives announced by the Government on 23 October, 1985.</P>
    <P>That committee is chaired by Deputy Ivan Yates of the Minister's party and the Vice-Chairman is our Seanad colleague, Senator Michael Lynch.  That was their firm recommendation in relation to the insurance for businesses in strike-prone city areas.  Given the gravity of the insurance problem facing businesses in these high risk areas, some alternative to the abolition of their cover for malicious injury resulting from the provisions of this Bill is necessary.  The joint committee acknowledge it, Senator O'Leary acknowledges it.  It is in that spirit that amendments Nos. 8 and 9 &mdash; No. 9 being consequential on No. 8 &mdash; are now put down for consideration today and have been allowed by the Chair.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurers' Bureau &mdash; I know this was referred to in the other House when the Bill was being debated there &mdash; though not a direct parallel to what we have in mind here, has a valuable administrative arrangement in claims where no motor insurance exists.  The bureau provides an important service.  Therefore, is it not possible to have a criminal injuries compensation fund, or something of that type, to meet what will be a particularly acute problem for businesses if the Bill is implemented as it stands?  Will the Minister consider that talks between the Government, businesses and the insurance industry need to be initiated and advanced rapidly with a view to the establishment of such a fund.  I know the Minister made some reference to talks.  I would like her to elaborate on that in her reply.</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of the Garda, the resources being applied to the special problems areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, in which many businesses are located, are not enough to provide the kind of protection that is necessary.  In other words, despite the best efforts of the Garda to reduce significantly the problem in these inner city areas in relation to business, the results are still extremely <Col N="2136" /> worrying.  On the insurance side, some of these businesses cannot get insurance cover and, where they can, the premiums are so exorbitant that they are beyond their reach.  Businesses are suffering as a result of the breakdown in law and order. The Minister must continue to take action to remedy the situation.  It is in that context, namely, the inadequacy of the Garda, despite their best efforts, to meet the crime-torn problem and its impact on the businesses in those areas, that we have put down this amendment. We would ask the Minister to seriously consider an amendment along these lines on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  This is a very difficult problem, one which exists in a few areas only.  In these areas it is very serious. It cannot be dealt with adequately with present resources.  As Senator Hillery has said, some of these premises are uninsurable or, if they are insurable, the premiums sought are so high that the businessman or concern simply could not pay them.  It is simply going to be impossible for certain businesses to carry on in these areas unless the Government do something to help them.  Our proposals here constitute one way in which this could be helped.  There does not seem to me to be any other way in which it could be dealt with except by some kind of Government contribution.  The Government are not being asked to carry this by themselves.  It would be a joint effort.  It is a fair and reasonable way to meet a situation which cannot otherwise be dealt with.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment or to consider a similar amendment which would achieve the same purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I support the concept of this amendment. Senator Hillery and Senator Ryan said the problem applied to the principal cities.  This does not apply only to the inner city of Dublin or areas of Cork or Limerick.  My experience has been that in certain parts of Athlone insurance companies are saying to householders <Col N="2137" /> with comprehensive household policies that they must use padlocks and install all kinds of locks on the doors before they can get insurance cover.  Houses must be as well protected as Fort Knox before insurance cover can be got.  On top of that, these householders have to pay hefty premiums, far above the normal. While this is a problem in areas like Dublin, Limerick and Cork, unfortunately it is a problem which will spread to the other parts of the country in the future.  Therefore, it is opportune that this amendment should be discussed at this time and hopefully the Minister's reply will help solve this problem and she will agree with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment.  As there is no question of there being any State subvention available for such a fund, I do not see any reason why my Department or any other Department should have a role in administering a fund of this nature.  The administrative resources necessary to administer such a fund would, in any event, not be available in my Department. If businesses or commercial parties were interested in setting up such a fund there is no reason why it could not be administered by one of the existing trade associations.</P>
      <P>As to the detailed provisions of the amendment, I envisage difficulties in organising any fund where contributions are made on a voluntary basis and again I do not see any role for a Government Department involving themselves in trying to secure agreement as to the amount of such contributions.  The final paragraph of the Senators' amendment is so widely framed that it would cover any type of damage whether or not it was covered by insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind having such a fund, if I understand the Senators correctly, would be to deal with cases where there is a difficulty in obtaining insurance cover.  We are, of course, concerned at the prospect that in certain circumstances businesses might have difficulty in obtaining malicious injuries insurance as a result of this Bill.  The Minister of State at the <Col N="2138" /> Department of Industry and Commerce who has responsibility for insurance matters, is taking up the matter with the insurance industry with a view to seeing if there are any practical ways to help alleviate any problems that may arise. As part of that consultation process the Minister of State could, of course, raise the question of a fund of the type in question but, as I have said, there would be no question of any State subvention. It would, however, be open to interested businesses to approach the insurance industry directly in the matter and this may, in fact, be more appropriate since, as I have said, there cannot be any question of a direct State involvement in such a fund.</P>
    <P>I might add that where difficulties do arise it is very likely that similar difficulties already exist in relation to other insurable risks, such as theft, so that the termination of the existing malicious injuries scheme should not alter the situation in those cases to any great extent. What one is dealing with in these cases is a general problem in relation to insurance cover and not a problem confined solely to malicious damage.  That general problem may in some instances relate to the fact that one is dealing with old buildings which may be fire hazards due to the material used in construction, lack of sprinkler systems, faulty electrical wiring and such like.  In any event, as I have already said, the question of what practical steps might be taken to deal with any vacuum that might arise as a result of the passing of this Bill is being taken up with the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery mentioned the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  The main difference between motor insurance and property insurance is that there is a minimum insurance requirement in law for motor vehicles.  There is no such requirement in law as regards property.  Therefore, one cannot draw a direct parallel with the Motor Insurers' Bureau as it is structured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not draw a direct parallel and the amendment was put forward in the spirit of finding some <Col N="2139" /> alternative for a particularly acute problem that will continue in the case of small businesses.  Predictably as far as I can gauge it, the Minister's response has been practically identical to the one in the Dáil.  Our concern remains about the severe impact of this cut-back exercise. The implications of the Bill for the groups I have elaborated on must be taken seriously. The scale of the crime problem is still such that the various categories mentioned in the amendments are being subjected to further penalties for increased insurance cover, especially schools, community centres and businesses in crime torn urban areas.  Our case is that the removal of the right to compensation for malicious injuries is particularly unfair to a range of vulnerable categories.  They should continue to enjoy the benefits of the Malicious Injuries Acts until the crime level is very considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>On the question of the reduction of the crime level I want to link up amendment No. 10 which asks that section 2 (1) of this Act shall not come into operation until the levels of crime and vandalism recorded in 1985 have been reduced by at least 50 per cent.  As long as the crime level remains as high as it is, as day follows night, crime will continue, the vulnerable areas I identified will suffer, and will have to pay increased insurance premiums in difficult times in order to get that cover.  In the case of some of these organisations and groups, the level of insurance premium will be outside their reach.</P>
      <P>It is in that spirit that amendments Nos. 8 and 9 were put down, not as ideal models of what might be implemented but rather to get across the idea that an alternative is necessary, as Senator Ryan underlined in his contribution.  In conclusion, would the Minister of State inform the House when it is intended that this Bill will be implemented?  When will it go into action?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this amendment I was intrigued by it and hoped it <Col N="2140" /> would produce something more interesting than that which has been outlined This amendment specifies a rose by another name.  It is simply the reincarnation of the malicious injuries code without recourse to the Circuit Court, but instead with recourse to a tribunal.  That is how I understand Senator Hillery's amendment.  If I have misunderstood it, he might correct me.</P>
      <P>As a society we must ask ourselves the basic question: are we going to pick up the tab for every citizen's misfortune?  I find the answer of the principal Opposition party to this Bill very intriguing when one bears in mind their attitude to the Health (Amendment) Bill which we discussed in this House and which was welcomed by them some weeks ago.  The effect of that Bill was to take off health boards the onus in relation to charges for maintenance and treatment imposed by damage against persons who suffered injuries in motor accidents, and to ensure that such charges were paid by the insurance company involved, and not by the public body.  If the logic which the principal Opposition party displayed at that time in supporting the Health (Amendment) Bill were carried forward, there should be total support for the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  For that reason I support this Bill and oppose these amendments which are simply a rose by another name.</P>
      <P>I oppose this amendment on the basis that underlying it is the idea of the establishment of yet another form of tribunal. Somebody will have to ajudicate on the citizens' misfortune.  Here again we are going to establish, above or outside our existing court system, yet another form of tribunal with presumably six, eight or ten members and its own form of administration, its own bureaucracy.  In recent years we have seen the establishment of far too many tribunals to deal with either specific or ongoing situations.  For that reason I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to elaborate on that much further.  I made my case.  I have argued for a tribunal or something similar to what we have in <Col N="2141" /> mind on the basis that there is a need to meet the most urgent problems of businesses in crime torn areas.</P>
      <P>Senator Durcan refers to citizens' misfortune. The reality is that crime levels are extremely high now and that people are being very adversely affected by them.  I have been attempting, with the other speakers on this side of the House, to point out the harsh realities of the application of this Bill.  While Senator Durcan in the course of his Second Stage contribution said that he would like us to agree with the principle of the Bill, as realistic Members of this House we have to look at the practical implications to see what can be done for deserving cases.</P>

I am still in darkness because I do not understand the logic behind these amendments, bearing in mind the support which was given by Senator Hillery and his colleagues for the Health (Amendment) Bill and the fact that there is now a complete change of tack on the part of the principal Opposition party in relation to the underlying logic and the underlying principle.  He might explain further for me why this departure has come about.</P>

      <P>Suppose you are driving down the road, and for some reason you have an accident involving somebody who is not insured.  You have no recourse to your third party insurance because that does not cover it and the person with whom you are involved in the accident has no insurance.  Therefore you have <Col N="2142" /> access to a fund known as the Motor Insurers' Bureau fund which covers this type of consideration.  This amendment was put down because we feel that many property holders will be coming onstream who will have no insurance at all and will find themselves in difficulty if there is no fund.  Such a fund could be accumulated by insurance companies or by the Government and the Minister could have control over it.  As Senator Hillery has said, the provision under amendment No. 10 will not come into operation until we have at least a 50 per cent reduction in crime.  We do not see that on the horizon at the moment but we hope that the Government will ensure that the rate of crime will reduce rather than increase.  If we had reached that stage we on this side of the House would not need to be as concerned as we are about it.  With the impact of crime and its escalation today, we feel that there should be some fund such as the Insurers' Bureau fund that will compensate people who will not be covered either by the Act or by any insurance company.</P>

My understanding is that the Motor Insurers' Bureau are funded entirely by resources other than State resources, that the Government contributes nothing to that fund and that the moneys within that fund come from all our insurance premiums.  Maybe I am wrong but that is my understanding.</P>

      <P>There is no contribution whatsoever by the State.  That is reasonable. Here we have a departure from that principle, and it is a very unfair comparison to draw.  Here we have a suggestion that the State should contribute.  In other words, the suggestion is that we have the malicious injuries code reproduced in another form, presided over by a tribunal but with State funding to an <Col N="2143" /> agreed extent.  That is what the amendment provides.  I oppose that.  We must be realistic and tell people that they must in measure look after themselves and that the big net which was the State is not there any more.  That is what we did in this House when we enacted the Health (Amendment) Act which was welcomed on all sides of the House.  We are trying to bring the same principle a little further in this Bill today.</P>

      <P>The question asked by Senator Hillery was with regard to the enactment of this legislation.  Any damage that is caused after the passing of the Act will be subject to the new legislation.  Any damage or any claims prior to that will be dealt with under the 1981 legislation.  The restricted scheme applies only to damage caused after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing for the time taken to process claims, it is unlikely that the revised scheme will effect major savings before 1987 or 1988.  The statutory limitation on taking actions under the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981 is three years.  Notice of intention to make a claim must be served on the local authority in question and the Garda within 14 days of the incident giving rise to the damage.  That just clarifies one point.  On the other point with regard to the crime levels, there is <Col N="2144" /> no doubt at all that the overall downward trend of crime which commenced two years ago is continuing.  More importantly for the purpose of this legislation, this drop in crime is reflected, according to the incoming President of the Insurance Institute of Ireland, in the lower number of insurance claims arising from specific criminal operations.  This must inevitably lead to a beneficial effect on the general level of insurance premiums and availability of insurance.</P>

When this Bill is passed by the House, with a Government majority, it will then go to the President for signature and it will then be the law of the land.

    <Title>Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, 1986: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that section 3 is not good law in that it is putting a responsibility on chief superintendents of the Garda Síochána which <Col N="2147" /> is an unfair responsibility.  It purports to allow the appropriate chief superintendent to certify that the act was committed maliciously by a person acting on behalf of an unlawful organisation.  The Minister, I am sure, will say in reply that a similar provision already exists relative to the necessity for the recoupment of expenses from the State.  That is not really comparable because what is at issue there is not whether the person against whom the malicious act is being committed will or will not get his or her money but merely who will ultimately bear the cost, the local authority or the State.  As, ultimately, the State had underwritten practically all the costs in any case these certificates were of no practical significance in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of the responsibilities already on them, we are proposing to put an additional responsibility on chief superintendents, because no malicious injuries compensation will be payable except where injury is as a result of the actions of an unlawful organisation, leaving out the question of riot for the moment. Imagine the position in which a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána will find himself when he is faced with the knowledge that a malicious act has been committed in respect of the property of an individual who had not insurance &mdash; and no doubt he would be made aware of that.  Local pressure will be brought to bear on him, or he will feel that it is, when deciding whether or not to certify that that act was the result of the activities of an unlawful organisation, because on his decision alone will depend whether or not a person who is not insured will get any compensation.  A person who has property which is not insured, or, more frequently, inadequately insured, has to go to the chief superintendent in his area to say that he believes his property was burned down by an unlawful organisation.  Unless the chief superintendent so certifies, he will not be able to get malicious injuries compensation. That is subjecting the chief superintendent in his own district to pressure and responsibility which is quite <Col N="2148" /> inappropriate to a man in his position. The chief superintendent is dependent for the operation of his office on the goodwill of the local community and the involvement of the chief superintendent in certifications such as this would potentially bring him into conflict with the local community.  For that reason I think that the system used is quite inappropriate and is a lazy way of overcoming a problem.</P>
    <P>When the 1981 Act was being introduced somebody thought that it would be a good idea if the chief superintendent certified whether the local authority or the State should pay compensation. Because they were two public bodies there was not going to be too much pressure on the chief superintendent. Now he will be certifying between the individual who has lost all his or her possessions bearing the cost or the State bearing the cost.  That is not a fair responsibility to be put on chief superintendents.</P>
    <P>The system used is quite inappropriate and is a lazy way out of overcoming a problem.  When the 1981 legislation was being prepared, somebody thought that it would be a good idea if the chief superintendent certified whether the local authority or the State would pay. Because they were two public bodies, it did not much matter.  There would not be that much pressure on the chief superintendent. Now you are talking about a situation where he will be certifying between whether the individual who has lost all his or her possessions will bear the cost, or the State will bear the cost.  It is not fair to put on chief superintendents the responsibility in certain cases to decide whether a person will be totally bankrupt.  That is an unreasonable provision and some better method should be found by the Minister to determine whether activities were carried on by an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>The amount of power that is put into the hands of chief superintendents is colossal. Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> The appropriate chief superintendent shall not be required to disclose in any proceedings the information (or its source) on which a certificate under subsection (1) is based.</P>
    <P>It would be absolutely and totally at his discretion.  If the chief superintendent says it is as a result of an unlawful organisation the State pays.  If he says it is not, or refuses to give such a certificate, the persons themselves pay.  That is bad law. I should like to hear what proposals the Minister has to ameliorate the position, which I consider quite unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting section. I do not agree totally with the point made by Senator O'Leary that the powers given to a chief superintendent are inappropriate.  It is appropriate that a chief superintendent should have power to certify certain matters in relation to subversion and that is what this section does.  It gives an evidential value to the certificate of a chief superintendent for such purposes in relation to the operation of section 2 (1) of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the inclusion in section 3 (1) of the word &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo;. I would not find the section worrisome if the word &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; were excluded.  If it were excluded, the value of the chief superintendent's certificate would be simply to confirm the jurisdiction of the court and to confirm that the application came within the much limited malicious injuries code.  By including the word &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo;, it would appear that the section is taking the onus off the applicant to prove that there was malice by the person who committed the act.  It would appear that all the applicant has to do, if this Bill is passed, is simply prove the quantum of his or her damages, if the chief superintendent gives a certificate that satisfies all matters other than proof of quantum.  That is an unfortunate situation. I have expressed my views on the principle underlying that code already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have a limited malicious injuries code &mdash; that is what the Bill does &mdash; then we should not include the word <Col N="2150" />&ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; in section 3 (1) of this Bill, because to do so creates a total departure from the code.  If we are going to include that word, we should establish a much simpler procedure for dealing with malicious injuries applications.  I would like the Minister to respond as to whether she would be willing to remove the word &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; from section 3 (1) between now and Report Stage.  If she can do that, she will be making the operation of subsections (1) (2), (3) and (4) of section 3 clearer and providing that the effect of a chief superintendent's certificate is simply to get the application into court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be very difficult for lay persons to prove that damage caused to their property was caused maliciously.  They would not normally be able to prove in a court that the damage suffered was caused by a person acting on behalf of, or in connection in any way with an organisation in question.  Accordingly, so that the provision will have practical meaning the Bill is giving a statutory role to the Garda.  The appropriate chief superintendent will issue the certificate to the person who proposes to make an application for compensation if he is satisified, first, that the act was committed by a person acting on behalf of one of the organisations in question and secondly, that it was an act done maliciously, as defined in that section referred to by Senator Durcan.  Such a certificate will be admissable as evidence of the facts stated therein.  This should simplify matters as far as determining whether an organisation referred to in the new section 5 (1) (a) of the Bill was involved in a particular instance.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland malicious damages scheme has a similar provision where a certificate is issued by the chief constable. One could ask what happens if a certificate is refused.  If a chief superintendent is of the opinion that an unlawful organisation was not involved, or that the act was not malicious, there is nothing to prevent a claimant from seeking other evidence to support his case that such an organisation was involved or that the act was malicious, as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not happy with the inclusion of the word &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo;. If the word &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; is excluded, the intent as indicated in the Minister's Second Stage speech and as indicated in the Dáil, will operate properly, that is that this section should operate merely as a procedural matter, that the chief superintendent's certificate will enable an applicant to get his or her application before the Circuit Court.  The chief superintendent will certify that the circumstances specified in the new section 5 (1) (a) (i), (ii) or (iii) will exist.  What section 3 proposes is to bring the matter a step further and to provide that the question of establishing malice, which is basic to a malicious injury application, is removed.  The necessity for doing that no longer exists.  The applicant does not have to establish malice as the chief superintendent's certificate does that.  The issue of a certificate under section 3 has the effect of proving the case and virtually winning the case, other than the question of proof of quantum.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Senator that the certificate provided is only evidence.  It is still up to the court to decide whether the act was committed maliciously.  If a lay person were given a certificate that an act was committed by an unlawful organisation only, it could be very difficult for him or her to provide that it was committed maliciously because of the circumstances involved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 23, to delete &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to change in a number of places in the Bill the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and substitute the expression &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;.  First of all, I want to bring to the attention of the House that I do not propose to make the change in every case.  There are a number of cases in the Bill where I consider that &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is correct.  They refer basically to where something is to be done by the tribunal or by the complaints board.  The reason I am drawing a distinction between those actions and the actions of the other people is that they are actions of corporate bodies or of groups of people who contain an element of voluntary service, who contain an outside independent element, which obviously cannot be as disciplined with regard to time, or should not have the same onus put on them with regard to time as people whose professional duty it is to carry out the responsibilities placed on them by the provisions of this Bill when enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I have identified what I consider to be the appropriate places where &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; should be substituted by the phrase &ldquo;as soon as is practicable.&rdquo;  The first such case is on page 6, which Members will be aware refers to section 4.  In that case in line 23, it imposes an obligation on the chief executive at subsection (3) (c) where the chief executive is of the opinion that the complaint is admissible, and the board decides the complaint is admissible, the chief executive shall, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, so notify in writing the complainant. That is a very good example of why I consider some fairly strict timetable should be put on people.  Here a chief executive is of the opinion that the complaint is admissible.  The board have decided that the complaint is admissible. All that requires to be done in order to start the procedure is for the chief executive to notify the complainant and <Col N="2153" /> the Commissioner.  I do not see anything particularly wrong with that.  I do not see any reason that should be delayed. Therefore, it falls on us to consider what is the legal meaning of the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have failed to find an accurate or a judicial definition of &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo; Other expressions were suggested in the course of the Committee Stage debate, phrases such as &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;  I would like to explain briefly why I consider they are not as good as what I suggest.</P>
    <P>To do something &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;, in my opinion, imposes a very strict obligation on somebody to do something almost irrespective of the circumstances. For example, if a delay was caused, in the classic example of sending things to a laboratory for examination in a drunken driving case, if it was interrupted by holidays or something like that, that would mean, if one used the expression &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; that one could not postpone the task until after one's holidays.  I think the phrase &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; has been fairly conclusively held to mean exactly what it says, that a break for something social like holidays, or even for a weekend, might not be an acceptable interpretation.  The phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; has the same problem attached to it, in that it may be possible to do something but highly inconvenient.  For that reason I do not think &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; is appropriate.  It would impose an obligation on people which would be of a kind which would be unreasonable. That is why, having considered the suggestion of &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;, I dismissed it.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; of course, is used in the British regulations. The Minister will be aware of this.  I saw the Minister looking last week at the All-England Reports.  He is no doubt looking at 1986 I, All-England Reports, Part V, pages 257-320, where in the case of <i>Rex versus the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police</i> and others two matters were considered.  It is made clear that, in that case, an obligation was <Col N="2154" /> put on the investigating officer to do something &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;.  In that case it was not done for some two years.  Hardly surprisingly, it was held that two years were outside what was considered to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The English regulations apparently use the expression &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  I was not aware of that when I decided on it in this connection, but it strengthens my conviction that this is an appropriate expression to use in the circumstances.  I refer the Minister to a case in which &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; was referred to.  It was decided that a delay of two years in informing the officer concerned of the complaint meant it was not done &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; in all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; is different from &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; which I have already given my interpretation of, and from &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;.  I maintain that it is also significantly different from &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, which is a much more vague concept and a lot less urgent than &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;, because the latter puts an obligation on those involved to do things quickly &mdash; not to do them immediately, not to do them without delay, but to do them as soon as they can be done taking all circumstances into account.  For example, if somebody went on holidays, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; would cover the circumstances if the person took the action when he came back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is considerably more vague than that; it seems to me to suggest as soon as a person who has the responsibility considers it appropriate to do so.  I look forward to the Minister's explanation of what he thinks the difference is between &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;. He must have considered &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; as one of the options and <Col N="2155" /> he must have got advice.  Obviously, the research facilities available to his advisers would be considerably better than those available to me.  Therefore, the Minister might like to say what he considers, and the basis on which he considers it, his definition of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is and what the appropriate and corresponding definition of &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; is. Having heard that, I will be in a better position to see if in view of that response it would be appropriate for me to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>One of the good things about the administration in its broader sense, the public service, is that it is a model of integrity by and large.  It operates fairly, and as one who has been critical on many occasions, particularly of the Garda, I wish to say that many gardaí do a very fine job.  One of the deficiencies in our public service generally is their capacity for delay which can destroy the public image of an otherwise very well run public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I share the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Leary about the need to build into both regulations and legislation the most tightly worded phraseology possible to ensure that there will be a motivation in people, the Garda in this case, to operate with the minimum of delay.  Therefore, I worry about clauses written in such a way that people can make their own judgments about the urgency of cases rather than having society tell them that because complaints against the Garda are being investigated, these matters are important.  It would be improper of me to suggest that this is a matter of fundamental importance, and it will be interesting to hear the Minister giving a possible legal interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and how it falls into the spectrum of phrases to indicate some <Col N="2156" /> sense of urgency.  Much of the good work done throughout the public service in all areas is badly damaged in the eyes of the public because of unnecessary delays, not brought about by any malice but by a sense of a lack of urgency.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary pointed out that the English regulations, more properly the British regulations state &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. Accuracy in the use of language is important in cases like this.</P>
      <P>I will not limit myself to referring to the British experience.  I will go back a little further in our cultural heritage and speak about the parts of it we share with our British friends.  Being of Norman stock, I am rather sensitive to it.  Part of the difficulty lies in the perception of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In our use of language the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has an indefinite and conditional flavour.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; has another meaning and mood in the English language which can be rather imperative not to speak of subjunctive.  I go back to the French phrase which would translate &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; very accurately &mdash; that is where it came from in the first place &mdash; which is <i>aussitôt que soit</i> which is the most imperative expression one can have.  It is the sense in which it is used here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary has pointed out that he has not proposed the replacement which is involved in this amendment in all cases in the Bill where the phrase is used.  I would like to remind him of the fact that one of the provisions of the Bill is that the member about whom a complaint is being made must be informed of the complaint &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; after he is formally notified of its admissibility.  Again, that has the same sense of urgency attaching to it as I would give to it here.  The essential meaning is that what is to be done must be done without avoidable or unjustified delay. There are some judicial authorities for saying that the phrase does not mean &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; having regard to the person's own convenience or business interests.  The phrase is frequently used in statutes in relation to the making of <Col N="2157" /> reports.  Examples are to be found in section 33 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, and section 19 of the National Lottery Bill, 1986.  I think we can now call that the National Lottery Act, 1986, after the labours of the Chamber last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the context in which the expression is used in this Bill.  On Committee Stage Senator O'Leary asked for a judicial authority and definition of the phrase.  Stroud's <i>Dictionary of English Law</i> does not mention it, nor does Jowitt's <i>Judicial Dictionary.</i>  Saunders work on <i>Words and Phrases Legally Defined</i> mentions a case from 1910 where the phrase was used in a mining lease.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as may be&rdquo;.  The Lord Chancellor said:</P>
      <P>I think that it is quite impossible to say that when a man covenants in regard to particular mines that he will proceed to open...them &lsquo;as soon as may be&rsquo; after the date of the demise, that means that he may do so as soon as may be, having regard to his own convenience and to his business interests in working other lands and other mines outside the demised mines altogether. I think that this would be making those words far more pregnant and giving them a far wider meaning then can in any legitimate way be attributed to them.</P>
      <P>By the process of counter argument that information shows the urgency which is attached to this phrase.  In the same work, <i>Words and Phrases Legally Defined,</i> by Saunders, there is a judicial interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; in the case of the <i>Anglo-American Oil Company Limited versus Port of London Authority</i>&mdash; 1914 1 KB 14.  The following opinion was given:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> In my opinion &lsquo;as soon as practicable&rsquo; means as soon as practicable in the course of navigation, having regard to the facilities of the port, and not as soon as practicable with regard to the convenience of the merchant's business.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the House that in the cases with which Senator O'Leary's amendments are concerned the persons who are being obliged to perform a duty &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; are not in any sense independent republics.  They are not acting without reference to other people. They are subject to close supervision by or on behalf of the complaints board. The investigating officer is subject to the directions of the chief executive who is answerable to the board.  An exception concerns the duty imposed on the Commissioner in section 4 (4) to notify the member concerned that a complaint has been made against him, but it has not been suggested that the Commissioner would be likely to delay such a notification in the normal case, but he is authorised by section 4 (5) to postpone notification if he thinks it necessary to do so to preserve or obtain evidence.</P>
    <P>I could tediously delay the House by referring to other cases but I will come back to the point I started from.  Having examined the matter and having heard Senator O'Leary's arguments and submissions on Committee Stage and having reflected on them in the meantime it is my opinion that the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; faithfully conveys the sense of urgency we want to convey about these matters.  It meets the case and for that reason I am not disposed to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to section 4 (5), and to the responsibility resting on the Commissioner to notify the officer about the complaint.  I am glad the Minister raised this point because I was going to do so.  Will the Minister give further clarification on the extra authority and responsibility on the Commissioner to postpone notification?  A peculiar situation can arise.  He has to <Col N="2159" /> have very good grounds, otherwise this is the situation I can see developing: undue delay, unnecessary delay and delay which cannot be related to getting final evidence. The Commissioner will find himself in the Ombudsman's dictionary &ldquo;Guilty of maladministration&rdquo;.  Undue delay and unnecessary delay are maladministration. That is why I share the concern of Senator O'Leary and Senator Durcan about delay which is not necessary and about delay which is avoidable. Who will complain about the Commissioner and to whom?  There is nothing in the Bill about that.  This is not a question of mechanics.  I am not a linguistic expert or a lawyer, but I recognise an offence against natural justice when I see it.  Undue delay is a very serious matter for the officer who is charged.</P>
      <P>A couple of examples will satisfy me. From my experience I cannot understand it.  I operated the police complaints board against the RUC in the North.  The other question I want to ask is a very big question for the Minister.  It is probably an unfair question.  Maybe I should have given him notice.  Can the Stalker saga be repeated in the Republic under this Bill?  Here is a man who has not been charged.  He has been suspended.  There may be <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I am watching very closely, having been chairman of the police complaints board in the North, to see how they are involved in the independent element of the serious allegations or charges which may be made against Stalker.  What I am asking is this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 4 (3) (c) of the Bill provides as follows:</P>
      <P>If the chief executive is of opinion that a complaint is admissible, or the Board decides that a complaint to which paragraph (b) of this subsection applies is admissible, the chief executive shall, as soon as may be, so notify in writing the complainant and the Commissioner and, if the complaint was made, sent or given to the Board, send to the Commissioner a copy of the complaint, or, if the complaint was not in writing, a copy of the record of it.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is one of those which Senator O'Leary wishes to amend.  I remind the House of that because it is important in the context of section 4 (5) and indeed section 4 (4). Section 4 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>On receipt by the Commissioner of a notification under subsection (3) (c) of this section, he shall, as soon as may be, notify in writing the member concerned that a complaint (the nature of which shall be specified in the notification) has been made against him by a specified person.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) goes on to deal with the question raised specifically by Senator McGonagle and it provides as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2161" /> It shall be the duty of the Commissioner and of any member (whether authorised under section 1 (2) of this Act or not), on becoming aware of a complaint, to take any lawful measures that appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining or preserving evidence of or relating to the conduct complained of and, in a case where the Commissioner proposes to take any such measures, he may postpone notification of the complaint to the member concerned under subsection (4) of this section until the measures have been taken.</P>
    <P>That is a very specific and restricted power of discretion to the Commissioner. It applies only in specific cases. It is worth repeating them.  Any member has the duty to take any lawful measures that appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining or preserving evidence of or relating to the conduct complained of.  In a case where the Commissioner proposes to take any such measures he may postpone notification of the complaint to the member concerned under subsection (4) of this section until the measures have been taken, that is measures that appear to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining or preserving evidence.</P>
    <P>That is very specific.  It is necessary that that should be the case.  It is in nobody's interest, neither of a member of the general public nor of a member of the force, to allow the emergence of a situation where evidence might not be preserved or obtained because of, perhaps, precipitate or injudicious action.  The purpose of that subsection is very clearly and very narrowly defined as relating to the concern to make sure that the obtaining of evidence is not in any way compromised by action that might be taken. Those are the only circumstances in which the Commissioner has the right to postpone the notification in the way that is provided for here.  That, I would submit to the House, is not a provision that would in any way sanction the kind of delay that emerged in the case to which <Col N="2162" /> Senator O'Leary referred a few moments ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has failed completely to explain to the House the meaning of the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  He has said that if it was translated into French it would be very imperative and urgent.  If we ever have to interpret it as it is, translated into French, the Minister's view in that regard will be of considerable assistance.  In the meantime we must view it as it is in English, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  The Minister may be right.  It may be very imperative.  It may be very urgent.  I do not know.  I am <Col N="2163" /> not saying that I am definitely right in it by any manner or means.  I am saying that the Minister is entering into what appear to me to be uncharted waters. He did not have very convincing arguments, nor indeed did I have any convincing argument.  I am not boosting my own arguments.  The Minister did not have very convincing arguments as to what the real meaning of &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is.  He said it was used in another statute dealing with posts and telecommunications. That may be true, but if it has not been judically interpreted the fact that it has been used in the statue is irrelevant.  We do have in police regulations, whether they be English, British or whatever you call them, judicial interpretation of &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and it seems to fall some way in line with what appears to be the consensus of the House as to the proper approach and the desirable sense of urgency which should be applicable in these matters.</P>
      <P>What we do not have in regard to &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is a definition of it. The Minister gave us one example which dated back to about 1911.  I am not objecting to the fact that it is that old.  I am saying that if it has been judicially interpreted since then it is fairly uncertain what it means and I am surprised in those circumstances that the Minister is satisfied to use it.  The difficulty which I had was finding a judicial definition of it.  The Minister went through a number of books which just did not have it.  He found one which did have it, but the standard textbook did not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To introduce that expression into a situation where we want to be as certain and as positive as possible and to put a reasonable degree of urgency into the process without tying people up in knots, would be a shorthand way of saying what we are trying to achieve.  In those circumstances the use of the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is open to interpretative difficulties and is slightly more risky from the point of view of making sure that justice will be done between the parties. That is what we will be seeking to do.  It is slightly more risky than the use of the <Col N="2164" /> expression &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  That is all I am saying.  I am not certain I am right but I am certain that the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is an expression which has not been judicially defined in the reasonable past.  For that reason, it is not an expression to which I would feel attracted, in putting obligations on people in an important matter like the complaints procedure as set out herein.</P>
    <P>The Minister is mistaken in not accepting my amendment.  Of course, I am not sufficiently sure of my grounds to be able to press the amendment to a vote but I put it forward in the expectation that I would extract from the Minister a more comprehensive reply than I had got.  In view of the fact that I have not got that comprehensive reply, I can only remain in ignorance as to the true position, an ignorance which is shared both by the Minister and myself.  He did not seem to satisfactorily define &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;. In those circumstances I have no option but to withdraw the amendment, and not because I want to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 42 to 47 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6).&mdash;(1) (a) The Commissioner shall appoint a member of the Garda Síochána (in this Act referred to as an investigating officer) not below the rank of inspector.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is to give the Minister the opportunity of amending the Bill because I knew he was very anxious to do so.  Section 6 contains a rather strange provision to which I referred on Committee Stage.  The section speaks of instructing or permitting the Commissioner to appoint a member of the Garda Síochána as an investigating officer, a member not below the rank of superintendent or, if he considers the circumstances so warrant, of the rank of <Col N="2165" /> inspector.  The effect of that, irrespective of what is in the Minister's mind, is that he can at his option appoint anybody from an inspector upwards.  That is the reality of the situation and, therefore, why not put it into law?  The Minister can have all kinds of internal rules about it if he wants to, that for certain kinds of cases it should be a chief superintendent, but why not put it into law?  For that reason I have drafted an amendment with Senator Durcan that is much more straightforward than the proposed subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The purpose of this amendment as Senator O'Leary said is to give effect to the reality of the section.  This issue was raised by Senator Eoin Ryan on Committee Stage and it was discussed at that time.  It is unrealistic that the Commissioner should have the two options specified in section 6 (1) (a) (i) and (ii). The section as it stands is meaningless. The Minister gave a reasoning on Committee Stage which I did not find particularly inspiring.  The amendment, as drafted, gives effect to the reality and does not in any way diminish the powers of the Commissioner.</P>

      <P>As a lay person, I had this impression before I got involved in this House that the purpose of being governed by law was largely to do with people being able to have a precise understanding of what society deemed to be the case in many areas and that the regulations under which society operated were written down to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty.  This is the third time in 24 hours in which we have been confronted with phraseology in legislation which is anything but precise and which leaves all sorts of options open to people, and quite unnecessarily so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the amendment but I begin to wonder about what is it that motivates people to draw up legislation in this ambiguous way.  We had it yesterday on the regrettable National Lottery Bill; I will not concede that it is an Act until it is finally signed.  The National Lottery Bill had at least two paragraphs in it that <Col N="2166" /> were gobbledegook.  I would not accuse this of being gobbledegook but I would like to know why it is necessary to have two such subordinate clauses in it when, in fact, what it really means is that when the Garda Commissioner thinks it is appropriate he can appoint an inspector and when he thinks it is appropriate he can appoint a superintendent.  Why cannot we just say that he can appoint somebody not below the rank of inspector and leave it at that?  There must be some overwhelming advice available to the Minister or perhaps this was slipped in and he did not notice.  He is hardly going to accept an amendment at this late stage.  He will hardly admit that he did not notice; knowing the Minister he probably did notice &mdash; before he turns his ire in my direction.  I would like to know why we put in things like this which mean something simple but where the complicated phrases attached to them make them sound much more complicated than they actually are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  Like the movers of the amendment, I find it difficult to understand why it is framed in this way.  Perhaps I could ask the Minister to address a question when he is replying to this amendment as to whether there would be any circumstances in which there could be a challenge to the Commissioner considering that the circumstances warranted the appointment of the rank of inspector.  Could that be challenged by anybody?  If not, why not simply accept the amendment, putting in plain English what is in complicated gobbledegook?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The clarity of the exposition of both the amendment and supporting statements belie the contention that this is gobbledegook.  When people are dealing with gobbledegook they find it very difficult to be clear about it but Senators have found it very easy to be clear about this one.  I confess to some surprise that the House should be making such a meal of such a very simple and straightforward matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following our discussion on Committee Stage, it is clear that there is not <Col N="2167" /> a great deal between us on this issue.  The advantage in my view of having the text as it is in the Bill is that it clearly indicates that in the normal course of events the member appointed to investigate a complaint will be a superintendent.  There is a value in that, both from the point of view of the general public and also from the point of view of the Garda Síochána, in that it indicates very clearly the importance we attach to the proper investigation of these complaints.</P>
    <P>Complaints can take many and varied forms; some of them will be very serious, some of them will be serious and some of them will be trivial.  They will cover the whole spectrum.  While it is important that we indicate that the norm is that an investigation be carried out by a superintendent, where the Commissioner believes that it is not necessary to do that it can be carried out by an inspector. Could that be challenged?  I suppose there may be occasions when people will feel that they have not perhaps been all that well done by, some because they have been investigated by an inspector rather than superintendent and others perhaps <i>vice versa.</i>  That is the kind of contention that would arise anyway if people feel upset by the fact that they are being investigated or if they are upset at the way they are being investigated.  I do not think that having a provision of this kind in the Bill is going to make any difference to that ground of objection that a person under investigation might bring forward during the investigation.</P>
    <P>My view is that the text as it stands gives the Commissioner a clear indication as to what we expect and, equally, a clear indication of the fact that he has some discretion in the matter.  That is important. As I said on Committee Stage, we should recognise in this Bill that the Commissioner, notwithstanding the provisions of this Bill, is the chief disciplinary officer of the Garda.  It is important that we should make that clear so that, if anything, we buttress his authority as the chief disciplinary officer.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the <Col N="2168" /> Senators who contributed, particularly Senator Robinson who emphasised a point which I had forgotten to mention. One of the reasons we like to tidy things up is to reduce the area of potential conflict. This Bill says the Commissioners can do certain things if he considers the circumstances so warrant.  Somebody at some stage is going to ask, did he ever think about the situation, did he ever come to a conclusion that the circumstances warranted it before he appointed the inspector, or did he just appoint the inspector as a matter of routine?</P>
      <P>I will not push this amendment to a vote, but I think it is sloppy draftmanship which adds another layer of uncertainty in particular circumstances, the uncertainty being whether the Commissioner exercised his discretion to appoint somebody to the rank of inspector properly, or whether he exercised it at all.  That is an unnecessary additional complication and it was only in a spirit of trying to remove the complication and to facilitate the process that I proposed my amendment which I now withdraw.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in introducing this amendment is to invite the Minister to explain what inherent superiority one can presume in successive Ministers for Justice over a carefully chosen chairman of an appeals board which would leave to him the final decision about what constitutes a matter which would be liable to affect <Col N="2169" /> the security of the State or what constitutes a serious and unjustifiable infringement of the rights of some other person.  Why should we take this stand given that a recent Minister for Justice showed very little consideration for peoples rights and privileges particularly in the area of privacy, when he handed out telephone tapping warrants?  Why should we hand this power over to a Minister for Justice and presume that that individual would be far more sensitive to all these proprieties than the chairman of an appeals board working under statute?</P>
    <P>Second, I want to mention the tendency to expand the concept of the security of the State.  On the last amendment the Minister mentioned subversives making unjustifiable claims.</P>

      <P>I must have misheard the Minister but I am very glad he did not.  I am relieved because I thought subversives were extending into areas they had not gone into before.  Considerable emphasis is being laid on subversives as a breed who, if it were not for the valiant State sitting on them, would have materialised in virtually every square yard of the country and would have taken away all our freedoms.  We get the impression of a country on the verge of armed takeover by a revolutionary organisation if it were not for the security of the State being protected.  That is not to make little of the efforts being made to deal with armed subversion.  It is the suggestion of the scale of it and the threat it poses that some of us are concerned about.  After the recent referendum anybody who thinks Irish society is on the brink of revolutionary change would have a lot of arguing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to wonder how a section like this which will be internal to the apparatus of security within the State, will be operated.  On Committee Stage when I suggested that the board would not be involved in assessing this matter the Minister said I was incorrect because the investigating officer would be acting on <Col N="2170" /> behalf of the board.  The investigating officer, with possible rare exceptions, will be, a member of the Garda Síochána.  I am sure he will do his job with integrity and with thoroughness, but he will still have a view of what constitutes a threat to the security of the State which will be coloured by his training, experience and the guidelines issued by his superiors and, ultimately, by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about the way people are arrested under the Offences Against the State Act.  It was in the Trimbole case that a judge in the High Court, confirmed by the Supreme Court, brought some limitations on the capacity of the Garda to arrest people under that Act.  I had the delightful pleasure of being followed home by plain clothes members of the Garda not so many years ago with my flat being kept under observation until the early hours of the morning &mdash; looking back it was quite funny but at the time it was quite unnerving &mdash; and I am not prepared to dismiss the possibility of being arrested under the Offences Against the State Act.  The Garda must have had some reason to follow me.  I cannot understand why, being, if anything, the most romantic pacifist in the House.  Perhaps it is the power of my ideas that is so subversive.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed because I thought you were very interested in my life story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly 2,000 people are arrested every year under the Offences Against the State Act.  As long as the identification of the security of the State and the final arbitration as to whether a certain matter is a threat to the security of the State are <Col N="2171" /> retained within the apparatus which is responsible for looking after the security of the State, a large number of people who are arrested and searched under the Offences Against the State Act will have considerable difficulty in getting a proper hearing of their complaint.  One could argue whether everything in a report by the investigating officer should be made public in the broadest sense but one could not argue that all these matters should be excluded.</P>
    <P>What I have suggested is that an independent element of assessment should be built into decisions of this nature.  The first stage should be that the officers would report to the chairman and the Commissioner, and they should endeavour to reach an agreed position on it.  I would assume that in 99.9 per cent of cases that would be quite feasible.  Given that the chairman of the board will be an eminent member of the Irish establishment, he or she and the Garda Commissioner will take, I suspect, very similar views on these matters.  It would be at least an active role for the board in determining these matters.  If that failed then the board should decide on these matters. I do not understand why we have to do it differently.</P>
    <P>There is an apparent reluctance within certain areas of the apparatus responsible for the security of the State to believe that anybody except themselves understands or cares about the problems of society in the areas of crime and subversion, and is prepared to do something about them.  We have this often self-made imagery, particularly coming from the Department of Justice, of a bastion of security defending the rest of us innocents from an overwhelming wave of terror and subversion that would sweep us all away if we really understood or were allowed to know what was going on.</P>
    <P>The best protection for the security of the State is the freely given support of the citizens of the State for the protection of the security of the State.  To have people give freely their support to whatever measures are necessary they need to have the information on which those <Col N="2172" /> measures are based.  Therefore, to retain all decisions on what constitutes information which might threaten the security of the State entirely within the apparatus of the security system will undermine that public confidence.  As matters stand a large area of what I consider to be legitimate concern about the operations of the Garda in the use of the Offences Against the State Act will not be properly or thoroughly investigated, and hence I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. One central point in what Senator Ryan has said and on which he is entitled to an explanation was not properly addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are complaints with regard to the treatment of persons arrested under the Offences Against the State Act going to be rendered not capable of being investigated by this system of the restriction? What will happen where a member of the force who, acting under the opinions he has formed which are necessary under the Offences Against the State Act, decides that somebody should be arrested and that simultaneously, for example, that that is a possible cause for complaint?  I am not talking about a person who might be ill-treated, but a person being improperly or wrongly arrested.  The Minister will be aware that paragraph 4 of the Fourth Schedule makes it a disciplinary matter, in so far as this complaints procedure is concerned, to arrest a person without good and sufficient cause. Some persons arrested under the Offences Against the State Act if they are not subsequently charged are going to feel that they have a genuine complaint &mdash; they may not have a genuine complaint &mdash; that there was not good and sufficient cause for making the arrest.  Is the Bill as enacted going to give an automatic out to any member of the force who has so arrested a person under the Offences Against the State Act?  It is not going to give an automatic out, will the Minister explain why?  I am talking only about a person arrested under the Offences Against the State Act, held for a while and not charged.  If that person says that <Col N="2173" /> he was arrested without good and sufficient cause will he get redress under this complaints procedure, or will the provisions in page 10 mean that the investigation of complaints envisaged in section 6 will be frustrated by an investigating officer almost automatically forming the opinion that because somebody was arrested under the Offences Against the State Act, the reason that person was arrested, based as it may be on information supplied to an officer, cannot be included in the report as it would be liable to affect the security of the State or constitute a serious and justifiable infringement of the rights of another person?  Senator Ryan's point should be considered by the House and for that reason I second the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been very well made both by Senator Ryan and Senator O'Leary in support.  I share their concern about the implications for persons arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act who subsequently, for whatever reason, wish to lodge a complaint and what may ensue from that.  I hope that the Minister will develop the implications fully.  I support this amendment because it takes it out of the potential political arena entirely and does not provide a role for the Minister for Justice in an area where there does not seem good ground for that role to be exercised by a political figure.  It is better for the system.  It secures the authority and acceptability of the whole complaints machinery that there is not the possibility of reference in such circumstances to the Minister for Justice or the role for the Minister as has been described.  I await with interest the Minister's reply to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>These are areas which, apart from other considerations, are concerned with the security of the State and I cannot accept, nor will I, that the security of the State or anything to do with it should be an area where there is no role for those who are elected by the people of the State to represent them.  I reject the logic of that argument from the beginning, particularly bearing in mind that if the citizens of the State do not like the way their elected representatives are carrying out their jobs they can fire them and they get the opportunity of doing so at least once every five years and recently rather more often than that.  It has become too much of a habit.  There are other people who have functions in this matter who cannot be dismissed by the general body of the populace even if they have a mind to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to take up some of the points made by Senator Brendan Ryan. I do not claim, nor would I ever, any inherent superiority for any Minister for Justice, the present one included, over the chairman of an appeals board, but that is not what is in question here. Senator Brendan Ryan is exaggerating more than a little in his remarks about the expansion of the concept of the security of the State.  Again, he is exaggerating more than a little in seeing dangers in the influence that an investigating officer's training, instructions or experience might have on the view that he takes of the security of the State.  In fact, I find it perverse to say that the experience, training and instruction of an investigating officer should not be brought to bear in assessing whether there is an implication for the security of the State.  You do not train people to do a particular job and then say because the security of the State may be involved here you will not let them do the job because their experience might colour their thinking.  Most of the time we like investigators and police <Col N="2175" /> officers to use and build on the experience they have rather than reject it.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan criticised the provisions in the Bill on the basis of his view that it is wrong that the definition of the security of the State should be reserved to the apparatus designed to protect that security.  I am not quite sure what point the Senator was making.  I agree with what I think I detected in his closing remarks, that we are all part of the apparatus designed to protect the security of the State.  I do not see anything wrong with acknowledging and providing for the exercise of a responsibility that we vest in certain people involved in the adminstration of our judicial and legal system and who are involved <i>ex officio</i> in protecting the security of the State.  It would be totally wrong to provide that the Minister for Justice should have no role in that because it is part of his responsibility, given to him and confirmed by the seal of office the President hands to him.  It is part of the responsibility of the security forces to protect and uphold the security of the State.  It is not part of our job to say those people on whom that charge is placed should not be involved in making decisions that arise out of our concern for the security of the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of people arrested under the Offences Against the State Act, it has always been the case that, if a person believes he or she has been wrongfully arrested under whatever Act is invoked to justify the arrest, that person may have a means of redress provided for in law.  We now have a new, clearer procedure under which people can make complaints, which I hope will be effective.  That redress will also be open to a person arrested under the Offences Against the State Act if that person believes he or she should not have been arrested.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (8), which it is proposed to amend, is designed to bring about an accommodation, a balance between two conflicting interests.  On the one hand we have the need to ensure that a complaint is thoroughly investigated and that all <Col N="2176" /> the relevant facts are placed before the complaints board so that they can arrive at a proper decision and, on the other hand, we have the concern to prevent the disclosure of information that would be liable to affect either the security or the State or, something which was not referred to in the remarks made so far apart from those made by Senator O'Leary, to infringe on the rights of some other person in a serious and unjustifiable way.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan goes in the direction that I have just set out, but I do not think the result of his amendment would be as effective as the provision in the Bill.  We are trying to protect two kinds of information here, security information and information from confidential sources, subversive or not.  Both those categories are already protected from unauthorised disclosure by the Official Secrets Act, 1963, and the power to authorise disclosure is vested only in Ministers. A distinction is made in the penalties applicable to the disclosure of subversive and non-subversive crimes. Very severe penalties are provided for in the case of the disclosure of security information and the disclosure of other official information is a summary offence. There is a distinction, therefore, already between those two areas and the Bill follows that pattern.  Only Ministers can authorise disclosure of information under the Official Secrets Act.  In the provision written into the Bill the Minister for Justice ultimately decides on whether the kind of sensitive information we are talking about would be disclosed to the board and to what extent.  Before that, of course, the investigating officer and the Commissioner must be satisfied that the information should not be disclosed.</P>
    <P>If the investigating officer alone or the investigating officer and the Commissioner together do not form the opinion that there is a problem about the disclosure of information, the Minister for Justice has no function.  Each of the three people involved &mdash; the investigating officer, the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice &mdash; when they come to make a decision as provided for in the <Col N="2177" /> Bill will make it in the knowledge that the fact that that decision has been made will be stated explicitly in the report.  In each case there will be pressure on them to ensure that there are good reasons for making that decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan proposes that the chairman of the board should be substituted for the Minister and have the power to make inquiries he believes are necessary before deciding on whether he should adopt the opinion of the investigating officer and the Commissioner. He proposes further that, in the event of disagreement between the chairman and the others, the matter should be decided by the board.  I do not think that is a proper way to deal with a matter which could affect the security of the State or put another person's life at risk.  It would give the board a right to insist on disclosure of information which, on grounds of public policy, even the courts cannot require to be disclosed.  There is ample documentation in regard to that point.  In addition to that, it would allow the board under section 12 of the Bill to authorise the chairman to disclose to the ordinary members or to the complainants any confidential information the chairman had obtained in the course of his inquiries.</P>
    <P>When one puts all that together it produces a most unsatisfactory situation for the sources of the information, perhaps for the security of the State and certainly for the Minister for Justice who, under Senator Ryan's proposal, would have no hand, act or part in the operation even though among the members of the Government he is probably the one, apart from the Taoiseach, who is most specifically charged with defending both the security of the State and the rights of individuals not to be put in danger as a result of matters over which they have no control.</P>
    <P>Looking at it from those angles I conclude that the system set out in the Bill best accommodates all the different requirements without in any way running the risk of unnecessary, unjustified oppression on people of the kind Senator Ryan seems to fear.  For that reason I am not disposed to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must appeal for the Chair's protection against Senator Honan.  That is a most unfair remark. Paragraph (d) reads:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the making of arrangements between the Board and the Commissioner whereby, in a particular case or more general by a matter referred to in paragraph (9) of this subsection may be dealt with by some other procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained at length why the Minister had to be involved and then, under paragraph (d), is quite prepared to accept an arrangement where the Commissioner and the board work out some arrangement where the Minister is not involved.  If the involvement of the Minister is a matter of principle we should not have paragraph (d).  If the matter of involvement of the Minister is not a matter of principle then we should have put in something else.  I would be interested in those areas where the courts do not have any right to publish documents particularly in the area of security of the State.  I do not suppose the Minister can go into that now, though I know it is possible to claim privilege.  I do not know that the courts are actually precluded from publishing documents if they deem it to be necessary in the interests of justice. I know that the Executive has made attempts in the past to insist that the courts do not have the right of access to certain documentation.  I do not know that the courts have ever conceded that right to the Executive.  Our courts have <Col N="2179" /> a good record in insisting that on all matters, including the question of the security of the State and things like that, the courts take the final decision.  I am simply drawing a parallel with what I understand to be the attitude of the courts in the area of the operation of the complaints board, that it should not be the Executive which takes these decisions.  I did not suggest that in some broadly based way the definition of the security of the State should be taken away from the people who are responsible for the security of the State. I said, in the context of the subsection of this Bill dealing with complaints against a section of the security forces, it should not be left to the security forces or their political master to define what constitutes the security of the State.</P>

I have a detailed view of what political masters are for and it is quite different from accepting Garda advice about what constitutes the security of the State in some sort of unqualified way which is not open to independent assessment.  I happen to believe that one of the values we have in this country is that the courts finally determine what is legal and what is not legal in this country.</P>

      <P>Of course it does not prejudice the courts but the Minister's implying somehow that to give a similar power to the appeal board to that which the courts currently have would somehow undermine the position of the Minister for Justice.  I do not see how it would.  I think it would strengthen the Minister's position because the suggestion of political interference in difficult areas would not so easily surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2180" /> Having been the author of a considerable number of complaints about misuses of the Offences Against the State Act, where I was satisfied that from my own knowledge that the security of the State was in no way at risk, I do not believe that there is any current willingness to treat such complaints seriously. The best one ever gets is a three line reply either from the investigating officer or the Garda officer who investigates the complaint or in some cases from the Minister for Justice saying that he or she is satisfied that the matter was carried out in accordance with the law.  If that is the level of accountability that is going to continue for complaints under the Offences Against the State Act we will get nowhere.  I have experience of people being questioned under the Offences Against the State Act where Senator Brendan Ryan's political views seemed to be more important than offences under the Offences Against the State Act and where people's activities in campaigns against the Criminal Justice Bill and the so-called pro-life amendment seemed to be of more concern than people's activities or scheduled offences under the Offences Against the State Act.  I think the Offences Against the State Act can be used as a convenient way of checking up on what people who are suspected of being involved in subversion are doing in other areas.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister will not accept the amendment.  I am confused as to how he can on the one hand make it an issue of principle and then tell us that under paragraph (d) if the Commissioner and the board agree on the different procedure he is quite happy with it.  I can just assume and hope that since he sees this as an acceptable procedure he will do his best to encourage the Garda Commissioner to agree to implement some sort of an arrangement which would be a far more acceptable method of operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when the draft of these regulations was debated so I will not try to go back to that debate. By and large these regulations are a worthy step forward and I want to compliment the Minister on them and, notwithstanding my reservations, on the introduction of an independent complaints procedure to deal with complaints against gardaí, I should not be negative and complaining all of the time.  I do think that both of these items are an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I regret one part of these regulations.  That is the fact that the only age distinction that appears to exist in the regulations is between persons over 17 years of age and persons under 17 years of age.  I would have thought that regulations to deal with people of a much younger age group would have been well worth inserting into these regulations. The Minister's predecessor accused me of being highly emotive when I mentioned the prospect of a 15 or a 13-year-old girl being detained in a Garda station overnight and being questioned by members of the Garda.  It is quite possible and quite feasible under a certain set of circumstances under these regulations for that to happen.  I happen to believe that, whatever about 16 and 17-year-olds, an eight, nine, ten, 11, 12 or 13-year-old-child is primarily a child and should be treated as a child in all areas of the State's <Col N="2182" /> operations.  I would have thought that, whatever about the legalities, it ought to have been possible to insert into regulations about the care of persons in custody some provision for people of those age groups.  I do not for one second believe but that in 99.99 per cent of cases children are going to be other than treated extremely well in Garda stations.  I have ample evidence of this.  But it should not be possible for it to be otherwise.  Our attitude to children of that age should be written into regulations and to law.  It should not be left to the considerable goodwill and generosity of the Garda.  I want to say again something I said in a different context, that because of the failures of caring agencies to provide services in the area of young children the Garda often have to do a child-care job in Garda stations at night and that is not fair to the Garda either.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of the detention of children it is a matter of regret that these regulations do not go into greater detail, particularly for children of the younger age group.  The Minister may enlighten me a little on this and I would be very relieved if he can.  I do not think he believes or the Garda believe that a Garda station is the place to detain young children for any length of time however serious the offence being investigated.  I regret the possibility of children being questioned separate from their guardians under any circumstances.  I do not think it is ever a good idea to have children questioned on their own about any offence, however serious, by gardaí &mdash; I am talking about children of nine, ten, 11, 12 and 13 years of age.  It is not so much that I think the gardaí would misbehave, I do not.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding things I say from time to time about the Garda, I think the gardaí treat children who are in custody extremely well, but it should not be possible in a civilised society for children ever to be detained in Garda stations.  We should not do so and it should not be part of the normal framework of the operation of a civilised society.  I regret the fact that, to the extent to which I have read <Col N="2183" /> these regulations &mdash; and I read them carefully &mdash; there is no recognition of the possibility, given the appallingly low age of criminal responsibility in this country, that very small children could end up in Garda custody.  That is the only major qualm I have about the regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the regulations are concerned, very few changes have been made to the proposals which were before us a few days ago.  I have not really any objection to the changes that have been made.  Some are sensible amendments to the proposals.  What really concerns me is that a number of points arose during the discussion on the proposals and no amendments were made to meet them.</P>
      <P>The first point I made in relation to the proposals was that the member in charge played a very useful part and it was a very good idea that the person who was detained would know what an important part he played and if he did have complaints, or felt his rights were being infringed in any way, he should be made aware that a person was there to deal with that type of situation.  It may not be absolutely necessary to have that provision in the regulation.  It may be that when he is given notice of his rights, this notice may inform him of the existence of a member in charge.  I am sorry that it is not more specifically set out in the regulation, but if it is done by way of a notice, it would certainly meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which arose on the discussion on the proposals and which I regret has not been met by the Minister.  In his reply to the debate on the proposals, he made it fairly clear that he was not going to meet the situation, but I still have to reiterate that four hours questioning of a person is much too long. It appears in the regulation that, if an interview has lasted for four hours, it shall be either terminated or adjourned for a reasonable time.  Four hours are very, very long and, as I said, two hours is the very maximum that should be permitted.  We must try to be objective <Col N="2184" /> about this and arrive at a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <P>Anybody who, as a result of an interview, has not given the gardaí the information they require after two hours, from then on is going to crack up, make omissions, or give information because the strain has just become too much.  In a way, it will be self-defeating because it may well be that the courts will arrive at the decision that information or admissions made after that length of time were not obtained in a reasonable way and would not be regarded as proper admissions. I am sorry the Minister did not feel able to meet the point.</P>
    <P>A number of other Senators agreed that four hours were too long and I find it difficult to understand why it seemed necessary to persist in having an interview lasting for four hours.  The only reason, one would have to say, that it is persisted in is that if it goes on for four hours, a person will just give up and make admissions and so on that are not true because the pressure becomes too much.  I am very sorry the Minister has persisted in having a maximum of four hours rather than two hours or even less.</P>
    <P>The other feature of the proposals which has not been changed and which I would like to mention again is regulation No. 12 (a):</P>
    <P>A person arrested under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs to the extent that he is unable to appreciate the significance of questions put to him or his answers shall not be questioned in relation to an offence while he is in that condition, except with the authority of the member in charge, which authority shall not be given except in the circumstances specified.</P>
    <P>The circumstances specified may be important and a case can be made for them, but it seems that if you are allowing a person in that state to be interviewed, there should also be regulations to protect him from giving answers in that state. It may be that some vital matter can be got from him then, but it certainly should not be such a situation that could in any sense incriminate him.  It should be in <Col N="2185" /> very, very restricted circumstances that somebody should be interviewed and asked questions when he is unable to appreciate the significance of either the question or the answer.  If this is left in the regulations, it should be specified and the circumstances and ramifications to the answers should be set out in great detail.  This is, to say the least of it, subject to very considerable abuse and could have consequences which would be most undesirable.  I regret that the points that I made on this have not been met in these regulations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the regulations have not been changed in certain ways I urged on the Minister, the changes that have been made are, by and large, sensible ones and I have no objection to them. Having expressed the reservations that I have about the regulations, it is certainly a very good thing that they have been introduced as a result of pressure put on the Minister by this House.  By and large the regulations are a great improvement on what existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members I welcome the draft regulations which, to a considerable extent, speak for themselves. They have already been considered in broad outline by the House.  It is useful for us to reflect on the fact that, when we do get round to having regulations relating to persons held in custody in Garda stations, they are quite detailed and quite complex.  They ensure a number of safeguards which are standardised and which are required in the procedure and in ensuring access to information, advice and medical help, if necessary by persons held in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about regulation No. 24.  I am still a little unhappy about the preservation of custody records, or rather that these custody records might be preserved in a manner which could be detrimental, ultimately, to a person.  Although, regulation No. 24 requires the preservation of custody records for a period for good reason, it does not require the destruction of custody records.  I am concerned about that. One of the benefits of having regulations <Col N="2186" /> of this kind, and the detail of them, is that a considerable amount will be recorded, what took place at interviews, who was seen by or asked for by the person in custody and so on.  As I understand the position &mdash; the Minister I am sure will correct me if I am wrong in my understanding of it &mdash; these custody records shall be preserved for at least 12 months or, if any proceedings to which a custody record would be relevant are instituted or any complaint is made in respect of the conduct of a member while a person was in custody, until the final determination of the proceedings or complaint, whichever is the later.  I agree with that as it stands but there is no provision for the actual destruction of these records. Subsection (2) simply provides for a person having access to a copy of the custody record, if a request is made either by the person or a legal representative within 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the possibility of these custody records lingering on being available in some way, being accessible to other parties or, indeed, being accessible in a way that could be prejudicial afterwards without the person being even aware of that.  I am wondering whether the Minister did consider, and if so why it is not included expressly, an expressed provision for the destruction of the custody records.  It may be that the Minister has a more final text than I am working on; it may be that he has considered this, in which case I am sure he will inform the House about it.</P>
    <P>We live in an age when there is great concern about the computer records of people, and we are, for good reason, ensuring in these draft regulations that very full custody records will be kept of what took place while a person was detained in a Garda station.  I am concerned about the possibility of future implications of those custody records where there is no expressed requirement that they be destroyed other than the necessity for their preservation for the reasons set out in regulation No. 24.  I would be grateful for clarification on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned to the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, my deep concern, when the Criminal Justice Bill was going through the House, for all children from a certain age down.  The Minister has dealt with that.  I support Senator Eoin Ryan's comments on the four hour interview.  That is a long time for anybody to be questioned.  I have asked gardaí about this.  Some excellent gardaí think that four hours is too long.</P>
      <P>When the House was debating the Criminal Justice Bill I mentioned the problem of the moderately handicapped child of ten, 11 and 12 years who is a member of a group taken to a garda barracks.  I know the gardaí in the Ennis area will deal compassionately with such cases because they are near the specialised schools in Ennis that are so organised. The gap between the mildly and moderately handicapped is not clearly defined and is difficult to understand unless one is dealing with the problem. Those children would not be able to name immediately a nurse or a doctor, in their fright at arriving in a Garda barracks. They may be able to name their teacher but they certainly would not be able to name a solicitor or somebody near to them.  It may be that that matter has been dealt with in paragraph 22 (1) and (2) of the regulations.  I am deeply concerned about what may happen to a mentally handicapped child who is frightened on being taken to a Garda barracks.  Most of our gardaí are great men &mdash; I do not know so much about the Banghardaí &mdash; and I pay tribute to them.</P>
      <P>In the areas, and counties, where this service exists for mentally handicapped children, the gardaí are involved in fund raising projects for these schools and the workshops we have in them.  In counties that do not have the services for these great children, I would worry about mentally handicapped children being brought to a Garda station with other children and not being able to look for their rights. A 12 year old might be able to look after himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a mother I must say &mdash; I do not think it could be said often enough &mdash; that in Ireland we are too critical of the <Col N="2188" /> children who are growing up.  They are growing up in an environment that is harder on children of 11 and 12 years of age than it was in our time.  More children might find themselves in Garda barracks and being questioned than has been the case up to now.  As a mother who has reared children I have to voice my worry in that regard.  I know the Garda are family people and that they would be concerned about children's rights also. However, it would be wrong to let this motion go through without again voicing my concern for the children that I have helped so much in Clare and for children generally.  There must be a shorter time for questioning.  I do not know what length of time is given to children in the matter of questioning but certainly I support Senator Eoin Ryan in his concern. He has been a long time in the legal world.  He obviously has deep worries about four hours of questioning for all persons in Garda barracks.  If the Minister has looked after the children that I am mainly concerned about I thank him.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the House that at pages 9, 10, 11, 17, 24 and perhaps elsewhere also, certain things are expressed, for example, the necessity to do things &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  There are other things to be done &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; and that is fair enough.  I am very happy about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; is a very fine expression.  It is the correct expression to have here but I am anxious that the Minister would explain to me, if he thinks &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; is not as good or as urgent as &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, why he did not put &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; into these regulations.  I am happy with these regulations except on this point.  The Minister must be in the reverse position to myself unless of course he can distinguish the difference, which he has not quite explained, between &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and &ldquo;as <Col N="2189" /> soon as practicable&rdquo;.  He obviously has a difference in his own mind and considers &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; to be more urgent and stronger than &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. Why not use the strongest one available in this case?  I am not talking about those cases where he says &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;.  I understand that but this other phrase is used many times.  That is the way the regulations were drafted.  I am interested as to why the Minister considers that these should be drafted in such a way that all those cases should have a less urgency than they would have, according to his definition, if he had used &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would say the Minister is white.  In the draft regulations, or whatever status they are now, station bail is referred to.  Does station bail still exist, or has there been some change in the status of that?  The Minister might be aware of whether station bail is in existence any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might give us a more detailed explanation as to the position with regard to the Bridewell Garda Station in Dublin.  There is a change there but I am not familiar enough to object to the change.  It appears that the member in charge there is effectively the person in charge of the detention section of the Bridewell.  The Minister obviously has a good reason for that.  He might like to explain why he made the change in regulation 5 (4) which appears to have the effect of permanently authorising, for the purpose of carrying out the duties of the members in charge in a certain area, the <Col N="2190" /> member with particular responsibility for the cell area in the Bridewell Garda Station. The Minister obviously has good reason for that and I would like to hear his comments on that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I too share the view that four hours is quite an inappropriate length to question people with regard to their activities.  I can only repeat the advice which I would give to anybody arrested under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984: that is while they can ask you questions for as long as they like, you have no obligation whatsoever, except in very limited circumstances, to answer any of the questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the House first of all, as has already been noted by a number of Senators, that following the discussions we had here of the White Paper some changes have been made in the regulations compared to the text that was in the White Paper.  I want to thank the House for assisting me in getting value out of the particular procedure that I used because once draft regulations are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas they can be either accepted or rejected but not amended. The purpose of the previous discussion was to give both of the Houses an opportunity to give me their views on changes <Col N="2191" /> that they might like to see in the regulations.</P>
      <P>The regulations now before us take account of the debate that we had and indeed they take account of discussions that I have had with Garda representative associations and the Garda management. It is important that we get the widest measure of agreement that we can on the content of the regulations.  Since they have not all been mentioned I might just briefly recite what the principal changes are, apart from the purely drafting changes.  Regulation 1 provides for these regulations to come into force a month after the date on which they are made. The reference to integrity which figured in the draft of regulation 3 (i) has been deleted, but we have given an emphasis there to the special needs of handicapped persons for very much the reasons that Senator Honan and Senator Eoin Ryan developed earlier.  In regulation 5 (iv) we have added in a sub paragraph (c) to take account of the special situation in the Bridewell station in Dublin where one member has particular responsibility for the cell area.  The need for that, of course, arises from the fact that there is a substantial flow of people into and out of the Bridewell Garda Station for a number of reasons with which I think the House will be familiar.  I felt it was appropriate to have a specific provision making the position clear beyond any doubt because of the numbers of people who go in and out of that Garda station.</P>
      <P>We made provision in regulation 7 (1) for the recording of any relevant particulars relating to an arrested person's physical or mental condition on arrival at the station.  It is important particularly with a view to any subsequent proceedings that that form part of the custody record.</P>
      <P>Regulation 11 (2) makes it clear that this provision, which allows access to a solicitor whose presence has not been requested by an arrested person, applies only where the arrested person has not already had access to a solicitor of his choice.  That is a matter of clarification rather than of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> Regulation 11 (5) has been amended so that it now provides that a telephone call by an arrested person is to be free of charge provided it is of reasonable duration and to a person reasonably named within the framework of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In regulation 12 (8) we have inserted a new subparagraph to provide that a person who is deaf, or hard of hearing, may have questions put to him in writing if he or she has requested an interpreter and one is not reasonably available.</P>
    <P>Regulation 17 (3) now includes reference to head gear and gloves among the items of outer clothing which may be removed in the course of a search in the presence of a person of the opposite sex. That is a matter of practicality and not any substantial matter of policy.</P>
    <P>Regulation 21 (2) will apply irrespective of the expected duration of custody so that medical advice must be sought in every case where a person in custody claims to need medication for any potentially serious condition.  If the person does not claim to need such medication but has medication in his or her possession the member in charge must still seek medical advice if he considers that to be necessary.  That meets a concern that was expressed during the last discussion by Senator Fitzsimons.  It is a matter to which we must give some attention, particularly when &mdash; although I know it is not a very widespread practice &mdash; it is becoming more common for people who are in need of constant or regular medication to carry some indication on them to that effect.</P>
    <P>Regulation 12 (4) now provides that if an interview has lasted for four hours it shall be either terminated or adjourned for a reasonable time.  That clears up an ambiguity in the original text pointed out by Senator O'Leary during our earlier discussion.</P>
    <P>Regulation 14 (14) contained an ambiguity pointed out by Senator Eoin Ryan at our last discussion.  It has now been removed.  That concerned the restriction of consular access to persons in custody who seek political asylum.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific points raised <Col N="2193" /> today I should like to remind Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Honan that under section 14 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, children under 12 years of age cannot be detained.  Children between the ages of 12 and 17 may not be questioned without some responsible adult, other than a Garda, being present unless that is impracticable.  Regulation 13 (2) deals with that point.  On the length of a period of questioning, I note that Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Honan both have reservations about a period of four hours, suggesting that that period might be too long.  It is a matter we dealt with during our last discussion.  I pointed out on that occasion that it is not difficult to conceive of circumstances in which a court would find that even a period of questioning of four hours or less might be held to have been oppressive.</P>
    <P>There are also cases in which one could argue that a longer period of questioning than that would not be oppressive.  If it can be shown that it is the case that questioning for four hours or even a shorter period was oppressive, there is at least redress available.  The specification of the period is very much a matter of judgment being formed by experience. The conclusion we came to was that in order to specify a period, we should take a period of four hours as being, on the whole, a reasonable period, again bearing in mind the fact that even a period of questioning of less than four hours could be found, in some circumstances, to be oppressive.  That would have to be determined subsequently by a court rather than in the course of operation of these regulations on the ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan also asked about the situation of a person who is intoxicated, who might be asked some questions and who might make statements that would tend to incriminate him. Questioning in a case like that &mdash; this is dealt with in regulation 12 (8) &mdash; would have to be authorised by the member in charge.  The authorisation by the member in charge would have to be recorded in the custody record so that there would be a clear indication in the custody record that this person was intoxicated but that <Col N="2194" /> for what he judged to be adequate reasons the member in charge authorised questioning.  It would, therefore, be knowledge available to the court in any subsequent proceedings that that was the case.</P>
    <P>It would be perfectly open to the court to take its own view as to the circumstances in which any statement, particularly an incriminating one, was made. On the other hand, there is always the concern &mdash; particularly when we are talking about the investigation of serious crime &mdash; to make sure that as much information as possible is got as quickly as possible so that dangers to other people can be averted or so that we can avoid the danger that evidence that would be of value in the prosecution of the crime would not be hidden or taken away during the period when no questioning could take place.  The safeguard there and the fact that such an event would be recorded in the custody record, in itself would ensure that due care was taken in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson pointed out quite rightly that there is no provision for the destruction of custody records.  There is not.  That is also the case today.  We have already a form of custody records which will be superseded by that provided for here.  There is equally no provision for the destruction of those.  However, they are confidential documents, official records, that are not available to the general public.  I have a feeling that there may have been some lack of clarity in the debate on the previous occasion.  In case there was I should like to point out to Senator Robinson that the custody record itself will not include the record of any interviews that take place during questioning. The custody record will record the fact that an interview took place, will record the names of the gardaí who were present during the course of the interview and will identify the length of each interview. But the record of the interview itself is a separate document.</P>
    <P>I can understand Senator Honan's concern with the case of a mentally handicapped child or a mentally handicapped person of any age who might not be able <Col N="2195" /> to articulate, particularly in the circumstance of being brought into a Garda station.  As far as we can do so in the legislation we have provided both the duty and the means for the garda in charge to deal with that situation.  I realise there can be difficulties when a person is incapable either of identifying himself or herself or of identifying a parent or guardian or giving the name of a parent or guardian.  We have gone as far as we can to anticipate such a problem and the qualification required, that the person dealing with the situation will be one who has had experience of dealing with mentally handicapped persons.  If there are further practical steps we can take I would be happy to look at them, and in the light of experience if Senator Honan or anyone else finds cases that need a different approach I will look at them and bring them to the attention of the Garda Commissioner and the Garda in general.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan asked if the notice of rights would include a reference to the garda in charge.  It will.  Indeed the notice of rights now given to a person in custody contains such a reference, and any modification we will have afterwards will include a reference to a number of rights that do not arise from anything in these custody regulations.  Senator O'Leary returned to &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  We had some little discussion on that earlier, although we are not comparing different formulae I think the phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; is the most appropriate one here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the temptation is great, I do not intend to return to that discussion.  It might be desirable in principle to require certain things to be done immediately a person is taken into custody &mdash; Senator Michael D. Higgins referred to the arrest of 30 persons in the Phoenix Park &mdash; and it might be desirable to provide for certain things to be done <Col N="2196" /> immediately, but the unfortunate garda in charge in the Bridewell faced with 30 people coming in all together will not be able to do a number of things immediately. However, he will have to ensure that they will be done as soon as practicable. How he will choose who will be No. 1 on the list, and No. 2 and right down to No. 30 is a matter for himself to decide.  No. 30 will certainly not be handed the statement of rights immediately; he will be handed that statement as soon as practicable and, at latest, immediately after No. 29.  There is a question of practicality involved.  A number of steps have to be taken before that point can be arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State for Family Law Reform, I am very happy to recommend this Bill for the consideration of Senators.  By any standard, it must be considered a major measure of legal and social reform.  I have been very heartened by the positive response which the proposals in the Bill have received from the various interest groups concerned with family law matters, from the Churches and from the public generally. I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill and trust that the debate will be imbued with the same spirit of social concern that has motivated the Government in promoting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I should like to point out that in enacting this Bill we shall be following an international trend, dating back some 20 years now, towards eliminating discrimination in the law against people born outside marriage.  By 1975, the position in Europe had developed to the point where the Council of Europe, building on what had already been achieved in several member states, adopted the Convention on the Legal Status of Children <Col N="2197" /> Born out of Wedlock.  The purpose of the convention was to bring about a situation where, throughout Europe, the legal position of children born outside marriage, in all essentials would be assimilated to that of children born within marriage.  That is also the purpose of this Bill; and as soon as it comes into operation, the Government intend to ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>We also, of course, have obligations in this area arising out of our adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In 1979, in the Marckx case, the Court of Human Rights held that laws which discriminate against persons born outside marriage are inconsistent with the Convention, unless they can be justified on some reasonable and objective ground.  In the course of that judgment, the court expressly recognised that, while support and encouragement of the traditional family was in itself legitimate and praiseworthy, measures aimed at achieving that end should not be such as to result in prejudice to the family not based on marriage.  Senators will be aware that there is at present a case before the Court of Human Rights involving this country, which raises a number of issues relevant to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Until relatively recent times the child born outside marriage was ignored by statute.  The common law had always regarded him as <i>filius nullius</i>&mdash; nobody's child, with no parents and no relations. Natural parents were neither the guardians of their child nor had they any rights to its custody.  Furthermore, if either parent died without making a will, the child had no right to share in the estate.</P>
    <P>Some of the rigour of the common law has been mitigated by statute over the past 50 years or so.  The Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act of 1930 enabled the mother of a child to claim maintenance for the child from the &ldquo;putative father&rdquo;&mdash; but a finding of paternity in such a case is effective only for maintenance purposes.  The Legitimacy Act, 1931 provided that the marriage of parents subsequent to the birth of a child would render the child legitimate but only if they could have been married at the <Col N="2198" /> time the child was born.  That Act also gave a child born outside marriage some rights of succession on the death intestate of the mother.  The Adoption Act, 1952 provided for the legal adoption of children born outside marriage; this involved the permanent transfer of parental rights and duties from the natural mother to the adopting parents.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 removed uncertainty in relation to guardianship by declaring that the mother of a child born outside marriage is the child's guardian.  Finally, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 improved the position of children born outside marriage in the area of maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before us can be traced back to the report on illegitimacy published by the Law Reform Commission in 1982.  That report gave an overview of the existing law and how it discriminated between children born within and outside marriage and made many recommendations for change.  At the heart of these was the recommendation that the concept of illegitimacy be done away with altogether and the remaining recommendations followed on logically from this.  Among these recommendations was one which would make the father of a child its guardian in all cases regardless of whether the child was born within or outside marriage.  Though this recommendation might have had some appeal at first sight, it took insufficient account of the interests of the child in each case; while the parents of a child born within marriage owe a duty of fidelity to each other and in consequence can be expected to provide a suitable family environment in which the child's interest will be given a high priority, the same bonds of fidelity do not necessarily tie the parents of a child born outside marriage. That is not to say that such parents are not capable of providing loving and caring upbringing for their children.  In many cases, they do so provide.  This Bill caters for situations like that by enabling the father of a child born outside marriage to share the responsibilities and rights of guardianship with the child's mother where that is in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> Clearly, fundamental reform of the law on illegitimacy was called for.  In October 1983 I was able to announce the Government's decisions in principle on the Law Reform Commission's report. These were based on the belief that the continuance of the legal disadvantages suffered by children born outside marriage was not in keeping with the Christian and democratic nature of the State. It was decided that the proposed reforms should be concentrated on the elimination of discrimination in the law against children born outside marriage and on the rights and obligations of their fathers.  In particular, the Government did not accept that fathers of non-martial children, should in all cases have automatic parental rights.</P>
    <P>When proposals based on these decisions in principle were worked out the Government took the somewhat unusual, but I think you will agree enlightened, step of publishing a memorandum setting out in some detail their proposals for reform of the law and incorporating a draft Bill.  That was in May 1985.  There was a very gratifying response to the proposals.  I should like to place on record here my appreciation of the trouble so many organisations and individuals went to in examining the proposals in detail and submitting their considered views on them.</P>
    <P>This brings us now to the Bill in hand. Its aim is to eliminate discrimination in the law as between children born within and outside marriage.  There are, however, limits to the extent to which this aim can be fully achieved.  Because of the fact that a non-marital child's parents are not married to each other, whereas a marital child's parents are, there must inevitably remain some differences in the way the law deals with them.  But I am confident that this Bill will bring about a situation where it will not be possible to point to any area of the law where any invidious discrimination will remain against non-marital children.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a wide spectrum of the law.  It deals with guardianship; maintenance; succession and other property <Col N="2200" /> rights; a new procedure for declaration of parentage; blood tests as an aid in determining questions of parentage; legal presumptions and evidential matters; and registration of births.  The only major area of relevant law which it leaves untouched is that of revenue law.  The reason for this is that changes in that area are more properly dealt with in a Finance Bill which is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I have been assured by the Minister for Finance that he will promote the necessary legislation as soon as possible after this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill sets out a number of preliminary and general matters relating to the Bill.  Section 1 specifies that the main provisions of the Bill will come into operation at the latest six months after its enactment.  This is to allow time for the necessary regulations and rules of court to be made.</P>
    <P>Section 2 introduces the terms &ldquo;marital child&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo;.  Basically, the term &ldquo;marital child&rdquo; means a person whose parents are or were married to each other.  The definition also embraces adopted persons, and certain children of void marriages or of voidable marriages which have been annulled.  The term &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo; means, principally, a person whose parents are not and have not been married to each other.  The need for a distinction of this kind arises from the fact of the parents' marital status and should be seen for what it is: a distinction between equals rather than a discrimination against a less favoured class. Except for some rather obscure circumstances which may arise under existing law, there will be no need in the future to use the pejorative term &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; with its associated overtones of unlawfulness and moral disapproval.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a declaratory provision which puts beyond doubt that the fact that one's parents are not and have not been married to each other does not debar one from claiming Irish citizenship through either parent.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with legitimation and modifies the law in this area in a number of important respects.  At present, under the Legitimacy Act, 1931 <Col N="2201" /> if the parents of a child born outside marriage subsequently marry each other, that marriage has the effect of rendering the child legitimate.  However, this is so only if the parents were free to marry at the time of the child's birth.  If, for instance, the child's father was married to a woman other than the mother at the time of the child's birth and the wife subsequently died, his marriage to the child's mother after his wife's death would not legitimate the child.  The effect of section 5 of the Bill is to change this so that the subsequent marriage of the parents of a child born outside marriage will always operate to render the child their legitimate child, regardless of whether the parents were free to marry each other at the relevant time.</P>
    <P>Another important change in the law as to the status of a child is brought about by section 6.  At present, the child of a void marriage, regardless of whether it has been declared void by a court, is illegitimate from birth.  Where the marriage is voidable, a decree of nullity renders it void from the beginning and also has the effect that any child of the marriage is rendered illegitimate from birth. Section 6 provides that if either party to a void marriage believed at the relevant time that the ceremony of the marriage was valid, the child of that union will be deemed to be the legitimate child of both parents.  In the case of a voidable marriage, a decree of nullity will not have the effect of making a child of the marriage illegitimate as it does at present.  The principal effect of this change will be that, in appropriate cases, the father will continue to be the guardian of the child where a decree of nullity is granted.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill amends the law relating to guardianship of infants and produces a significant advance in Irish law.  For the first time, once this part comes into force, it will be possible for the father of a non-marital child to act jointly with the mother as legal guardian of the child.  At present it is not unusual to come across cases of couples who have entered into second unions after one of them has had an earlier marriage annulled by an ecclesiastical tribunal. <Col N="2202" /> Such an annulment is not, of course, recognised by the civil law and, accordingly, any child of the second union is non-marital.  Under existing law the mother is sole guardian of the child. There is no provision which would enable the father to become joint guardian with her even though, in fact, he will most likely be sharing in decisions regarding the child's care and upbringing.  One also finds other cases of unmarried couples with children where the relationship between the parents themselves, and between the parents and the child, is such that guardianship is shared in practice, though not in law.  There are many advocates of the view that a child born outside marriage should not merely know the identity of his parents but should have the opportunity of developing a full relationship with both parents and this Bill provides that opportunity for the first time in Irish law.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in Part III, the mother of a non-marital child will continue to be guardian in every case but the father may be appointed joint guardian with her if it is in the child's interests. Where the mother wishes it and where the father's name appears on the child's birth certificate, a procedure will be provided to enable him to be appointed joint guardian with her with a minimum of formality.  If the mother does not agree to the appointment of the father as guardian or if there is some difficulty in establishing the father's paternity, then the matter can be determined after a full hearing in the normal way in either the Circuit Court or the District Court.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with maintenance. The law on maintenance for dependent children of a family is set out in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and children) Act, 1976 and maintenance for children born outside marriage is covered by the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930. Despite having been updated to some extent by the 1976 Act, the legislation of 1930 can, I think, be fairly described as in many ways inadequate and inappropriate in today's legal and social climate.  The Bill accordingly repeals the 1930 Act <Col N="2203" /> entirely and replaces it with new provisions being inserted in the 1976 Act which are modelled on the existing provisions of that Act for dependent children of the family.</P>
    <P>I might point out that the removal of discrimination as between marital and non-marital children is not all one-way traffic.  For instance, the 1930 Act has a provision which enables the court to order a once-off lump sum payment to cover the birth or funeral expenses of a child born outside marriage.  There is at present no similar provision in relation to the dependent child of a family.  The Bill, at section 20, will make this type of order available in respect of all children both marital and non-marital.</P>
    <P>We come now to an area of the law which gave us much cause for thought not merely because of the complex legal issues involved but because the subject matter, succession rights and other property rights, involves controversial social issues as well.</P>
    <P>The underlying principle of the Bill requires that all persons, whether marital or non-marital should be treated equally for the purposes of succession, rights to property and so forth.  Thus section 26 of the Bill proposes that, in the case of a person who dies having made a will, words in the will which denote a family relationship will be interpreted as referring to relationships through both marital and non-marital links.  If the parent of a non-marital child dies having made no provision in his or her will for the child, then the child will have the same right as the children of a testator's family based on marriage to apply to court under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, for proper provision out of the estate.  The court can then decide in all the circumstances whether and to what extent the applicant should benefit.  This solution preserves the freedom of the testator to dispose of his or her property as he or she pleases, and at the same time offers to the testator's children, whether marital or non-marital, the opportunity of rectifying any injustice resulting from an omission from the will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2204" /> So far as succession rights in general are concerned, section 29 will insert a provision in the Succession Act, 1965, which will ensure that henceforth, for the purposes of that Act all relationships will be deduced without regard to the marital status of a person's parents.  However, in the view of the Government, that provision on its own would ignore the social reality that in many cases where there is an estate of any substance the surviving members of the family based on marriage will have contributed to the building up of that estate, and to give an automatic share of that estate to someone who was not a member of that family might cause injustice.</P>
    <P>Section 32, accordingly, provides for the possibility of an application being made to a court to vary the normal rules of distribution on intestacy where their strict application would lead to injustice. This procedure will be available where the intestate is survived by a non-marital child as well as a spouse and/or marital children, and may be invoked by the spouse or by any of the children, whether marital or non-marital.  The criteria which must be met in each case are that the applicant has made a contribution of a substantial nature to the building up of the estate and that injustice would be caused by applying the normal rules.</P>
    <P>Another innovation in this Part is the provision, at section 35, which would enable a court to determine that the father of a non-marital child was unworthy to succeed on the death intestate of the child, if he did not make a contribution of a substantial nature to the child's upbringing.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Part of the Bill will operate in relation to dispositions made, by will or otherwise, and deaths occurring on or after the commencement date.  Accordingly, where a person died before that date, the estate will be administered under existing law, whether or not there was a will.  Where a person dies on or after the commencement date, the estate will fall to be administered under the law as revised by this Part.  Thus, if the father of a non-marital child dies intestate after that date, the non-marital <Col N="2205" /> child will have a claim on his estate under the rules of intestacy.  If the deceased made a will which excludes the non-marital child, the child will be able to apply to court under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, for proper provision out of the estate.  The Bill will not change the effect of wills or other dispositions in existence at the date of commencement of this Part, and that is as it should be; but section 33 will ensure that the right of a non-marital child to make a claim under section 117 of the 1965 Act will exist from the commencement of this Part of the Bill, no matter when the will was made.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill sets up a new court procedure, which will enable a person to obtain a declaration as to the identity of his or her parents.  For children of a marriage, both legitimate and legitimated, a declaration to somewhat the same effect has hitherto been available under the Legitimacy Declaration Act (Ireland), 1868.  Also, where the question of any person's parentage has been an issued in proceedings for some other relief, for instance, guardianship or maintenance, it has always been possible to have the issue determined for the purposes of those proceedings.  The proposed new procedure will be another &ldquo;first&rdquo; in Irish law as far as persons born outside marriage are concerned.  I see the main use of this procedure as being for the purpose of securing, during the lifetime of the father of a non-marital child, the child's succession rights to the father's estate.  Of course, a declaration of parentage is not a prerequisite for a claim by a non-marital child against the father's estate, but if the allegation of parentage is not made until the institution of succession proceedings after the death of the alleged father, then the child faces a difficult task of proof with a major part of his evidence no longer available.  Use of the new procedure to determine the question of parentage during the father's lifetime will not only have advantages for the child seeking the declaration; it will also give the alleged father the opportunity to counter the allegation himself. There is, of course, a risk that frivolous or vexatious applications will be made, <Col N="2206" /> but I am satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that this will not be a problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear that this procedure will not be available to adopted persons.  The present policy of the Adoption Acts is to sever all links between the natural parents and the child, and to establish new legal links between the child and its adoptive parents.  This policy secures confidentiality with regard to the natural parents and this Bill does nothing to change that policy.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill gives a statutory basis to the use in civil proceedings of blood test evidence, which is gaining in importance as an aid to settling questions of disputed parentage.  Such evidence can, of course, be adduced at present; but there are disadvantages in its use which need to be sorted out by legislation. In particular, for this type of evidence to be of full use to the court, samples should be taken for testing from the child, from the mother and from the person alleged to be the father where paternity is an issue; cases where maternity is in doubt are much rarer, though not unheard of.  If any one of these parties refuses a blood sample, then tests undergone by the others may well be rendered useless, but the court is not empowered to draw any conclusions from such a refusal, or to force a person to undergo the test.  Thus, for instance, an alleged father can frustrate proceedings by refusing a test if he knows that it will show him to be the father.  This gap in the law is filled by section 46 which, among other things, permits a court to draw inferences from the refusal by a person to submit himself to a blood test.</P>
    <P>Part VIII makes some changes relating to presumptions of law and the law of evidence.  At present, there is a presumption of law that the child of a married woman is the legitimate child of the woman and her husband.  This presumption can be rebutted only by evidence which puts the contrary beyond reasonable doubt, which is the standard of proof applicable in criminal proceedings. The more rigorous standard of <Col N="2207" /> proof required by the civil law to rebut the presumption of legitimacy is understandable in a situation where a social stigma attached to illegitimacy and where a court judgment declaring a person to be illegitimate would have the effect of depriving that person of substantial property rights.  In the context of the present Bill, which will remove discrimination against persons born outside marriage, it is appropriate that the normal standard of proof in civil proceedings should apply in relation to this presumption.  Hence the provision in section 48 of the Bill. Another important provision in this Part is that at section 49, which will enable a finding of parentage in one set of proceedings to be used as evidence in subsequent proceedings.</P>
    <P>Part IX makes the necessary amendments in birth registration law.  One of the important changes to be brought about by this Part is to make it easier for the father of a non-marital child to have his name entered as father on the births' register.  At present, this can be done only by the father and mother of the child presenting themselves personally at the births' registration office.  In future, it will be possible for either parent to have the father's name entered on production of either a statutory declaration from the other parent, or a court order naming the child's father as such.</P>
    <P>I last spoke in this House on this subject in May 1984, on a Labour Party motion.  On that occasion I was heartened by the welcoming attitude of Senators on all sides to the Government's proposals, then announced only in outline.  The filling in of that outline has been an arduous and time-consuming task, but it is with confidence that I express the hope that Senators will be equally welcoming today of the comprehensive Bill now before them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to remind Senators of the sentiments of concern for the plight of non-marital children in our society, which were so frequently expressed during the recent referendum campaign. These came from both sides of the divorce debate, regardless of political <Col N="2208" /> affiliation.  What was most gratifying to me was that they were accompanied by a genuine desire on all sides for reform of the law in this area.  I am confident, therefore, that we can look forward to a positive, expeditious and constructive debate on this long-awaited Bill, free from political contention.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's final sentence I am confident we can look forward to a positive, expeditious and constructive debate on this long awaited important Bill, free from political contention. On this side of the House we are not going to make a very substantial statement on this Bill.  It is probably one of the most important Bills that has come into this House for many years and it is unfortunate that it has to be introduced today, the last day of this session, when we will not have a proper chance to debate it.  Because of that, the spokesman on this side of the House will not be dealing with the Bill today but will take the opportunity when the Bill comes before the House again, having studied it properly, to give it the proper judgment it should be given.  It was only yesterday morning that our spokesman was told that this Bill might or might not be taken, even though the Whip on this side of the House got a call from the Leader of the House that the Bill might be taken as the Minister was anxious that it be taken today.  It is most unfortunate that the Members of the House should be treated in this manner, particularly as the main Opposition party did not have time to study the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Status of Children Bill, 1986, introduced in the Seanad today is a Bill of major importance and is one that will affect the lives of a great number of people.  The Bill will remove the concept of illegitimacy from the law and give equal rights in many areas to children born both inside and outside marriage.  It is the intention of the Bill that, as far as possible in common law and civil law jurisdictions, no disadvantage would be felt by people because of the circumstances of their birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2209" /> Ireland is not a party to the European Convention on the Status of Children Born out of Wedlock, 1975, the aim of which is to assimilate the legal status of persons born outside marriage with that of persons born within marriage.  I presume it should be possible to ratify that convention when this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that on this side of the House we support the broad thrust of the Bill and will not in any way impede its passage through this House. The Bill is a highly complex one and will necessitate very detailed study.  There is no area of life which is not encompassed in the Bill and indeed, because of the sections relative to property and succession rights, the Bill deals with situations that may arise after the death of one of the parties.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the methods adopted by the Government in introducing the Bill.  It would have been much more preferable to introduce the Bill when a full debate through all Stages could have been taken.  The Bill is of major importance and there are many thousands who await its passage through the Oireachtas.  My worry &mdash; and this worry has been expressed by many of my colleagues &mdash; is that having got the Minister's contribution on the record of the House the Government could leave this Bill on ice.  I know that Minister Fennell would not wish this to happen but past experience has shown that when Bills are introduced in this manner they can too easily be forgotten, and this is particularly so in the run-up to a general election.  We had an instance of this in the Seanad this week when a Bill which had gone through Second Stage in 1984 has now been referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation for further study.</P>
    <P>We fully support the abolition of the stigma and concept of illegitimacy.  Children born out of wedlock have been for far too long the victims of major acts of legal and social injustice.  They have been the butt of cruel jokes, they have been discriminated against in the job market and, indeed, up to recently they were discriminated against in Church law. <Col N="2210" /> There is hardly a family which has not had to confront the problems which are associated with non-marital children, as they will now be called.  Some families confronted the problem openly and charitably and with great concern; but, equally, many families were torn apart because of their inability to cope when the situation had to be faced.  The Churches were no less tardy than the State in addressing themselves to this major issue and too often they did not show the Christian attitude they should have shown.</P>
    <P>Children grow into adults with difficulty and with an overwhelming need for love and concern.  Too many non-marital children have been scarred for life because of the attitude of society towards them.  Many non-marital children have grown up in a loving atmosphere and do not bear the outer scars of their non-status.  It was with pleasure that we saw the introduction of this Bill and, even though it will not right all the wrongs done to children, at least it is one further step along the long road of social reform in the family area.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill will not be welcomed by certain interested groups in our society because of the problems that could arise in the area of succession.  The Bill puts marital and non-marital children on the same footing for succession purposes and will include non-marital children in the meaning of expressions such as &ldquo;child&rdquo; or &ldquo;issue&rdquo; when used in wills, deeds and other dispositions unless contrary intentions appear.  Also, there are provisions designed to avoid injustice in certain cases where a parent of a non-marital child dies intestate and to exclude an unworthy father from benefiting from the estate of his deceased non-marital child.</P>
    <P>One of the changes which this Bill proposes and which is very welcome is the amendment of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which provides, at section 6 (4), that the mother of a non-marital child is its sole guardian and the word &ldquo;parent&rdquo; as used in that Act excludes the father of such a child.  The only rights conferred by the 1964 Act on the father of a non-marital child are that he <Col N="2211" /> may apply to the court for access to or custody of the child under section 11 (4).</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill amends the 1964 Act so as to enable the father of a non-marital child to become guardian of the child jointly with the mother on application to the court.  The Bill also takes account of the possibility that the father may, if an order under section 6A is in force at the time of the death, appoint a testamentary guardian.  The mother would act jointly with the testamentary guardian or any guardian appointed in his place in accordance with the 1964 Act. There is provision in the Bill before the House that will enable the court to appoint the natural father of a non-marital infant to be a guardian of the infant. Under section 3 of the 1964 Act the court must regard the welfare of the infant as the paramount consideration.  There is provision also for a special procedure to be used where the mother consents to the appointment of the father as guardian and the father is already registered as such on the births register.  These new provisions, which recognise the rights of fathers in relation to non-marital children, are very welcome.</P>
    <P>There are a number of changes in the Legitimacy Act, 1931, which will benefit children and, while I will not address them now, I welcome them as an integral part of this legislation.  I also welcome the provision which legitimises children of certain void and voidable marriages. Section 6 1B states:</P>
    <P>where a decree of nullity is or has been granted in respect of a voidable marriage, any child who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if it had not been annulled by the decree shall be deemed, notwithstanding the annulment, to be their legitimate child from the commencement of Part II of the Status of Children Act, 1986, or the date of the voidable marriage or the date of the child's birth, which ever is the latest.</P>
    <P>There are many other very worthy changes being made in this Bill which will <Col N="2212" /> enhance the status of children and we welcome these.  The country will benefit from the changes.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I must pay tribute to all of those dedicated groups who for many years had been fighting to have a Bill of this nature introduced.  I am certain that each section of the Bill will come under microscopic examination in this House and in the other House and that at the end of the day the rights of children will be enhanced.  I must compliment the Law Reform Commission on their report of 24 August 1982 which pointed the Government in the right direction on the issues raised in this Bill.  I again appeal to the Minister to press the Government not to consign this Bill to any purgatory and, while I object to the manner in which the Bill was introduced, I can assure the Minister that we support the main thrust of his conclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I must compliment the Minister of State on her very extensive and illuminating Second Stage speech.  I cannot subscribe to all the remarks of Senator Lanigan because this Bill was circulated on the first week of May of this year and it is unfair to say that the measure is being rushed through in an unseemly way.  I want to compliment the Minister and the Government for introducing this Bill in this session so that my colleagues will have an opportunity between now and the autumn to consider in depth this Bill which in many respects is complicated. This will have repercussions in many areas of society.  It is one of the nettles that should have been grasped a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed to do away, as far as possible, with the legal discrimination between persons born within marriage and outside marriage.  I welcome the decision of the Minister of State to press ahead with this Bill and to open the debate in the Seanad.  This process underlines our Government's commitment to make progress with a series of legislation, with the ideals of which so many are prepared to pay lip service, and have done so over the years, but very little <Col N="2213" /> else.  This Bill is designed to amend the law relating to the status of children and for that purpose to amend the law relating to legitimacy and to guardianship of infants, to amend and extend the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, in relation to certain children, and to amend further the law relating to the succession and other property rights, to provide for declaration of parentage and for the use of blood tests to assist in the determination of parentage, to amend the law relating to certain presumptions and evidence, to make further provision for the registration and re-registration of births, and to provide for connected matters.</P>
    <P>This Bill has 54 sections and it is one which I am sure my colleagues in this House will treat with great seriousness.  I am confident that before this Bill leaves the Seanad it will be excellent legislation. I am heartened by the tone of the Minister's Second Reading speech.  I recognise that this is an attempt to remove as far as possible the provisions in existing law which discriminate against children born outside marriage.  The Bill proposes to achieve this purpose mainly by putting children born outside marriage as near as possible on the same footing as those born within marriage in the areas of guardianship, maintenance and property rights and by setting up statutory procedure to enable any person to obtain a court declaration as to his parentage. Other matters provided for in the Bill include the use of blood tests in determining parentage in civil proceedings, presumption of law and other evidential matters and the registration of the births of children born outside marriage.  The Bill follows from the Government's consideration of the Law Reform Commission report on illegitimacy as published in 1982.  I understand that the proposals in the Bill will not involve any material charge on the Exchequer and that there are no staffing implications for Departments of State, State bodies or local authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to parental rights, it is true to say that the Government are faced with a problem.  At the heart of the Law <Col N="2214" /> Reform Commission proposal is the recomendation that the concept of illegitimacy be removed from the law.  This may seem a commendable course, and one which would be welcomed heartily by people with a social conscience, but it is only when one considers the possible effects of such a step that one realises this is not the simple and straighforward solution to the problem that it appears to be.  If illegitimacy is abolished completely, it must follow that the legal relationships, the rights and responsibilities that exist between the marital child and its mother and between the marital child and its father should also apply to the non-marital child and his mother and natural father.</P>
    <P>One of those rights is guardianship and the effect of removing the concept of illegitimacy from the law would be that the father of the non-marital child would in every case automatically be a joint guardian of the child, irrespective of the nature of his relationship with the mother.  This would entitle the father to have an equal say with the mother with regard to the child's upbringing and even to remove the child from the custody of the mother if he so wished.  While there are many cases where the father of a non-marital child is willing and well qualified to act jointly with the mother as guardian of the child, there are many other circumstances where the automatic right of guardianship for the natural father could operate against the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>A survey was carried out by the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children and argued forcefully against the granting of such an automatic right of guardianship.  The federation, an umbrella body including in its membership most, if not all, of the organisations dealing with the problems faced by unmarried parents and their children, sought the views of its members on each of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations.  The solution which has been adopted in this Bill is that, while the father of a non-marital child will not automatically have guardianship rights, he will be able to apply to the court for <Col N="2215" /> those rights and the court will decide each application on the basis of what it perceives as in the best interests of the child.  This solution has the advantage that it will reassure the many mothers of children born outside marriage who have been rearing their children without any help from the father while, at the same time, it will enable the fathers of such children who share actively in their children's upbringing to obtain legal recognition of that shared process.</P>
    <P>Matters covered in the Bill include guardianship, maintenance, succession and so on, and one of the more important provisions is the means of appointing the father of a non-marital child as guardian jointly with the child's mother.  At present the father of a child born outside marriage cannot share guardianship with the child's mother; under this Bill the father may apply to the court to become joint guardian with the mother.  This is a significant step forward and one that will be welcomed by many people.</P>
    <P>A new provision is being inserted in the Succession Acts empowering a court to grant an application for extra provision from an intestate's estate where the applicant can show that he or she has made a substantial contribution to the estate. The provision will operate only where the intestate is survived by a non-marital child as well as by a spouse and/or a marital child or children.  An application may be made by the surviving spouse or by any surviving child of the intestate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the right of the non-marital child to apply for a just provision, under section 117 of the Succession Act where a will is made the law ensures against hardship by guaranteeing to the surviving spouse a minimum legal right share in the estate and by enabling children of the testator to apply to the court for the proper provision out of the estate.  This latter facility is not at present available to children born outside marriage.  The Bill ensures that it will be available to non-marital children of a testator who dies after the enactment of the relevant part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the new procedure for the <Col N="2216" /> declaration of parentage, at present a person born outside of marriage has no statutory means available to him to get a court declaration as to his parentage, although a person born within marriage or legitimated by his parents' subsequent marriage can get a declaration to that effect.  This Bill will enable any person other than an adopted person to apply for a declaration as to his parentage.</P>
    <P>On the statutory provisions relating to blood tests as an aid to proving paternity, at present blood test evidence can be used by a court where a person's parentage is an issue, but if one of the parties refuses to permit his blood to be tested the court cannot force him to do so, nor can it draw any inferences from the refusal even though the refusal may render useless the tests undergone by others.  I am glad that in making the new provision for the taking of blood test evidence the Bill will enable the court to draw whatever inferences it thinks appropriate in such cases.</P>
    <P>The reform of the law in this area was a subject of the Law Reform Commission's report on illegitimacy which was published three or four years ago.  The present proposals follow on the examination and the adoption of the bulk of that report, although the central recommendation of the commission which would have the consequence that all unmarried fathers would have full parental rights in relation to their children does not appear to have been accepted fully by the Government or the draftsman.  The common law has always regarded children born outside of marriage as <i>filius nullius,</i> nobody's child with no parents and no relations.  The Minister mentioned this in her speech, and in reading through that speech one gets an indication of her feeling and the way she has treated the entire problem.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this legislation is to recognise these people not only as individuals but to recognise their rights as equal children and equal citizens.  Our Constitution proclaims that all the children of the nation should be treated equally, yet we are 64 or 65 years in existence as this State and we still have around 5,000 babies born a year who fall into <Col N="2217" /> the category of illegitimacy and who can honestly say that they are not treated equally with the rest.  It has taken our society a long time to get around to treating this matter with honesty and facing up to this problem which poses many difficulties.  We must accept that some of the rigours of the common law have been mitigated over the years.  An Act of 1930 enabled the mother of a child to claim maintenance for the child from the putative father but a finding of paternity in such a case is effective for maintenance purposes and for no other.  An Act passed in 1931 provided that the marriage of parents subsequent to the birth of the child would render the child legitimate but only if they could have been married at the time the child was born.  That Act also gives the child born outside marriage some rights of succession on the death intestate of the mother.  In law the position remained, however, that a child born outside marriage had strictly speaking, no guardian although the mother had custody. The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 eventually recognised the factual position by declaring that the mother of an non-marital child is the child's guardian. The debate here in the House on the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which I can barely recall, made interesting reading. Nevertheless, the progress we are now making in this regard is surely welcome.</P>
    <P>These statutory modifications of the austerity of the common law do little, however, to disguise the fact that the person born outside marriage is still treated very harshly by our law.  Even where paternity is admitted or proven the legal links of guardianship and succession which exist between a parent and child within marriage do not exist between the child born outside marriage and his father. There was a time when the legal position coincided to a very large extent with the social reality that in most cases the father of the child born outside marriage had little or nothing to do with the child, leaving it to the mother to decide whether to bring up the child alone or to put the child up for adoption.  Nowadays it is <Col N="2218" /> happening more and more that children born outside of marriage are acknowledged and cared for by both parents in a family-like situation.  In recent times there has been an international trend towards the elimination of legal discrimination against children born outside marriage and many of our European neighbours and many countries throughout the world have during the last two decades or so modified their laws in this area.  The process of reform in this country took its first major step with the publication of the 1982 Law Reform Commission's report on illegitimacy and this report had as its core a recommendation that the status of illegitimacy be abolished completely.  While on the face of it the recommendation appeared admirable, further consideration found that certain unacceptable consequences would arise if this principle were carried rigorously to its logical conclusion.  Most notably, it would give rise to a situation where an unmarried mother who was rearing her child without help from the father would be obliged either to share the guardianship with the father or to institute court proceedings to relieve the father of his automatic guardianship right.  The Government took the view that a law which automatically put the father of a child born outside marriage in the position of guardian even jointly with the mother would in many instances operate against the best interests of the child. The Bill, deals with guardianship and custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the system of Apartheid in South Africa, and calls on the Government to impose trade sanctions against the South African regime, while continuing its efforts within the EEC and the United Nations to bring about a peaceful transition to a normal, democratic integrated society.</P>
      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to bring to the attention of the people once again the oppression that is being foisted on the majority of people in South Africa.  I wish to show solidarity with the majority of people in South Africa who have been condemned for many years to live under this oppressive yoke which was described by my 14 year old child many years ago as a crime against humanity.</P>
      <P>We only read about South Africa and it seems the problems that are being encountered daily are subsumed into our national newspapers in a manner in which they can be overlooked.  I rise in solidarity with the people of the African National Council who represent the majority of people in South Africa and who are to the forefront of the fight to have South Africa become, as is said in the motion, a normal, democratic and integrated society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the president of the National Union of Miners in South Africa at a conference in England last week suggesting that one of the problems at present in dealing with South Africa is Margaret Thatcher's right wing attitudes and her belief that if something is right, it is right.  Of course, it is not alone that she thinks in this right wing manner but, <Col N="2220" /> as the National Union of Miners representative said, she is involved in bedroom politics as well as in other forms of politics in that her husband is very much involved with companies which have invested heavily in South Africa.  This is possibly one reason for her not favouring sanctions against the South African Government at present.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to us this evening it is very hard to get the urgency of the situation across.  I am afraid this urgency is not felt at EC level or, at least, if it is felt it is not coming across as a matter of grave urgency.  At the last meeting our Minister for Foreign Affairs attended, the EC Governments could not agree on sanctions and the only soft option they came up with was that Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Minister, should pay a visit to South Africa to see if he could establish any further relationships that might help to solve the problem rather than imposing sanctions.  It is said by Mrs. Thatcher and, unfortunately, many organs of the media have taken up her cry, that sanctions would hinder the growth of the oppressed African people but she is not listening to the people who live in South Africa who are crying out for trade sanctions against the South African Government.  Oppressed people will put up with hardship if they know that by doing so they will get out from under the yoke of oppression that binds them.</P>
    <P>The EC is possibly one of the worst places in which to raise a matter of urgency such as the situation in South Africa because in the end the soft option will prevail and we have seen this throughout the life of the EC.  I have seen this in terms of the oppressed people of Palestine.  The soft option is taken and no decision is made that will harm any of the interests within the EC.  It is very hard to suggest practical ways in which we can help our brothers in the fight for the setting up of a democratic society in South Africa.  However, there is one practical way that we can do so within the next few weeks.  In September an international computer conference is to be held in Ireland and it is important <Col N="2221" /> that the organisers should tell the South African delegation that they are not welcome in this country as long as the régime exists and the oppression continues.  In a peaceful, practical manner we can tell the organisers of this international computer conference that, irrespective of what losses we might be subjected to if people do not turn up at the conference, we have the courage of our convictions and we do not want representatives from an oppressive race here.</P>
    <P>I will not say much more because I want to give my colleague, Senator Eoin Ryan, a chance to speak.  We are in solidarity with the people of South Africa and all sides of the House will continue the fight in the hope that the South African Government will see sense in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no longer any necessity for people to make the case against apartheid.  It is agreed by everybody, or certainly by 95 per cent of the people of the world, that it is an evil system which cannot be tolerated.  This has been shown again and again by overwhelming votes in the United Nations apart from the views expressed in many other places.  John Hume described it in the last few days as the greatest crime against humanity in the world today.  That is certainly not putting it too far.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary thing is that, in spite of all these votes in the United Nations and all the pressures, the South African Government continue to brazen the situation out.  There is a danger that because of this people will gradually begin to accept it as something that cannot be changed.  We must ensure that that kind of attitude does not grow.  Sanctions have been agreed in principle by many nations and by the countries of the European Communities but unfortunately, because of the attitude of the United Kingdom, the US and West Germany, nothing tangible has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present proposed tour of the British Foreign Secretary seems to be merely an effort to save face and to waste time. It quite obviously is going to achieve nothing.  Anything like that merely gives <Col N="2222" /> the South African Government more time, more excuses to carry on as they have been carrying on up to now.  In this country we cannot do anything dramatic. We cannot do much.  But we certainly must do everything we possibly can to ensure that this evil is criticised and as far as possible we must do everything we can to undermine it.  So we must ask our Government, because they are in a position to do something about it, to press for effective action.  All of us in our own small way, must always do what we can by speaking about it and by refusing to buy South African produce.  We must do what we can also to play a part in the fight against apartheid.</P>
    <P>The situation in South Africa is deteriorating.  That it is deteriorating is, in one sense, a good thing.  In another sense it means that the measures which are being taken against the blacks there are becoming increasingly harsh, which in turn means that there is a great urgency about taking effective action against this evil.  We certainly ask the Government to do what they possibly can, because only the Government can take swift action, quick action, action which will be effective in the present situation.  We certainly urge them to continue to do what they have been doing up to now and to do it even more effectively in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that parliaments worldwide raise their voices in ritual condemnations of apartheid. This Parliament and this Chamber are no exception.  Consequently, I rise to add my voice to what is a growing volume of condemnation from parliaments all over the world.  This should be a debate not only involving that ritual, perhaps platitudinist, condemnation of apartheid, involving a certain predictable criticism of the regime, which has been described by Senator Lanigan as a crime against humanity.  We should also press, urgently and strongly, that our Government should use every possible means at their disposal to bring about change in that immoral and benighted state.  South <Col N="2223" /> Africa today is in crisis and this time it is for real.  Those of us who have been interested in the situation over the past number of years have perhaps talked about the crisis in South Africa on earlier occasions.  This time it is unmistakably at boiling point.</P>
      <P>The apartheid state is being threatened not only by internal violence and oppression and unrest, but also from growing and sustained continuous opposition from the international community. What has been the South African Government's response?  It has been to introduce so-called reforms which have done nothing to satisfy the needs of the country's majority black population and which have left the rotten core of apartheid intact.  The black population in South Africa are still victims of a complex constitution and set of laws which regulate their movements and their access to employment and deprive them of basic, political and human rights.</P>
      <P>I believe firmly that the time for ritual condemnation and platitudes has long gone; it has come to an end.  We in Ireland, small and all as we are on the perpiphery of Europe, have &mdash; and we need to remind ourselves of this more and more &mdash; moral authority, and we need to use it now like we have never used it before.  We cannot hide behind myths.  We cannot hide behind platitudes and, more importantly, we cannot hide in the thickets of EC and Security Council of the United Nations type diplomacy. As matters stand, in Ireland, along with other western states, we are indicted for creating the moral and political climate in which crimes against humanity, like apartheid, are not only possible but inevitable. The problem of South Africa is a global matter.  The denouement will be bloody and it will be severe, precisely because it demolishes the morality, to say nothing of the definitions, of the western world and we are part and parcel of that struggle and of the denouement, whether we like it or not.  We can help to make it peaceful and speedy; or, by indolence or refusing to take part, we can make it even bloodier and even more severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2224" /> I believe we do hide behind myths. I instance as an example that civilised Europe did not go to war with Nazi Germany because it was morally outraged at the mass murder of Jews and homosexuals and gypsies but only in order to defend itself from direct attack.  Self-interest is at the basis of our actions in relation to World War II and in relation to apartheid.  It is not enough to make soothing noises about the need for a peaceful solution in South Africa while at the same time collaborating, no matter how slightly, with that régime.  Our overriding concern should be about justice, freedom and peace, and considerations of economics and world power play should play no part in our national approach to this evil because apartheid &mdash; we must repeat it &mdash; is evil.  It is the evil of racism which inflicts hatred and rejection upon its victims.  Why &mdash; for being born with a dark skin?</P>
    <P>Many pressures can be applied in many fields, economic, diplomatic, strategic, financial and social.  They all add up to one word, ostracism.  We must ostracise South Africa.  There has been a belief for many years that ostracism is a purely negative and a destructive process in which we should not engage.  I would agree that this may be valid, that this criticism may be true in certain contexts, but it is not a line that it is always worthy of pursuit.  In the case of the Nationalist Government of South Africa it is not only necessary at this stage, but vital.  The softly, softly approach in the matter of sporting links or visas has merely allowed the South African Government to feel that they are still approved of internationally in spite of apartheid.  Critics have stated that such actions will drive South Africans even further into what is called in Afrikaans their laager.  To these critics I say that the South Africans are in their laager.  They are very deeply entrenched in that laager.  Over and over again we have seen that the friendly advice type of approach, not backed by strong actions, is seen as weakness and indeed a condonation of the South African Government.</P>
    <P>What of Ireland and our approach to <Col N="2225" /> this problem in recent months?  I am disappointed. It gives me no pleasure at all to say that, because I do believe in the general thrust and motivation and sincerity of this Government.  But in the area of South Africa we have not done all that it has been possible for us to do.  We do not support comprehensive mandatory sanctions.  We subscribe to what I call a formula which supports graduated and selective sanctions. Specifically, it is true to say that we have supported mandatory sanctions through the United Nations Security Council in such matters as the oil embargo, investments, the export of South African arms and the strengthening of the existing arms embargo on the regime.  That sounds very impressive, but we as a State have no interest in any of these areas.  It is a painless and a high-minded exercise to say that we support these types of mandatory sanctions.  The proposed areas in which we are involved are the importation of fruit and vegetables, timber, clothing, furniture and wool, and the export of computers, electronic materials and the large investments of De Beers in the Shannon free trade area, which permits the large scale repatriation of profits to the regime.  I have not heard of any statements particularly in that latter matter.</P>
    <P>Unlike a number of western European States, we in Ireland have generally declined or refused to take unilateral action in recent years, preferring to involve ourselves in multilateral acts through the EC and the UN Security Council.  One notable exception &mdash; that I would like to put on record, because it is one that I am pleased to note and it shines like a beacon &mdash; was the decision to license the exclusion of South African fruit and vegetables, which was taken as a contribution to the settlement of the long running Dunnes Stores dispute.  I am very pleased that this was so and I expressed my pleasure at the time, but I would still have to ask why we have to be pushed into this kind of action, into doing what was manifestly and obviously the right thing to do.  Why can we not be out there leading?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> Interestingly enough, in announcing their decision to exclude the importation of fruit and vegetables, the Government related it to a further programme of action against apartheid.  That announcement was made in March.  Since that announcement no further steps, to my knowledge, have been implemented, or indeed even suggested, apart from the involvement and engagement in diplomacy, which I cannot see as having borne any fruit to date.  Apartheid is a challenge to every citizen of every country on earth.  It is a challenge which should be met with all the ingenuity and all the idealism of which all peoples of principle are capable.  It is not simply a regrettable localised aberration, of importance only to South Africa.  It is a universal moral crisis and no nation &mdash; particularly this one which claims to have moral authority &mdash; can stand back and adopt a neutral, passive, or self-interested, or indeed halfhearted attitude towards it.  It is an affront to every single member of the family of mankind.  For that reason, I am on my feet in this House this afternoon. I welcome the comments and contributions from other Senators and I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister of State has to say here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by mentioning to the House that we have in our company here &mdash; and I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach will permit me to say this &mdash; a representative of the legitimate trade union movement in South Africa.  We are all humbled by their bravery and their struggle.  At this stage we can say without equivocation that the South African regime is the worst in the world.  In terms of murder, of repression, of censorship and of downright lies, it has exceeded all of those regimes, of both left wing and right wing variety, that many of us here have condemned on many occasions. There is no regime anywhere in the world operating the methods of censorship, of brutality and of thought control that are now in practice in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who thought that George Orwell's vision of 1984 was a model of <Col N="2227" /> the left gone crazy should now stand back and reassess the whole thing.  The nearest thing to George Orwell's 1984 that has ever been seen anywhere in this world is what is going on in South Africa today. Words no longer mean what they used to mean a week ago; truth no longer means what it used to mean a week ago; life no longer means what it used to mean a week ago; violence no longer means what it used to mean some weeks ago.  We have stories of 11 years old children in detention for three months.  I do not believe there is any other State in the world, either of the left or the right that is anything like as appalling as that regime.</P>
    <P>Let us remember why this is being done.  It is being done, not in the name of privilege because they deny that; not in the name of power, because they deny that.  It is being done in the name of western civilisation and western values. That is what we are being told over and over again by what is now a subversive phrase in South Africa &mdash; the white minority regime in South Africa.  That is now a subversive phrase in South Africa; you can end up in jail for ten years for simply uttering it.</P>
    <P>Let me remind this House that there is no such thing as a South African Government. It does not exist.  What exists is a minority oligarchy in power by terror and terror alone.  It is there because it controls though armed terror, not because it has legitimacy and not because it has right. There is no Government in South Africa and no country has the right to have diplomatic relations with a country that has no legitimate Government.  The only legitimate objective at this stage, with respect to the South African regime, is the destruction of that regime.  There is no middle ground; there is no room for moderation; there is no room for balance. I am sick to death of clichés being uttered by western politicians about the delicate sensitivities of the white minority in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves again that there is also a majority in South Africa whose sensitivities have been ignored for 150 years.  If there must be a choice of <Col N="2228" /> sensitivities, then let us remember whose sensitivities have suffered by our ignorance for the past 20 years.  It is not so long ago when talking about apartheid was a mark of left wing extremism.  We have shifted a long way now at this stage, but let us not forget where we stood and what we stood for.  Less than 15 years ago, Members of this House welcomed the sporting representatives of white racism in South Africa into this House as representatives of good, vigorous anticommunism. We have a shameful record and it is about time we worked out where our allegiances lie.  Our allegiances lie with the legitimate Government and the legitimate representatives of the people of South Africa.</P>
    <P>In that context I do, of course, look forward to and hope for peaceful change in South Africa, but it is becoming too sanctimonious to stand here, 3,000 miles away, and make pronouncements about peaceful change.  If ever, in the traditional Christian understanding of the term, there was justification for a just war it exists in South Africa today.  Whether the people of South Africa chose that route, or are compelled to chose that route, is one thing, but to stand back here and make moral pronouncements is entirely a different thing.  There are the objective conditions which in any manual of Catholic moral theology would envisage a just war.  If we want to avoid warfare in South Africa, of course, we are right.  I do not accept Catholic moral theology on a just war, I have somewhat pacifist views but the consensus in this country accepts the right of people to use armed force to defend themselves.  It is hypocritical on our part to claim the right here to set up an armed force to defend ourselves and then deny that right to the majority of South African citizens.</P>
    <P>Let us remember again that there is no legitimate army in South Africa; there is a terrorist force controlled by a racist minority.  The only legitimate army in South Africa could be an army organised and led by the African National Congress. There is no such army at present. I will not go so far as to say that I regret <Col N="2229" /> that fact.  It is true that there is no legitimate army; there is a terrorist force which has military attachés &mdash; or had until recently &mdash; in most of the capitals of the western world.  That terrorist force is at the centre of the problem in South Africa.  That terrorist force was armed by the western powers over the last 30 years. When we finally got around to stopping giving it weapons we left it with sufficient information, knowledge and access to back-up equipment to allow it to generate its own armaments.</P>
    <P>I want to give way to my colleague, Senator O'Donoghue now, but I repeat that we are not any longer talking about pleasantness or unpleasantness; we are talking about a minority regime held in force by terror alone.  We should, of course, encourage ourselves to take sanctions. I did not bother saying I was in favour of sanctions because I do not think there is anybody in this House or probably in this country who has any doubts about my view on sanctions.</P>
    <P>We would want to start getting away from moralising about what methods people should use in South Africa to liberate themselves.  We should, of course, do everything possible to obviate the necessity for people to use violence to defend themselves.  We should stop telling people that somehow they have no option in this direction.  There is no Government in South Africa; there is no army in South Africa; there is simply terror installed in the name of democracy. It is time that it was ended and we did everything to end it.  It is a moral principle and a moral choice and it is about time we made it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to lend my support to the motion before the House.  As has been made clear by other speakers there is general agreement on our opposition to apartheid. That is not the issue these days. The question is, how do we best bring the ending of that hateful regime and how do we do so as quickly a possible? Essentially, it boils down to whether we can produce change by non-violent <Col N="2230" /> methods or whether people find themselves forced in the direction of resorting more and more to violence as the only apparent solution.  We have heard Senator Ryan indicating the way in which people might find themselves moving in that direction.  Undoubtedly, if the West continues to prevaricate, to drag its feet and pass the time in rather pointless and largely irrelevant discussions, then more and more people, both within South Africa and elsewhere, will find themselves moving in the direction of saying that the only option open is force.</P>
      <P>As democratic parliamentarians we should be using every means at our disposal to show that is not the only road ahead, that it is possible to produce effective non-violent change in societies.  Our own history should encourage us to look in that direction.  We gave a new word to the English language, &ldquo;boycott&rdquo;.  We know that our example was followed by other countries seeking their independence. Many people in the Third World were heartened by the example of our own country and of the movement led and inspired by Ghandi in the case of Indian independence.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of ourselves, and our fellow democrats in the Western world today, to devise appropriate effective measures of a non-violent nature.</P>
      <P>I express the view of many in this House, and elsewhere, when I say it is not the wit that is lacking, it is the commitment and the willingness.  There is a reluctance to face up to awkward, painful decisions and actions.  Of course people will be hurt; of course sacrifices will be needed; and of course it is not possible carefully to distinguish the guilty from the innocent and ensure that no innocent party will suffer.  The history of all non-violent movements, such as the ones I have mentioned, shows that the innocent had to participate and suffer just as fully as the guilty parties but they were willing to do that for the sake of the principles that were at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from the statements made by the African National Congress, and other leaders associated with the struggle in South Africa, that the people there are <Col N="2231" /> also willing to accept whatever hardship is necessary in order to bring about the end of apartheid.  For that reason we should put aside the careful studied balancing of all sorts of interests, however valid they may be in a local sense.  They are local interests which, ultimately, must give way to the superior principles which are at stake in this issue.  For that reason I should like to add my voice in urging the Government to take a much more positive role.  They will find that they will have support not only in this House, but among the people as a whole if they take their courage in their hands and move in that direction.</P>

      <P>All that has to be said about apartheid has been said eloquently today and, indeed, on many occasions in the past.  In the five minutes available to me, I should like to focus on the central and new element in the motion before us.  For the first time, one of the Houses of the Oireachtas will this evening call, unanimously, I believe, for the introduction of trade sanctions by Ireland against South Africa.  This decision marks an important development in our national position against the apartheid regime.  While the decision we are about to make will not be binding on the Government, it will be a clear indication to them that it is the will of all political groupings in this House, and I believe in the other House, that unilateral economic sanctions be taken now against South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This point must be emphasised.  While this House is fully supportive of recent, however belated attempts by our Government, with others, to bring about a common policy of sanctions within the European Community, we are saying this evening that the continuation of these efforts does not, and should not, preclude unilateral action on our part.  A month ago, the eminent persons group predicted a blood bath for South Africa in the absence of decisive economic sanctions from Western nations.  The introduction of the state of emergency three weeks <Col N="2232" /> ago has brought that horrendous prospect radically forward in time.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the procrastination of Britain, Germany and Portugal in blocking effective economic sanctions at the recent European Council stands as a monstrous crime against the majority in South Africa.  Sir Geoffrey Howe got his answer this week from that majority, who clearly understand the economic self-interest which lies at the heart of the delaying tactics adopted by the countries I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We do not know at this point when, if at all, the European Community will take effective economic action to minimise or foreshorten war in South Africa.  What we do know is that mandatory comprehensive sanctions are asked of us by the black majority without further delay, as the best, and possibly the only, means of avoiding bloodshed in Southern Africa on a scale unprecedented since World War II.</P>
    <P>In the context of that dreadful prospect, Ireland has a moral responsibility to act decisively.  It is true that the imposition of trade sanctions by Ireland will not, of themselves, affect the South African regime.  But the accumulation of sanctions by Denmark, the Nordic countries and ourselves will have an effect economically and politically within South Africa and, more important, they will serve the purpose of demonstrating to those nations which are now equivocating, what precisely is required of them in the face of this escalating tragedy.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to that of Senator Lanigan who mentioned specifically the computer conference to be held in Dublin in September.  However, in my view, it will not happen that the organisers of that conference will of their own volition take action to prohibit South African participants from coming here. It is not in their power to do so.  The only effective action to prevent South African participation in that conference will be action taken by Government.  I call on the Government to take that action in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we are discussing tonight condemns the system of apartheid in South Africa and calls on the Government to impose trade sanctions. I do not need to illustrate by the myriad of examples that are available to me, and to every Member of this House, the nature of the barbarous, inhuman regime that exists in South Africa.  We have a common view as a House and I believe the Irish people have a view now that is far more radical than the view expressed by the Government.  The Irish people have led the Government by their own example in taking action against South African produce.  It is time now that we plucked up our own moral courage and took direct unilateral action against this monstrous regime.</P>
      <P>We have for a long period talked about the issue, discussed and debated the issue and beaten our breasts in condemnation of the issue, but we have not taken action that would in any way impinge on the Irish economy or hurt us.  As a small country, unlike many of our European partners, we do not have extensive trade or economic links with South Africa.  We do not have tremendous amounts of economic interest to lose and yet we have lacked the moral courage of some of the Nordic countries in particular &mdash; I single out Denmark as an exemplary example &mdash; to take unilateral action.  We can look for excuses and the GAAT agreement has been used.  Denmark have shown that they will take action.  Let South Africa sue us if they like; let South Africa take us to whatever court they wish, if they dare.  Let us have the moral courage to take that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points I want to make in the five minutes I have left.  One is that there exists a sponsored subcommittee of the United Nations called AWEPA which is the Association of Western European Parliamentarians for Action against Apartheid of which I and some other Members of this House happen to be members.  That is a co-ordinating forum for the western Parliaments and indeed for the western democracies outside of Europe to co-ordinate action, to underline and underscore for western <Col N="2234" /> Governments the abhorrence of free people for the system of Government that exists in South Africa.  I urge Members of this House, all members of all parties because AWEPA contains members of all the various shades of political opinion that exists within the western democracies, to join, be united and be co-ordinated in an action of solidarity with the oppressed peoples of South Africa.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator O'Mahony, referred to the recent commonwealth eminent persons group report.  The commonwealth sent a cross-section of eminent people to negotiate with the South African regime, not all of whom were by any stretch of the imagination left wing or radical in their views.  They included people like the conservative banker, Lord Barbar.  They were unanimous in their view.  What else could they be when during their stay in South Africa the regime was so contemptuous of their efforts that they attacked the front line states, their neighbours, to show their contempt for any negotiated settlements. Senator Bulbulia mentioned the laager mentality of the South African regime. They are contemptuous of democracy, they are contemptuous of the feebleness of western democracies to tackle them. We can only confront them by a serious, concentrated effort and Ireland should be the moral leader in that crusade.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to refer to another aspect of the position in South Africa which has not been referred to by any previous speaker.  That is the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime.  South Africa illegally occupies the territory of Namibia in flagrant violation of international law and in total disregard for repeated resolutions of the United Nations.  They are in the process of raping that country of any vestige of wealth.  They have fished out the seas.  They have pulled every ounce of ore, every diamond and every ounce of uranium that they can in a mad, desperate effort to leave a wasteland behind them when they withdraw eventually, as they must, to their laager of the South African mainland.  The illegal occupation <Col N="2235" /> of Namibia should be an integral part of our protest.  We should demand that the resolution of the United Nations be complied with.  We should equally have nothing to do with the illegally robbed produce of the Namibian people.</P>
    <P>The world awaits a calamity.  I quote findings of the eminent persons group in their Commonwealth report, <i>The Missions of South Africa.</i>  They said:</P>
    <P>Negotiations leading to fundamental political change and the erection of democratic structures will only be possible if the South African Government is prepared to deal with leaders of the people's choosing rather than with puppets of its own creation.  President Botha's recent statements expressing his determination to &ldquo;break&rdquo; the ANC bode ill for the country's future.  There can be no negotiated settlement in South Africa without the ANC; the breadth of its support is incontestable; and this support is growing.  Among the many striking figures whom we met in the course of our work, Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo stand out. Their reasonableness, absence of rancour and readiness to find negotiated solutions which, while creating genuine democratic structures would still give the whites a feeling of security and participation, impressed us deeply.  If the Government finds itself unable to talk with men like Mandela and Tambo, then the future of South Africa is bleak indeed.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the eminent persons group are summarised in five issues.  They declare that the system of apartheid will be dismantled and that specific and meaningful action will be taken in fulfilment of that intent.  They demand the termination of the existing state of emergency.  They demand the immediate release unconditionally of Nelson Mandela and all others imprisoned and detained for their opposition to apartheid.  They call for the establishment of political freedom and specifically for the lifting of the existing <Col N="2236" /> ban on the ANC and other political parties. Finally, they call for the initiation, in the context of a suspension of violence on all sides, of a process of dialogue across lines of colour, politics and religion with a view to establishing a non-racial and representative Government.  The hour of final calamity approaches.  We, as a people who have suffered oppression, need now have the moral courage to lead the western democracy in taking action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Seanad last had an opportunity to turn its attentions to the subject of South Africa there has sadly been nothing but a continued worsening of the situation in that unhappy country.  In spite of the draconian measures taken by the South African administration to prevent the media reporting on what is taking place there, world attention is focussed as never before on the shocking events consequent on the latest declaration of a state of emergency.  I welcome the opportunity accorded by this motion to reiterate my condemnation of the white minority's continued repression of the black majority, the denial of their basic political rights, and the whole abhorrent apparatus of apartheid.</P>
      <P>In January President P.W. Botha of South Africa said that apartheid is dead. Unfortunately, the realisation did not lead to withdrawal of its life support system.  The events of recent weeks are only too clear evidence that we are far from a solution acceptable to responsible opinion in South Africa itself.  As well as this, the situation in South Africa is not only a serious affront to international opinion, it is a very grave danger to the peace and stability of the African continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dilemma faced by the regime was never better illustrated than by its action in restricting the media to the extent that the violent clashes occurring daily between the security forces and protesting blacks, the disappearance of thousands of persons black and white into detention and the wholesale destruction of property cannot be reported openly. <Col N="2237" /> The South African regime likes to present itself to the world as a defender of western values, including freedom of the press.  Yet it attempts to put a blindfold on the world's news media in order to prevent exposure of the grim reality of continuing violent repression and institutionalised descrimination which alas for too many is now the reality of daily life under apartheid.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this year the South African Government have announced a number of &ldquo;reforms&rdquo;, which it has presented as representing a significant shift in its apartheid policies. Most recently abolition of the hated system of pass laws has been announced. This system, directed against blacks only, is to be replaced by a common identity document to be issued to everyone, irrespective of colour.  The abolition of the pass laws is obviously a development to be welcomed provided &mdash; and this is the important carrot &mdash; that the new regulations to be introduced do not in practice impose similar restrictions and indignities on the majority population.  So far, we have no indication that they will not.  The abolition of the pass laws will not of itself have very much impact unless the current influx controls are also radically modified and the South African Government have made clear that they do not intend to do this.  The system of apartheid incorporates a number of basic elements developed, adapted and modified over almost four decades of rule by the Nationalist Party.  Tinkering with the system, or specific reform of one particular aspect which particularly offends outside opinion is to be dismissed and is valueless if the basic structure of apartheid is left intact.  The system is evil and has to be eradicated root and branch. The Government's actions in declaring a state of emergency and the wholesale arrests and repressive measures taken under it clearly indicate that the South African Government are not yet seriously intent on genuine reform.  A number of Senators pointed to the coincidence which saw the raids on Zambia, Zimbabwe and on Botswana on the very days that the eminent persons group were <Col N="2238" /> concluding their report showing to all, if there were any left in doubt, how lacking in seriousness in reform were the South African Government.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, in their response to the continuing loss of life and offence to human dignity presented by the current situation in South Africa, have maintained a firm and unequivocal stand of total opposition to apartheid. Government policy aims at securing the end of apartheid by peaceful means through the exercise of pressure on the South African Government to persuade them peacefully to abandon the policy of apartheid.  In the course of his contribution Senator Brendan Ryan suggested that there had been a significant change of opinion over the years.  He commented that, on an occasion in the past, when a South African sports team &mdash; I think a rugby team &mdash; visited this country, they had been welcomed to this House.  That was perhaps a somewhat selective recollection of what happened on that occasion.  While it is of course, the case that they visited this building &mdash; and that is a source of shame &mdash; it is also the case that many more Members of the Oireachtas, including the Leader of my party, were to be found outside Lansdowne Road expressing their condemnation of those who would have any truck with that administration.</P>
    <P>That policy toward South Africa is kept under constant review in the light of the Government's aim to help bring about that objective, the objective of an end to apartheid.  Ways are examined of maintaining and increasing pressure on the Government in South Africa in the most effective manner possible as well as seeking to provide practical assistance to victims of apartheid to the extent that resources permit.  The restriction on imports of fruit and vegetables from South Africa is just the latest measure to be adopted.  The net effect of that measure will be that imports of South African agricultural produce into Ireland will cease from 1 January 1987.  That measure is to be seen as an integral part of Ireland's national policy.  That policy is among the most forward of western <Col N="2239" /> countries; Sweden and Norway only have announced similar restrictions on produce imports, while Denmark intends to prohibit all imports from South Africa. Many other features of our policy toward South Africa &mdash; our attitude to sporting contacts, to cultural exchanges, our policy of keeping official contact to a minimum, of not assisting trade with South Africa, all of those have long been elements of Irish policy.  Some of them have been adopted only recently by other western countries, adopted in part, we would hope, following on our lead. Senator Bulbulia suggested that we should not be found hiding in the thickets of diplomacy, that we should be leading. She asked: why can we not lead?</P>

      <P>That we have not been able to bring all our partners with us is a source of regret.  But our position on that is clear.  Of course it is the case that Community action is likely to be much more effective than unilateral action, though that does not exclude room for unilateral action.  We have already moved unilaterally, as exemplified by our decision with regard to fruit and vegetables, viewing that as the sending of an important signal.  To that extent we are leading, we are in advance, with Denmark, of our Community partners. We have indicated to our Community partners the desirability of taking further restrictive measures as a signal to South Africa.  We will continue to engage in that task.  We will continue to work, within the process of European political <Col N="2240" /> co-operation, to seek to find ways on which the Twelve member states of the Community can agree as a means of further applying pressure on South Africa.</P>

      <P>The Twelve have already adopted a common series of measures, both positive and restrictive, with regard to South Africa and have stated that the question of taking additional measures, including sanctions, remains.  The measures adopted in September last were regarded as a minimum and were designed to make clear, in unambiguous terms, the seriousness with which the then Ten viewed the situation in South Africa, the need for the abolition of the apartheid system in that country and the opening of a genuine dialogue with the representatives of the black majority population.  That was the situation in September last.  More recently there have been developments but let me come to them in a moment.</P>
      <P>In the statement announcing the measures in September last the then Ten set out a number of specific steps which they looked to the South African Government to take, steps which had been enumerated to the South African authorities during the visit to South Africa at the end of August 1985 by the Foreign Ministers of Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, representing the Community. Those demands are now well known: the lifting of the state of emergency, the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, an end to detention without trial and forced relocation, a firm commitment by the South African Government to end apartheid, to dismantle discriminatory legislation, particularly the pass laws and the Group Areas Act and, lastly real negotiations with the true representatives of the South African people, including those currently in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those steps were not seen by the Twelve as necessarily sufficing to bring an end to international pressure on South <Col N="2241" /> Africa.  They were seen merely as constituting the necessary preconditions for the establishment of a genuine dialogue between the communities in South Africa.  The Twelve &mdash; on this at least &mdash; are united and firm in their conviction that apartheid must be abolished in its entirety.  When those measures were announced in September last it was stated that if there was no progress within a reasonable time the situation would be re-examined.  That re-examination has now taken place.  On 26 June the European Council reaffirmed that the main goal of the Twelve was the total abolition of apartheid and they decided to take additional measures.  Given the time available to me I will not go through those measures in detail.  They have been well reported by the media.  Those measures do not represent what we would have sought.  The decision of the Council did not go as far as we would have wished. In common with the majority of our partners we argued strongly for the adoption now of further economic measures against the South African administration. Unfortunately, that proposal was resisted by three states who preferred the weaker formulation with regard to future action that has been reported in the press, which involved a commitment to consultation with other industrialised countries on further measures which might be needed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has adverted already in the Dáil to the vagueness of the formulation as to future action.  He has made clear what is our interpretation.  We would interpret it as precluding a veto on the measures suggested in the event of Sir Geoffrey Howe's projected mission proving unsuccessful.  It was generally agreed that no member state excluded the possibility of sanctions.  It was not the sort of agreement that Ireland would have liked.  But if it was not the sort of agreement we would have liked it does at least constitute perhaps a very small step forward.  We have agreed to increase assistance to victims of apartheid.  We have indicated that further measures, particularly economic ones, are ready for implementation if there is no improvement evident in three months.  We have <Col N="2242" /> authorised the Presidency to make a further effort to establish conditions for commencement of a dialogue &mdash; all clear signs to South Africa of the Community's determination to pursue its action against apartheid.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the discussions at the European Council the question was posed whether it might not have been better for those countries that were anxious to have seen stronger measures taken to press their case, leaving those countries that wanted to dissent to do so and to justify their decision.  I understand the sincerity with which that view is held.  I do not dismiss it lightly.  But what we are about is the business of sending signals. It seems to me that to have sent a signal that the Community was so hopelessly divided &mdash; incapable at any stage in the foreseeable future of bringing all of its members with it &mdash; would have been a signal of comfort and reassurance to the Pretoria regime.  That should not be the business in which the Community should engage.  That we were unable to get as clear a commitment to future action as we would have liked is regrettable.  But our view, the view of the then Presidency of Prime Minister Lubbers and the view of the majority of states is that, after three months, the Community should return to the issue.  A commitment has been given that no member state will seek to exercise a veto at that stage on future action.  So much for the European Community.</P>
    <P>Let me look now at our role within the United Nations.  The stance taken by Ireland at the United Nations is to support the imposition by the UN Security Council of selected, gradual and mandatory sanctions to be implemented on a universal basis.  It is worth making the point that the resolution co-sponsored by Ireland on Concerted International Action against Apartheid was drafted carefully by the sponsors with the aim of securing maximum support from all quarters in the United Nations for a series of measures capable of further pressurising South Africa.</P>
    <P>The resolution at UNGA 40 calls for Governments urgently to consider the <Col N="2243" /> adoption of a range of measures pending the imposition of mandatory sanctions by the UN Security Council, as well as calling for the Security Council &ldquo;to consider without delay the adoption of effective mandatory sanctions against South Africa&rdquo;.  The success of this resolution can be gauged from the support it secured, being adopted by 149 votes to two with only four abstentions.  Ireland's attitude to sanctions remains that we support the imposition of effective sanctions which should be carefully chosen, selective, graduated, properly imposed by the Security Council and fully implemented. In the view of the Government the aim of sanctions should be to achieve peaceful change through carefully applied pressure.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put by some who oppose sanctions that sanctions do not work.  Former Rhodesia was given as an example.  It was possible to evade sanctions there, but it is worth posing the contrast that the sanctions now under consideration in the EC operate on the import side, and to that extent they would hit more effectively at the South African economy and make it substantially more difficult for the South Africans to evade sanctions even if there were those who were willing to assist them.  People might unscrupulously seek to profit by exporting. In so far as that argument continues to be put in public debate it is without substance.</P>
    <P>With regard to help and assistance to victims of apartheid, including South Africa's neighbours, Ireland already supports the work of the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination Conference, which aims to further the development of Southern African countries and to lessen their dependence on South Africa.  At the recent meeting between donor countries and member states of the SADCC, in Harare, in January 1986, a memorandum of understanding was concluded between the Community and the SADCC which will provide the framework for future assistance to be provided under the terms of Lomé III.  Ireland also <Col N="2244" /> includes three of South Africa's neighbours among her priority countries for Development Co-operation, Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho, the last-named in particular being a country which has had its development choked off by the policies pursued by South Africa.</P>
    <P>Ireland also provides practical assistance to victims of apartheid by its support for bodies such as the International Defence and Aid Fund and the Asingeni Fund of the SACC.  It goes without saying that, in considering future support for such bodies, the needs of those requiring assistance in the light of the evolving situation in Southern Africa will be kept very much in mind.  I might add that it has been decided that for 1986 the grant to the International Defence and Aid Fund, first announced to the Seanad in March 1985 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be increased from £10,000 to £15,000.  A further grant will be made this year to the Asingeni Fund of the South African Council of Churches.  A number of NGO projects to assist victims of apartheid are currently under consideration in this Department for co-financing assistance.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that in formulating policy the Government pay close attention to developments within South Africa through monitoring of the sources available to us and through contacts with those of our partners with diplomatic missions in South Africa.  It is important, however, to stress that our policy must remain one of maintaining pressure on South Africa not just pending the introduction of specific reforms, however desirable, but until the whole edifice of apartheid has been swept away and replaced by a democratic and multi-racial society capable of harnessing the energies and wealth of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants. Senators may rest assured that we take every opportunity to work both within the European Community and in the United Nations framework to further this policy.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony suggested that in seeking to bring the EC with us we were taking belated action.  Factually that is incorrect.  The policy of successive Irish <Col N="2245" /> administrations has been quite clear; they have taken every opportunity in the EC and elsewhere to express our concern on this subject and to advance the case for collective Community response, including economic measures.  The sense of anger, impatience and frustration felt by many Senators at the continuing position in South Africa came through very clearly in the course of the debate.  The message of the strength of feeling of Senators from different political groups has not been lost on me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the House to some statistics. Since 1960, the annual number of births outside marriage has increased steadily from about 1,000 in 1960 to 5,000 last year.  The figure rose steadily, despite fluctuations in all live births.  Despite increases in the number of births outside marriage, the number of adoptions has not kept pace, the average being about 1,200 per year in recent times.  It is not that there is any lack of potential adoptive parents but that fewer mothers of children born outside marriage are prepared to give their children for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another category, children born within marriage who, for one reason <Col N="2246" /> or another, find themselves in orphanages or homes.  Existing legislation does not allow this category to be adopted.  I hope the Minister will be able to rectify that because such children are in a pitiful situation.  I am glad the Government are addressing themselves to this.  I compliment the Minister on having introduced the Bill.  It was circulated early in May following a White Paper the previous year.  Therefore, Members of the House have had considerable time to consider the advantages of Government action.  Now that the Bill has been launched, the Seanad can consider in depth the complicated provisions in the Bill so that when we return in the autumn we will be able to take action to give equality to all children in the State.</P>

      <P>I welcomed the publication of this Bill on 9 May, two months ago today.  My welcome, however, was qualified by acute disappointment at the limitations in the Bill and, in particular, its failure to remove from our law the concept of illegitimacy.  I share this deep sense of disappointment and reservation with Cherish and other bodies such as the Federation for the Unmarried Parent and Child who are concerned with single parents.  However, I am an optimist.  I am encouraged by the fact that the Bill has been introduced in the Seanad giving us the first opportunity for debating the issue.  I am also encouraged by the clear interest and commitment of the Minister of State to the subject matter of this Bill. I know she will follow with particular interest the debate which will take place in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I am puzzled at the timing of the debate.  The Bill was published two months ago.  This is a long time for a Bill to be published before it is given its first airing in either House.  We started the debate in what has to be regarded as a rather halting manner.  Second Stage commenced and almost immediately it was adjourned to give way to another area of injustice, an area which everyone in this House would feel strongly about. We are now resuming Second Stage in an <Col N="2247" /> almost empty House and just before we go on holidays.</P>

      <P>I am not making any criticism of the energy of Senators.  All I am saying is I am puzzled at the timing of this important Bill given that it has been published for two months and is one of the most important areas of social reform to come before either House for a considerable time.  Why are we getting off to this halting start where we resume Second Stage and will adjourn for quite a long period?  The House reconvenes in the first week of October.  I am not sure when this debate will be resumed but I hope it will be early in the next session.</P>
      <P>I do not share Senator Lanigan's criticism that there was no time to consider the provisions of the Bill.  There was a good two months to consider the provisions of the Bill.  Prior to that there was a White Paper published in May 1985. Attached to that White Paper was a draft status of children Bill which reflects almost completely the provisions of the Bill which is before the House and which was published two months ago.  I am disappointed that the debate will be adjourned when the House goes into recess this evening.  However, it affords those of us who are speaking at this stage am opportunity to ask a number of questions about the Bill and to put forward a number of proposals for a broader scope so that all of us can reflect on these matters and on the values underlining the Bill during the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> I would like to consider the context in which we debate this Bill.  The Minister of State at the end of her speech introducing the Bill made reference to that context. She did not spell it out in the way I am going to spell it out now but it is a most relevant consideration that the House is debating a Bill on the status of children in an Ireland which voted on 26 June to rule out the possibility of remarriage for couples who are anxious to remarry, and who believe they have a right in their circumstances to do so but who are prevented from remarrying by a provision of our Constitution.  We said quite definitely &ldquo;no&rdquo; to those people.  We denied them the right to order their own relationships by having the possibility of marrying or in certain instances, remarrying.  That is an important context for this Bill.  It has been rightly said that Ireland virtually is unique in that part of the world with which we share our culture, western Europe, in totally prohibiting divorce. We are the only country in the Council of Europe other than Malta to totally prohibit divorce and we have said we are going to continue that.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, and the people have voted very definitely to convey that message, we must be unique also in ensuring that there is no legal or social discrimination against children depending of the status of parents.  Just as we are unique in not having divorce and a right to remarry, we must be uniquely protective of the child outside marriage. That, we are not at present.  As the Minister of State made clear, our laws are extremely defective.  We are behind the international trend.  The Minister of State referred to an international trend.  We are out of line in western Europe.  We are way behind other countries.  We have not moved and in this Bill we are not moving nearly far enough.</P>
    <P>This Bill was published before the divorce referendum.  The first thing I would ask the Minister of State to do is to consider the provisions of the Bill in the light of the divorce referendum and the fact that as a society we have denied to people who wish to do so the possibility of taking steps to marry and by so doing to affect <Col N="2249" /> the status of their child or children.  We have denied that option.  We have put out a very important marker in relation to our society.  In the course of the referendum debate, as the Minister of State has said, very clear statements were made on both sides about the importance of removing the concept of illegitimacy.  I am delighted to hear that.  I hope we will amend and extend this Bill to achieve it. As introduced, this Bill does not abolish the concept of illegitimacy.  It introduces a number of welcome reforms, welcome protections and rights for children outside marriage in our law but it does not abolish the concept of illegitimacy.  The Minister of State in introducing the Bill used that concept several times in her speech.  The Bill uses that concept.</P>
    <P>For example, section 48, in Part VIII of the Bill which deals with certain presumptions, recites that any presumption of law as to the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any person may be rebutted in civil proceedings before a court on the balance of probabilities.  As the Minister of State has said that is a deliberate reform of the existing position in respect of the onus of proof in relation to that presumption but it leaves us with the concept and the presumption in relation to illegitimacy and with a Bill which introduces a new classification and wording for the purposes of this Bill and other legislation which it amends but does not remove the legal terminology which has stigmatised and caused hurt and offence to children born outside of wedlock and to the parents of those children.</P>
    <P>Before I come in more detail to the question of terminology and classification in this Bill, I should like to refer to the fact that it does not abolish all legal discriminations against children outside marriage.  The Minister has conceded this in her speech in that the Bill does not extend, for example, to discrimination in revenue law.  It does not extend to the provisions of our taxation code under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act whereby a child born outside marriage is a stranger to the father for the purposes of inheritance and, therefore, would pay full inheritance tax on an inheritance. <Col N="2250" /> Granted when talking about capital acquisitions tax we are necessarily talking about children of a father who has some substantial assets, but it is a legal discrimination which forms part of our law and will not be affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the explanatory memorandum to the financial implications of the Bill.  It states that the Bill does not amend Revenue law and that any changes that may be necessary in that area arising out of the measures proposed in this Bill would be a matter for separate legislation promoted by the Minister for Finance.  I read that very carefully because it seemed to me that it did not necessarily commit the Government to any changes in removing discrimination under our taxation law.  I would welcome a clear commitment from the Minister when replying that it is not just a question of this Bill not extending and that there is a very clear Government intention that this will be done in the next financial Bill to come before both Houses.  That is important.</P>
    <P>There is another area where there will still be unequal treatment of a child outside marriage.  That stems from the fact that the child will not have recognition of his or her family status and relationship with his or her parents.  This is a particularly difficult and far reaching discrimination which will continue.  It affects the child mainly in the lack of link between the child's parents.  Obviously in this instance it affects a couple who are living together with their child or children. They may have been living together in a stable long term relationship, unable to marry because one of them is married and cannot free himself or herself to marry.  That child lives with his or her parents in what appears to be a family relationship.  Most of us see it as a family relationship, yet most of our law excludes recognition of that family relationship. That couple with their child or children are excluded from a whole network of family legislation.</P>
    <P>They are excluded from the maintenance provisions of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) <Col N="2251" /> Act in so far as it affects the adult partners. The mother cannot look for maintenance from the father.  They are excluded from the Family Home Protection Act.  Notwithstanding the fact that a couple may have been living together for 15 years and have four or five children, if the father who owns the home &mdash; taking the normal model &mdash; sells it from under the mother and the children, there is nothing she can do about it.  She has no right in relation to the family home.</P>
    <P>Probably of great importance to the protection of the child, there is no right to protection under the provision for barring and protection orders.  These were introduced initially in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act of 1976 but are now contained in the Protection of Spouses and Children Act, 1981.  Barring orders and protection orders are only available to a spouse who can apply on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a child where either the spouse or the child needs protection.  If you do not have that relationship you cannot have that protection by way of a barring order.</P>
    <P>I mention all these points and spell them out because they all affect or can potentially affect a child of what appears to be a family relationship but which we are not recognising as having the attributes of a family and therefore requiring protection.  It is important that we recognise that we are not doing away with these areas of discrimination or unequal treatment or disadvantage for those children. This is something we should reflect upon between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of terminology or classification.  As the Minister has emphasised, this Bill will define new terms.  Section 2 will define the terms &ldquo;marital child&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo; for the purposes of the Status of Children Bill.  &ldquo;Marital child&rdquo; includes children who are legitimate under the present law or children who are legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents and this extends the present Legitimacy Act <Col N="2252" /> so as to include circumstances where the parents were not free to marry but subsequently married.  At the moment if they were not free to marry they cannot legitimise a child by their subsequent marriage. That will be changed.  It will also include children of certain void and voidable marriages.  They will be reclassified as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; children.  This is an area of classification which I should like to pursue and about which I should like to ask some questions of the Minister.</P>
    <P>At present the children of a void marriage, by virtue of the fact that it is a void marriage, or of a voidable marriage if, for example, there is a decree of nullity, are illegitimate.  There being no marriage, the children have the status of children outside marriage.  It is proposed in this Bill to reclassify those children as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; children.  The marriage will still be void, either because it is void <i>ab initio</i> or because it has been declared to be void on foot of a decree of nullity but the children will be classified as marital.  Why are we re-classifying within this categorisation if we are supposed to be removing discriminations and minimising the differences in that classification?  Why are we re-classifying children so that we are narrowing the range of what is non-marital? We are, therefore, potentially isolating the non-marital child in a narrower category, although we are using the language of &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo;.  We are changing the status of children of void or voidable marriages at a time when we are supposed to be removing the legal effects of the status.  We must look very closely at this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to part III of the Bill which amends the law relating to the guardianship of infants and makes significant changes which I will come to. She said:</P>
    <P>For the first time, once this Part comes into force, it will be possible for the father of a non-marital child to act jointly with the mother as legal guardian of the child.  At present it is not unusual to come across cases of couples who have entered into second unions after one of them has had an <Col N="2253" /> earlier marriage annulled by an ecclesiastical tribunal.  Such an annulment is not, of course, recognised by the civil law and, accordingly, any child of the second union is non-marital.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to reflect on that because it seems to me that the thrust of section 6 of the Bill will be to result in the child in question being marital rather than non-marital.  If a couple who were married in a Catholic church then get a Church annulment and then go through a ceremony in a Catholic church, that is obviously a void marriage, a bigamist marriage.  However, under section 6 of this Bill, which will amend the 1931 Act in relation to the legitimacy of children of certain void marriages, it is provided that:</P>
    <P>subject to the other provisions of this section, the child of a void marriage shall be deemed to be the legitimate child of his parents from the commencement of Part II of the Status of Children Act, 1986, the date of the ceremony of marriage or the date of his birth, whichever is the latest, if either or both of his parents reasonably believed (whether or not any such belief is due to a mistake of law or of fact) that the ceremony of marriage resulted in a valid marriage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be presumed for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, unless the contrary is shown, that one of the parties to the void marriage reasonably believed that the ceremony of marriage to which that subsection relates resulted in a valid marriage.</P>
    <P>Whatever they may have thought about when they went through the second Catholic marriage, we are presuming, in law it is a valid marriage.  I presume that that phrase &ldquo;unless the contrary is shown&rdquo; means unless they are prosecuted for bigamy.  I cannot think of any prosecution for bigamy in these circumstances that have actually been brought to fruition before our criminal courts in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It raises very serious issues.  Why are we reclassifying children? I am aware, and the Minister is aware, that in other jurisdictions &mdash; for example, in Britain &mdash; the children of void or voidable marriages have for a number of years been deemed to be illegitimate.  That is a very different situation because you are dealing with a society where nullity is a very exceptional situation, where people have the freedom to divorce and remarry.  We are dealing with a very unique situation here where, as Irish people, we have prohibited remarriage, we have said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to divorce under any circumstances.  What we must be concerned to do then is not reclassify children within classifications but ensure that there are no discriminations or disadvantages to children and no reclassifications of that kind.  It is extremely important that we do not in this way provide the kind of backdoor through removing from nullity some of the attributes of nullity which with a nod and a wink provide us with a sort of backdoor divorce by another name.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her speech, in referring to the question of the change which I have been just referring to, of providing in section 6 of this Bill that children of void or voidable marriages would be reclassified as marital notwithstanding there was no marriage, said:</P>
      <P>The principal effect of this change will be that in appropriate cases the father will continue to be the guardian of the child where a decree of nullity is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that that is an important objective, that the father in those circumstances would be guardian of the child; but I also believe that that objective should be attainable in other similar circumstances where you have cohabiting couples and an assumption of parental rights by the father.  In other words, I do not think that is an answer to the objection I am making.  I think that is itself a value to be realised but that value <Col N="2255" /> should be realised in the context of this situation where the marriage is void or voidable and in the situation of established co-habitation by a couple, the assumption of parental responsibilities and where the couple want and wish to share guardianship rights in relation to the child.  I will come to the provisions of the Bill in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we would not introduce a new type of discrimination and a new classification of children as to whether they are marital or non-marital, which has its own in-built discrimination and which by narrowing the range of children who are non-marital may also in effect give that classification a pejorative context in a very short time.  We are talking about words and the scope of those words and the word &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; is as capable of becoming over time something with a pejorative context if there is reason for it, if it means that the child is discriminated against, if there are differences which are known and become part of our consciousness and which then get translated to giving the term a meaning in a pejorative context.</P>
    <P>I want to turn substantially at this stage to Part III of the Bill which amends the law relating to guardianship of infants.  It amends the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  It is extremely important that this Bill brings about a change from the present situation where the mother of a child outside marriage is the legal guardian of the child but the father is not a guardian. Indeed, he is excluded from the definition of parent or guardian and he cannot become guardian of the child under present circumstances.  What is proposed in this Bill is, I think, half-way to where the House should wish to see us moving in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the mother will continue to be the guardian of the child; indeed, she could not be excluded from guardianship, she has a recognised constitutional right to the care and custody of her child and I think the acknowledgment of her guardianship merely reflects that constitutional right.  The Bill provides in section 11 that the father may <Col N="2256" /> be appointed joint guardian with her in certain circumstances.  I believe that the circumstances are too narrowly framed. The father may apply to the court to be appointed father and if an application is made then as with other applications under the Guardianship of Infants Act the primary consideration would be the welfare of the child.  That would be a case where a father could apply whatever the wishes of the mother, whether the mother supported the application or opposed it.  A very different situation arises where the mother and father of a child are agreed that as parents they should constitute themselves and exercise joint guardianship over the child.</P>
    <P>That situation is given partial recognition in section 11 (3) of the Bill.  This is a change from the provision in the White Paper and the draft Status of Children Bill.  It is a recognition of some of the representations made to the Minister on this point but in my view and I hope in the judgment of the House, it does not go far enough.  Subsection (3) provides that rules of court shall provide a special procedure for determining an application under this section where (a) the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the natural father as guardian, and (b) the natural father is registered as the father in the register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1986.  If the mother and father are agreed, the mother's consent in writing has been produced and the natural father is on the register of births as the child's father, then there will be some kind of simplified application to court &mdash; rules of court will provide for a special procedure.  We do not quite know, although I have a fair idea, what would be envisaged by way of a simplified procedure. In those circumstances a father has to apply to court to be a guardian of his child.</P>
    <P>Take the father of a child or children who had been living with the mother for a period of 11 or 12 years before this Bill becomes law, who has always exercised parental responsibilities, and where both of them believe that the rights as parents, including rights as guardians and all other <Col N="2257" /> rights, should be shared jointly between them, that would still require applying to court.  Where a couple have been living together in the same manner but are parties to a voidable marriage &mdash; where a nullity has been obtained &mdash; a very different situation will arise.  Because the child will be reclassified as marital rather than non-marital, that father will be retrospectively assumed to always have had, and will continue to have, automatic guardianship rights in relation to the child.  If it is part of a policy to create guardianship rights of a father in one context where there is no marriage, then there is a very strong basis on which to extend that to the completely parallel context where the couple are cohabiting and where the mother and father jointly agree to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to place some importance on the interests of the child. That worries me a little bit because I am wondering whether he envisages a situation where the interests of the child in relation to the assumption of guardianship by the parents would be somehow different from the joint wishes of the parents.  Certainly, it is hard to envisage areas of difficulty where they jointly consent. In my view there are very strong policy considerations, very strong reasons indeed, not to require a court application in those circumstances.  No matter how we simplify the procedure we are still requiring somebody to apply to a court.  Culturally that is extremely difficult for a number of people.  No matter how simple the application may be, it can also involve expense, access to lawyers and so on and this creates a barrier to the full assumption of parentage.</P>
    <P>This brings me to what I believe is one of the very important values which we should have in mind in a Bill of this kind. It is absolutely crucial that we not only create a legal framework which helps to improve the ways in which paternity can be established, and provide for the first time the establishment of true, full paternity outside marriage, but that we encourage the use and availing of that facility by fathers.  I know from my work with Cherish and anybody who is involved <Col N="2258" /> in this area knows, that we have a very strange phenomenon.  We have an increasing number of single mothers, an increasing number of children born outside wedlock, but for some reason we do not seem to have any rise in the very small number of natural fathers.  Happily, there is some change and there are fathers who are anxious, willing and indeed frustrated by the legal and other barriers they encounter in assuming their responsibilities and role as parents.  We must encourage fathers to acknowledge paternity.</P>
    <P>Representations in this regard have been made to the Minister.  I know that, for example, William Duncan, senior lecturer in law in Trinity College, has strongly advocated the need for research in this area, the need for detailed research into the absence of a climate which encourages natural fathers to assume their responsibilities, if I could put it that way, the attitude and approach of mothers, their fears and concerns in that regard.  This is a very neglected area and one about which we need to know a great deal.  Even if we had very detailed research in this area, we would still be faced with the same reality, which is that only a very small number of affiliation orders have been brought in the past. Only a very small number of natural fathers are on the register of births.  We have a very big job to do &mdash; and this Bill forms part of that job &mdash; in changing that climate and approach.  We need a programme of public education emphasising the importance of the role of fathers and of mothers and fathers in the child's interests.  We need to emphasise the importance for the child of establishing paternity.  What worries me is that we are not going to effect a great change with this Bill unless there is a substantial programme of education and research in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the means of obtaining a declaration of parentage.  That, combined with the role of fathers, is extremely important in promoting the assumption of role and responsibility by natural fathers, the encouragement of <Col N="2259" /> mothers to involve the father, particularly in the interests of the child, and the removal of any fears or apprehensions in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to guardianship and the declaration of parentage it is necessary to apply to the court.  This Bill, like the other children's legislation which is not before this House yet, shows the necessity for urgent reform in our court structure and the introduction of a genuine family court in which applications of this kind can be heard and determined.  In many ways what we are doing in this Bill is quite legalistic.  We are creating a number of ways in which people can, by applying to or having access to court, affect their rights or their status.  That means that we have to improve greatly the access to court which we are talking about and improve the nature of the court to which a person would have access. This Bill is a further argument, if we need any further argument, for the urgent necessity for the establishment of family courts.  I urge the Minister to come before the House very shortly with proposals in that regard.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Part IV of the Bill which deals with maintenance.  Here is a substantial improvement, in effect equating the child outside marriage with the maintenance provisions of the 1976 Act for the child of a marriage.  The Minister referred to the fact that the Bill now proposes to allow the court to make lump sum payments in certain circumstances which points to the fact that is true, that this is a useful carry over from the provisions of the 1930 Act which were confined to affiliation proceedings.  There were a number of representations to the Minister on this and it is a reform which was not included in the original White Paper and Status of Children Bill.  I would like to question the Minister on this and to invite some thought on it.  I am puzzled as to why the approach in section 20 of this Bill is so narrowly framed.  I accept that it is couched on the same terms as the 1930 Act, but it is confining the lump sum very narrowly to birth and funeral expenses of a dependent child, whether <Col N="2260" /> a child of the marriage or outside the marriage.  It is confining payment to a lump sum &ldquo;not exceeding £1,000, but no such order shall direct the payment of an amount exceeding £500 in respect of the birth of a child to whom this section relates or £500 in respect of the funeral of such a child&rdquo;.  There is a ceiling of £1,000.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the whole question of jurisdiction in the courts in maintenance applications to make lump sum orders was discussed at very considerable length, but I am afraid without ultimate clarity, by the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It was one of the areas that surprised me.  I thought we would have endless disputes or endless discussions about other areas which I might have regarded as more sensitive, but I discovered that the whole area of possible jurisdiction to make a lump sum payment is, in the minds of certain Deputies, a very sensitive issue indeed. One Deputy from the west, Deputy Flynn, would hit the ceiling if anybody mentioned lump sum payments.  He was in no way going to allow the Committee on Marriage Breakdown to form a committee view on this.  However, lump sum payments are a familiar part of the possible orders which can be made by courts in other jurisdictions where applications for maintenance are brought.  They are not unusual and there is provision for discretion.  There are circumstances where the only payment that can be made is a lump sum payment.  Therefore, I invite the Minister to look more broadly at the question of giving the court a clear, broader discretion &mdash; which would be used carefully and only in appropriate circumstances &mdash; without a ceiling to make lump sum payments whether in relation to an application for a child of a marriage or a child outside marriage.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the provisions of the Bill in relation to succession and other property rights.  Here again the Bill proposes to make very important changes and reforms.  It will change the presumption in language in a will so that words will be construed to include children whether through &mdash; as the Minister <Col N="2261" /> has put it &mdash; a marital or non-marital link whereas at the moment &ldquo;issue&rdquo; or such words unless they expressly or by necessary inference include a child outside marriage are not deemed to include such children.  Also, children of a testator who are non-marital children will be able to apply to court under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965, if they are excluded from the terms of the will.</P>
    <P>It is very important that that right will exist from the time of the passage of the Act.  It will be very important that the complex consequences of these succession rights are, first of all, reduced to understandable language for those who may be affected and, secondly, very widely promulgated by the Minister when this Bill is passed.  When we get to Committee Stage we can look at this in detail, but it literally requires, as the Minister is well aware, having the sections of the Succession Act beside the section of the proposed amendment to the Succession Act.  There is even at this stage considerable confusion.</P>
    <P>We will be discussing this at length on Committee Stage, but there is an area that I would like to comment on and I hope the Minister will be open to suggestions of amendment of the provision.  Section 32 of the Bill contains a new provision which was contained in the White Paper and draft Status of Children Bill which allows for the possibility of an application being made to court in the case of intestacy, where the Bill will provide that children outside marriage will have equal rights on intestacy but there will be this provision in section 32 to prevent injustice.  This procedure will be available where a person has died intestate and is survived by a spouse and children of the marriage and also by one or more non-marital children and a non-marital child or children assert their rights on intestacy.  In that instance it will be possible for the spouse or children of the marriage to apply to assert that they have made a contribution of a substantial nature to the building up of the estate and that injustice would be caused by providing for equal rights to the children &mdash; marital and non-marital &mdash; as between <Col N="2262" /> themselves; that one child, for example, had contributed to building up the family assets and should be preferred over the other children, marital or non-marital, who would take a smaller share than this child.</P>
    <P>This provision for a claim or plea to prevent injustice is a novel provision.  It does not exist in our present Succession Act.  It is an interesting provision to the extent that it has some merit in preventing inequity.  It seems that it has that merit whether or not there are children outside the marriage.  In other words, if somebody dies intestate, leaving a spouse and children, the spouse takes the share on intestacy and then the children normally take an equal share.  If there is a farm and one of those children has stayed and built up the farm, then it may well be that we would decide as a matter of policy that that child should be able to make a claim for a larger share than the other children because that child has built up the family farm and has put a great deal of work into it and the others have some independent income elsewhere. There are important policy considerations there, which could mean that we would introduce this into our succession law, into distribution on intestacy. We are not doing that.  We are not introducing it into our succession law across the board, we are only introducing it if a child from outside the marriage &mdash; a non-marital child &mdash; is making a claim. If a non-marital child is making a claim and if an application in relation to possible injustice is made by a child of the marriage that will affect the possible share of distribution on testacy of the other children of the marriage.  It will all be affected or up for grabs at that stage.</P>
    <P>It seems we are introducing a new discrimination. We are saying that this provision will only apply where a claim is made by a non-marital child.  No matter what the circumstances are of somebody who spent 40 years in Australia, who has an independent income and is very wealthy, he or she can still claim the same amount as the brother or sister who stayed at home and built up the family <Col N="2263" /> farm, where the person has died intestate. That is another example of introducing a discrimination by the way in which the claim against justice would be applied.  I ask the Minister to look at it closely and to consider either dropping it altogether or broadening it so that it is a general claim that can be brought on distribution on intestacy where there is a child who has made a contribution of a substantial nature who should be preferred over other children whether they are the children of the marriage or not.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister when replying to Second Stage to develop the whole question of why the Bill is still confined to operating in relation to either dispositions during lifetime but in particular wills and deaths occurring on or after the commencement date.  The provision which means that a will made prior to the passing of the Bill will not be affected by its provisions seems to potentially carry very far into the future the kind of discrimination we are seeking to eliminate. It does not do it entirely.  I will come to the point of the possibility of applying under section 117.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, this Bill is being debated today and we are adjourning for three months.  Word may get around that you should make your will now if you do not want the Status of Children Bill to be applied to construing it and to its effects. You still run the risk that a child may bring an application under section 117. Why do we not avoid projecting into the future?  It could be 20 or 30 years before the testator dies and the will takes effect. Why have two types of construction for lawyers who will make a lot of money on these things in 20 or 30 years?  The Bill should contain a provision that two or three years after the Bill had come into effect, all wills would be construed in accordance with its terms.  In other words, if a time limit was allowed during which people were put on notice, if you like, that even wills made before the Act were unnoticeable after a period they would be construed in accordance with the terms of the Act.  I invite the Minister to consider the possibility of avoiding the <Col N="2264" /> situation in 20 or 30 years time depending on whether the will was made in 1986 or before Easter 1987 when this Bill may be on the Statute Book, that there may be a different construction of the terms of that will.</P>

      <P>I accept that there is a problem in relation to that, I am not trying to skirt that problem.  If a person making a will now which is affected by the present law is given sufficient notice that the will will be affected in the future, that raises a different kind of issue, that after a certain period wills are to be construed in accordance with the law.  The person is alive and can change the will in one way or another, can make any provision and it does seem to raise different issues.  It is not, in fact, depriving somebody of an opportunity of acting in the matter in a total sense, which I accept would run into constitutional difficulty.</P>
      <P>Most of the other points I want to make in relation to blood tests, the registration of births etc. are really Committee Stage points.  I have outlined the main provisions on which I wanted to focus.  The thrust of what I have been saying is that although this Bill was published in May we are examining and debating it in the context of a unique situation for a western European country.  We have made it clear that we will not allow dissolution of marriage or remarriage.  We, therefore, deprive a significant number of couples of the possibility of themselves taking steps to change their status and the status of their children.  It behoves us, if we have any sense of justice, fairness or values, to go uniquely far, if I can put it that way, in abolishing any discriminations and disadvantages to children born outside marriage and to recognise their family links and status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that in our Constitution we have an express provision in Articles 41 and 42 which identifies the rights of the family based on marriage.  That does not say that the Legislature cannot recognise anything else.  It does not say that <Col N="2265" /> we cannot under any circumstances recognise any other kind of family relationships.  It merely, if you like, places in a certain fully protected marriage context the family based on marriage. We need to be very concerned about where we are going and how we will protect family life, how we will recognise it and, above all, how we will cater for and ensure the status of children. That is the title of the Bill: The Status of Children Bill, the status of children in that context.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the subject matter of this Bill.  I welcome the fact that it has been introduced in the Seanad and that we had an opportunity to debate it.  I look forward to Committee Stage when I hope we can further extend the scope and thrust of this Bill so that it will have the effect which I think most Senators on both sides of the House genuinely want.  The only constraints that have been put up are legalistic.  I think we should examine those very carefully because some of those constraints are not as real as they might appear, but there are ways in which we can extend the scope of this Bill and I hope we will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Senators who have complimented the Minister of State for her courage in coming back here with the Bill and in her personal commitment in trying to do something for the status of children and I do so very sincerely.  However, I want to begin by making a few points which I am afraid will be different from the assumptions just made by the preceding speaker, Senator Mary Robinson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is typical of her idealism that she is appealing to the sense of justice of Senators to pass this legislation and amend it rather than appealing to their sense of guilt.  I would choose the second term.  I found it very interesting that in the history of the concept of illegitimacy, which is referred to in the early stages of the Minister's speech, there was no reference to the Private Members' Bill which was introduced in 1974 by Senator Mary Robinson and supported by Senator Horgan and me.  On that <Col N="2266" /> occasion the Bill was contributed to by speakers from all sides of the House.  I feel that I have to refer to it because I want to do so on both historical and moral grounds.  The Bill was defeated.  It was argued against in one of the most virulent defences of property that I had heard up to the 1970s until the most recent amendment to the Constitution.  I also feel I want to talk about this Bill for a very important number of reasons.  It is an important corrective to the Minister's speech in introducing this Bill that we should take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that she is not here but I want to place on record my own personal admiration for Senator Mary Robinsion who brought in that Bill 12 years ago.  It was in 1974-75.  It was at a time when a great deal of the social legislation in relation to equality and the protection of women was not in existence.  We have to be careful about not fooling ourselves about the attitudes that are prevalent in this country.  I doubt if people, if I did not have the record to sustain what I am about to say, would believe the remarks that were made on that occasion about illegitimacy, about property and about the jaundiced connection between the two.  I intend to make reference very particularly to some of the speeches that were made by the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  Basically many of these speeches assumed that we should do something but that we should be careful about what we did in so far as, although the phrase was not then in vogue, it might damage &ldquo;the first family&rdquo;.  I quote from column 575 of the Official Report of 12 February 1975.  That is just 12 years ago:</P>
    <P>If we proposed to take in all adulterine children, that would be an interesting debate on its own.  It is a very serious and important matter, requiring treatment of a most careful kind. Take the situation of a fetching lady with a consort who, getting bored with his wife, is looking for a little bit of excitement.  He happens to have a lot of money.  She knows he has a lot of money.  She sets her hat at him.  She gets a hold of his affections and they <Col N="2267" /> have a child by her deliberate plotting &mdash; and this does happen, let me tell you: I absolutely know of one certain case where it happened, where the woman went to get the man's fortune and got the man's fortune by this procedure, or a chunk of it.  Very often in such cases a person will make a will and make a provision for such issue. But here we are talking about rights where he does not want to provide or where a provision will be made at the expense of the faithful wife and her children.  I am not satisfied that this is something which we should adopt.</P>
    <P>That was a quotation from the most distinguished lawyer of the Seanad in my day, certainly one of two or three. Another distinguished lawyer was the former Senator, Mr. M.J. O'Higgins. The debate got worse as it wore on through the different speakers, all on the subject of property, all with their assumptions that the woman was going to plot to get the farm &mdash; arguments that we have heard in the last few weeks.  So let us not cod ourselves that things have changed that much &mdash; the ugly, dirty assumptions about sexuality, the profound anti-woman construction of extramarital relationships and the whole question of the lack of responsibility and property.  I have made up my mind that there are issues I intend to visit in this regard because they must be encountered in any Bill that affects the status of children. The late Senator Alexis FitzGerald was also worried that perhaps this woman would pounce on the man late in life long after he had forgotten his alibi.  Let me quote from column 577:</P>
    <P>It is hazardous in the extreme to think that a man could be made a subject of affiliation order proceedings 20 years after his alleged child was born to the woman.  How could he gather evidence as to what he was doing on the night of the 2nd November in these circumstances?  It would be extremely difficult, I imagine.  There must be a limiting period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> Again another argument for the avoidance of responsibility in relation to marriage. The Minister of the day indeed, who joined in in many ways, was Minister Cooney.  I have to continue a little bit with what the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald said in my last quotation from him on the subject of property.  It is from column 582 of the Official Report of 12 February 1975:</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan talked about the damaging effects of property.  We all agree that there are damaging effects with excessive property.  That is a Christian principle.  It is very sad.  We want to start giving it away now, taking it from the legitimates and giving it to the illegitimates.  It is becoming important at this point.  I do not understand what we are running down property for, if you are busy amending the law with regard to property, which I understand is the main object of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Do not those quotations together form a very convincing picture of a brave Senator &mdash; Senator Mary Robinson did all the drafting of the Bill at that time, the Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Support) Bill, 1974, was her work and it was supported by Senator John Horgan and me.  I recall those arguments; they were about property.  Closely afterwards, as is the cult now in Ireland, there was the suggestion that Christ and religion were involved in this seedy view of the world.  I quote from column 583, where Senator Alexis FitzGerald had this to say:</P>
    <P>Religion concerns the spirit in man whereby he is able to recognise what is truth and what is justice.  Whereas law is only the application, however imperfectly, of truth and justice in our everyday affairs, if religion perishes in the land truth and justice will also.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am unashamedly of the view that it is the proper concern of legislators to promote the spirit of religion, and wholly disagree with the view that the affairs of this island are in any way bedevilled by the practice <Col N="2269" /> of religion.  It is not the practice of religion, it is the rejection of Christ which is creating the trouble in the northern part of this country.  It is only by religious practice that that evil spirit there rampant will be exorcised.</P>
    <P>That speech was made in this House from the front benches just here.  I did not sit in the same place.  I was back here then. I remembered at the time thinking how honest Senator O'Higgins was at that time.  He spoke about all our actions deriving from natural law.  He believed that.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald believed that they derived from natural law mediated through property relations. One speaker after another stood up and they made speeches like the ones that I have read now.  I have plenty more of them but I do not want to delay the House unduly.  Minister Cooney was at the time the Minister for Justice.  Incidentally, in spring 1975 he said that he had a major Bill in preparation.  It must indeed have been very major because Senator Robinson announced on 13 February 1975, as is quoted in the Official Report of 13 February 1975, column 645, that she had discussed her Bill with Senator Horgan and me and that she was withdrawing it because a major Bill was ready.  That was a mere 11 years ago, so obviously the Bill that I am going to turn to in a moment has had 11 years of preparation and improvement put into it.  In many ways I compliment the Minister of State on achieving in such a short period of time what a more senior Minister took over a decade to deal with.</P>
    <P>To move on to the question about it, in contributing to the debate on that occasion the Minister, Deputy Cooney said, as he has continued to say &mdash; at least he is consistent; he said it again the other night &mdash; that we need to draw a distinction between change for change sake and legislation which is brought in with the idea of improvement.  In so far as he believes me to be totally informed by emotion, I have decided that I will qoute him so that the officials will be able to bring all this back and read it again.  It is very interesting to hear his views.  He <Col N="2270" /> believed &mdash; as Senator Alexis FitzGerald had suggested &mdash; that women were into the business of colluding in a kind of socialism by stealth under the sheets; women putting their eye on men of property, farms, fields, shops, places like that, going to bed with the man and then, God help him, because he could not remember it, 20 years afterwards he was going to have to make provision.  We know, of course, that this did not happen at all. What he did was that he fired the child into some kind of institution.  He sometimes gave the mother a few pounds and then he proceeded to have the amnesia from which the previous quotations would have suggested he should be protected in law.  He could not remember where he was on 2 November.  This is what this Minister, Deputy Cooney, had to say on that occasion and I quote from column 587:</P>
    <P>There is nothing in it (the Bill) to protect against the collusive proceedings to which Senator FitzGerald adverted.  Having regard to the growth in wealth and the changes in our society, the type of hard mentality which would lend itself to such collusion, it might be more common than in the past and could be a real danger in the future.  It is another example of why a Bill which has not had the analysis which the seriousness of the subject requires made in advance could produce dangerous results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they not changed?  It could have been said last week.  The fact is that there was going to be such a proliferation of property in society, that there was more to sleep for in an extra-marital way and thus we had to protect ourselves.  The Minister went on to quote from a brilliant academic journal he had been reading before February 1974.  I quote from column 588:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently come across a working paper from the New Brunswick Department of Justice dealing with the status of children outside marriage. <Col N="2271" /> Although the whole tone and theme of the report was humane and advocated reforms and improvements it nevertheless sounded a note of caution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, apparently, always a good reference point for a Minister.  I am resuming the quotation:</P>
    <P>&mdash;in relation to succession rights.  The working paper states:</P>
    <P>While from the standpoint of the child it may seem inequitable to treat a child born outside marriage differently from one born within marriage, yet from the standpoint of the mother and the children born within marriage, to treat equally the child born outside marriage detracts from the benefits accruing to the members of the family.</P>
    <P>Echoes of the first family.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the case of a father dying intestate and leaving a wife and two children; the family may know nothing of the existence of a child born to the father outside this marriage who nonetheless appears on the scene and establishes that he is the child of the intestate and thus is entitled to share in the portion of the estate going to the children.  Surely one must question carefully the social benefit of a law to this effect.</P>
    <P>There was no great evolution in Irish thinking about the family up to the year 1974.  Maybe the Minister is an optimist and I am a pessimist and there was an evolutionary source in what was happening in Europe that I seem to have missed.  I was very busy at that time simply trying to support Senator Robinson in bringing in amending legislation. Senator Robinson withdrew that Bill, not before an interesting discussion as to the status of illegitimacy itself.  Where did all this stuff come from?  Senator Robinson suggested that its origins were in canon law.  This was very angrily refuted.  My <Col N="2272" /> dear friend, the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald, suggested that it was in the civil law that the origins of illegitimacy and its different forms began.  In the next few years there will be even more attempts to accommodate family law to canon law, laws on marriage, laws affecting children so we might like to know what a rich tradition is there in that regard.  I quote from the Official Report of 13 February 1975, column 630, at which Senator Robinson stated:</P>
    <P>An important part of the influence of Canon Law resulted from the way it gradually refined the categories of illegitimacy.  For example, a general distinction was drawn between illegitimate children who are natural and those who are spurious.  A natural child was one born to parents who could have been married at the conception. A spurious child was one whose parents could not have been lawfully married at the time of conception. Spurious children were further subdivided into further categories: adulterous, who were born of an adulterous union; incestuous, where born of an incestuous union where either party had taken solemn religious vows; and nefarious, where born of parents who were blood relations in the same line. Such were the degrees of iniquity with which innocent children were branded. These categories involved different penalties and prohibitions on joining the priesthood or being able to take vows.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson went on to state:</P>
    <P>In many ways I would agree with Senator FitzGerald that the Church was trying to discourage illegitimacy and that it was possible throughout this period for a person who was illegitimate at birth to get a Papal rescript legitimising him.  Indeed, for those who want to pursue this research further, there are many Cardinals in history who were illegitimate but who got a Papal rescript which legitimised them.</P>
    <P>I quoted that point because I think it is extremely important &mdash; and I am not <Col N="2273" /> suggesting that the Minister is involved in this effort &mdash; that we establish a distance between the assumptions, principles and prescriptions of canon law and the assumptions, prescriptions and procedures of the civil law.  I interjected one sentence, when I heard Senator Robinson speak, about the enormous advantage of having a separate State and a separate Church ceremony for marriage, for a start, and the confusions that it would save.  In this regard I am not speaking only from information available to myself.  For example, in April 1979 the Office of the Chief Registrar at the Custom House felt it necessary to write about the Presbytery of Dublin and Munster Marriages Act, 1844.  They wrote to a reverend gentleman.  I will quote from that letter:</P>
    <P>I am directed by An tArd Cláraitheoir to refer to your letter of 6th April, 1979, regarding ecclesisatical annulments of marriage.  The Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863, provides for the registration of such Roman Catholic marriages as may be legally solemnised in this country. As you are aware, such marriages entail a civil as well as a religious contract. An ecclesiastical annulment terminates only the religious contract where a person who has received an ecclesiastical annulment of a Roman Catholic marriage subsequently goes through a marriage ceremony without having obtained a civil decree terminating the first contract, particulars of this second ceremony should not be entered in the civil records.</P>
    <P>Note the difference between saying that the particulars of this second ceremony should not be entered in the records and saying people should be prosecuted for bigamy the distinction that was drawn in the contribution of Senator Robinson. The idea is that bigamy could be sustained, but that the records had to be kept intact, which makes its own comment in relation to this intersection.</P>
    <P>On the question of the purposes of this Bill, I certainly will be supporting the Minister, in the remarks I shall be making <Col N="2274" /> now and on Committee Stage in relation to many of the welcome changes introduced in it.  I do not have the enthusiasm of some of the opening speakers, even those from the other side of the House, who felt, listening to the Minister, that the status of illegitimacy is being abolished. It is not being abolished.  In fairness, I do not think the Minister said that it is being abolished.  She said she is going as far as possible &mdash; I do not want to get involved in endless quotes &mdash; to mitigate as many consequences as she can of the existence of the status of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>May I, in turning to the next part of my remarks which address entirely the purposes and adequacy of the Bill itself, make reference to the 1974 concluding discussion by Senator Robinson.  On 13 February 1975 she drew attention to something that might be regarded as an international code, namely, the Uniform Parentage Act which was compiled in 1973.  She listed a number of specific conditions which she offered practically as a guiding spirit for future discussion.</P>
    <P>There are two things which the legislation is seeking to do.  The first is to try to improve the position of all children and the second is to enable social provision to be made to assist people who are in a less position than the usual circumstances for the maintenance, education and sustenance of children.  It is very interesting to note that everything I have quoted so far has been from February-March 1974. When Senator Robinson rose to propose a resolution, which the Minister made reference to in her speech, and which I seconded, on 16 May 1984 we were all older by ten years.  What happened to this gestating piece of legislation, this major piece which led to several dismissive remarks from the then Minister for Justice?  It has not appeared.  Great people, no doubt, are entitled to longer delays than lesser people.</P>
    <P>However, a number of things had happened. People had begun to consider the legislation and references being made to some of these points in the Minister's speech, but not all.  I should like to yet again state that I believe that the historical contribution of Senator Mary <Col N="2275" /> Robinson to the question of reform in this regard will be acknowledged in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of points arise.  I have some sympathy for the Minister in taking on this task and moving it forward within the context of the Irish Constitution.  It seems to me that there are two sets of difficulties involved.  The first of these is the fact that the constitutional document of 1937 is one that has provisions which are not in practice interpreted in terms of each other.  For example, Article 41 states the general provision that should be made for all children.  There is a socially prescriptive clause to the Constitution, Article 45, which would have made possible since 1937 a whole range of sustenances in the range of children. But they did not happen.  It is just a mere 50 years on when we are talking about the position of children in relation to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion, perhaps painfully, that at the end of all this we might be better with a new Constitution, that we might be better with a document into which we could discover not the statements of the protection and development of children in contradictory terms.  For example, I have just identified a paradox.  The obsessional consistency of this country has been built on the issue of property yet a clause, Article 40, and another enabling clause.  Article 45, have existed in the same Constitution and they could have made it possible for all children to be cherished equally.  None of us can claim in any sense of credibility that we did not know the difference between legitimate and illegitimate children, and their experience.  It is time we asked what price we are paying for these paradoxes in documents that we purport to live by.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to live in a country that had a Constitution that had an explicit protection of children and an explicit recognition of the rights of children in it. Here again we have the idea that there is a history here of the Constitution being used to obstruct the State's reasonable regard for children in a number of respects.  There are cases currently before the courts which seek to stop health <Col N="2276" /> boards, in one activity or another, from being involved in the welfare of children. There is the connection equally of the question of the status of the family.</P>
    <P>There are images that strike one in the Constitution.  I was impressed for most of my life with the phrase about the family being the basic unit of society until I heard this term being used so freely like the carburettor of a car, the manifold, or something like that, the basic unit.  I am in favour of all families.  I raised the question in 1974 under what principles of constitutionality or of law did we ignore and preclude the children who were born of relatively stable unions outside of conventional marriage from full participation in the State.  The argument was, as we have just heard in the quotations I have given, that we meant something very special by the family.  It was not a far remove from the distinction people had in certain other countries of having what is called a common law wife and a major first wife.  Thus the phrase, &ldquo;first wife&rdquo;, &ldquo;first family&rdquo;.  They tell us a great deal; they tell us what the meaning of the family is, a kind of amoral familism if one likes, it is that ones consideration of family does not extend to even the child one is the natural parent of to the same degree.  It might be that if one were to follow the debate of 1974 that one could in time convince oneself that this action never took place and that one had been the victim of a hallucination.</P>
    <P>On the specific issues the Minister has a difficulty in relation to the Constitution and I have sympathy with her in that regard.  Any contributions I make on Committee Stage will, I hope be aimed at addressing those difficulties.  The Minister also have difficulties in relation to attitudes because I do not believe this Bill will change attitudes in Irish society. It may change some basic minimal rights in a number of limited regards that have been addressed already by Senator Robinson.  However, it will create other difficulties.  I do not see any point repeating any that Senator Robinson dealt with comprehensively except to say that it is very important to emphasise some.  For example, the Minister in her speech on <Col N="2277" /> Second Stage referred to the implications of our adherence to the European Convention of Human Rights.  If I remember correctly the argument was being made in the discussion on a White Paper on this subject that the passing of legislation like this would enable us to sign the Convention. Quoting the European Court's judgment, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>the Court expressly recognised that, while support and encouragement of the traditional family was in itself legitimate and praiseworthy, measures aimed at achieving that end should not be such as to result in prejudice to the family not based on marriage.</P>
    <P>Where is the recognition for the family not based on marriage in Irish social attitudes? The people have just been told that they cannot have a marriage while the other partner is alive.  They have been told, &ldquo;we have compassion for you&rdquo;, and, while they are fainting from the compassion, they are being told that they should live separated for the rest of their lives, irrespective of their age.</P>
    <P>Let us return to this question of the triple somersault that people want to do in relation to the question of the family that is not based on marriage.  Senator Robinson listed a number of these.  I have listened for the past several weeks &mdash; I had a non stop seminar blazing in my ears &mdash; about the joys of civil nullity, about judicial and legal separations and how it was morally superior for somebody to live with somebody else without the protection of the Family Home Maintenance Act, without the protection of barring orders, without rights of succession and so on.  Their children would not be protected and, equally, both partners significantly diminished in rights.  Let us be perfectly clear: that is the price of a limited, miserable property-orientated version of the family we have.  Perhaps it was never constitutionally intended, which has just been vindicated in this country.  I find it sad but the Minister is correct to make the point.  The greater burden of her speech deals essentially with what are regarded as material rights, maintenance, property, succession, <Col N="2278" /> guardianship and so forth.  What is missing is a consideration of the social distance that society has established between the so-called legitimate children and children who were born out of wedlock. I hope I gave enough examples of it.  I may return at another stage of the debate to emphasise particular points about what I mean by these examples if anyone is in any doubt.</P>
    <P>What would change those attitudes about responsibility in sexual procreation, about assuming ones responsibilities and so on?  We cannot say that all children are equal.  All children have never been equal in Ireland.  That is just a simple fact.  They are not equal today. They are not equal in terms of protection, in terms of maintenance or in terms of property succession.  What is the point of going on with this humbug language?  It is correct to say that we have justified it all in the names of superior Christianity, morality to our neighbours.  Thus, I want to hear from other speakers, who would be better versed in this, about how it was backward pagan England &mdash; from whose influences we recently protected ourselves by an enormous majority &mdash; with their degenerate view who changed the law in this regard in 1969.  We are a mere 17 years behind them.  Is that an example of, as the phrase was put, &ldquo;we have to bring our campaign to them yet&rdquo;?  When you look at the history of common law in Britain there was a long period in which there were many disadvantages against the child born outside wedlock.  Many of these were improved in the 1969 Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Law Reform Commission's report of 1982, why did it have to take so long for the report to appear? Of course every report is welcome.  But why does it take us so long to make changes in such areas.  I doubt if the answer can be anything other than the fact that, whenever property is involved, law will move very slowly in Ireland.  It is that property ethos, a kind of sickness, which runs through the debate.  Another example of it is in relation to support for a woman who is living with a man and they have a number of children.  If they cannot get on any longer they split up. <Col N="2279" /> The debate in Ireland usually refers to what she is entitled to when he dies, the disposal of property after death, not what she is entitled to today, the idea of what they might have created together, what they might divide up today or what they might want to live on today.  Property after death: the Senator Alexis FitzGerald image &mdash; all these people coming out with memories of 2 November, to claim all the property.  What a distinguished record to have in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when she was talking about the Government's reaction in October 1983 to the Law Reform Commission's report said that the Government's decisions were &ldquo;based on the belief that the continuance of the legal disadvantages suffered by children born outside marriage was not in keeping with the Christian and democratic nature of the State&rdquo;.  May her belief always be with her in that regard.  When looking back at the law of the State and the practices of the State in relation to illegitimate children it is neither very Christian nor very democratic.</P>
    <P>The Minister's aim is not the abolition of illegitimacy.  I find this unsatisfactory. I do not believe that it is impossible to abolish this status.  If necessary, let us prepare the groundwork and let us have the options for a new Constitution, a constitutional amendment or whatever obstacles which need to be removed to change it altogether.  Her aim is to deal with guardianship, maintenance, succession, property rights and the declaration of parentage which she stressed. She has expressed a confidence in relation to revenue law.  We read the phrases &ldquo;marital child&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo;. Are these concepts not the strongest evidence you could possibly have for changing the Constitution in this regard very fundamentally?  What do we mean by it all?  Perhaps people will correct me and guide me on this.  Three categories of children will exist after the passing of this Bill.  Marital children will be those born within wedlock.  They have been well defined.  There will be legitimated marital children and, finally, non-marital children, the idea being the civil concept of <Col N="2280" /> nullity built on the sand of the canon law concept of nullity.  It will state that a marriage never existed or a marriage was defective.  Of course I welcome the children of such a piece of fiction being saved from the stigma of illegitimacy.  But they are &mdash; Senator Robinson was hinting at this &mdash; being moved into this category of marital children.  Then, again, you will see these standing distinct from the concept of non-marital children.  Related to these concepts will be marital child, non-marital child, legitimated marital child, marital child after the legislation has been passed.  I kept thinking about how good it was, in the law, to be developing concepts. After you had gone through the exercise of suggesting that the marriage was a figment of your imagination you then went on to say that the children were the fruit of a marriage.  There is some merit in such a retreat to biology but that is what it is in the end.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill proposes to extend the grounds whereby the status of children can be changed.  We would welcome this.  But I support Senator Mary Robinson when she makes the point about section 6 of the Bill.  Section 6 provides that, if either party, to avoid marriage, believed at the relevant time that the ceremony of the marriage was valid, the child of that union will be deemed to be the legitimate child of both parents and in the case of a voidable marriage a decree of nullity will not have the effect of making the child of the marriage illegitimate as it does at present.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that needs great clarification. The position was, as I illustrated earlier in a letter from the registrar general's office, that many people believed that they were involved in a second proper civil union.  I would like that distance established between the assumption that you had gone into a second civil union when you had not and the effect of section 6, as it is described here, on all of these. I regard these little fictions with a certain amount of black humour.</P>
    <P>A number of very important points have been well made by Senator Robinson. It is a mistake for speakers &mdash; and some from all sides of the House have <Col N="2281" /> made the comment &mdash; to assume that this Bill is abolishing the status of illegitimacy. The fact that it is not extends far beyond this Bill.  What it means is that our inability to demolish the concept of illegitimacy will live on in consequences not only in this Bill but in every Bill where the words &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; are used as a distinction. Should it not be so will be good news for me when I hear it.</P>
    <P>The distinction between marital and non-marital needs to be developed.  I cannot see to what extent one has gone towards my second purpose &mdash; of amending social attitudes &mdash; if one wants to say that one would have liked to abolish illegitimacy but one is talking about marital and non-marital, when one is back to the first argument about potential constitutional difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty involved in relation to the procedures for handling the children of marriages that have been declared void or voidable.  Equally I think that perhaps &mdash; Senator Robinson made the point &mdash; the courts procedures which are envisaged in the area of family law should have preceded this Bill.  We might have been able to discover, in those procedures, better and more satisfactory ones for adjusting and settling issues as to guardianship rather than appeal to the courts under the present conventional system.  There are many people who believe they have moral relationships that are continuous, who love their children, who love each other, who would like to be treated under the Irish Constitution but who have been excluded.  They are now non-people.  They do not have the merit of taking on this vow of separation never to remarry.  They are people who &mdash; as has been pointed out &mdash; are living in sin in the eyes of God and the Irish Constitution.  If they want to make arrangements for their children they should be able to make those arrangements in a dignified way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of maintenance and affiliation orders I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that she did not intend to go back to the 1930 <Col N="2282" /> position of the once-off lump sum payment. I ask the Minister to think again in this regard, to think of the kind of historical background I have hopefully sketched for her in relation to responsibilities on the part of Irish males in relation to their children born outside of wedlock.  What of the situation where a person or party may have only a limited opportunity to get something rather than to get the continous expectation of nothing?  Should the one exclude the other?  That is something to which we can revert.  Perhaps when we are teasing out this section it is something we might give some thought to.</P>
    <P>The point has been made, but is it not symbolic in its own way, that we find ourselves so obsessed with wills at a time when there are a quarter of a million people unemployed, when we are told we are a poor country that cannot afford this or that.  Wills are a great consideration in Ireland.  By the way I am not arguing against some Philistine position, that I am against good law.  I listened to cheap remarks like that.  I listened to some the other night.  What I am interested in is that, when one looks at comparative jurisprudence one finds that there are a limited number of countries that concentrate exclusively on the disposal of property after death.  There are very many different jurisdictions who look at the disposal of property as it is created, re-distributed and so forth.  It is just an example of our usual supremecy of imagining that our miserable concentration on what we are doing is somehow morally superior to the rest of the world.  That is a confident position to have of the world.  I wish at times I have never lost it myself.  There used to be a phrase for it: as happy as a pig in mud, let us say, for the sake of illiteracy.  The fact of the matter is that there is a major problem in relation to the question of succession.  I take Senator Robinson's point about what we will do after the enactment of the legislation.  Ministers may reply there may be a constitutional difficulty in relation to accommodating any of the requirements of retrospection. That can and should be solved.  There are <Col N="2283" /> a number of ways of addressing this issue in relation to creating a concept of property that is not divisible after death and so on.  We can debate it more thoroughly on Committee Stage.  We should agree, on Second Stage, that it would be much more desirable to have a date in the future on which all wills would be affected by the requirements of this legislation, than having a whole series of these other ones.  They will create a new kind of novel, when all of the people will exchange their love stories with each other.  One will say perhaps: were not you lucky that you were able to be born after the enactment of the legislation but I am the illegitimate child of the person who was born before the date of the legislation and therefore condemned to be poor.  The whole thing is farcical.</P>

      <P>Intestacy.  I want to support her in that regard.  If we are removing discrimination from one category there is great merit in trying to apply this to all children, leaving all children who have been treated &mdash; as they would feel &mdash; unjustly to have the same recourse to law.  In all of this what will be the traumatic point for Irish people, and for people who are interested in the law, will be the concept of putting the children first.  I wait to be contradicted on it by evidence.  Everything I have read in all the debates over the past 12 years taught me only one thing, that it is a property first culture, a property first Constitution, a property first legislature and that we <Col N="2284" /> have property first discussions.  I would like to think that the reforms this Bill will introduce will lead to the kind of changes in attitudes that will undo what I have been describing.</P>
      <P>I will make one last point.  I have said already I would support the Minister in any way in which the Bill can address the question of diminishing as much as possible all of the adverse consequences for children at present.  Let me conclude at the point at which I began.  It is this: is there not a case, as we move along, for trying to accept the legal entity of the child in its own right?  I read the Russell report when this issue was being debated in Britain.  I have looked at some of the debates that have taken place in some of the other Parliaments.  They have made a number of points.  They have tried to address the issue of the child in its own right.  But I think we have to live with the enormity.  I make no apology for saying it.  We do not see the child directly in Irish social debate.  We see the child through spectacles and those spectacles portray the child as either the child of the first marriage under the Constitution &mdash; the only marriage now &mdash; or the child within wedlock, or the child without wedlock. It would be a very significant leap forward if we could hope that this would ever change.  I do not say I have much hope any longer in this regard.  Equally, this is another issue to which we must address ourselves.  I ask Ministers to assist us to address ourselves to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should a case be made for retrospection? If we say we will change the law for the future, albeit we have been converted to a more progressive and humane view, how could we ever undo what we have done by drawing all of these distinctions?  Has anybody ever read or listened to the evidence of those who found themselves in institutions of one kind or another, who found themselves as the abandoned natural children, particularly of Irish maids?  How can we ever undo that damage?  I am not in favour of people continually flagellating themselves with guilt and all the rest of it, but <Col N="2285" /> this is a shame in Irish history &mdash; there is no point in calling it anything else.</P>
    <P>It is not something about which we became concerned in the twenties and thirties.  The fact is that there is a case in the European Court at the moment to vindicate the rights of a child.  There were cases in the Supreme Court, and in the future we probably will have to rely on the courts rather than on the will of the people.  I wish the Minister every success in what she is trying to do.  I hope she will take the remarks I have been making as an attempt to draw the context of the difficulties in which anybody is who tries to draw up reform in this regard.  She will have the critical but constructive assistance of the Labour group in the Seanad in improving this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move the adjournment of the Seanad on the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration:</P>
      <P>In the light of continuing disquiet and concern with regard to the Birmingham Six, compounded with the most recent revelations, the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to undertake new initiatives to press on the British Government the necessity for a re-trial in this case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for affording me the opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  We are asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to invoke a number of new initiatives in regard to the Birmingham Six.  I know that a number of Members have expressed the view that this is not the time to raise it in the House, but I should like to put on record that I feel that this matter has long since left the realms of speculation, that there is a growing body of opinion here and abroad that the Birmingham Six are innocent and that it will take a very considerable co-ordinated effort on the part of all those interested to persuade the British Government to take appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn, as all the other sane people have to do, the bombing atrocity committed in Birmingham in November 1974 in which 21 people were killed and more than 160 people were injured.  No cause <Col N="2287" /> would warrant such devastating consequences for so many innocent victims. However, the issue in this motion is whether the so called Birmingham Six perpetrated this heinous crime or whether, as many believe, they are innocent.</P>
    <P>According to criminal appeal law, new evidence must be produced before the case can be reheard.  The Home Secretary in Britain has discretionary powers to investigate and review if he feels that considerations of substance exist.  Powerful forces need to be at work not only to persuade him but to conclude investigations which, we understand, began some months ago to exonerate and secure the release of these innocent victims.</P>
    <P>Our task here this evening, in as responsible a way as possible, is to try to help and to convince our Minister and the Government that something urgent needs to be done.  Individual Senators have been endeavouring in their own way to heighten public awareness and bring to bear on the British Government the necessity to reopen this whole sordid affair.  For the first time, an all-party delegation, of which I am happy to be one, representing both Houses of the Oireachtas, will travel to London to express our deep concern in the matter.  A comprehensive programme has been arranged by the Department of Foreign Affairs at our request, involving a visit to the prisoners and to people in London who have not only shown a deep interest in the Birmingham Six but have carried out exhaustive investigations into the events leading up to and during this infamous trial.  We hope to have a meeting with the Home Secretary.</P>
    <P>Many people genuinely believe that there has been a miscarriage of justice in this matter.  To deprive innocent persons of their freedom and impose life sentences in prisons creates a tremendous loss of respect for authority and ultimately weakens democracy, but it is more important for the individuals involved.  Having to suffer the misfortune of spending years behind bars, living through the killing boredom of prison life when they are innocent is not only <Col N="2288" /> appalling but a heinous travesty of justice.</P>
    <P>We can think for a moment of the consequences for any one of us, at a young age taken away from our families, with little or no contact with home life, with no job opportunities.  It would bring home to us the necessity to ensure that as far as possible no innocent person would have to suffer such loss of freedom.</P>
    <P>Lingering doubts were expressed at the time of the trial.  These doubts have lived on.  They are now cushioned and padded by an overwhelming body of evidence which leaves many convinced that the Birmingham Six are innocent and have been imprisoned for crimes they could not have committed.  These men have consistently claimed that they were brutally battered in prison prior to the trial and that the confessions they signed were literally dragged from them.  During the trial the judge admitted that the six defendants had been subjected to a series of quite outrageous assaults at Winson Green Prison in which prison officers had taken part.  These allegations of brutality by the police have never been cleared up satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The forsenic tests carried out on five of the six men threw up evidence on which it was concluded that two of the men had recently been in contact with commercial explosives.  During the trial Dr. Black who appeared for the defence stated that the traces allegedly found on two of the men could have come from a range of other non-explosive substances. A &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme on 28 October 1985 confirmed this and presented further evidence which virtually demolished the forensic evidence on which so much had earlier hung in this case.  The two scientists on that programme set out to prove that contact with playing cards or leatherette surfaces found in train furniture could produce the same result as nitroglycerine under the test by the scientists who carried out this test for the Home Office and on whose evidence in the court so much depended.</P>
    <P>Anyone who reads through the confessions will find a variety of different <Col N="2289" /> contradictions.  They indicate that a number of different types of bombs were planted in different places and are inconsistent with what took place.  These confessions were subsequently contradicted by the forensic evidence which showed that the bomb used was carried in either a briefcase or a suitcase.  The confessions indicate it was a plastic bag.  No identification of fingerprint evidence was introduced. None of the six men serving the sentences was at any time member of the Birimingham IRA.  The IRA has claimed that the volunteers who committed this atrocity are walking free.</P>
    <P>I want to read an extract from the book &ldquo;Error of Judgement&rdquo; which to me sounds extremely convincing.  It is at the stage where the writer of the book is interviewing one of the people who allegedly planted the lethal bomb.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Again I drew a rough sketch of the pub and asked him to mark the site of the bomb.  Without hesitation he marked a spot at the rear.  For good measure he also drew in a rear exit which I had omitted.  On my diagram I had inadvertently drawn in a staircase and he remarked that he could not recall any stairs in that place.  When I returned home and examined the plan of the pub, I saw that he was right.  It is hard to see how someone who cannot possibly have access to the forensic evidence at the trial could accurately mark the spot where the bomb was placed unless, of course, he was present when the bomb was planted.</P>
    <P>The prison authorities where the Birmingham Six are held appear to be convinced also that these men are innocent. They have long since abandoned, as far as these prisoners are concerned, the strict visiting criteria and other regimes which apply to prisoners to whom similar sentences apply.  So much for the circumstances. What is to happen now?  I would like to ask the Minister of State if this matter has been raised at the Anglo-Irish Conference?  Will it form part of the agenda for future meetings between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher?  Can the House be told what the response was <Col N="2290" /> to earlier attempts by the Minister?  I understand there has been correspondence between the Irish Embassy in London and the Home Office.</P>
    <P>Following on whatever action is taken by the Government, it will be necessary to mount continuing and enormous pressure. This has to be generated here and at home.  It is far more expedient for the British Government to keep those men in prison.  As has been stated in other places, they fear that to open up this case would bring a vista of wrongful convictions. It is abundantly clear that the police do not come out well from this saga.  Perhaps, at the time because of the nature of the atrocity, there was an anti-Irish prejudice.  There now appears to be an establishment continuing to cover up what is involved.  We should not stand for that appalling travesty of justice.</P>
    <P>However, a momentum has to be reached to ensure that it is not possible for the British Government to withstand that pressure, that they will have to ensure that justice is done and there is a speedy release of the men involved.  In any system of justice, mistakes can be made.  They can be made with the best will in the world but, when it reaches the stage where overwhelming evidence has been provided, one should get a decent response.  It would be extremely sad if our failure to protest at unjust convictions should lead to continued misery behind bars for these unfortunate men who have already served 12 years.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the motion.  Sufficient facts have been made available in recent years to throw serious doubt on the guilt of these men. <Col N="2291" /> They were convicted on two bases, one being the confessions which they made. The judge said there was no doubt that the men had been subjected to a series of quite outrageous assaults and, to accept confessions in view of that fact, was a very doubtful procedure.  The other evidence was forensic which has now been shown to be very doubtful.  The other aspect about this case is the consistency with which the men have repudiated and denied their guilt.</P>
      <P>Opinion in general and the opinion of those within the jails where they are serving their sentence is that they are not guilty.  A number of features of this case including the evidence on which they were convicted, the general belief that they are innocent and their whole background before the case which shows that they were not members of the IRA and not likely to have been involved in this, add up to the conclusion that there must be serious doubt that they are guilty.  At the very least this justifies an investigation into the case.</P>
      <P>It is a regrettable fact that this is not the first case where British police have sought a victim at any cost and have been determined to find a scapegoat for a crime of this kind.  I suppose this is not surprising because it was a horrific crime and public opinion was demanding that the police find those who perpetrated it. The police were, I suppose, under tremendous pressure to find somebody. It seems unlikely that they found the right people.  This adds another question mark as to whether these men are guilty.</P>
      <P>From the point of view not only of British justice but of the men concerned the time has come when there should be an investigation to see whether in all the circumstances these men are guilty.  I am very glad that a delegation is going to the UK to talk to some of these men and to members of Parliament to ensure that there is an investigation.  I feel fairly confident from the facts that I know that if there is an investigation there is a very good chance that these men will be allowed to go free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate. Like other Members of the House and of the public at large, I have studied the case of the Birmingham Six as carefully as I could in recent months.  I must admit that it was a rather belated study on my part but I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that the men concerned have been the victims of an appalling miscarriage of justice.  Because I am so convinced I am glad of the opportunity to join an all-party delegation to the House of Commons next week to seek to have the case put to the Court of Appeal by the British Home Secretary, Mr. Hurd.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information available to us since last year at least, I believe that a grievous wrong has been done to these men and it is incumbent on all of us to do everything we can to redress that wrong in so far as it can ever be redressed at this stage.  I do not believe that it will be easy for the British Government to admit that their country's system of justice was roundly abused on this occasion, as it was in my view in the case of Annie Maguire and the Guildford four.  It is better that this admission be made by the British Government than that six innocent men should remain incarcerated in jail and that the system of justice as a whole which, generally speaking, serves the British people well should itself be brought into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reasonable person reading the evidence now available concerning the case of the Birmingham six must come to three conclusions.  The first is that the confessions made by the convicted men were made following serious beatings in Morecambe police station and as such should not have been admitted by court in evidence. Secondly, the Greiss test used in forensic evidence to prove that the men's hands had been in contact with explosive substances we now know can be misled, as was said by the defence forensic expert during the trial, by a whole series of substances including the surfaces of playing cards.  We know that five of the men played cards on the train on the way to Belfast.  The third factor taken on its own <Col N="2293" /> would not necessarily be credible but taken in conjunction with the other two factors I have mentioned it can be thought to be credible.  This third factor is that the IRA have officially denied that the men were members of that organisation. The men themselves, their families and their friends have consistently denied membership of that organisation.</P>
    <P>As the matter stands a review is underway at the Home Office to see whether in the light of the new evidence the case should now be referred to the Court of Appeal.  Anyone who has studied the case believes that sufficient new evidence is now available to justify such a referral. The proper legal option is now obvious.</P>
    <P>The problem, however is in nature a politico-legal one.  It is precisely for this reason that we are going to the House of Commons next week.  As has been said by Senators Smith and Ryan, it will not be easy for the British Government to admit that a miscarriage of justice has taken place on this occasion but it is incumbent on all of us to do all in our power to convince them that this is the case and to show to them that any redress that is made not only will not undermine the credibility of the British political system but will in fact enhance it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Mahony and most other Senators, I was probably so outraged by the bombing campaign in Britain in the seventies that notwithstanding my sympathies for people who end up in prison I probably tried, if not consciously then quite subconsciously, to stay away from some of these issues.  However, it is to the great credit of the families and friends of the Birmingham six, the Maguires and the Guildford four that as they persisted with their efforts the evidence presented to me and the alternative interpretation of what happened became so convincing, both in terms of the admitted violent assault on the Birmingham six and the ample evidence that the allegedly conclusive forensic evidence was anything but conclusive, as well as the fact that no other evidence was evinced against any <Col N="2294" /> of the six persons convicted of the Birmingham bombings, that I was led to the inescapable conclusion that a profound miscarriage of justice resulted.</P>
      <P>It is easy to understand why a conviction could have been entered in, in spite of the evidence.  Britain must have been a very frightened place in 1974. There had been a considerable number of outrageous bombing attacks.  The police must have been under enormous pressure, as must political figures.  I have no doubt that figures in the Judiciary respond to that pressure, not consciously or deliberately.  I am not implyng any misconduct but they are part of the society they live in.  It is evident in our own society in the way members of the Judiciary respond in terms of the penalties they impose to crimes that become more apparent.  That was the situation in Britain at that time.  There was a need for someone to be convicted.</P>
      <P>There is and has been in recent years in Britain a rather unhappy and unhealthy tolerance of a form of racism towards the Irish which it could do without.  I found it extraordinary that when the Greater London Council, so ably led by Ken Livingstone, withdrew advertising from a newspaper which they felt to be consistently hostile to the Irish community, the British Press Council took great exception to what they thought was a tremendous interference with the freedom of the press because of the fact that the advertising was withheld.</P>

    <P>It was understandable that somebody would be sought to be convicted of these bombings.  It is tragic, however, that the understandable public pressure, the understandable sense of outrage and the understandable sense of fear, should have resulted in the conviction of six people who, to anybody looking at it with reasonable detachment from this side of the Irish Sea, seem to be clearly innocent. One of the consequential tragedies that has sprung from that is the fairly substantial evidence of, to put it mildly, a less than helpful attitude on the part of Irish public authorities.  The activities of the Irish Embassy in the United States when a United States Congressman took <Col N="2295" /> an interest and where rather than confront the evidence, the embassy attempted to undermine the status of the source of the information, Father Raymond Murray, was regrettable to say the least.  I would still welcome an attempt by the Minister present to confirm or deny the existence of the letter from the then Ambassador attempting to undermine Father Raymond Murray.  At the time nobody was in a position to confirm that this letter was issued; nevertheless, nobody has denied it.  I would be interested to know if the letter published in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 3 November 1985 is authentic or is it a concoction or a forgery generated by somebody with presumably less than admiral objectives.</P>
    <P>Now that we have got to the stage where we are all concerned, it would help a lot if the Minister could tell us if the Government now accept that the Birmingham Six have been unlawfully convicted. I know they have expressed concern about their convictions, but expressing concern seems to me to be a reasonably large step away from saying they accept that they are innocent.  If the Government are prepared to accept that these people are innocent, then the steps they must take consequential on that will have to be very serious.  If we accept that in the case of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four that there are at least ten people, not all of them Irish, serving sentences in Britain for offences that they most manifestly did not commit, then a very serious matter of relationships between this country and Britain arises.</P>
    <P>Expressions of concern are only one step along the road.  What we need now is for the Government to say whether or not they accept that these people are innocent.  If they accept that these people are guilty, or do not accept that they are innocent, they should explain to us why they differ from the rest of us, and I think a large spectrum of Irish opinion ranging through Church and political figures including John Hume, Séamus Mallon, the Cardinal and all sorts of people.  They should explain why they take a different view from all those people and on what <Col N="2296" /> evidence their conclusion is based.  If the Government accept that these people are innocent, let them say so clearly and unequivocally.  There is the capacity and the possibility of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; here. Do the Government believe that these people were wrongfully convicted?</P>
    <P>Without diverting too far, I would like to say that I think that at this stage there is an equally overwhelming case in the case of the Guildford Four.  To suggest that the four people, one of whom obviously had a serious drugs problem, were the stuff of a ruthless IRA bombing cell is to push imagination to the limit.  The people portrayed in the recent British television programme in connection with the Guildford bombing seem to me to be the direct antithesis of what you would expect for a ruthless IRA bomb squad capable of such co-ordination of activity, speed of response and so on.  When the Government begin to make up their mind about people convicted of alleged terrorist offences in Britain they should not ignore the Guildford Four.  Even though the Maguires have been released, it does not in any way reduce the need to reconsider their case.</P>
    <P>This debate is particularly worth while. It is necessary to accept that even if our Government believe that these people are innocent, even if there is some new evidence and even if, as is the case at present, the Home Office is reconsidering the whole issue, we must remember that very serious matters are at stake for the Government, the police and the Judiciary of the United Kingdom.  When Lord Denning was giving judgment on a civil case taken by the Birmingham Six against the police he said:</P>
    <P>If the six men win it, it will mean that the police were guilty of perjury, violence and threats, that the confessions were involuntary and were improperly admitted and that the convictions were erroneous.  The Home Secretary would have either to recommend that they be pardoned or remit the case to the court of appeal. This is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land would <Col N="2297" /> say &ldquo;it cannot be right that these actions should go further&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the quality of the legal opinion about the consequences of reopening these cases.  On the other hand, it is true that if these cases which are now under reconsideration are not dealt with favourably now they may never be reopened again.  This is probably the most critical time in the history of these cases.  If the British Government now choose to decide that there is no reason to reopen the cases, it may well be many years before a situation can arise again in which the cases will be reopened.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what we need from the Government at this stage is far more than expressions of concern.  The Government should make their position known.  Do they believe that these people are innocent? Expressions of concern at this stage do not go half far enough.  If the Government believe these people are innocent they may well have to take steps they do not want to take.  I sincerely hope that, if the Government have come to the position where they recognise the innocence of these people, we will have no further evidence of the retreat from the capacity to act and think independently that we saw here on another issue of foreign affairs earlier today.  Therefore, I appeal to the Government to make their position clear as to whether they believe these people to be innocent and then to take the necessary consequential action on behalf of innocent people, action that most of us at this stage believe should be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Before addressing the problem of the people it is fair to say that it would be giving an incomplete picture of the situation if one were not to draw attention to the massive contradictions which exist in the leaks and reported statements of various figures in the IRA regarding this matter.  In the extract from &ldquo;Error of Judgment&rdquo; published recently in the <i>Sunday Press</i>, for example, there was a very interesting and informative extract.  It said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was eleven years before the IRA <Col N="2298" /> could bring themselves to admit that their men were responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings.  The first public admission came from Joe Cahill, a senior figure in the IRA and a former commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. He was speaking on Granada's &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; on 28 October 1985.</P>
    <P>The report stated that Mr. Cahill said:</P>
    <P>These volunteers who did carry out these operations are walking freely about today.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should place any credence whatsoever on what the IRA say. Anybody who is capable of killing and injuring people indiscriminately or selectively will have no difficulty whatsoever in telling lies.  Anybody who can justify shooting their neighbour, whether coming from or going to church, will have no difficulty in saying afterwards that they did not do it if it suits them to say so.  Any appeal with regard to this case which is based on the statements of the IRA is totally and absolutely with credibility. It rests with the IRA, of course, if these men are innocent.  I will deal with that matter later.  It rests with the IRA to name the people who did it, because they are in a unique position to know that injustice is being perpetrated on these individuals.  They, more than anybody, know what the position is.  The fact that none of us in this room is childish enough to expect them to do so is a recognition of the lack of principle for which the members of that organisation are famous.</P>
    <P>I look on these people as just what they are, Irish people in jail for whom there is a genuine concern about their convictions. They are Irish people, even though they are probably not just at this moment citizens in the sense of having Irish passports.  As far as I am concerned, the fact that they were born in the Six Counties qualifies them for the full concern of the Irish Government.  I think the Irish Government are quite right to be expressing that concern and doing what they can to bring about a re-examination <Col N="2299" /> of their case.  Secondly, the fact that their conviction is largely based on confessions &mdash; confessions which allegedly were wrung out of them as a result of violence &mdash;gives me a problem with regard to their conviction straightaway.  I am on record, and I take this opportunity of repeating, that I think convictions based on confessions got with or without violence, but after prolonged questioning in conditions of oppression are worse than useless, even if they are genuine, even if they are true, and they reflect less credit on the society which extracts those confessions than no confessions at all.</P>
    <P>I note that the Government have been expressing concern in this matter and I think their attitude is right.  I could imagine no more unhelpful approach than the approach of Senator Brendan Ryan in this matter.  It is not necessary for the Irish Government to say whether these people are innocent or guilty.  It is not necessary for the British Home Secretary to arrive at that conclusion before taking the steps which we all hope he will decide to take.  The more we put it up to anybody to definitively decide whether these people are guilty or innocent, the less the likelihood is that they will get out of prison.  That was the most irresponsible portion of an address that I have heard in the civil rights area from Senator Brendan Ryan.  It is only necessary for the Irish Government to come to the conclusion that there is a reasonable case to be answered that they were wrongly convicted.  That is all that is necessary for the British Home Secretary, too.  But if we raise the level of expectation with regard to the conclusions of the Irish Government to the extent that they must decide before they go any further whether these men are really innocent and we convey that feeling to the United Kingdom Government, by doing so we are inviting the Government not to take the action which we want them to take.  It is not necessary for anybody who wants this case to be reviewed to arrive at a definitive decision as to whether these people are guilty.  It is not even necessary for the judges, who, <Col N="2300" /> I hope will eventually consider the case, to arrive at that conclusion.  It would be quite sufficient if they arrive at the conclusion that they were wrongly convicted. Anybody who thinks that a British Home Secretary will be encouraged to refer these matters to the court of appeal on the basis and in the threat that by doing so he is going to expose members of the police force to all types of accusations, is attacking this problem in a most childish and unrealistic way, and in a way that is most unhelpful to those people we are all trying to assist in their difficulty.</P>
    <P>I hope the Irish Government do not raise this matter in the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  It is not a matter for the Anglo-Irish Conference.  It is a matter we can raise on a bilateral Government to Government basis and it is right and proper that this should be done.  We should not be using the Anglo-Irish Conference, which has a specific job to do.  We should not be diverting it into areas in respect of events which happen on the mainland of Britain.  I do not think that is the purpose of the conference.  It has other very serious purposes.  We are an independent country and we are entitled to make representations without hanging our hat to any Anglo-Irish Conference. I note that the Government are doing that.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is reason to be genuinely concerned about these convictions.  Because of that I think it is appropriate for the Government to continue vigorously to press the United Kingdom Government to refer the matter to the judicial authorities.  That is the most constructive approach we can adopt.  By doing this and not arriving at half-baked and ill-conceived conclusions based on hearsay, and by confining ourselves to raising serious doubts, we are doing the best we can at present, because this matter can always be looked at again.  We are doing the best we can at this time to try to ensure that these matters are reexamined in accordance with the judicial process of the country in which these people were living and the country in which they were convicted.  Our interest must recognise the fact that they are <Col N="2301" /> Irish.  That is our concern.  I would have concern even if they were English people and had nothing to do with the IRA, even if they had nothing to with an Irish crime, if you like.  I recognise that at Government level the fact that this is an Irish related problem and that these are Irish people gives the Government a special stamp of authority in bringing the matter to their attention.  For that reason, and only for that reason, I hope the Government continue in their worthwhile efforts to have this matter resolved.</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to support this motion which has received agreement from all parties in the House. Many speakers have outlined the facts as we see them.  I agree this is an unbelievable position.  Confessions were taken after serious beatings and since no fingerprint evidence was produced in court it leads us to question the wisdom of that trial.  Many speakers have said that because of the pressure at the time of public opinion these men were probably the scapegoats.  I support the all-party delegation who are to travel to Westminster next month.  As Senator O'Leary said, there is a reasonable case to be answered as to whether these men are guilty.  It is up to the British court system to prove this matter beyond all doubt.  Twelve years is a very long time for one person but 12 years is an enormous amount of time when it is for six men.</P>

      <P>I will be brief, but nobody should take that as indicating any lack of attention to the subject.  I can be brief because I find myself very largely in agreement with what Senators from different sides of the House have been saying.  I commend Senator Smith for tabling this motion, his party colleagues, Senator Cassidy and Senator Ryan for their contributions, and the contributions of Senator O'Mahony and Senator O'Leary.  With none of what they said did I find myself in disagreement.</P>

      <P>Of course. Senator Eoin Ryan was responsible, helpful and constructive in his contribution. Senator Brendan Ryan was ill-informed and unhelpful to the extent that his contribution must be damaging to those six men involved.</P>
      <P>I said I can be brief and for this reason. The issue that arises now is a net issue. Six people have been convicted of the largest mass murder in British history. Doubts have been expressed and cast about the correctness of those convictions, and the question is now whether it is appropriate that the legal remedies available within the British system should come into play and specifically whether it is now appropriate for the Home Secretary to exercise his powers to refer the cases back to the Court of Appeal.  I am satisfied entirely that sufficient doubt has been cast on the convictions to warrant the intervention of the Home Secretary.</P>
      <P>I do not know that it is really necessary for me to review in any detail the facts of the case because Senators have dealt with them.  In so far as some Senators concentrated on forensic and some on confessions, it is worth putting the picture in the round, as it were, and summarising the case against the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case against the six men rested on those two matters, confessions and forensic evidence, and both of those elements have given rise to grave doubt about their reliability.  I share those doubts and the Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, has said in the Dáil that he too shares them.  Let me reiterate what Senator O'Leary made clear, that what is at issue at this stage is not any individual's belief in guilt or innocence, nor was that <Col N="2303" /> ever the issue.  The question originally was whether the six who stood accused could be convicted beyond reasonable doubt.  The question that arises now is whether sufficient doubt has been raised for the Home Secretary to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, and if the Court of Appeal are then asked to reconsider the matter the question they have to consider is whether it was open to the Court of First Instance to form the view that beyond reasonable doubt these men were guilty.  On the basis of the present state of my knowledge I believe it is appropriate that the Home Secretary should review the case and refer the matter again to the Court of Appeal. That that is the Government's view has been made clear personally by the Minister, Deputy Barry, to the Home Secretary.</P>
    <P>Why that view?  Because serious doubt has been cast on the reliability of the confessions and the forensic evidence.  In regard to the confessions, doubt arises from the fact that when on the train&mdash; as Senator Smith mentioned &mdash; five of the men were playing cards.  The relevance of this is that when tested by Doctor Frank Skuse, the forensic scientist employed by the Home Office, he used the so-called Greiss test for nitrates.  Then two of the accused, Patrick Hill and William Power, tested positively.  Robert Hunter and Noel McIlhenny tested negatively and one accused's, John Walker's, test was not conclusive either way.</P>
    <P>The concern arises from the fact that evidence has now been adduced to show that someone who has handled playing cards for even a brief time can test positively. Evidence has now emerged that the Greiss test for nitrates can give positive results with a wide variety of substances, including leatherette and nitrocellulose.  Also of relevance is the fact that positive results can be obtained from certain paints because some of the accused had a background in the painting and decorating area.  Thus the doubts on the forensic testing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the confessions that <Col N="2304" /> were obtained, the undisputed fact is that when in Winson Green Prison in Birmingham the six were assaulted.  There has never been any controversy or doubt about that assault.  There was at one time an argument about who perpetrated the assault, but that the six men were seriously assaulted in Winson Green Prison was clear.  That fact had the effect of rendering it more difficult for the defence to establish the existence of a beating prior to the confession.  They could establish that the accused had been beaten but they were not in a position to establish at what time the beating had taken place and in particular whether the beating had taken place so early as to influence the confessions.  It might be said fairly that if it was established that beatings take place it must raise some doubt at the minimum as to whether the confessions were affected.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on both the grounds on which the convictions were obtained, the forensics and the confessions, serious doubts exist.  Since the conviction of these men the Embassy in London has been involved in relation to the conditions in which they were obtained.  One Senator referred to the fact that an improvement has taken place there, and that is to be welcomed.  However, there remains the central question whether there is a need to have a second look at the conviction. It seems at this stage, following the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme, following the recent publication and the various interventions that have taken place over the years from people of standing whose opinions are to be respected, that, indeed, sufficient doubts have been cast in order for the matter now to go back to the Court of Appeal.  It is my earnest wish that that would happen as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>For our part we will continue to do everything possible.  We welcome the fact that this delegation are going to London. The Department will co-operate with them and facilitate them in every way in connection with their visit.  I am pleased that this debate has taken place here this evening and that there has been such a <Col N="2305" /> degree of interest.  The numbers attending and participating in the debate are perhaps greater than one would have expected at this time of the evening on the eve of a recess, and that reflects the degree of public concern that exists and the degree of concern that exists within the House.</P>
    <P>I notice Senator O'Leary's reluctance to rely on any statements in regard to the matter made by the IRA, and I agree with that view.  I am sure many Senators in this House will do so too, recalling the fact that when a former Member of this House was murdered by the IRA, the IRA thought it appropriate while denying responsibility to send a mass card and a wreath.  An organisation capable of that kind of conduct scarcely deserve marks for credence and credibility.</P>
    <P>Their statements aside, on the two essential matters on which the original convictions were based serious doubts now exist.  The Home Secretary has power under the legislation to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal and it seems that it is an appropriate case in which he should do that and we will continue to do what we can to assist that course of action.</P>
