      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order.  Agreement has been reached that we should complete all Stages of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985.  Agreement has also been reached that we should complete the Second Stage of the National Lotteries Bill, 1986 and the Second Stage of the Malicious Injuries Bill, 1986.  We have agreed that these three items will be completed in that format today.  I am not sure how long it will take the House to complete them.  We cannot decide on finishing time although we would normally finish at 5 p.m.  In view of the doubt about how long it will take, I am not proposing a lunch or tea break until we see how we are proceeding.  A decision can be made by the House later.  If we make good progress on the first two items it would be appropriate to have a lunch break.  I will leave it to the House to decide when we see how we go.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I am not speaking from a desire for publicity.  Item No. 21 reads:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Third Report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries: Apartheid and Development in Southern Africa.</P>
    <P>It would be a matter of general regret if we were to adjourn for the summer without some possibility of statements from the four groups in the House on the appalling situation which has developed in South Africa over the past few weeks. Would the Leader of the House consider whether it would be possible to have at least statements from the four groups in the House?  Perhaps we could have them on Tuesday or Wednesday next.  Statements of perhaps 15 minutes in length might suffice.  Many Members of the House would like to record their feelings about the situation in South Africa.  We will not have an opportunity to do so for two and a half months.  Would it be possible to have a brief statement on motion No. 21 before we adjourn for the summer?</P>

      <P>With particular reference to the point raised by Senator B. Ryan, in a winding up debate last night on the multilateral aid, Senator Lanigan referred to this point, as did Senator McGuinness, other Senators and myself. It is a pity we were dealing in isolation with an item dealing with aid to Africa with just a passing reference to apartheid. We all expressed concern.  We would like to have an opportunity to discuss this report.  I would be in favour of the method suggested.  I will try to get agreement over the weekend to facilitate the suggestions made.  It is becoming a matter of crisis for all of us, both as a matter of conscience and politically.  It is appropriate that the House should express an opinion on this subject.  We will reach some agreement and I am sure the House agrees with the suggestion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 6 and 7, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) In this section &lsquo;properly prepared&rsquo; in relation to accounts shall mean that the accounts in question are consistent with the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act.  Any summary of or omission from the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act necessary for the purposes of conforming with the formats for accounts prepared pursuant to sections 10 to 12 of this Act shall not mean that the accounts in question are not properly prepared.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the opportunity of the Report Stage to reintroduce the amendment which I withdrew on Committee Stage dealing with the problems associated with the implementation of this very fine measure.  Specifically, section 18 of the Bill as it is before us makes provision with regard to certain steps to be taken by a company.  It is proposed to deliver to the Registrar of Companies amended accounts under sections 10 and 12 of the Bill on the basis that they are either small or medium sized companies.  During the discussions in the House on the last day I put it to the Minister &mdash; which was unfair without notice &mdash; that various problems arise out of that.  Since that time I know the Minister has had discussions with a number of people who appreciated that a lot of problems are being sorted out by discussion. I myself have also had discussions with people who are concerned with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is framed on an assumption.  It is necessary to explain what that assumption is in order to make sense of the amendment.  It may be that my assumption is incorrect.  I think my <Col N="1774" /> assumption is the most correct interpretation of the Bill as we propose to enact it.  I acknowledge that it is not the intention of the Bill to have interpretations which, I think, will come apart as a result of legislation.  There is a problem relative to this matter.  I should explain that there is an obligation under the Companies Act on every company to produce a set of accounts for the benefit or the shareholders. It must be a full set of accounts. Various regulations must be followed. The Senators will all be familiar with them.  That obligation applies to every company.  What does not apply to every company, but only to public companies is that the public companies must file a copy of the accounts in the Companies Registration Office.  Most of the companies in this country are private companies and they do not have to do that. Only the public companies have to do it. The purpose of this, which is the implementation of the appropriate directive, is to change that position.  Every company will be under an obligation to produce accounts.  Some companies will be able to file abridged accounts.  With small companies there will be no change.  They will still have to publish in the normal way and conform with the format in the Act.  No problem arises with regard to small and medium-sized companies.</P>
    <P>Within the Bill as proposed, section 3 re-enacts the obligation on a company to produce and set the accounts before the annual general meeting.  Under the Companies Act 1963 there is an obligation to produce accounts.  Now there will be an obligation under the Companies (Amendment) Bill.  Section 3 reads:</P>
    <P>(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, every balance sheet and profit and loss account of a company laid before an annual general meeting.</P>
    <P>This specifically discusses the balance sheet laid before the annual general meeting of the company.  They might have other accounts.  There is a special kind of account to be laid before the annual general meeting.  Nowhere does it state that the obligation to produce a full set of accounts is being done away with. <Col N="1775" /> Nowhere does it state that if an abridged balance sheet is drawn up that that fulfils the requirements of section 3.  It should state that if that is what it means.  It is quite clear that is what is actually meant to happen.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that section 10 specifies the exemptions which may be availed of by companies. The exemptions in question relate both to the preparation of the accounts for shareholders and the publication of accounts through lodgement with the Companies Registration Office.  Nowhere in section 10 does it say that it relates to the preparation of accounts for shareholders.  I did not take too much notice of the explanatory memorandum because I read the Bill.  I assume that the correct interpretation is that a company which will avail of the small reliefs provision is always under and obligation to prepare a full set of accounts for the information of shareholders.  It appears from the memorandum and from discussions which have taken place outside the House that this is not the Minister's interpretation. The Minister might well be right.  I hope I am wrong.  What I am saying is that I am not so aware that this is clearly stated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My amendment makes no sense unless one understands that that was my interpretation &mdash; that a small company had to do two things: they had to prepare a full set of accounts under section 3 and prepare a full set of accounts for lodgement with the company office.  I am anxious that the Minister would give his views on that aspect.  If my interpretation is wrong then my amendment does not make much sense.  If there is only one set of accounts they must give a true and fair view.</P>
    <P>If the Bill provides for what I think it provides there is an obligation on a small company to produce a full set of accounts for its own use and an abridged set for use in the companies office and my amendment slots into that position.  As I explained last week abridged accounts cannot give a true and fair view.  My amendment states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> ...in relation to accounts shall mean that the accounts in question are consistent with the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act.</P>
    <P>I have assumed that section 3 accounts must be prepared.  The amendment continues:</P>
    <P>Any summary of or omission from the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act necessary for the purposes of conforming with the formats for accounts prepared pursuant to sections 10 to 12 of this Act shall not mean that the accounts in question are not properly prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary's amendment gives me an opportunity to clarify a number of points.  I shall deal directly with the amendment and state my position in relation to it.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with section 18(4).  It refers specifically to the duties of auditors when the directors of a company wish to avail of the provisions of sections 10 to 12, that is, where a company wishes to benefit from the exemptions specified in sections 10 to 12 the auditor has two specific duties under section 18(4).  Those duties are quite clear and simple.  Subsection (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...it shall be the duty of the auditors of the company to provide the directors <Col N="1777" /> of the company with a report in writing stating that, in the opinion of the auditors of the company, the directors of the company are entitled to annex those accounts to the annual return...</P>
    <P>In other words, where a company wish to be defined as a small company and are availing of the exemptions in sections 10 to 12 the first duty of the auditor shall be to provide a report in writing that the company is entitled to avail of the exemptions.  The second duty of the auditor is that he must give a report in writing stating that in the opinion of the auditor the accounts so annexed are properly prepared as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>The second obligation on the auditors is the subject of the amendment put down by Senators O'Leary and Cregan and put down initially by Senator O'Leary on Committee Stage.  It has also been the subject of a meeting I had with the consultative committee of the accounting bodies, who expressed concern about the phrase &ldquo;properly prepared as aforesaid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the wording of subsection (4) is quite clear and does not need to be amended.  If an amendment on the lines submitted by Senator O'Leary were to be adopted it would possibly cause confusion.  It could also raise problems of a legal nature.  The words &ldquo;properly prepared as aforesaid&rdquo;, merely state that the abridged accounts &mdash; for a small company the abridged balance sheet or for a medium company the abridged profit and loss account and balance sheet &mdash; have been prepared in accordance with the entitlements under sections 10 to 12. It does not impute any qualitative judgment on the account.  The auditors' report in this regard merely states that the accounts have been properly prepared as aforesaid.  In other words, that they have been properly prepared in an abridged form as allowed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The abridged versions of accounts and balance sheets for small companies must at all times give a true and fair view of matters in the company.  In relation to the balance sheet the true and fair view <Col N="1778" /> required by section 3 follows throughout the Bill.  There is no mechanism whereby any accounts filed in the Office of the Registrar can do anything other than reflect a true and fair view of the company whether those accounts are in an abridged or in a comprehensive form. There is no getting away from the concept of a true and fair view.  Otherwise, the Bill would become valueless.  If the Bill did not have the philosophy of a true and fair view running through it we would not achieve what we set out to achieve.  If it is necessary in order to achieve that true and fair view, that notes would have to be submitted that will have to be done.</P>
    <P>The second matter I should like to comment on relates to whatever structures or rules an auditor may wish to put on an account.  This is dealt with in section 18 (3)(b) which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a copy of the report of the auditors under section 163 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In other words, an auditor has to certify the accounts under section 163 of the Principal Act.  It is there that whatever strictures the auditor has in relation to the qualitative aspect of the accounts are entered.  There are different certificates, the report under subsection (4) and the report of the auditors under section 163 of the Principal Act.  I am satisfied that the requirements of this Bill when it comes into force, will be of benefit to companies and auditors and will not impose any undue burden on them.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised a separate issue in relation to the rights of directors to draw up abridged balance sheets for small companies under section 10.  Section 10 (1) which refers to small companies states quite specifically:</P>
    <P>notwithstanding paragraph (a) of section 3(1) of this Act, but subject to paragraph (b) of the said section 3(1) the directors of a company treated as a small company pursuant to section 8 (1) of this Act may draw up an abridged balance sheet showing only those items preceded by letters or roman numbers in Formats 1 and 2 of the balance sheet <Col N="1779" /> formats set out in the Schedule to this Act:</P>
    <P>In other words, the directors may draw up an abridged balance sheet and submit it to the Companies Registration Office. They may draw up a full balance sheet or an abridged one for their shareholders but they still have to comply with the Principal Act.  They will also have to have their auditor's certificate, directors' report and notes for their shareholders. In all probability, small companies would have a more comprehensive set of accounts for shareholders.  What we are doing in section 10 is giving small companies the right to lodge abridged balance sheets, in other words, balance sheets showing only those items preceded by letters or roman numerals in formats 1 and 2 of the balance sheet formats set out in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling section which we are allowing small companies to avail of. They may draw up and lodge an abridged version of the balance sheet.  They will also have to report to their shareholders and may or may not draw up a more comprehensive set of accounts.  They are two different things.  We are facilitating small companies.  As I said in my Second Stage speech we are not anxious to put an undue burden on small companies.  I know Senator O'Leary accepts this concept. Whether the balance sheet is an abridged version or not it must still comply with the concept of giving a true and fair view of the company.  If in drawing up an abridged balance sheet notes will be required to achieve that end then notes will have to be produced.  One has to understand that there are certain obligations on directors and auditors and these obligations are being strengthened where companies wish to avail of sections 10 to 12.  Nevertheless running right through the Act is the principal philosophy that company accounts must at all times show a fair view of the company.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered all of Senator O'Leary's questions on this matter.  I will be glad to address any other points he wishes to make by way of questions if this is allowed under the procedure.</P>
    <Col N="1780" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for dealing with both of the matters I raised, using this amendment as an opportunity for doing so.  As the Minister will appreciate if my interpretation of sections 3 and 10 and the combined effect thereof is incorrect my amendment makes no sense at all.  I must however reiterate to the Minister the following: while section 10 allows a company to draw up an abridged balance sheet and subsequently allows them to file it in the company's office, it does not override the requirements of section 3(1) which quite clearly states:</P>
      <P>...every balance sheet and profit and loss account of a company laid before an annual general meeting of the company, pursuant to section 148 of the Principal Act, shall comply with the following requirements and section 149...</P>
      <P>That is the bedrock.  Section 10 in providing for what may be in the balance sheet allows an abridged balance sheet not to conform with subsection (1)(a) of section 3 but does not rule out the applicability of subsection (1).  That is important. While it rules out the applicability of (1)(a) it does not rule out the applicability of subsection (1).  Subsection (1), therefore, is not in any way subject to any restriction under section 10.  If I were a shareholder of a company and attended an annual general meeting of that company I would say, &ldquo;under section 3 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, you are under an obligation to provide a full balance sheet in accordance with sections 148 and 149 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  I am quite sure that what I am saying is correct.  However, I realise what the Minister has in mind but he should have a further look at it even after the legislation is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the substance of the amendment, the Minister has dealt with problems which arose, either here on Committee Stage or privately, about the obligations which are put on auditors. We could discuss them in detail.  For example, does their obligation precede the signing of the accounts?  Ultimately <Col N="1781" /> auditors are in a position to put pressure on companies in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am quite clear about what the Minister said in relation to &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; and that section 18(4) does not impute any qualitative certification in respect of that particular certification. &ldquo;Properly prepared&rdquo; cannot be looked at on its own.  It is properly prepared pursuant to sections 10 and 12.  These sections refer back to a true and fair view.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said.  If it is the intention that there should be only one set of accounts they should do everyone and my amendment makes no sense at all.  If my interpretation is correct there will be a residual obligation on a company to produce accounts under section 3.  In those circumstances my amendment or something similar would be a useful addition. Bearing in mind what the Minister has said and realising that the enactment of company legislation is an ongoing process and that further opportunities will be presented to us within the near future to have another look at this matter, I am happy to leave the matter at that and to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take note of what Senator O'Leary said and of his reservation in regard to director shareholders.  I understand it.  It is not my wish to support anything that would deprive shareholders of full disclosure of information particularly where there are minority shareholders and where accounts could be used to suppress the minority.  I do not want that situation to arise.  Senator O'Leary has made an interesting point.  I am not saying that it may not have validity.  We are allowing small companies to draw up an abridged balance sheet.  They may draw up an abridged balance sheet for submission under section 10, assuming that they comply with the criteria for a small company. They must also report to the shareholders and in doing so they may draw up an abridged balance sheet or they may draw up a full balance sheet.  They will also have to submit to the shareholders the directors' report as well as notes which must comply with this Bill when it <Col N="1782" /> becomes law and the various auditors' certificates.</P>
      <P>We are trying to lighten the burden on small companies but in doing so I should not like to see a situation where shareholders would be deprived of the right to disclosure.  Company law is an ongoing process and will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that abridged accounts will give shareholders the quality and quantity of information at present given under the 1963 Act.  I am satisfied that if there are any difficulties at a later stage &mdash; which I do not think there will &mdash; they can be corrected in a further Company Law Bill.  I take the point that the Senator has made but I am satisfied that the Bill in its present form will be of assistance to small companies.  It is not intended to put an undue burden on them nor is it intended that the Bill will mitigate the rights of shareholders or indeed obviate the responsibilities presently on directors to report fully to shareholders.  I am satisfied that the existing law is comprehensive and sufficient to attain that objective.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>

No one can assume tremendous knowledge in what is a complicated area and I do not wish to assume tremendous knowledge of it.  I hope that in giving effect, as we must, to the Fourth Company Law Directive we are complying with that directive and modernising our approach to companies. Hopefully this Bill will go some <Col N="1783" /> distance towards reducing the burden particularly on small companies.</P>

    <Title>National Lottery Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's undertaking to establish a national lottery first set out in their White Paper <i>Building on Reality</i> in October 1984.</P>
      <P>As I said in my speech to the Dáil, lotteries have a long history going back to the 15th century.  When it was discussed in the Dáil some Deputies suggested that the history went back beyond that but my research did not go back beyond the 15th century.  The establishment in Ireland of a national lottery is not, in international terms, a very unusual step. State lotteries exist today in over 80 countries. Among our partners in the European Communities, State or national lotteries are established in the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Spain and Portugal.  Britain, of course, has its football pools.  In the United States lotteries exist in some 22 states, including New York, New Jersey, Maryland and the District of Columbia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come to some specific aspects of the Bill I should like to outline the considerations which determined the general thrust and shape of the legislation. Public trust and confidence is of crucial importance in the operation of <Col N="1784" /> state lotteries.  Such trust can only be secured and held by comprehensive legislative provision which demonstrably protects the public interest and guards the integrity of a national lottery on behalf of prospective participants.  It is, accordingly, appropriate that the legislation should provide for the award by the Minister for Finance of a licence to operate the national lottery to a body in which he can be satisfied that the public interest can be safeguarded.  As the House is aware, after due consideration of the matter the Government decided to award a licence to operate the national lottery to a subsidiary of An Post.  The general enabling provision to award the licence is contained in section 3.</P>
    <P>A matter which may be of concern to Senators is the question of the purposes to which lottery surpluses are to be applied.  These were not specified in the Bill as circulated but in response to the debate in the Dáil I have decided upon an amendment to section 5, the relevant section of the Bill, which will be more specific as to the purposes for which lottery funds will be used.  These purposes, as already announced by the Government, are sport and recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts and health.  The needs of sport were very much to the fore in the Government's thinking when drawing up plans for the lottery.  I am convinced that we will see in due course substantial support from the lottery funds for projects in the sporting area.  A strong case has also been made for funding for the arts and national culture.  There have also been calls to support various other causes including those charitable and voluntary organisations which operate in the health area.  The areas identified by the Government to benefit from the national lottery a balance of deserving causes to be given assistance from the lottery.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, also be provision to extend the list of purposes should the Government so decide.  Any addition to the list of purposes to be contained in the Bill will have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Moreover, through the process of allocation of funds, the Dáil will have <Col N="1785" /> the opportunity to consider all the purposes for which the funds are used and the entire proceeds of the lottery will be accounted for in a completely visible manner.</P>
    <P>The legislation needs to allow for extension of the purposes in order to cater, for example, for arrangements which may become necessary in relation to existing charitable and voluntary lotteries when the national lottery becomes operational and also to allow the Government flexibility to meet other beneficial community purposes which may arise in future without having to amend the Act. There need, therefore, be no fears among Senators that lottery funds will be absorbed into general public expenditure purposes.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to the question of the impact of the national lottery on those existing lotteries operated by voluntary and charitable organisations.  The Government when announcing the national lottery indicated that consideration would be given to measures, including changes in the existing legislation governing prizes, designed to ensure that the activities of existing lotteries could continue.  The Minister for Finance, in his budget speech of 29 January 1986, reiterated that the Government's intention to ensure that the good work funded by existing charitable and other voluntary lotteries which operate nationally does not suffer as a result of the national lottery. Extensive discussions have taken place with those voluntary organisations, charities or umbrella groups that had earlier expressed disquiet at the possible adverse effects of the national lottery on their fund-raising.</P>
    <P>Specific measures are being provided in the Bill to help existing lotteries to compete.  Section 33 will enable the Minister for Justice to improve the prize limits at present specified in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 for lotteries operated under Garda permit or licence from the District Court and also will exempt such lotteries from the restrictions on advertising and publicity set out in section 22 of that Act.  As I informed the Dáil, the Minister for Justice has new prize <Col N="1786" /> limits of the order of £3,000 for lotteries under permit and £10,000 for lotteries under licence in contemplation.  I believe strongly that these measures will provide adequate opportunity to those bodies concerned to compete successfully with the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Only time will tell how, if at all, the national lottery will affect the situation of the bodies who hold existing periodical lotteries.  However, I have already given an assurance that where such bodies can demonstrate satisfactorily that the lottery has adversely affected their receipts, the Government are prepared to take steps to make funding available to them from the lottery's surplus.  To conclude on this aspect of the Bill, I regret to say that there appears to be some misunderstanding about the participation of charities or voluntary bodies in selling tickets for the national lottery.  Such participation would not be consistent with the intention to support, not to supplant, existing charitable fund-raising.  Moreover, the best technical advice indicates that sales outlets should be fixed retail business locations which will have to satisfy a number of criteria from a business and security point of view.</P>
    <P>Coming to the specific provisions of the Bill, there are largely self-explantory; an Explanatory Memorandum has also been provided so I propose to refer only to a few specific provisions in any detail.</P>
    <P>In addition to my proposals on section 5, I might mention at this stage that a number of amendments covering minor drafting and presentational aspects of the Bill as circulated have been dealt with during its passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the total value of the prizes to be distributed by the national lottery must not be less than 40 per cent of the total amount received in respect of national lottery ticket sales in any financial year of the authorised company.  I would point out that this is a minimum and the amount returned in prizes could be more.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is an important provision of the Bill.  It provides for the appointment by the Minister of an independent scrutineer <Col N="1787" /> who will examine on the Minister's behalf the operation of the national lottery in order to ensure its integrity and to guard against fraud.  The scrutineer is not intended as a substitute for or aide to the auditor who will in the normal course under the Companies Acts audit the balance sheet and accounts of the authorised company.  His function will be to act as the Minister's and the community's watchdog over the operation of the national lottery to ensure its correct and proper functioning.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the appointment by the authorised company of ticket sales agents on such terms as the company may determine with the consent of the Minister.  Lottery tickets may be sold only by the company or by its sales agents and may not be sold to anyone under the age of eighteen years.  The purchase of tickets on behalf of those under eighteen years, for example as presents, is not however to be prohibited.  Section 7 also makes it an offence for certain categories of person, for example, directors or employees of the authorised company, to own a national lottery ticket.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment under the Minister's management and control of a national lottery fund at the Central Bank.  All lottery receipts, with the exception of sales agents' commission and any &ldquo;instant&rdquo; prizes payable in any lottery game at point of sale, will be paid into the fund from which the authorised company's remuneration and operating expenses will be paid.  Prize moneys will also be paid periodically <i>en bloc</i> from the fund to the company for distribution.  Surplus moneys in the fund are to be remitted at least annually to the Central Fund.  Section 9 provides for payment of remuneration due to the licensee from the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that the number of directors of the authorised company shall be seven including the chairman and sets out their mode of appointment.  The Government envisage that An Post will nominate four of the seven directors of the subsidiary company, including the <Col N="1788" /> chairman, with the consent of the Minister, who will nominate the remaining three directors.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to refer in detail to the remaining relatively standard provisions such as those regarding memorandum and articles of association, share holdings, accounting and financial arrangements. I might mention the following sections as of particular note:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that a scheme of rules in respect of each lottery game in the national lottery must be prepared by the authorised company for approval by the Minister.  Only those games in respect of which such a scheme has been provided by the company and approved by the Minister can be operated by the company.</P>
    <P>Section 29 enables the Minister to issue such directions as he considers necessary or expedient in the public interest to the authorised company.  Section 30 as well as giving the Minister certain powers of share acquisition provides for the appointment by the Minister if he so thinks fit at any time of a manager who would, in terms of the section, take over the management of the authorised company as a going concern.</P>
    <P>Section 31 confines the use of the names &ldquo;National Lottery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irish National Lottery&rdquo; to the Minister, the licensee, the authorised company or a person so authorised by any of these.  A person who uses these terms unlawfully will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 32 exempts the national lottery from the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1979.</P>
    <P>Section 33 authorises the Minister for Justice to amend by regulations sections 27 and 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 by altering the prize limits specified in subsections (2) (b) and (4) of section 27 and subsection (2) (c) of section 28 of that Act.  Lotteries held pursuant to sections 27 and 28 are also exempted from the provisions of section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 in relation to advertising.</P>
    <P>With particular regard to the latter measures I have mentioned, the Government believe that these measures will <Col N="1789" /> enable the lotteries in question to operate successfully after the start of the national lottery.  It is not of course the Government's intention that the national lottery should supplant or replace the present fund-raising activities of voluntary and charitable bodies.  The loyalty of subscribers and participants in existing permitted or licensed lotteries will ensure that these are still a substantial source of funding for the voluntary and charitable organisations concerned.  I believe that the start of the national lottery will in no way diminish this loyalty, which is rooted in a deep appreciation of the excellent work which charitable and voluntary bodies undertake in our community.</P>
    <P>In the event that, despite these measures, it can be shown that the net income to charitable and voluntary bodies from the lotteries they operate has declined as a direct consequence of the activities of the national lottery, I have given an assurance in the Dáil that the Government will be sympathetic to their situation in deciding on the allocation of the national lottery's proceeds.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by commending this Bill to the House and assuring Senators that the Government's wish is to see the beneficial causes which have been identified begin to benefit as soon as possible from the national lottery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal way I would like very much to be able to give a welcome to this Bill.  As the Minister said, a number of countries over many centuries have had lotteries.  All parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas have from time to time lauded the notion.  My difficulty, and it is shared by quite a number of individual commentators on this Bill since it was introduced, is to decide whether or not the moneys which will come into the Exchequer arising from this lottery will be disbursed in the areas where they are greatly needed.  I realise that in the Dáil, the Minister did pull back at least somewhat from his original position, which certainly appeared to all of us to be going to suck these funds directly into the Exchequer without committing <Col N="1790" /> himself as to where the expenditure would eventually lie.</P>
      <P>Section 5 says:</P>
      <P>the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and</P>
      <P>(b) such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had confined himself to paragraph (a) he would have received fairly broad acceptance but once paragraph (b) is included there seems to be a number of other possibilities.  The Minister will argue that it gives him power to deal with situations which could not now be envisaged.  But it is far too comprehensive, too open, too vague, to be acceptable by this House.  Remember, we have very grave and great competing considerations for funds of this kind.  I think of people on the margin of society and organisations in this city and in other parts of the country who have failed to convince the Minister for Health of the need for the provision of shelter and overnight accommodation for people in desperate need.  We have failed here: members of the Eastern Health Board have failed to convince that board and the Minister for Health of the necessity to provide funds for matters of that seriousness.  I have witnessed the Department of Finance, over years, failing to support essential schemes where the EC was prepared to provide £1 for every £1 we expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the background of that experience, and with the looseness in section 5 I find it very difficult to accept from the Minister that the surplus funds which will come out of this lottery will go directly into these areas.  I remain unconvinced that this Bill, when it is introduced, will be sufficient to ensure that the interests of the charitable organisations, those <Col N="1791" /> groups in our society who do such laudable work &mdash; unpaid for their efforts on behalf of the handicapped and the poor in our society &mdash; will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>When mention of a lottery first came up most people thought in terms of sport. Because of our very young population and the necessity for people to lead active lives up to the end if possible, the provision of sports facilities is very essential. But I am not one who would argue that all the funds should go in that direction. It is quite clear that there are other very major competing considerations.  I have mentioned the charitable organisations and the question of our arts.  In recent years there has been a happy and welcome development in relation to the growth of historical societies, the building of heritage centres and the awakening of an interest in our population in our history and in the protection of the environment, of architectural buildings and matters of this kind.  In so far as it is possible &mdash; we will never have enough money for all of those considerations &mdash; it is important to give those causes sufficient funds.  The Minister, in paragraph (a) has tried to cover this aspect of it.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The greatest contribution the Minister could make would be to be far more specific.  In his statement to this House, he said:</P>
    <P>Such trust can only be secured and held by comprehensive legislative provision which demonstrably protects the public interest and guards the integrity of a National Lottery on behalf of prospective participants.  It is, accordingly, appropriate that the legislation should provide for the award by the Minister for Finance, of a licence to operate the National Lottery to a body in which he can be satisfied that the public interest can be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I believe that all of that is very good. But the Minister is undermining his own statement by not &ldquo;coming clean&rdquo; as to how this lottery will operate.  We have had representations from groups, charitable organisations and others who feel <Col N="1792" /> that their interests will not be safeguarded. But the central question is not that.  It is: is the Minister going to use this lottery as a means to supplement Exchequer funds, without having regard to the needs which we would suggest should be covered by it?  We would agree &mdash; there is no way around it &mdash; that there is no surplus money: if we were to pay our debts we would not have a penny. Our problem, in that climate and bearing in mind the considerations I have already mentioned and the experiences we have had up to now, is how the Minister is able to convince the officials in the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance that the surplus funds from this lottery should be totally available for the specific purposes which have been outlined.  There is practically no previous experience on which any one of us can rely on to indicate that that is what will actually happen.  As far as we are concerned we would be very anxious to support the lottery and ensure that the funds which derive from it are used exclusively for the purposes which have been laid down.  If we could be satisfied on that count the Bill would have our full and total support.  It is the key question which, I consider, has remained unanswered.</P>
    <P>I would therefore conclude by asking the Minister, if he wants to gain the trust which he mentions in his Second Stage speech, where he was asking the people to trust him that this will be what he purports it to be, to give it that additional strength by making a categorical statement to this House that none of the surplus funds, after the prizes have been paid for in the lottery, will be sucked into the Exchequer under the control of the Department of Finance, but that they will be specified, spent on and go directly into the areas covered in section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving my full support to the concept of a national lottery, I welcome the fact that the Bill has eventually been put into legislative form and is before us for debate in this House.  It is a matter on which our party, in particular, had many views to express as regards <Col N="1793" /> the desirability of this type of funding for specific projects.  It is fair to say that in the preparation of the National Programme for Government, <i>Building on Reality,</i> when this concept came about, I was satisfied that our party had a major input in ensuring that legislation enabling this lottery to be set up would be introduced in the lifetime of this Government.  It is because of that that I particularly welcome the Bill as amended.  Initially, when the Bill came before the other House, there were certain sections about which we in the Labour Party in particular, had reservations. I want to thank the Minister for the removal of some of the sections which were worrying to members of our party. I am glad that the old section 15, which was in the original Bill, has now been removed.  That section gave statutory control of wages but now the normal, accepted right of free collective bargaining is allowed to operate in the area of remuneration of people involved in the running of this lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, our party were also aware that other governments throughout Europe, in America and elsewhere, have had the concept of a national lottery built into their budgeting arrangements over many years.  These lotteries operated quite successfully.  It was always a matter of mystery to us &mdash; particularly those of us who are members of local authorities &mdash; that we were always precluded from initiating the concept of a lottery to help to pay our way because the Irish people, by their very nature, enjoy &ldquo;a flutter&rdquo;.  They are not compulsive gamblers but they enjoy a bet.  If that enjoyment can be linked to specific projects which will be of benefit to the community, then a dual purpose will have been fulfilled.  The Prize Bond Scheme, which is not a lottery as such, and there is no gamble involved in it, has been extremely successful.  An extraordinary amount of money has been invested by people in that scheme because they have the opportunity to win a prize which is tax free.  I feel that the extension of that concept into a national lottery will have even better spin-off effects.  The new <Col N="1794" /> section 5 specifically determines that the moneys shall be applied for the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts, within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951 and the health of the community and any other purpose the Government may from time to time determine.  All of us want to ensure that funds would be available to a much greater extent for sport of all descriptions than has been the case in the past.  There are Senators here with a specific interest in sport and they will be making a case specifically for that, I am sure.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the amount of money we have been able to allocate to sport and the promotion of sport has been negligible.  It always amazed me that despite very little State support by way of assistance for training, facilities and recreation we have managed to produce some of the best sportsmen in the world and some of the best sporting teams in the world.  Everybody welcomed the concept of a lottery which would channel more money into the particular area which would do our country credit abroad and at Olympic games and benefit our national sport also.  I am satisfied that that is the cardinal purpose of setting up this lottery.  It is accepted by most people that that is what it is about.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of our culture, our heritage, including the language. I am thinking particularly about organisations promoting Irish music and culture which have had difficulties with the existing allocations that they get from the Arts Council.  That body have been subjected to severe and critical analysis of their role and their functions and have suffered from a lack of finance from Government agencies.  I felt they were entitled to funds.  We had facilitated them in the past through the Funds of Suitors Act and through other non-statutory means.  It is important when we are legislating here, to give them a slice of this cake as well.  Nobody will object to that <Col N="1795" /> and many would welcome it.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure in what area health will benefit from this fund, whether it is in the area of advice or care.  It is important that the Minister in his reply would be as explicit as possible as to how the various purposes which have been listed here will be allocated funds.  I know how the money will be spent, it is a matter for an order laid before the Dáil, subject to Dáil scrutiny.  Do I take it from the Minister that each Department which will be distributing the money under their jurisdiction will have a specific subhead written into their Estimates which will come before the Dáil for discussion but, will not come before this House as we have no input into a budget or departmental Estimates?  It would have been useful if this House also had an opportunity for discussing how the money which will be collected will be spent.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is doubt in people's minds, particularly in the mind of the Opposition about how the money will be spent because in order to be successful the lottery must have the confidence of the people.  If the electorate, as I will refer to them, consider that any Government will absorb some of the funds of this lottery into the normal day-to-day running of the affairs of State, the lottery is doomed to failure from the beginning.  I hope that the discussion of the Bill in this House any doubts that might exist about how the money will be dispensed will be completely dissipated and every assurance humanly possible will be given so that we will start with a clean slate and the people will realise that if they support the lottery, they can get a certain amount of pleasure out of doing so with the possibility of winning prize money amounting to at least 40 per cent of the intake.  To ensure that the intake is good enough will require the fullest support of the people and that can only be secured by reassurances from the Government that at no time will money be used by Departments for the normal day-to-day running of their Departments. If that assurance can be given we can be assured of a successful lottery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> I would like to deal briefly with the various submissions that were made to all Members of the House from existing voluntary agencies who depend on their livelihood and depend on the success of their enterprises, on lotteries, draws, raffles or anything else.  This arises in the case of the very smallest clubs in our parishes and the national voluntary organisations which were dependent in the past on the generosity of the Irish people.  I honestly do not feel that a national lottery will interfere at all with them.  They are immediately successful because people know exactly what they are contributing to and they know that by buying a ticket for a draw for any voluntary organisation the money being collected, apart from the commission or the handling fee, goes directly to the benefit of the charity or other cause.  The Irish Hospital Sweepstakes has been dramatically successful over the years basically because people felt that in some way they were helping the construction of hospitals or the hospitals programme. Dr. Noel Browne when he was Minister for Health was successful in ensuring that the Hospital Sweepstakes was widely subscribed to by people throughout the world and was associated with the racing industry.  People subscribed to it because it benefited hospitals, and they had a chance of winning the sweep.  The Hospitals Sweepstakes was so great that there was a certain amount of mystique about it.  I would be sorry to feel that anything we are doing now would interfere with that concern and I sincerely hope that they will continue with their project although they have intimated that they will not.  I hope they will because I can see a national lottery as completely distinct and separate from anything that has been run in the past.  In every other country in Europe where a lottery is run, as far as I am aware it is run successfully.</P>
    <P>It is important that the outlets that the Minister has referred to are accessible and readily available because if one sees an outlet and if one has £1 or £2 for a &ldquo;flutter&rdquo; and it is for a good cause, that is the time to have it.  Otherwise, the Irish punter, as we would call him in the past, <Col N="1797" /> would have access to only a limited area in this regard.  Again, the deposits made very rarely come back into society as a whole and certainly not into the area of sport, art, culture or health.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might clarify for us his idea of how the allocations would be made in the area of health because of the problems that health boards are faced with in their budget restrictions. One would want to ensure that the national lottery would not be used to take up the slack in health boards.  Certainly we would agree and commend the idea of subscribing to the Health Advisory Council or the Health Education Bureau because that could be of benefit to the people as a whole and could be linked to sport and recreation and other facilities which would be to the benefit of the nation as a whole.  It would reduce the cost on institutional health care afterwards. With those comments I welcome the concept of a national lottery.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the fact that An Post have been chosen by the Government as the authority they consider would have the greatest success in the area of sales and distribution and of the actual operation of the lottery.  They have shown in recent times some imaginative ideas.  I am satisfied that they will be capable of doing the job that the Houses of the Oireachtas will be placing on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>It is important, too, to ensure that we do not legislate for An Post in this regard. This allows us the opportunity to review the process of how the lottery is worked. A time might arise when An Post might feel that it was a burden on them in some way and within the restrictions that might be placed on them as a semi-State company, decide some other agency should take on the job.  By legislating for the type of organisation we want without naming them there, we are allowing ourselves a certain flexibility in the future to make any changes that might be necessary.  In the meantime, it is important that we all know that in the initial stages at least An Post will be the agency involved.  I am <Col N="1798" /> confident that they will be successful.</P>
    <P>A figure of £20 million per annum has been mentioned as the amount that may accrue from this lottery.  I have no doubt that Ireland will be a better and healthier country as a result of the benefits to sporting and recreational organisations of the proceeds from the lottery.  I fully support the Bill and I hope the House will, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to do the puritan but I think certain issues have not been addressed in the period since the proposal to introduce a national lottery. There are certain proposals which have been floating around for a long time and emanated from local authorities on occasions. Somewhere around £50 million is going to be generated in revenue which is going to work out, as Senator Ferris said, at around £20 million which is about 40 per cent of £50 million.  Where is it going to come from?</P>
      <P>This country is awash with economists who will tell us that you cannot create money out of nothing.  If you are going to get £50 million from the Irish people, it is either going to come from surplus funds they have at their disposal, from a different choice of how to spend some of their current income or it is going to come by their biting deeper into what funds they have at the expense of one or the other of the necessities that they or their dependants may need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very few people in either House who would suggest that Irish people, by and large, have any surplus funds available to them.  I have not heard it said.  I tend to be in a minority of people in either House who actually believes that it is possible to generate greater revenues from taxation from different areas.  I would hasten to add that those groups and institutions I would identify as being capable of paying higher levels of taxation are most definitely not the sort who would be buying large numbers of tickets in a national lottery.  I would identify corporation tax, capital tax and other taxes.  We have to assume, therefore, that the ordinary citizen will be the one who will be buying these tickets.  What we are now being told is that the ordinary citizen <Col N="1799" /> who, according to what we have being hearing for the past five years, cannot possibly afford to pay any more tax is now going to voluntarily contribute at least £50 million a year.</P>
    <P>We have been told the reason he cannot pay any more tax is because he cannot afford it and because already people's living standards have been severely affected.  We cannot have it both ways.  If people are going to pay for a national lottery, the money is either coming out of what they cannot afford or it is going to be taken from something they are contributing to already.  For instance, it may well result in people deciding to spend money on this lottery rather than on funds they traditionally give to existing groups.  That is why some of the concerns of existing groups are legitimate.</P>
    <P>The pitiful plight of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes is one that comes to mind. I have enormous sympathy for the employees of that company, but far less for the group and one could almost say the family who have run that organisation for a considerable number of years and who, notwithstanding their pleas of poverty, have not yet impressed me that they have actually lost money out of the general business of running the sweeps for a considerable number of years.  I will not abuse my privilege by naming the family.  I do not think they have exactly gone poor or broke on the basis of their charitable impetus to run the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes.  I am sorry for the employees of that concern if they do lose their jobs though I am not particularly sorry to see the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes departing.</P>
    <P>There are many other voluntary organisations running greater or smaller lotteries who are quite rightfully worried that this new lottery will simply result in a transfer of funds from one hand to the other, funds which may or may not be recycled back to these bodies.  At the end of it all everybody will be working much harder to get their hands on the same funds &mdash; if that is to be the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> What I am concerned about is the alternative third possibility which is that we will end up spending more money out of people's very limited incomes on yet another inducement to spend money &mdash; the lottery.  It will be visible and will be easily accessible, it will not have any upper limit.  Its frequency of operation and the fact that it will presumably be a weekly draw is going to make it more tempting for people to spend far more money.</P>
    <P>At least the sweep had the advantage of being an infrequent event and, therefore, people did not have a riveting interest of a weekly lottery to concentrate their attention.  We are liable to end up with a transfer of resources from people who already cannot afford to maintain a reasonable living standard to areas which would be nice and proper and worthy of support but do not rate nearly as highly in my priorities as does the question of the basic standards of living of our deprived society.  On the basis of studies so far, it appears that many lower income group people, given the misery of their situation, tend to spend disproportionate amounts on alcohol and gambling.  That is apparently the case in respect of most household budgets, as surveys suggest. Not that these people would spend large sums in this way but they would spend proportionately large sums.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about is gambling, a form of gambling sponsored by the State.  We tend to brand our young people with terminology about sex and drugs and rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll.  For most of our society the two great abuses which devastate families are alcohol and gambling.  It is a fact of life in Irish society that alcohol and gambling can consume huge proportions of many families' incomes.  We do strike quite righteous moral poses about the abuses of alcohol and we are deeply concerned about it.  If somebody decided that the State should go on an advertising binge to encourage people to drink more because of the fact that it would generate masses of increased revenue, we would all work ourselves into paroxysms of moral indignation about how immoral that was. <Col N="1801" /> But we are launching into a national lottery &mdash; I do not want to strike a position of moral superiority &mdash; without any more than passing reference to the question of the fundamental morality of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>One of our flaws as legislators is that, when it comes to morality, we think it only applies to one area of life and that once we get beyond the area of human sexuality it is a bit soft or lily-livered or almost effeminate to suggest that there is a morality which operates in other places. There is something immoral about families being left penniless because the income earner in the family cannot control an impulse to drink or an impulse to gamble.  Therefore, when we as a society, choose to extend the opportunities for gambling we are taking decisions which have profound moral implications for society.  It has been reported &mdash; perhaps, the Minister could confirm this &mdash; that one State in Canada which had a national lottery has actually abandoned it because of the damage being done to lower income families.  The Minister can tell us if this is correct or not.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about legalised State gambling on the scale of people spending the equivalent of £1 million a week on a national lottery, we cannot just pretend that moral questions do not exist.  If I suggested that we should set up a legalised State brothel system, questions of morality would descend upon us like a shot.  Or if I suggested we set up legalised massage parlours, questions of morality would be presented on the spot.</P>
    <P>Gambling presents exactly the same moral questions.  I do not believe in the State imposing moral values on anybody. But I believe legislators have no right to ignore moral values when making decisions. I have a good record of being, perhaps, excessively liberal, in some people's eyes, on what are regarded as the proper areas for morality.  I have often suggested that we need to extend our perception of morality well beyond the traditional areas.  In that extension of perceptions of morality we are beginning to face up to the fact that alcohol and its <Col N="1802" /> use in society has moral overtones and moral implications.  It is about time, given our history as a gambling nation, that we faced up to the moral implications of gambling.  There is more to it than seeing that we are a nation of gamblers and trying to redistribute some of the money being spent on gambling into, perhaps, more deserving areas.</P>
    <P>For anybody who goes to race tracks frequently &mdash; I include myself in that &mdash; one of the more pathetic sights is the number of obviously close to penniless people who seem to be attracted there like bees to a honey pot to gamble what little money they have.  A body was set up called Gamblers Anonymous because it is a recognised fact that gambling is as addictive as alcohol.  Therefore, there are moral questions involved.  We should address these questions.  I am not going to say that I oppose a national lottery but there is a question of a profound and careful evaluation in the coming years of where the income for the national lottery is coming from, whether the national lottery is causing further addiction to gambling by greater numbers of people and consequential damage to women, children and to families.</P>
    <P>It ought to be part of this legislation to do a social evaluation on the impact of the national lottery.  It would be useful to require a small portion of the revenue to be recycled into evaluating who is buying national lottery tickets.  Is it being funded by a general contribution of about 50p a week per head of population, which would generate £50 million a year, or is it being funded by a small number of people spending very large sums of money?  If it turned out that most of its revenue was being generated from a small proportion of our population spending £10 or £15 a week on the national lottery, then we would all agree that there were serious questions of public morality involved in pursuing a course like that, however positive and beneficial the outcome would be in terms of where the revenue would be spent.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister and the House to address the question of morality because there will not be an upper limit <Col N="1803" /> to the amount of money people can spend annually or weekly on the tickets.  There will not be any physical barriers no more than there are physical barriers to people spending large amounts of money on horse racing.  Other lotteries run by voluntary organisations, because of the nature of their method of collecting money, makes it more difficult to spend large sums of money.  If tickets are going to be sold through large numbers of retail outlets, then it will be easy for people who are already addicted to gambling to find one more area to spend money.</P>
    <P>We should attempt, with as much dedication as there has been to getting this lottery going, to ensure that there are no overwhelming social consequences to some section of our society.  It will not be directly to the people who spend the money that the worst social consequences will be.  It will be the victims of the gambling addiction as in the case of alcoholism at present.  I have no objection to either drinking or gambling.  But we must confront moral questions when they are presented to us.  There is a moral question involved here.  I regret that the guardians of the consciences of this nation both inside and outside these Houses seem to find it much easier to contemplate the sort of morality and fudging of morality that goes with gambling than they do about attempts to face up to certain difficult questions in other areas of life.  It would have been useful to have moral guidance from those who claim the right to give us moral guidance, about gambling and the idea of a State lottery and the ideas and possible damage that can be caused by a State lottery.</P>
    <P>I say that not because I want to throw cold water on the whole idea.  If the national lottery turns out to be something in which the average citizen throws in 50p here and there and if there is no damage to existing voluntary organisations, then it is probably a good idea.  But we will never know if we do not go and find out. We will never know whether a minority are addicted to the national lottery, spending vast sums of money which we will see will generate positive outcomes. <Col N="1804" /> We could end up using the revenue from the national lottery to remedy the damage being done by the national lottery. It is not inconceivable if damage on the scale that I would worry about is being done.  Let us not forget that if everybody were to contribute to the national lottery, everybody would pay 50p a week.  If half the population contributed it would be £1 a week, if it is a quarter of the population it becomes £2 a week.  If it is 10 per cent of the population we are talking about people paying at least £5 a week. At that stage we begin to run into questions of morality.  If people are spending £5 or £10 a week on a national lottery, it is extremely doubtful if, unless it is the upper income group who choose to do it, people can afford to be spending that much money on something as non-essential as the funding of a national lottery.  I would invite the Minister and the Members of this House to confront the moral questions.  I would request the Minister to consider &mdash; I do not think it even needs an amendment &mdash; the extraordinary powers he has under section 34.  I was in the other House for the debate last night and it drew my attention to them.  The Minister has powers to rewrite the Bill.</P>

I am sorry, Minister.  I apologise.  I did not realise that you had amended it.  Nevertheless, that was by way of peripheral issue to what I wanted to say, which is that it does give considerable powers to the Minister.  It could be possible for the Minister in terms of making it work or in terms of making regulations for the purpose of enabling this Act to have full effect.  Maybe he can or cannot, but if he cannot he should consider some other way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ought to be part of the terms of reference of the institution of this lottery <Col N="1805" /> to study the social impact that it has on families and on society.  It is an inadequate provision unless we are sure that it is something that is being indulged in on a small scale by everybody rather than being indulged in on a grossly inflated scale by a small section of our society, and in the process doing damage which will be entirely out of proportion to any of the good that it might have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay special tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Donal Creed, who was very committed to the concept of a national lottery during his period of office.  It is unfortunate that he is not here with us today.  By saying that, I do not mean any disrespect to Deputy O'Keeffe.  I feel the reason that this Bill is with us is due in no small way to the commitment of Deputy Creed. During his period as Minister with responsibility for sport I felt that he put sport on a new plane.  The function of the National Lottery Bill will be to generate surplus funds that will benefit our community in a number of ways without the need for recourse to taxation and revenue raising measures.  I am very much in agreement with the general thrust of the Bill and the general philosophy behind the Bill.  However, I have some fears and reservations about section 5.  This has been debated thoroughly in the Dáil and mention was made of it again here today.</P>
      <P>Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>(1) Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and</P>
      <P>(b) such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that that definition is far too broad. I could see that sometime in the future <Col N="1806" /> the Government could decide in any area where pressure groups put a sufficient amount of pressure on for funding.  This is very dangerous.  I am not in agreement with subsection (b).  With regard to subsection (a) I would much prefer if reference was made only to sport and recreation rather than mention the remainder of areas, not that I have anything against the funding of national culture or the arts.  Nevertheless, I feel that these should be funded adequately from Government resources as they are already there.  By mentioning these, I feel that it takes away somewhat from the thrust and the effect of the Bill in the eyes of the general public and in the eyes of the punters, so to speak.  Basically, most of the contributions and interest will come from the gambling community. Those people who gamble on horses also gamble on sport in general &mdash; soccer, Gaelic football and hurling, rugby.  Those people would feel that their money would be going to the development of sport.</P>
    <P>Section 5 should be looked at again and the areas mentioned should be restricted to just sport and recreation and delete entirely subsection (b).  That is a very dangerous subsection; and, as somebody who has a very genuine interest in sport, I am in total disagreement with the powers it gives the Minister in respect of the disposal of any funds that will accrue from the national lottery. There is some disagreement about who first mooted the idea, but whoever did, did so in the interest of sport.  Indeed, it was mooted at the beginning in order to make funds available for sport.  We should not lose that objective.  That objective should remain.  There will be various pressures, as I mentioned already.  There may be the danger of pressure groups getting at Ministers for special funding.  I could envisage in time to come that the support for sport would be diminishing all the time because it has been the experience in this country that sport has always been the poor relation.</P>
    <P>The situation has improved since 1980 because we had a succession, since the time of Deputy Jim Tunney, of very good Ministers for Sport.  However, because <Col N="1807" /> of the scarcity of resources, sport is always the one to be left out and the area to get the least amount of public funding. For that reason I feel that by leaving section 5 as it is that it could endanger future funding for sport.  That is why I am very wary of it and, indeed, opposed to it.  This was and still is a major opportunity to put sport on a very firm footing. For years sport has been denied the type of support it deserves because of the importance and the impact it has for our society and the future of our society.  It is vital that an assurance be given that sport and the recreational facilities will be the major beneficiaries from profits made.</P>
    <P>Sport and recreation have always played a very important part in the history and culture of this country.  I do not have to remind the House that through the centuries numerous references have been made by historians and by commentators to the important role sport played in the culture and the day to day lives of the people.  Nevertheless, for that reason I feel that the national lottery should be solely for sport and for the development of recreational facilities.  We cannot allow the opportunity to be missed.  Whereas the Minister may have the right philosophy and favour sport, future Ministers could change the overall policy and place funds in other directions.</P>
    <P>The 20th century has witnessed major development of sport, both on a national and global basis.  Since the introduction of television and the coverage of the Olympic Games, World Cup Football, the Tour de France, golf competitions, cricket tests, rugby internationals and so forth, there has been a growing awareness and interest in sport.</P>
    <P>Indeed since 1970 Ireland has witnessed a type of sporting revolution when people have taken to the roads and beaches, when people who were not normally interested in sport have taken up some sport.  The general population have realised that in order to be a sportsman one does not have to be a footballer, a rugby player or a golfer but that sport is open to all.  For that reason there is a <Col N="1808" /> demand for a wide variety of facilities in order to ensure that sports people from all backgrounds are accommodated.</P>
    <P>We need so much funding in sport in order to provide even the minimum facilities to cater for such a wide-ranging interest in sport, that we would be justified in claiming that all revenue accruing from the national lottery should be donated to sport and sport development.  No doubt the National College of Physical Education in Limerick which was set up in the seventies has been a major contributor to sport.  Graduates from that college have created an awareness within the school system and in communities in general of the importance of sport and recreation. The health and fitness craze that grew during the seventies in America has also had a major impact here.  Again, this has been communicated to us through health magazines and magazines such as <i>The Runner</i> and so forth and also by television, even by the American soap operas.  The overall concept of health and fitness in Ireland is now reaching a very significant stage and it is important that it is encouraged, fostered and developed further.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given also to our very young and active population and also to the matter of the very high unemployment figures.  In 1984 I introduced a motion on sport in this House and pointed out the necessity for larger recreational centres where in addition to the availability of swimming pools, sports halls, weight training facilities and fitness rooms there should also be provision for courses in the various skills that would help the unemployed.  Unemployed young people could spend a whole day in these centres.  It is commonly acknowledged that sport, recreation and fitness can act as a great safety valve for a society and can also reduce crime rates, vandalism and so forth.  This gives further justification for increased funding in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned the moral implications of gambling.  If people are gamblers they will gamble their money anyway and there are plenty of opportunities to do this through horse racing, casinos, &ldquo;one-arm bandits&rdquo;, <Col N="1809" />&ldquo;space invaders&rdquo; and so on.  Therefore, Senator Ryan's argument has no basis and I was disappointed in the main thrust of his speech.  Though he claims to have an appreciation of the concept and the value of sport in our society, that it is not the impression one would get from listening to his contribution.</P>
    <P>The idea of a national sports centre has been discussed extensively recently. Various groups and regions have put forward reasons for having it sited in their locality.  No matter where it is set up it will be an important development for the future of sport and recreation and again I would request the Minister for Education, who will be responsible for the setting up of this centre, to give immediate attention to this task and to decide on a venue as soon as possible.  I hope the centre will be located at some place outside Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a case for Limerick because this would give additional recognition to the physical education college there.  The expertise and facilities are already on the site available which is on the banks of the Shannon.  There is an airport nearby and the road network in the area is good.  All of those factors would justify the location in Limerick of the sports centre.  The Minister for Education has said that it would spoil what is a very good college to locate the centre in Limerick but I cannot see any justification in that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Limerick has a very good case.  I certainly hope that the centre is not located in Dublin.  I know there are good reasons for having it centred in Dublin but everything is centred in Dublin at present and this is an opportunity <Col N="1810" /> to locate something outside of the capital.</P>
      <P>When I addressed the Seanad on the motion on sport in 1984 I mentioned that there was a need also for a national sports assembly.  On that occasion I said that this assembly could be a place where different sporting groups and organisations would be represented and that there could also be a resource library available on sport in general, on injuries, on training and coaching techniques, and so forth and that it could also act as resource library with material available for organisations around the country. Consideration should be given immediately to the setting up of this sports assembly.  I would have no objection to such a sports assembly being centred in Dublin.  It would be an attraction for visitors and tourists on the same lines as the National Museum and the National Art Gallery.</P>
      <P>There must be a great case to be made for the setting up of such a sports assembly in this country.  I know one has been set up recently in Victoria, Australia and it has proved very successful.  It could act as an umbrella for all sport organisations.  It could create the cross-fertilisation of ideas between various sporting organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention here the growing awareness of outdoor activity in the country.  Some of the funds which will become available could be committed towards the development of outdoor activity centres.  There is a very successful outdoor activity centre operating at Cappanalea, Killorglin in County Kerry. However, because of the lack of funding this centre is now on the point of closing. It would be a national disgrace if it were allowed to close.  The reason for the problem is that the Department of Education have not recognised outdoor activity pursuit centres and do not allow, in this case, the VEC in Kerry to fund Cappanalea and to keep it in existence.  The funding that the VEC are making towards Cappanalea at this stage is illegal.  I am sure the Department of Education are throwing a blind eye to that. Nevertheless, it is a very uncertain type <Col N="1811" /> of footing to be on.  It has created among the staff at the centre a sense of their not being looked after, a sense that they have no future.  Such outdoor centres like Cappanalea and others throughout the country should be developed.  Moneys from the national lottery could be put towards the development of these centres.</P>
    <P>The development of outdoor activity centres could also have very good tourist potential.  The centres could be made available also to foreign students or fishermen, for instance.  Again, I do not have to remind you that the whole area of outdoor recreation and leisure is recognised now as the fastest growth industry in the world.  With our environment and considerable natural facilities, Ireland could become a major outdoor education and recreation centre in the western world.  Because of the very unsound financial footing of these centres proceeds from the national lottery could ensure that they be put on a firm footing and helped to develop.</P>
    <P>When I mention sport, I would like to consider sport in a very wide spectrum and not confine our idea of sport to field games or to the traditional types of sport that we think of.  The many different areas that we could invest money in would justify the spending in this sphere of whatever amount of money will accrue from the national lottery, be it £8 million, £20 million or £50 million.</P>
    <P>Money should be spent on capital projects rather than making allocations available to individual sporting bodies for their day to day running.  There would be dangers involved here.  The Government should draw up some form of policy and identify what areas the money would go into so that the maximum benefit would be derived from any investments in the overall area of sport.</P>
    <P>The proceeds from the lottery should not replace any existing funding and should not affect the allocations to Cospóir and the subsequent allocations which Cospóir make to various organisations. There could be a danger here that the revenue accruing from the national <Col N="1812" /> lottery would in some way justify a decrease in funding from central funds. Both must be kept separate.  I would be looking for further and increased allocations to Cospóir in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is reference in section 5 to health.  I would regard sport and the provision of recreational facilities intrinsic to health.  The amount of money spent in this country on curative medicine compared with preventive medicine is totally disproportionate.  In countries like Australia that have a very high awareness of the value of sport and physical exercise, there has been a positive correlation found by various surveys which indicates that where money is spent on preventive medicine the overall health of the community benefits to the extent that there is less money spent on curative medicine. This is a major case for having large investment in sport.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed that the national lottery will affect existing voluntary and charitable organisations.  I do not share that view.  There are provisions in the Bill to protect and enhance the position of existing charitable organisations. However, in his speech in here today, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In the event that despite these measures, it can be shown that the net income to charitable and voluntary bodies from the lotteries they operate has declined as a direct consequence of the activities of the National Lottery, I have given an assurance in the Dáil that the Government will be sympathetic to their situation in deciding on the allocation of the National Lottery's proceeds.</P>
    <P>There is an inherent danger in this statement.  I could see the possibility that voluntary bodies, through lack of effort or because they had a bad year, could claim that whatever loss of revenue they suffer should be made up from the national lottery.  The Minister may have many demands from a great number of sources for money to make up for shortfalls. This is a very dangerous commitment. I would prefer if that commitment was not made.  It will lead to further <Col N="1813" /> pressure from various groupings.  As we know, people are inclined to blame somebody when there is a shortfall in revenue. In this case it will be the national lottery. It is a case which is being made against the whole concept of the national lottery. Nevertheless, any charitable and voluntary organisation, if they work hard enough can still do well with their own fund raising events, as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris has mentioned here, and I am glad of this too, that An Post have been given the licence to run the national lottery.  This will put the national lottery on a firm footing.  Mention has been made of public confidence and public trust.  An Post have this respect. Giving the licence to them will ensure that the people will have confidence that their money is being properly looked after and that there will be no scare about it being misappropriated.  It has been the experience of some organisations that people are not as trusting as they were in the past in giving money to them.  On market day in most provincial towns, as I am sure is the experience of all of the Members here today one could be met by representatives from each of four or five different organisations collecting money.  The public are becoming more wary of these collections.  The entrusting of the national lottery to An Post will ensure public confidence in this venture. If people buy tickets they know the money will be used properly and will not be misappropriated.</P>
    <P>An Post, since becoming independent, have proved themselves to be very effective with their marketing techniques. They have come up with some very innovative ideas.  I am sure, that in promoting the national lottery, they will show the same type of initiatives and will try to promote it, not just in this country but among the Irish communities abroad.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  It is a very imaginative approach, the type of approach we need in this country today in order to sort out our many problems. It is a great opportunity for sport.  It is a great opportunity to put financial support for sport on a very firm footing for the <Col N="1814" /> future.  It gives great hope to those people who are involved in sport, and who have devoted much of their time to the promotion of sport on a wide scale.  The Minister must, as far as possible, ensure that sport will be the major beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Senators from the opposite side of the House have again voiced their fears and opposition in relation to section 5.  To a considerable extent, I am in agreement with them.  Senator Smith has already mentioned the broadness of the terms of this section.  I share his fears and I agreee with him that the areas referred to will have to be restricted and more clearly defined.  The debate on Committee Stage is our last opportunity to ensure the clarity of the Bill.  My amendment to section 5 of the Bill will be recommending that paragraph (b) of section 5 be deleted completely.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has been mooted since the early eighties.  I am glad that it has been brought before the House.  It is another victory for the Government in terms of what they committed themselves to.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention Deputy Donal Creed, who deserves much credit for having ensured that this Bill is before us here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that in general we are not opposed to the concept of a national lottery.  The Bill is entitled:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the holding by or on behalf of the Minister for Finance of a National Lottery, to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1979, and to provide for matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said in his Second Stage speech national lotteries all over the world have been successful.  He has mentioned that in European countries, for instance, there are very active and successful lotteries.  These are in France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Spain and Portugal.  Indeed, as he rightly says, in Britain the football pools are extremely big business.  For very <Col N="1815" /> small outlays people can win huge sums of money.  Equally, he mentions that there are very successful lotteries in many states of America.  We often hear of people who travel to America buy tickets there and on returning tell us that they missed hundreds of thousands of dollars by single digits.  We know that for small money huge prizes can be won.  National lotteries are about many people participating for small stakes but with the possibility of big prize money.  We know of jackpots worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in America and all over the world. Part and parcel of the attractiveness of lotteries is that small sums can bring in huge dividends.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to suggest that a national lottery in this country will not be successful.  We all know that the Irish people, by and large, like a little flutter. I know that the kind of people Senator Brendan Ryan referred to like to have their game of bingo or their bet on a horse or a dog.  They bet small amounts. They are not compulsive or big gamblers because they do not have the money, but they enjoy their gambling and often have some success.  Certainly, the kind of activity proposed in this Bill is very different from the gambling on one arm bandits and such machines.  I saw the Acting Chairman, Senator Cregan, almost cringe when Senator Ryan compared the limited gambling of a national lottery with the morality of a brothel.  That is indeed an absurd and unfair comparison.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have, very big, professional punters, as we have all over the world.  Our own Grand National, bingo, tickets for our local draws and raffles, are all part of an Irish way of life.  A national lottery will be well received.  There is no reason it should not be successful, I do not know whether it will produce £20 million as had been said, there should be quite an interest in it.</P>
    <P>Having made the point that we are not opposed to the concept of a national lottery our major concern clearly is section 5 of the Bill.  The Bill in its original form was positively described as a Bill <Col N="1816" /> whereby the proceeds of the lottery would go to the general purposes as the Government may decide from time to time.</P>
    <P>Subsection 1 (a) of the amended section 5 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and...</P>
    <P>This is the one that I certainly would disagree with, as indeed did Senator Deenihan.  If Senator Deenihan puts in an amendment, which I am sure we will also, to have that section deleted he will have our total support; and, hopefully, Senator Deenihan will see his way to voting with us on that particular section.  Paragraph (b) of the section says:</P>
    <P>(b) such, if any, other purposes and in such amounts as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
    <P>I would have to argue that there is very little difference between what was in the original Bill and what is now in the amendment before us.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) refers to the health of the community and, again, that has not been defined.  But Senator Deenihan presumes, as indeed I would, that it is not, for example, about salaries of nurses or general hospital or community care.  I must assume it is about health education and the importance of physical fitness in our community which in turn would lead to a better and a more healthy nation and that it would be a form of preventative health care.  Certainly, we would not be objecting as we are.</P>

    <Title>National Lottery Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch, I had referred to the fact that I was not opposed to the concept of a national lottery.  My concern was with section 5 and the amended section 5 of the Bill.  I referred to the fact that, in my opinion, section 5 (b) was equal and similar to section 5 in the original Bill, that is, that it contains the following clause:</P>
      <P>Such, if any, other purposes and in such amounts as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of clause has caused concern and fear among Senators on the other <Col N="1819" /> side of the House.  Senator Deenihan in particular said he would be putting forward an amendment.  I hope he does and certainly we would support him.  I made the point that the amended section 5 (1) (a) was an improvement.  It includes an item now on the matter of the health of the community.  I was making the point before lunch, that I assumed &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will clarify this &mdash; that what is meant there is not payment of salaries to nurses or the payment of general hospital or community care expenses but that it would go in some way to the Health Education Bureau to create an awareness of the importance of physical fitness in our lives.  We should have healthy living habits and generally help to prevent illness in the community.  If that is what is envisaged it would be something I would welcome.</P>
    <P>Many of the contributions have dealt with sport in our community, its importance and the role of sport in Irish life. That is understandable in a Bill like this though that is not what the Bill is about totally.  I am glad the Minister with responsibility for sport is here on this Bill because, as I said, sport is very much part and parcel of the Bill.  I can recall another occasion when he was in this Chamber with us.  I was hoping that he would be here for this type of legislation.  He was sitting in on an amendment Bill on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the idea of a national lottery was intended primarily for sporting, recreational and leisure facilities, but this was never properly defined.  Was it meant to cope with the national situation or could it be for local communities, a football pitch, a hall or basketball or badminton?  Certainly sport was clearly to be the main benefactor of such a lottery.  It was suggested by Deputy Donal Creed when he was Minister that the national sports centre would be financed from this national lottery, not alone the actual erection of the centre, or whatever goes with it, but the running costs and the losses &mdash; unfortunately we know that there are losses in these ventures. This was very much to the fore and <Col N="1820" /> in the mind of Deputy Creed and the Government at that time.  There is no doubt about it but that an investment in sport, leisure and recreation is a good investment.  We find now that people have more and more leisure time.  Hopefully, more people will become involved in some form of sport, such as simple jogging, squash or swimming.  What better way is there for the people of our nation to develop a healthy interest in such sports?  It is not clearly defined in the Bill that many of the minor sports that are operating in this country &mdash; less fashionable sports which have not large spectator attendances and have no turnstiles to go through in the same way as football, hurling, soccer, rugby and Gaelic &mdash; would benefit from such a lottery. I am talking about canoeing, rowing, basketball and athletics to some degree.  Unless they have a major international meeting they will not have large crowds.  There are many other sports that would clearly like to benefit from such a lottery.  We have a great sporting tradition.</P>
    <P>We have a very high standard of sporting achievement in this country.  We have won much success on the international field from a handful of athletes.  We have won and performed very well in the international arena.  For example, going back to 1956 we had Ronnie Delaney, recently Eamon Coughlan &mdash; known as the chairman of the board for obvious reasons &mdash; Marcus O'Sullivan, Frank O'Meara, Ray Flynn and athletes of world reputation who can compete with the best.  The common denominator of all of these people is that they had to go to America for their coaching to achieve the high level of excellence they now enjoy.  If our athletes can get proper coaching and proper facilities they can be equal to the very best in the world.  In cycling Stephen Roche and Seán Kelly can match the best in the world because they have had proper facilities and coaching.  We would have great athletes and sports persons given the right opportunities.  Our footballers, such as Frank Stapleton and David O'Leary, had to go to England for proper coaching.  Our best youngsters are <Col N="1821" /> picked up by English scouts.  Most go on to become top class footballers.  If we could provide proper facilities our footballers could get the proper training and coaching at home.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan referred to the importance of the national sports centre for the future of sports.  He was advocating very strongly the case for Limerick. Many other centres throughout the country are anxious to have this vital and important facility.  With regard to such claims, Athlone has a stronger claim than its competitors.  From day one, we, as a local authority, were concerned when the advertisement for the national sports centre appeared in the newspapers on 15 November last year.  Submissions were to be with Cospóir before 28 November. As chairman of the council I called a meeting.  It was attended by all sporting representatives.  We made a first-class submission.  The point I am making is that we were the only local authority to have our submission in before the required date.  Athlone is the very centre of Ireland.  We have 70 acres of land in public ownership and an excellent road network.  It is easy to get to Athlone from any centre.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan referred to a water sports centre for Limerick.  In Athlone we have rowing, canoeing and yachting. We have the second oldest yachting club in the world.  We have a rowing course which is almost 2,000 metres.  This year most of the adult championships of the Irish Rowing Union were held in Athlone.  There is a lake and facilities for water sports.  I regard Athlone as the natural place for the national sports centre.</P>
    <P>Many people fear the impact which the national lottery will have on the existing lotteries operated by various volunatry and charitable organisations will affect them.  The Government, when announcing the national lottery, indicated that consideration would be given to this problem and that they would introduce changes in the existing legislation governing prizes in the hope of ensuring the continuation of existing lotteries.  Nonetheless <Col N="1822" /> many of these groups are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the lotteries run by Rehab and the Irish Wheelchair Association will not be affected by the national lottery.  I would also hope that the efforts of groups such as the Lions Clubs, the Round Tables and the Soroptomists, who are doing great work for charitable organisations and are contributing enormously to the overall health services, will not be interfered with.  These groups are very hard pressed at present for funds.  They will need every help.  I would hope that all voluntary groups who help to collect funds, whether they be Gael-Linn, the Mater Hospital Pools or the Rehabilitation Institute will continue to operate without any loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>The national lottery may also have an effect on local charities, where a group come together in a village or town to collect for an important local cause.  The Irish people have a great awareness of problems.  They are generous to charitable organisations.  I hope such groups will not be affected by the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The positive aspect of the Bill is that An Post are to have a major input into the lottery.  A subsidiary company of An Post will be set up to run the lottery.  This is the proper approach to it.  An Post are not referred to in the Bill but the Minister referred to it in his Second Stage speech. An Post are well suited to run this lottery because they have 2,000 or more suboffices. If it is to succeed, then the organising company, An Post, will have to embark on a major promotion programme.  Can they sell tickets in America and Canada and such places or will sales be confined to Ireland?  The Minister might comment on this.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that tickets may not be sold to persons under 18 years of age. This might be very difficult.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech made the point that if a person under 18 receives a present of a ticket then that would be satisfactory.  Let us assume that a 16 year old, not knowing the law regarding the National Lottery Bill, buys a ticket and wins a prize.  Will he be asked for his birth <Col N="1823" /> certificate?  Will he be denied his prize? That would be a very harsh attitude.  I know the Bill provides for that, but it should be looked at again.  It is not like drinking or gambling.  It is somewhat different. The age limit might be lowered but, if it is not, what happens if, through lack of knowledge, a 16 year old buys a ticket and wins first prize?  Can they take the prize home with them?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that these will be an annual report.  It is important that the lottery will be controlled properly from this point of view.  I hope that the reports will not be delayed for three, four or five years as often happens with local government accounting and so on.  I hope that we will have it as quickly as possible after the 12 month period.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is an independent Ombudsman who will examine and oversee the operations of the Bill is welcome. There may be a lot of complaints, particularly in the early years.</P>
    <P>Section (2) states:</P>
    <P>The total value of the prizes distributed in the National lottery in any financial year of the Company shall... be equal to not less than 40 per cent of the total moneys received by the Company in that year in respect of the sale of National Lottery tickets in that year.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how influenced people are by the size of the first prize.  The more money one has in the fund to distribute the greater the number of people who will participate.  The 40 per cent level should be increased if the lottery proceeds as we all hope it will.</P>
    <P>Section 34 (2) states that:</P>
    <P>If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing this Act into operation, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation...</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might comment on what exactly this means.  One could suggest that the Minister is overruling an <Col N="1824" /> Act of Parliament and I am sure that is not the intention.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the concept of a national lottery.  I like to have a flutter on the horses and dogs or participate in a raffle and maybe I am biased a little towards it from that point of view.  My biggest criticism of the Bill is in relation to how the funds will be fully allocated. Other Members have mentioned this. Section 5 (1) (b) is the provision I would be most critical of.  My worry is that the money collected would be spread through each Department for a multiplicity of causes.  Hopefully this will not happen. That is something we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The idea of a national lottery is not a new one.  The Minister in his Second Stage address cited the fact that State lotteries exist in many of our European partner countries and internationally in some 80 countries plus. In many ways, it is surprising that we have not already established what other countries have found to be a very lucrative way of generating revenue.  There have been discussions on the concept of a lottery.  From a personal perspective, I have no difficulties at all with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan had some critical comments to make on the line that the lottery is some sort of poverty trap created by the Government, particularly for people on low incomes who he contended are predisposed to gambling a disproportionate amount of their income. I reject the paternalistic approach that says that people with means can go to races, to the dog tracks or squander money as they please, but people on low incomes or those dependent on social welfare should somehow have to be protected from such foibles.  The same sort of logic often comes into play when we discuss liberalising licensing laws, that people on low incomes or in a poor socioeconomic status somehow have to be protected from themselves because they are predisposed to being reckless with their meagre resources.  People are entitled to dispose of their incomes as they please. <Col N="1825" /> There is an Irish trait &mdash; Senator Fallon touched on it very well &mdash; that we like the occasional flutter and on different aspects of gambling.  It is all the better if the profits that accrue from such flutters can be channelled for the good of the community generally.  The idea of a national lottery is something I have no difficulty with.</P>
    <P>I looked at the specific proposals in the Bill.  Most of the Bill is of a technical nature, as it must be, to set up a mechanism for establishing the national lottery. It seems as if it is long overdue and I welcome it.  The revenue from it could well be used in the variety of ways that have been touched on by other Senators, and which I will touch on later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a subsidiary of An Post will be licensed to operate the lottery, at least on an initial basis.  The history of An Post, their record of service, the quality and dedication of the personnel employed by them and the fact that they exist in every village makes them the ideal vehicle for implementing this operation.  I do not know whether each post office will be a franchise holder and will sell tickets.  Obviously other high street locations will be looked at; I have no doubt that it will be a combination of both.  I commend the Government for selecting An Post.  I know that there were other commercial and semi-commercial parties who were anxious to gain this licence.  I welcome the decision of the Government that it should go to An Post. They are a successful State company whose record of service to the community at every level is very high.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states that:</P>
    <P>Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for</P>
    <P>(a) the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language) the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> and</P>
    <P>(b) such, (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon was very critical of (b) and said that the Government would have control over the fund and could channel it to any Department of State that had a deficit.  There is a genuine fear that Governments would be tempted to dissipate the revenue that is gained from the national lottery and use it in a way other than is politically intended by the Government in their statement of intent. We should ensure that the funds are not dissipated or used to deal with normal day to day expenses of Government. They are a new and fresh resource available to help in the development of the twin areas of the arts and sport.</P>
    <P>Both these areas are obviously sadly lacking in funding.  Most speakers concentrated on the sporting aspects.  There are lots of sporting clubs catering for a variety of sports.  They manage to survive on resources that they generate from their members and supporters.  What we do not have is a central sports facility.  I know that, like myself, the Minister of State was fortunate enough to visit Australia and see the national sports centre there.  Some time ago, prompted by the rivalry with their neighbour, New Zealand, they found they were not doing as well in sport, particularly in the Olympics, as other countries.  Australia decided to sit down and analyse why. They are a sporting and athletic people with a very favourable climate for outdoor activities and pursuits.  Yet they did not seem to be as great achievers in the realm of competitive sport as their neighbours.</P>
    <P>They decided that the reason that this was so was that they had not got any central training centre where they could bring in young athletes at a very early stage and nurture and develop their talents through the growing years.  They have done that now.  They have created what can only be described as a magnificent <Col N="1827" /> sports complex which covers the whole gamut of sports.  They sent out experts in each of the sporting areas to identify young developing talent in the schools and bring those of particularly high talent into the central training centre.  We do not have that facility.  As a people it is doubtful if we can provide that out of normal central funds.  It is doubtful if we could ever afford such a facility.</P>
    <P>This lottery is our golden opportunity. Unlike other Senators, I do not think that we can do everything with this meagre resource.  I do not think it is possible to assist a variety of clubs on the ground or to assist each county.  We should be courageous on this and make a decision in the national interest.  There is no doubt that different interest groups will scream that they are not getting their little slice of the cake.  I appeal to the Minister responsible for sport to be rigid in this decision.  We need this facility if we are to be in the ball game internationally and if we are to give our athletes the resources, backup and coaching that every other developed country has.  If we miss this golden opportunity we will not get another because no Government will be able to gather together the resources that are necessary to provide such a facility. The Government should not be tempted to spread the resource around the country and allow everybody to feel a little better off.  It is an ideal opportunity. If we miss the boat this time we will not get another chance.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon repeated the eloquent plea for Athlone.  Obviously, it is centrally located.  Senator Deenihan made a similar plea for Limerick.  No doubt I am expected to say something for Wexford. The location is not the central issue. Resources in terms of land can be found. We must provide the facility and not allow sectional interests on a regional basis to act the begrudger and take from what will be a marvellous national resource.</P>
    <P>In terms of the allocation of resources from this fund the arts will benefit.  To be parochial, I come from a part of the <Col N="1828" /> country that is well endowed in terms of promoting the arts with very meagre resources.  My home town of Wexford boasts the Wexford Opera Festival which is one of the few cultural events that literally puts Ireland on the map.  It is renowned throughout Europe and the world.  Events like that, which are so important to this country, find themselves ticking over on a day to day basis not knowing for certain whether they will be in operation in 1987.  That is appalling. For the British to allow Glynebourne not to exist would be unthinkable.  Yet this is our cultural heritage.  We have show case pieces of Irish culture that we do not fund.  We allow the community to work together and then threaten to pull the rug at a moment's notice.  It almost happened this year in Wexford.  We must have some resources that allows international festivals to survive.  They are expensive but the amounts involved are paltry in comparison to the other international festivals with which they are regarded as equals.</P>
    <P>The south-east is well endowed with art centres.  My local authority, Wexford Corporation, provided a magnificent premises, our former town hall, for the Wexford Arts Centre at a very nominal rent. Luckily, we were in a position to do that. It is a focal point for the community.  In conjunction with Wexford Corporation and Wexford County Council it sponsors a myriad of cultural developments in the town and the surrounding areas from street carnival and street theatre to painting wall murals.  It is a focal point and even operates as a coffee shop where people can see marvellous exhibitions. We need focal points like that in every community but we do not have them.  We are culturally starved.  As a people with great soul we need to address this and we need resources to do it.  I am a great believer in the development of local groups and talents.  Thankfully, in the last 12 months in my home town, two new theatre companies have been developed both operating on meagre resources. They operate mainly with people who were formerly unemployed.  Some now operate under the various schemes of the <Col N="1829" /> Department of Labour, for example Teamwork or the social employment scheme.  There is one professional theatre and one developing theatre: Wexford Theatre Co-Op and the new pocket theatre which has just opened.  There is much enthusiasm in the communities and immensely talented people.  What is needed is financial encouragement.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to the development of our national culture and it is specifically stated in the Bill that resources could be used for the development of national culture, including the Irish language.  Despite all the rhetoric we did not, until very recently, make a proper analysis of how the Irish language could be made to be a living language in the community.  This can be done by community groups embracing the Irish language, not only in the Gaeltachtaí but in the Galltacht as well, places where Irish has ceased to be spoken as a medium of communication for a very long time, including the south-east of Ireland.  We can replant that seed because there is tremendous goodwill towards learning the Irish language.  What is needed is the structural support that we have failed to give in the past.</P>
    <P>There are powerful and compelling reasons why the arts and sport areas should be funded and supported.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are the dispensers of resources.  We dispense hundreds of millions of pounds to the Departments of Social Welfare, Education and Health. We do not have enough money at the end of the day to fund what is just as much a community need as the health services and what is just as important to human development as schools, that is an artistic and sporting infrastructure in our communities. We are beginning to do that now.  This is a vehicle to provide the resources to do that.  I am hopeful and optimistic that we will not allow those resources to be dissipated but will insist on them being focused on the areas that I have touched upon which will be of greatest benefit to the next generation.</P>
    <P>One of the fears that many Senators expressed during the course of this debate <Col N="1830" /> is the impact that this legislation will have on other charities and their fund raising. Senator Deenihan referred to the top-up provision whereby charities which could prove that their fund raising was adversely affected by the national lottery could apply for financial compensation from the fund.  Like Senator Deenihan, I would be wary of that because many very well-intentioned, important charitable organisations could seek funds from the national lottery.  This would dissipate the limited resources which would be available for sport and art.  An assurance is given that every effort will be made not to impact adversely on charitable events and fund raising.  I believe that this will be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 33 which allows the Minister for Justice to lift some of the out-dated restrictions on charitable fund raising in relation to the prizes that can be advertised and awarded.  That is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a mechanism that has been carefully thought out to belatedly generate funds and channel them into under-funded resource-starved areas that are vital to the health and well-being of any community.  The infrastructure seems to be very good and well thought out.  It takes account of experiences in other countries.  I welcome the appointment of a scrutineer and the fact that an annual report will be published.  If the operation of the national lottery proves to be in any way defective and if amending legislation is required I have no doubt that the Government of the day will take whatever corrective action is required.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  I hope that my trust is well founded and that the resources will not simply be another pool of money to be poured into central funding and dissipated withour specific effect. I appeal to the Minister to stick to his guns on the national sport centre and to consider the development of community art centres as a vehicle for developing the soul of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the holding of a national lottery, and the purpose of the lottery <Col N="1831" /> is to raise money.  Section 5 of the Bill specifies the purposes for which the proceeds of the national lottery will be used. The first reaction of most people to a proposal to spend money on sport and other recreation, on national culture, including the Irish language, and on the arts would be very favourable.  These are areas which are starved of finance at present and the expenditure of resources in these areas would not doubt have very beneficial effects as far as every section of the community is concerned.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that some of the proceeds of the national lottery would be used to provide a national sports centre but this is not specified in the Bill.  I wonder why this is so if it is the Government's intention to provide such a centre.  As Senator Fallon has mentioned, Athlone has already made a detailed and comprehensive submission outlining their case for the location of the proposed national sports centre in Athlone.  Senator Fallon outlined the range of amenities which exist in the Athlone area which would make it an ideal location for such a national sports centre.  I want to put on record that the local authority of which I am chairman, namely, Roscommon County Council, fully support the case made by Athlone Urban District Council in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the purposes which I have already mentioned which are specified in section 5(a), there is one other purpose specified and that is the health of the community.  Like other Senators, I wonder what is intended under this heading.  Is it intended that some of the proceeds of the national lottery will be used to subsidise the health services or to provide moneys which should be provided in the Health Estimate? Or will the moneys be used to finance the anti-smoking campaign, which the Minister announced recently? If that is the case, I am quite sure that the majority of people would not be in favour of the proceeds of the lottery being <Col N="1832" /> used for such purposes.  If, however, it is intended that the money will be used to promote and support activities which help towards the ideal of <i>mens sana in corpore sano,</i> I suppose that is a different matter.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (b) has been referred to by practically every Senator who has spoken.  This subsection is a different kettle of fish: it gives absolute power and discretion to the Government to use some or all of the proceeds of the national lottery for any purpose the Government may decide from time to time.  This subsection gives the Government power, if they so wish, to use the funds raised through the national lottery to subvent the Estimate of any Government Department, or indeed to provide inducements to the electorate in the run-up to a general election or in a by-election situation.  The Minister should reconsider this subsection and either agree to delete it or amend it drastically.</P>
      <P>I now want to get on to another point which I wish to make in relation to this Bill.  We should not fall into the trap of accepting that, even if it could be argued that the purposes for which the proceeds of the lottery will be used are commendable and praise-worthy, then the holding of the lottery to raise these funds is fully justified.  Senator Brendan Ryan and other speakers referred to this.  While I would not go as far as Senator Brendan Ryan went, I certainly would not dismiss the possible consequences of the holding of a national lottery as flippantly as Senator Howlin did.  However, commendable the end may seem to be, in certain cases it may not justify the means and I believe we should examine very carefully the possible adverse effects or consequences which the proposed national lottery may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past months we have heard much discussion and much soul-searching in relation to the whole issue of marriage breakdown.  A general consensus was that there is a lot of economic pressure on many families today and that this is a factor which contributes to marriage breakdown.  There is no doubt about it <Col N="1833" />&mdash; it will be the lower paid and the poorer sections of the community who will be most strongly attracted to the national lottery.  While I accept the fact that having a flutter on a horse or a flutter on a greyhound may be a very pleasant pastime and may not lead to compulsive gambling, at the same time we must accept that there is a situation where that type of gambling has an impact on the standard of living of lower-paid workers and lower-income families and social welfare recipients.  I am sure that, as public representatives, we all know people who spend an undue proportion of their income on gambling and on one-arm bandits and on bingo and consequently the standard of living of such people is affected.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the franchise for the national lottery has been given to An Post.  I assume that An Post will use the outlets which it has for the sale of the national lottery tickets.  I am referring in particular to the post offices.  We must take into account that the post offices are the places where old age pensioners and social welfare recipients and many persons in the lower income bracket receive their pensions and social welfare payments. The fact that those tickets will be on sale for the national lottery in those outlets will provide a temptation for these people to spend possibly a greater proportion of their meagre allowances on the purchase of lottery tickets than they would spent if those tickets were not available in those outlets.  Furthermore, I would like to ask if it is intended that other employees of An Post would be engaged in the sale of the national lottery tickets.  I am thinking in particular of postmen.  In rural areas especially, I know it would be very difficult for many people to refuse to purchase a lottery ticket from their local postman, if requested to do so.  If it is intended that postmen would be involved in the sale of lottery tickets, then I would assume that they would receive a commission on such sales so that this would be an inducement to them to sell as many tickets as possible.  Consequently, they may be in a position to exert undue pressure on the households <Col N="1834" /> and the persons on whom they call every day in connection with their duties as postmen.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the reservations which I have about the national lottery. Section 7 (4) states that a person shall not sell or offer for sale a national lottery ticket to a person under the age of 18 years, or invite from such a person an offer to buy a national lottery ticket.  I wonder whether or not that subsection of the Bill will be enforceable.  Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are no penalties laid down for a breach of that subsection.  Therefore, that subsection will be totally ineffective and it does not add anything to the Bill. The legislation, when enacted, would be stronger and better if that subsection were deleted altogether.</P>
    <P>A reference has been made by a Senator to the fact that the prizes in the national lottery would be tax free, but this is not stated in the Bill.  I wonder if the Minister, when replying, could indicate what the tax position is in relation to prizes in the national lottery, whether or not those prizes will be tax free.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the effect that the national lottery will have on Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and the consequences for their employees.  I feel a considerable amount of sympathy with the employees of Irish Hospital Sweepstakes who will undoubtedly and inevitably lose their employment as a result of the introduction of the national lottery. The national lottery will interfere to some extent, and detrimentally affect to some extent the fund-raising activities of other charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>I have these reservations about the Bill.  I am happy that the safeguards, which are written into the Bill to protect the public interest and the integrity of the national lottery, are quite good.  The appointment of an independent scrutineer to oversee the operation of the lottery will underline public confidence in the fairness of the lottery.  The Minister referred to that individual as &ldquo;an independent scrutineer who will ensure the <Col N="1835" /> integrity of the lottery and guard against fraud&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to see section 5 being amended at Committee Stage or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) being deleted. Subsection (4) of section 7 should be deleted also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address this Bill very briefly.  In doing so, one should stress at the outset that this is a very important enabling measure which provides for the holding, by or on behalf of the Minister for Finance, of a national lottery.  As such, the Bill is, in great measure, a technical Bill and much of its contents can more appropriately be addressed at Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The most important section of the Bill is the section which defines those bodies which can benefit from the moneys or funds raised by the operation of the national lottery.  Section 5 is the section which deals with the application of the net proceeds of the national lottery. Section 5 (1) (a) provides:</P>
      <P>the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and...</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government have got the balance right in determining the matters which should benefit from the proceeds of the national lottery.  It is interesting to remark in passing that the purposes specified here are not dissimilar from the purposes contained in the old Elizabethan statute, defining general charitable purposes within the meaning of the Charities Acts.  The purposes specified in the old Elizabethan statute &mdash; the Statute of Charles I as applied to this jurisdiction &mdash; are not dissimilar from the purposes specified in section 5 (1) (a) of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to address myself to the question of sport because that has been done in a substantial and reasoned <Col N="1836" /> way by my colleague, Senator Deenihan. I propose to address myself to the question of the need to apply moneys, whether they come from the national lottery or otherwise, to the advance of national culture and the advance of the arts within the meaning of the 1951 Act. Before doing so, I would express, in passing, the amazement which I seem to be developing on a daily basis, at the concern which the principal Opposition party have for the morality of the nation.  We have seen that concern expressed in a negative, sit-on-the-fence situation in the recent past in relation to one particular issue, the family.  We now see this newfound morality paraded today, without blush or blemish, without embarrassment or without difficulty by Senator Mullooly and others.  Indeed, we have seen it paraded in the other House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We see this concern for the lower income groups who might be contaminated or endangered in some way by this legislation.  Quite frankly, I find that concern to be without foundation.  I find it to be a little chattish, bearing in mind the history of the principal Opposition party and the lack of concern shown by them in relation to those they now appear to be so concerned for.  It is quite amazing to see this concern shown when a Bill of this nature comes before the Oireachtas, and how the concern that could have been expressed for those who are in a difficult situation in our society was not expressed when other measures were going through both Houses.  I would hope that this new concern would see itself extended and expressed in more meaningful ways when we come to deal with other legislation in this House in the months ahead.  Perhaps it is a conversion which is welcome; certainly it is a conversion which should be expressed in a balanced way and not in the narrow way that has been shown here today and when this Bill was debated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I want to express my concern about the need for the State to apply funds for the development of the national culture and <Col N="1837" /> for the development of the arts in general. In times of substantial although diminishing unemployment there is a need for the State to address itself to the problem of providing recreation on a broad basis for our citizens.  That recreation can be within the sporting field, but it can also be within other fields.  This is one problem that we, as a State, have failed to address ourselves to in the past. We have recently enacted the National Archives Bill, but we have done nothing in a realistic sense to preserve the various archives existing within this country.  We speak on this Bill today at a time when there is taking place in Castle Hacket, County Galway, an auction where a vast and valuable library &mdash; principally of genealogical works and a collection of family papers of historic interest to this nation &mdash; is being put under the auctioneer's hammer.  Yet, it has not been indicated to me that this State, through any of its organs, is in a position to provide money to buy in either the historic documents which are being sold or the books which would be of very definite interest to the Chief Herald's Office or indeed the National Library.  We must face, realistically, the needs which we are not answering.  What is happening today in Castle Hacket is one indication of our failure to address ourselves properly to that problem.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the recent report of the committee concerned with the outflow of works of art, which produced a good report under the chairmanship of the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, one sees the need for new legislation.  We can speak of new legislation on the one hand, and we can legislate, but we must, on the other hand, provide a mechanism whereby this State can buy in the things which are leaving this country.  Legislation, on its own, will not do it.  The implementation of this Bill and the proper application of the net proceeds of the national lottery can have that effect.  It is distressing to read all too frequently that valuable paintings, old Irish silver, old Irish glass and old Irish furniture made by crafstsmen who are particularly renowned, are leaving <Col N="1838" /> this country because we, within our national institutions, do not have the funds available to buy these things in for the benefit of the entire community.</P>
    <P>I can be local in this sense when I refer to the diminishing collection existing within Westport House, the home of the Earl of Altamount, I can express sorrow publicly when I see items from that house, which have an international and a national significance, leaving this country to be sold in London.  I can express that regret all the more because, whereas we talk about legislation, we are talking about empty legislation unless the State has funds available to save what is leaving our land.  I believe that section 5 (1) (a) provides a mechanism whereby that problem can be tackled.</P>
    <P>Speaking of Westport House &mdash; and I would be parochial in doing so &mdash; I would earnestly hope that the substantial collection of family papers existing there, running to over 10,000 in number and being different in nature might be protected for the benefit of this State and for people who wish to study them within this State by funds which might be made available under section 5 (1) (a) of this Bill.  One has to be also realistic because by doing so, and by addressing ourselves in this way to this problem, we are providing within this State a potential which will be available to students from abroad, to tourists and to people who have an interest in examining what we save.  If we are to develop one aspect of our tourism we must provide for our tourists and visitors things which will make visiting this land attractive.  Unfortunately, many of these things are leaving the country because we do not have the funds available to keep them within our own country.</P>
    <P>In the same sense one can comment on the work done by organisations like An Taisce or the Irish Georgian Society; one can commend the work done by them and one can commend it all the more because it is done with very limited funds. I would hope that the State can increasingly get involved in funding and in assisting organisations of that nature to protect within this country our heritage.  Indeed, it is an amazing thing that we sometimes <Col N="1839" /> comment unfavourably on many developments in the six northern counties of this country but one area where we cannot comment unfavourably is their attitude since the foundation of that statelet to the protection of the arts and, indeed, the protection of things of cultural interest there.  The fact that the National Trust of Northern Ireland has been supported by the State in a way that does not exist down here is a sad reflection on our own care of things which are of cultural and artistic interest down here.</P>
    <P>The fact that the director of the National Gallery has had to express disappointment publicly at the lack of funding available to that body to buy in paintings and works of sculpture which would be of benefit there and of interest to people visiting our National Gallery is something that cannot be forgotten.  I would hope that section 5 (1) (a) will have the effect operationally of making available in greater measure works of art for the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>I want to refer once again to the report of the committee concerned with the outflow of works of art.  Paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 of that report state:</P>
    <P>Tax incentives should be provided to stimulate donations of works of art, manuscripts and heritage material of such quality as to merit a place in public collections, to national cultural institutions or other designated bodies where the works would be on public display.</P>
    <P>The State should accept such works of art, manuscripts and other heritage material in lieu of taxes.</P>
    <P>Owners of historic properties accessible to the public should benefit from tax relief in relation to the upkeep and development of the collections in their properties.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 53 of that report under the heading, &ldquo;incentives&rdquo;, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Committee is aware that many of the older collections are in the hands of private individuals or families, struggling to maintain properties and who <Col N="1840" /> have a diminished asset base to support them.  This naturally often leads to the disposal of works of art and the breaking up of collections, to meet running costs, taxation and other circumstances. As the economic circumstances of these properties seem unlikely to change significantly, the Committee urges the Government to take action to encourage the preservation of these important collections, by providing incentives for their owners.</P>
    <P>Certainly, incentives can be provided within the Finance Act and within the existing tax code.  But the State must go further and I would like to see, in relation to heritage houses and in relation to heritage gardens and properties generally, a greater sense of partnership between the State on the one hand and the owners of these collections on the other.  This is an area where this Bill can operate in a constructive sense by providing that type of partnership; and, if that type of partnership is provided, we will have maintained within these Houses, first, a personal interest and also a State investment. It will have the effect of ensuring that these properties are retained intact for the benefit of this State and for the benefit of people who visit this State while at the same time retaining within them sufficient interest to allow them to be developed in a proper sense.  That can be done if the moneys which the national lottery can raise are made available in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to another aspect of national culture which is extremely important and that is the protection generally of national documents and national records.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even within what can be made available by this lottery we can do a lot.  We in this State in achieving independence and in developing our own identity decided that one of the best ways of doing it should be to burn the records <Col N="1841" /> of our past.  In the difficult years surrounding the foundation of this State we decided to burn our major public buildings and &mdash; a more important thing &mdash; we decided to burn the documents contained within them.  That was done in the national interest.  We lost the Custom House and we lost a tremendous collection of documents there.  We lost the Four Courts but, luckily, not very much of a documentary nature was contained there.  We lost the Public Records Office and we lost a great deal there.  It is incumbent on any Government of Ireland to try to ensure now that archival material is recollected.  There are many documents, collections of papers and records in private hands which if collected can provide a very sound basis for the type of national archive which is envisaged in a basic sense within the recent Act passed in this House and which I hope we will see developed.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the funds made available by section 5 (1) (a) of this Bill being used to purchase collections of documents and records which are in private hands and also being used to collect and store in a more meaningful way records which are in public hands but which at the moment are being retained in really appalling conditions.  If one examines the various public offices and one investigates what is retained there one finds that there is a vast collection of records and documents going back to the early part of the last century scattered throughout this country and they are so scattered because we have not had the resources available to collect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to depart from the few general remarks I made to refer to two sections of the Bill.  One is section 7 &mdash; I think it has been referred to by other speakers &mdash; the section dealing with the sale of national lottery tickets.  I simply want to express a certain sense of amazement at section 7 (7), that is the subsection that restricts the ownership of tickets.  I cannot understand why persons who are involved with the company should be deprived from the right to own tickets.  I can see why such an idea might have come to light but I cannot see that such <Col N="1842" /> an idea has any realistic or sound basis. I would ask the Minister of State to reconsider section 7 (7) (a) between now and Committee Stage.  Furthermore, I am a little unhappy about the phraseology of the subsection.  I will be addressing myself to that on Committee Stage.  Section 7 (a) reads as follows:</P>
    <P>None of the following persons shall be entitled to own a National Lottery ticket that has been purchased for value or awarded as a prize in the National Lottery or any part of such a ticket.</P>
    <P>What do the words &ldquo;to own&rdquo; mean?  Are we talking about legal ownership or are we talking about the beneficial interest in a ticket?  I believe the words &ldquo;as specified&rdquo; indicate legal ownership as distinct from the beneficial interest in a ticket. While I disagree with the intent, it is being deprived of its meaning by the use of the words &ldquo;to own&rdquo; in section 7 (a) of the Bill.  Certainly, it is my belief that if the Bill is enacted with those words it may give lawyers a field day in the High Court and in the Supreme Court.  There is every other reason I should welcome the Bill.  It is one I think the Minister might not be happy with although the Minister of State might not altogether disagree with my comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is the section which deals with the election either to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas or to the Assembly of the European Communities of a director or a member of the staff of the company.  The format of this section is one we have debated in relation to many Bills but a defect which existed in many previous Bills seems to exist still in relation to this section.  It would appear that nomination to this House is sufficient to deprive one of a directorship of this company.  Of course, one must bear in mind the fact that one can be nominated to contest a Seanad election without one's consent.  I should like the Minister to look at that section between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start I was going to be brief.  I want to conclude by saying that I <Col N="1843" /> welcome the general tenor and thrust of the Bill.  I believe it is a good Bill.  It can do a lot to develop and improve areas of Irish life which have been neglected over the years and in welcoming it I fail to understand, as I say, the concern shown by members of the Opposition for the weaknesses or the alleged weaknesses of sections of the Irish community.  This is a Bill which, on balance, is a measure which should be welcomed and supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make a few general comments on this Bill and I will be very brief.  I should say with regard to the last speaker that I am somewhat at a disadvantage as to what exactly he was critical of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that there is any need for this Bill.  I have not been convinced by the Minister's introduction and by any of the Members who spoke in favour of the Bill.  In my contribution I am making a few general comments from a very personal point of view as well.  I was in this House this morning for most of Senator Brendan Ryan's contribution and I want to say I was very impressed by it.  His sentiments, by and large, would represent my views as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said in this House and elsewhere on many occasions that I believe the abuse of alcoholic drink to be the greatest curse of this country.  There are very few Members in the House who in their own experience either in family relationships or in the social areas in which they move could not recount many situations where talents and lives were wasted because of the abuse of alcohol.  Perhaps, it is not an appropriate place to go into that in any greater detail but I think that very few <Col N="1844" /> people and very few Members of this House would disagree with me.</P>
    <P>I think also that gambling is one of the great evils of this country.  If it is not the second greatest evil, it is certainly coming close to the tape at the finishing line. Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous have been referred to.  Tributes have been paid to these organisations for the great work they do.  There are many people of course, who do not benefit from them and I suppose the greatest protection of all is to see that people do not have to avail of them.  I could quote statistics with regard to drink.  I could quote statistics with regard to gambling and I have done so before and I do not intend to repeat those figures.</P>
    <P>In a sense gambling could be considered a greater evil than drink because the amount of drink or poison that any individual can imbibe is limited but with gambling it is different.  There is no restraint and think of the human being &mdash; I have said this before &mdash; by making a comparison to the old steam engine.  I was very familiar in my time with working steam engines, threshing mills and the like.  I am sure there are very few now who had that same experience.  The steam engine was fed by coal or fuel of one kind or another: the more fuel thrown on the fire the faster the engine went and there could be a danger that it would go out of control but to prevent that happening, there were two metal spheres which were attached to a central axis and they were called governors.  As the speed increased, the radius of the governors extended and this was a control on the engine, a very important one.  The human being needs a control of this kind whether we call it a governor or common sense or tact or cop-on or gumption or whatever it is, it is very important in the make up of any individual's character. Unfortunately, there are many people who do not have this restraint and I am concerned about them.  It is the duty of all of us to be concerned about people who suffer in this way.  Senator Deenihan, referring to Senator Brendan Ryan's contribution, made the point that people <Col N="1845" /> who have the inclination to gamble have plenty of facilities at present and that this Bill, when it comes into operation is not going to make matters any worse.  Senator Deenihan misses the whole point of the situation.  It is the atmosphere that is created by this Bill that is wrong &mdash; the Government are stepping into this area, in a sense making use of this weakness that is inherent in the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Howlin was critical also of Senator Brendan Ryan.  He said it was a paternalistic approach to say that people of low means need special protection.  I feel that often people, when they are trying to be helpful, are inhibited by tabs that are unfortunate, ill-considered and improper.  That is the position here.  People, and, above all, people of low means need to be protected from, for example, advertising.  It is very difficult for anybody at present to cope with the power of advertising on our television screens, in the drawing room, in the papers and all those areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Howlin said that people should be free to do whatever they like with their own money.  In a sense, it is hard to refute that.  By and large, when they get their pay quite an amount of it is kept back in taxes; so, for a start, they do not have any control over that.  Leaving that aside, what we are concerned with here is the area of social engineering where we have an ideal situation in mind.  We strive for that; we try to bring about that shift in emphasis.  People, like Senator Brendan Ryan, are aiming towards that.  It is important to have success in this area of social engineering.  There probably will be conflict, but in the long run, whether you say it is a paternalistic approach or whatever, if it is successful, in my view it is to be welcomed.  I think alcohol has a special regard in Irish culture.  That is one of our great problems.  It has a root in song and story.  The strong drinker has a great appeal to everybody, except to his wife and family.</P>
    <P>I believe that we were to have important changes in the drinking laws with regard, for example, to extensions on Sunday nights.  I also believe from the media that the Government has made <Col N="1846" /> important changes in this area.  I will not go into that in any detail.  We will have an opportunity later on to do that.  I feel that what it does show is that the Government are not prepared to grapple with the problem.  I feel that the commitment of the Government in that respect is in doubt.  I certainly would question it.</P>
    <P>The gambler has been portrayed more or less the same as the drinker &mdash; a brave individual.  I can think back to the time when pitch and toss was very popular. The man who was prepared to put everything he had on a pair of pennies was considered a brave man.  The man who was not prepared to do that was considered cowardly.  This is the kind of atmosphere I believe the Government is encouraging.  I believe that in many ways, through advertising and other means, every attempt will be made to make this lottery a success.  The more successful it is, the more the people are losing out in this regard.</P>
    <P>What some of the Members have said is correct.  There is scope for gambling at present.  We have bookies shops all over the place.  Many of the people who frequent them are in no position to spend money in that way.  With regard to marital breakdown, it would be interesting to know what amount of it springs from gambling and drink, from horse racing and the amount of money that is spent on bets.  We have Sunday meetings now. I have no strong opposition to them, but that is a further opportunity and encouragement for people to spend more money.  People should be able to be happy and spend their Sundays in family situations together without going to Sunday racing.</P>
    <P>Bingo has been a craze for some time. I certainly do not have any objections to bingo.  It did serve a purpose to bring out people who are working hard, to get them out for an evening.  Even crosswords and fashion contests could be considered as a lottery in many ways.  I remember <i>Kavanagh's Weekly</i> in 1952.  He had a send up of crosswords and fashion contests. To make the point that there was no expertise involved in one particular issue, he promised that the following week he <Col N="1847" /> would have a crossword puzzle and the following week he stated in <i>Kavanagh's Weekly</i> that the artist who was to draw the little squares let him down but he proceeded nevertheless.  He gave one clue and the following week he had another problem.  He said they had decided that the person who won the crossword competition was a titled lady and when they checked her solution, they found there was no such word in the dictionary.  He had the same send up with regard to fashion contests.  He did not include any fashions he just gave the numbers.</P>
    <P>These are all areas of chance of one kind or another.  They are harmless in themselves and give pleasure to very many people.  What I ask with regard to this Bill &mdash; and the Leas-Chathaoirleach asked the same question &mdash; is: does the end justify the means?  Is it possible to make virtue out of vice?  If it is wrong to participate in this way, does the fact that work, or whatever else the Minister promised, will follow, make it acceptable?  If 80 other countries do likewise, as Senator McMahon said on an earlier Bill, so what?  Why do we have to follow slavishly what they do in other countries?</P>
    <P>The Government should encourage thrift.  In my young days at the national school we had savings stamps.  I believe they were a success at that time.  The Government should follow on those lines again.  People should be encouraged to save and not leave their happiness and future to chance of one kind or another. In this respect I believe that the Government have a great responsibility to provide opportunities for young people so that they can work, save, build a house, get married and have whatever happiness in life they aspire to.  With regard to the Government entering into this area also, I see problems with regard to people who, for example, would want to licence gaming machines of one kind or another. I could just mention that in my own town of Kells at present the urban council is rescinding the Lotteries and Gaming Act because of a second amusement centre <Col N="1848" /> that was opened in the town.  I have personally inspected that centre.  It is very well conducted, very clean, very proper. I can find no fault with the premises, the people who run it or as an amenity in the town.  I do know that many lives have been wasted through gambling.  In the media recently we got picture after picture, one more depressing than another. I know that situation.  It is very difficult to convince people who run these establishments and run them well that we are against them because of the common good when on the other hand they see that the Government seem to be cashing in on the situation.</P>
    <P>At present there are many calls on people's resources, church gate collections every Sunday, at places of employment there are collections almost every week.  Sport and recreation are most important because many people have time on their hands and are not trained to cope with it.  In many ways the Government could bring about training in this area, through the Health Education Bureau and other organisations.</P>
    <P>I should like also, in passing, to refer to the great work done by the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  Are prize bonds still a success? The same applies here as would apply to what I have said as to the Bill. In the case of prize bonds, the money is not spent; the initial £5 can be reclaimed.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us with regard to helping existing lotteries to compete, that the Minister for Justice has in contemplation new prize limits of the order of £3,000 for lotteries under permit and £10,000 for lotteries under licence.  This is very welcome particularly by organisations which are trying to raise funds. The national lottery will make gambling more attractive.  It is introducing this kind of competitive edge.  It is bringing about an ambience where those things are far more acceptable and this aspect of chance and gaming is more or less taken for granted.  This is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Lottery tickets may be sold only by the company or by sales agents and may not be sold to anybody under the age of 18 years.  The Minister informed us that the purchase of tickets on behalf of those <Col N="1849" /> under 18 years, for example as presents, is not, however, to be prohibited.  It will be impossible to prevent people under 18 years of age purchasing tickets.  They could get somebody else to purchase tickets for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the purposes for which the Government may determine from time to time to give money, the Bill is rather open-ended.  While areas are specified in section 5, nevertheless, the Government can vary them.  The fact that this will have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will not make any appreciable difference.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 40 per cent in prizes, the point has been made that this is a minimum and that it could be varied.  The minimum will be the actual amount.  I could not envisage a situation where more than 40 per cent would be paid.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced of the need for this Bill.  I am not convinced that, overall, it is for the benefit of society that we would have a Bill of this kind.  Because other countries have lotteries which are paying, I am not convinced that we should also have one.  It is unfortunate and regrettable. I am saying this from personal conviction and not, as Senator Durcan might feel, being in any way vindictive.  I hope that time will not prove me right in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief contribution on Second Stage.  I will not discuss the principle of the national lottery which has been adequately covered by other Members.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider the situation arising in respect of the fundamental change which he proposes to make in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 under the provisions of section 34 of this Bill.  Section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 which deals with banning advertising of lotteries, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No person shall print, publish in any newspaper or periodical publication, exhibit on any cinema screen...or cause or procure any such notice or announcement to be so printed, published, <Col N="1850" /> exhibited or broadcast or knowingly circulate...</P>
    <P>In respect of lotteries for which a licence has been granted that will mean that they will be able to advertise that they are being held and advertise the results. Bingo halls, for example, may be able to advertise the fact that they are having bingo on a particular night.  The proliferation of these forms of advertisements relating to things that have absolutely nothing to do with the national lottery will be a feature.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to look at restricting section 34.  I will have something to say on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the purpose of such a Bill.  The Minister said the establishment in Ireland of a national lottery is not in international terms a very unusual step.  He stated that state lotteries exist in over 80 countries.  That is not a valid reason for introducing a national lottery here.  We do not have to copy other countries. Proof of that is that the attempt to introduce legislation through a referendum last week to keep in line with other countries was flatly rejected by the people.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that the national lottery would affect the voluntary organisations who organise their own lotteries to raise funds, especially organiations such as the GAA and Macra na Feirme and so on who organise draws to raise funds to provide amenities and facilities for their members.  This is their only way of raising funds.  They are limited by law in regard to the amount of prize money they can put up and where they can sell tickets.  A person has to become a member in order to participate in this draw.  The Minister said and I quote:</P>
      <P>Extensive discussions have taken place with those voluntary organisations, charities or umbrella groups that had earlier expressed disquiet at the possible adverse effects of the National Lottery on their fund-raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific measures have been provided <Col N="1851" /> in the Bill to help existing lotteries to compete.  Section 33 will enable the Minister for Justice to improve the prize limits at present specified in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, for lotteries operated under Garda permit or licence...</P>
    <P>Lotteries are being organised at present.  I know of one organisation, Cappamore GAA Club, who have organised a lottery where someone sold tickets illegally.  The Garda and the law can be very strict on people who are spending much time and money, completely voluntarily, going from place to place selling tickets in order to purchase a field or to provide amenities.  It is something that Government should be doing.  These people find that they are harassed by the Garda authorities.  One-armed bandits and slot machines are in pubs illegally and Garda turn a blind eye to these.  The youth and the poor are spending their savings on these machines and families are suffering as a result.  I would like to see legislation to counteract that, to ensure that we do not have such attractive methods of gambling in places like public houses.  As much as £100 can be spent in half an hour with no return.  It is a disgrace. Legislation to eliminate or to cease that type of operation is more necessary than the legislation we are discussing today.  We should be concerned in introducing new legislation about creating employment.  The operation of the new national lottery will do nothing to create extra employment.  I understand that the franchise for bringing in this lottery has been given to An Post who have their own staff to operate it and probably will make extra earnings.  I am sure that there will be some monetary reward or commission for An Post so as to ensure that it will be a success.  Many people will be put in a situation where they will have to join the draw who may not be in a position financially to do so.</P>
    <P>There are prize bonds, the purpose of which is to create money for the Exchequer. The Minister said that no profit from the proposed draw will go to the National <Col N="1852" /> Exchequer.  Will the voluntary bodies benefit from the lottery as envisaged in the Bill?  Those who will be relied on to make the national lottery a success are the lower paid and poorer sections of the community.  They are the people who will be attracted to the lottery.  Tickets will be on sale in places such as post offices. Those in receipt of social welfare will be drawing their money in the post offices and will feel obliged, although they should not, to purchase tickets or get involved in the national lottery, which will definitely affect their income and eventually their standard of living.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the need for a national lottery.  The organisation of lotteries should be left to the voluntary organisations who are doing tremendous work in providing amenities, recreational facilities for the community and especially doing great work for the youth.  There are more problems to be tackled on the lines of gaming and lotteries laws, especially in the area of the one-armed bandits, which are being operated illegally throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay very long on this legislation.  There has been much controversy about it which has ranged over a large number of areas concerning the morality of the State being involved in lotteries, the way in which the moneys will be disbursed and the manner in which the operating company will organise itself.  We have had a long history of lotteries being run for charitable and social purposes in Ireland. There is no doubt that the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes which was a worldwide innovator of lotteries did a tremendous amount of work for Irish hospitals and for employment and indeed ran a very professional lottery for many years.  It is a pity that after all the years of service they have given they will not be involved in the organisation of this new national lottery.  It is only a new national lottery. The Irish Hospital Sweepstakes was a national lottery except that it was not run by the State, neither did the profits go to the State.  There was a certain private <Col N="1853" /> interest and no doubt many private individuals took money out of the receipts from the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes. Nevertheless, when we are setting up a national lottery we must first of all decide on maximising the gain to the bodies who will get disbursements from the fund.  I am glad to see that there is a maximum limit set on the expenses that can be incurred, whether by way of salaries, wages, commissions or organisation.  It is good that that should be written into the legislation in the beginning.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed by the vagueness of the Bill.  It is stated that the fund will be used for sport and cultural purposes, including the Irish language, the arts and health.  This &ldquo;and health&rdquo; bit is a worry to me.  The Minister said that it can be disbursed to charitable organisations who are involved in the health area.  I am wondering what the Minister means by supporting those charitable and voluntary organisations which operate in the health area.  It would seem to me that these charitable and voluntary organisations at present are involved in lotteries of their own and there is absolutely no doubt that one of the effects of this national lottery is that there will be less money available to the various charitable and voluntary organisations who are running lotteries at present in support of health and hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that the prizes to be won in this lottery will be tax-free. Would a group such as the fight for sight campaigners come under this Bill?  If they did, would moneys be given to them to fund such equipment as the laser machine which they have purchased and on which there is a £15,000 VAT attachment?  It would be a ludicrous situation to give £65,000 to a group like the fight for sight campaigners to purchase a piece of equipment and then have the State taking back £15,000 in VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial reasons for a national lottery were given as being in support of sport. Now that the Government have decided that sport and recreation are not going to be the only beneficiaries the lottery will have less effect.  I hope the moneys brought in by this lottery and used for <Col N="1854" /> the items mentioned will not lessen the amount of moneys the State is giving to these areas at present and that the lottery will not be used in total to support operations which are at present being supported from the Central Fund.  Under the Bill there will in effect be no change because the moneys taken in by the lottery will not be kept in a lottery fund. These funds will go into the Central Fund and there will be disbursement from that fund as the Government see fit.  This is very dangerous because we could end up with a similar situation to that of the road tax on motor vehicles which was to be used to improve roads.  However, the moneys collected from road tax go into the Central Fund and the Government do not provide enough to provide the roads which are necessary.  This bill could be used as a tax collecting option for the Government because section 5 says:</P>
    <P>Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and</P>
    <P>That is an extremely broad area and the Minister should be more specific about how these moneys are to be disbursed.</P>
    <P>The morality of the State being involved in lotteries has been addressed by other speakers and I am not going to follow that up but there is much concern throughout the community at present because of the amount of money being spent on gambling.  Much of the gambling is illegal.  There has been an attempt to break away from this but illegal slot machines and gaming machines are still being used throughout the country. Adequate concern is not being paid by Government to this problem.  There will be an increase in gambling because the lottery will be an easy way for people to <Col N="1855" /> gamble.  People will not have to go into halls to play bingo or into pubs because tickets will possibly be sold at counters in post offices.  Old people going in to collect their pensions can buy these tickets. According to the Minister there will be instant prizes available.  It is optional whether one buys these tickets or not but when people have easy access to them they will buy them.  The people who have no disposable income or little disposable income are the ones who will delve in to try to gain extra benefits by winning a small or big prize in an instant bingo game.</P>
    <P>From a Government point of view not enough money is put into sport.  Most of the money which goes into sport comes from voluntary subscriptions to clubs from companies and sponsorship.  There is a need for a much larger input by Government into the sporting and recreational areas.  If we had more sporting and recreational facilities we would have less need for hospitals and for the huge spending on health services we have at present.  Research has shown that we in Ireland do not spend enough money in preventive medicine.  Sport is a very big preventive medicine.</P>
    <P>We are hypocrites when it comes to the funding of sport.  We do not allow advertising of cigarettes on our national television stations but we allow Carrolls to advertise for four days on RTE during the Carrolls golf tournament.  During motor car racing Marlboro and JPS cigarettes are advertised continuously.  It is hypocritical that these people are allowed to use our media to advertise cigarettes on a continuous basis when the law does not allow cigarettes to be advertised.  This will have to be addressed by Government sooner or later.  It is ludicrous to think that because a golf tournament is sponsored by a cigarette company they can have four days of free advertising from RTE.  This is an amoral way of getting over the constraints that are put on cigarette and tobacco advertising.</P>
    <P>There will be a major impact on existing charities.  The Minister has said that if these charities suffer they can apply for <Col N="1856" /> disbursement from the fund which will become available from the lottery.  It is more probable than possible that all of the major fund raisers will have to go to the lottery for assistance.  In the end the State lottery will take over from the many fine voluntary organisations which are running lotteries for charity and for health schemes at present.  The cost of running the national lottery will be much larger than is anticipated at present. Some countries have been spectacularly successful in promoting national lotteries but other countries have not been successful.</P>
    <P>My comments have been made in the knowledge that this Bill will be enacted. Many people are afraid this Bill will supplant the present funding by Government of sport and the arts and cultural bodies. In the end there will not be much more money available but there will be a different source through a different taxation system which will be called the National Lottery.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for their contributions.  I observed that there were some reservations expressed by various Senators but in general there is welcome for the principle of the lottery.  A number of specific points were made which would probably be better teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In closing on Second Stage, I want to touch on some of the general issues which have been raised in the course of this debate.  A number of Senators on both sides of the House have expressed concern about the use of the surplus of the lottery.  I want to specifically reassure Senators that there is no intention to use lottery funds for general Government purposes.  All the proceeds, after expenses and prizes are met, will be devoted to beneficial uses as announced already by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will probably recall that the Bill, as originally circulated, did not include the specific purposes outlined in the Government announcement.  In the <Col N="1857" /> light of the discussion in the Dáil, I introduced an amendment to section 5 &mdash; the relevant section &mdash; which is now more specific as to the purposes for which the lottery funds will be used.  These purposes, as already announced by the Government, are sport and recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts and health.</P>
    <P>There will be provision of course to extend the list of purposes, should the Government so decide.  A number of Senators have expressed reservations about that particular point.  There is no need for fear among Senators that lottery funds will be subsumed or absorbed into general public expenditure purposes. Any addition to the list of purposes contained in the Bill will have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  As I see it the legislation needs to allow for extension of the purposes in order to cater, for example, for arrangements which may become necessary in relation to the existing charitable and voluntary lotteries when the national lottery becomes operational.  A number of Senators have touched on the possible dangers of existing charitable lotteries losing out because of the establishment of the national lottery.  In case there are grounds for those fears surely it is necessary that we have the flexibility within the Bill to be able to accommodate requests for what we might term loosely, compensation, from such bodies.  If the Bill were framed in a very tight and inflexible manner, such requests could not be accommodated at all.  There may be the possibility also of other beneficial community purposes which might have large scale endorsement but which could not be accommodated if the Bill were too inflexibly drawn.  While I accepted the point in the other House that it was proper to amend section 5 to specify the general purposes already announced by the Government, I still consider it necessary to retain power to add other purposes, with the safeguards regarding publication, etc.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have raised the question as to who is going to get what?  I do not want to be like Santa Claus &mdash; spending money I do not have.  There is <Col N="1858" /> no money there yet.  Even if one was to talk about specific percentages being spelled out, this, certainly in the context of the Bill, would introduce unwarranted rigidities into the Bill and would not be appropriate.  The House is entitled to know in general what the possible expectations are.  The possible surplus, as I understand from advisers, is that after payment of expenses and prize money there could be a figure of the order of £10 million in the first full year of operation of the lottery.  We cannot be certain of that, we cannot be certain what the pattern will be.  Therefore, to specify percentages at this stage would be quite foolish, it would be working in the dark and, worse, it would be raising false hopes among the possible beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Another major point was the position of the voluntary and charitable bodies.  I know that some of them are fearful of the effects of the national lottery on their fund raising activities.  These concerns have been expressed here by the last speaker, Senator Lanigan.  There have been extensive discussions between such bodies and the officials of my Department and the Department of Justice on this point.  They have made certain suggestions and I have been able to take some of these suggestions on board, specifically the changes in the prize limits under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, the raising of the £300 figure under the Garda permit to £3,000 and the raising of the £500 figure under the District Court licence limit to a figure of £10,000.  Those figures are not in the Bill but the Minister for Justice will be authorised to raise the figures by way of regulation.  These new figures I am mentioning are in contemplation at present.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary developed an interesting point in relation to the lifting of the advertising restrictions.  He focused on how this would affect the bingo situation. The lifting of the advertising and publicity restrictions was done specifically to benefit voluntary bodies.  The first point to be made is that bingo is very often run by voluntary and charitable bodies.  So, although the prime purpose <Col N="1859" /> is to cover the situation in relation to lotteries, in some instances voluntary bodies will be affected in relation to their bingo operations.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary is correct in saying that bingo operates under licence, usually under section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act and could accordingly, benefit from the lifting of the publicity and advertising restriction.  However, the prospects of a large scale expansion in bingo are limited due to a number of factors.  There is a natural limit on the participation in bingo due to the size of halls.  A rejoinder could be introduced to suggest that there could be a link up between different bingo games.  This has been looked at in the past by bingo operators and has been discovered not to be a very attractive proposition.  The evidence we have is that participants, usually people in local communities such as housewives, are not interested in paying higher entrance fees for prizes that may not be won on the night in the same hall.  There is a considerable social aspect to bingo as opposed to the prospect of winning prizes.</P>
    <P>There is also a suggestion by some of the experts that bingo, as a recreation, has probably reached its high point but that is a subjective opinion.  In so far as the national lottery would be providing competition for charitable lotteries it would also be providing competition for bingo, certainly from the point of view of attracting some of people's disposable income.  While Senator O'Leary &mdash; as I would expect from somebody with his legal training &mdash; focused directly and correctly on the target and highlighted something which is quite correct, I believe that any fears which might follow on from that correct interpretation of the situation will not be realised.</P>
    <P>I was developing the point earlier in relation to the position of the voluntary bodies.  I am firmly of the opinion that whatever the prize money on offer, essentially, those who support voluntary and charitable bodies are not primarily interested in prize money.  They do so to support those bodies and the prize money is incidental.  But in so far as the prize <Col N="1860" /> money is a factor we will be taking the necessary steps to put them in a more competitive situation.  Essentially, it is the appreciation of the work of the voluntary bodies which attracts the support.  I have also made it clear that in the event of the national lottery affecting the situation of those bodies who hold existing periodical lotteries that, pending satisfactory demonstration that they had been adversely affected in their receipts, the Government are prepared to take steps to make funding available to them from the lottery surplus.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators focused on the question of sport.  I understand the enthusiasm of the proponents' point of view that a large proportion of proceeds of the lottery should be devoted to sport. Senator Deenihan, in particular, made a very strong plea on behalf of the sporting bodies.  I can reassure him that the proportion of the lottery fund to be devoted to sport will be significant.  The needs of sport are very much to the fore in Government thinking when drawing up plans for the lottery, so I am very convinced that we will see in due course substantial support from the lottery fund for sporting and recreational projects.</P>
    <P>It also has to be borne in mind that a strong case is being made for arts and national culture.  There have also been calls for support for other charitable and voluntary organisations which operate particularly in the health area so what the Government have done is to examine all these various areas and to come up with what represents the balance of deserving causes to be given assistance from the lottery.</P>
    <P>I want to cover one other aspect and that is the moral aspect, as was raised in particular by Senator Brendan Ryan and a few others.  Senator Ryan referred to the possible ill effects of lotteries in encouraging young people to gamble. This whole thing has to be put in context. The latest figures I have are for 1983. They show that in that year more than £200 million was spent on on and off course betting.  We have looked at the situation in other countries and the evidence available to us is that State lotteries <Col N="1861" /> are regarded as a harmless form of legalised gambling.  There was a recent UK Home Office study in gambling and that concluded that there was evidence to show that lotteries and pools which provided a natural limit on participation were unlikely to be a significant potential danger to the participant.  I can put the Senator's fears at rest on what I loosely term the moral issue.</P>
    <P>I want to mention one point in regard to the timetable for the launch of the lottery.  A number of Senators will be interested to know when it is going to get underway.  When An Post applied to the Government to be allowed to run the national lottery, they made much, in addition to their many undoubted qualifications, of their ability to bring the lottery into operation at an early date.  This, indeed, was one of the considerations which influenced the Government to award them the franchise.  I understand that a detailed timetable for the launch is now under preparation in An Post, which puts the starting date at about six months' time.  I can reassure Senators here who are concerned and disappointed that I will be ordering An Post to secure the earliest possible start compatible with proper business and public interest criteria, so that tickets can be on sale, if at all possible, well within this target date. I will be monitoring progress towards the launch carefully to ensure that no delays occur.</P>
    <P>A number of other points have arisen in the course of the debate.  It might be more appropriate that these would be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage and, accordingly, I will conclude at this point on one note &mdash; I genuinely believe that the decision to endorse the national lottery by this House is in the interests of the country.  I am anxious for that endorsement and I am anxious to get the national lottery under way straightaway so that the many areas I mention can benefit as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 the Government, following a detailed examination of the future prospects for expenditure and taxation, took a number of decisions, involving reductions in Government expenditure, designed to reduce the current deficit and borrowing as a share of GNP, while stabilising and preparing the way for reductions in the level of taxation.  The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to one of those decisions. The Bill replaces the existing Malicious Injuries Scheme with a new scheme under which compensation for malicious damage will be available in a limited number of circumstances only.</P>
      <P>The cost of malicious damage claims has been escalating over the last seven or eight years.  For instance in 1979, the cost, including that portion of claims borne by local authorities, was £3.5 million.  The cost of claims relating to 1985 was just under £20 million.  This increase in expenditure under a scheme which is, in fact, open-ended caused the Government to look at it to see if the continuation of the scheme under its existing terms was justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into a debate on the historical background to the Malicious Injuries Scheme or argue whether, as some have argued, it was an instrument of oppression imposed by a colonial power.  However, it must be said that the people who benefit from the scheme are property owners while the cost of the scheme is levied on the general taxpaying public regardless of whether they benefit from it.  In most cases the risks involved are insurable.  A property owner will normally have his property insured, including insurance against malicious damage, and will pay the appropriate premium to his insurer.  Where his property <Col N="1863" /> is damaged maliciously he will claim against his insurer.  Where his property is damaged maliciously he will claim against his insurer who will pay out on a valid claim.  The insurer, however, can by subrogation recover his money under the Malicious Injuries Scheme.  While insurance companies will, of course, argue that the level of their premiums reflects this fact, the position is that the cost and risk to insurance companies of malicious damage at present is minimal.  The cost to the taxpayer, however, is significant, as the figures I have already mentioned indicate.</P>
    <P>Why should the general taxpayer bear the cost of compensation for malicious damage to property when he is not required to do so for example, in the case of theft?  Why, if someone can afford to own a very expensive motor car, should the ordinary taxpayer be asked to compensate him when a vandal happens to scratch the paintwork?  There is no justification for the present position.</P>
    <P>There have been claims that this Bill will result in a dramatic and widespread increase in insurance premiums.  The purpose of the Bill is to transfer the cost of insurance against malicious injury from the taxpayer to the owners of the property in question and to insurance companies. Obviously owners of certain properties, particularly in urban areas, will be affected to some degree.  However, the cost of insurance for the average citizen is unlikely to be noticeably affected whether it be in respect of house or motor insurance.  I would point out that to my knowledge, the only public statement made on this matter by the insurance industry is that reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 30 January 1986: this indicated that, while the measure would have an effect on premiums, a dramatic increase in premiums is not expected.</P>
    <P>As respects motor insurance, particularly, I want to refute the claim that 50 per cent of compensation paid out under the scheme, £10 million in 1985, relates to damage to motor cars and that, therefore, there will be an equivalent overall increase in motor premiums.  This claim <Col N="1864" /> has no basis in fact.  Statistics of the type which would allow an accurate breakdown, by type of claim, of the compensation paid out under the scheme are not kept by local authorities.  However, a statistical exercise carried out in Sligo revealed that in 1983, while 39 per cent of the number of claims related to motor vehicles, they accounted for only 5 per cent of the total amount of compensation for that year.  The number and size of claims for compensation for malicious damage to cars is small compared to claims arising out of accidental damage and personal injury.  Clearly, therefore, the cost of motor insurance will be affected by this measure only to a marginal degree, if at all.</P>
    <P>Malicious damage to schools in particular areas is a serious problem.  This question was the subject of discussion between officials of the Department of Education and my Department.  I understand that measures are being taken to improve security in schools by the installation of better fencing, burglar alarms and toughened glass, and that grants are available for such measures for both new and existing primary schools and, in certain circumstances, for post primary schools.  I would anticipate that this will have a beneficial effect overall on the level of insurance premiums for schools.</P>
    <P>Attention has been drawn to the problems some businesses face in obtaining insurance cover, particularly in certain areas of Dublin.  I understand that this problem relates to a wide range of risks such as fire, theft, liability and not just to cover for malicious damage.  While one cannot be happy with that situation, this Bill is not going to change the position significantly in those cases.  I appreciate the concern about the difficulty businesses in the areas in question may have in obtaining insurance, and the Minister for Justice raised it with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has primary responsibility for insurance matters.  The matter will be taken up with insurers to see if there are any practical ways to help alleviate any problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>As the question of the level of crime <Col N="1865" /> will undoubtedly arise during the course of the debate, I would like to remind Senators of the fact that the level of indictable crime recorded has declined continuously since 1984 and that there can be no doubt but that the efforts of the Garda Síochána, with the full backing of the Government, have played a vital part in bringing about this continued reduction.  I would like to make it absolutely clear that the Government do not think that the battle is won.  The level of crime must still be viewed as a major problem facing our whole community and there is not the slightest room for complacency in our attitude to the matter.  The fight against the criminal must, and will, be vigorously pursued.  I can assure the House that the Government are fully committed to giving continued support to the various measures which have already been taken to deal with the situation.  I think, nevertheless, that we can take heart from the latest statistics.</P>
    <P>They are proof that we are moving in the right direction and that the measures being taken, with the full support of this Government since assuming office, are beginning to produce the desired results. This is of particular relevance to the Bill now before the House since this drop in crime is reflected, according to the incoming president of the Insurance Institute in Ireland, in the lower number of insurance claims arising from specific criminal activities.  This must inevitably lead to a beneficial effect on the general level of insurance premiums and the availability of insurance.</P>
    <P>To turn to the Bill itself: section 2 sets out the grounds on which compensation for malicious damage may be claimed under the new scheme.  The section, which amends section 5 of the 1981 Act by substituting two new subsections for subsections (1) and (2) of the 1981 provision, will apply to claims in respect of damage caused after the passing of this legislation, leaving the existing law to apply in relation to damage caused up to that date.  Under the new arrangements, damage to property will be compensatable <Col N="1866" /> in three circumstances: first, where the damage is caused during a riot; second, where it results from an act committed maliciously by an unlawful organisation as defined in the Offences Against the State Act 1939 and, third, where it results from an act committed maliciously by an organisation from outside the State which is engaged in violence for purposes related to the conduct or administration of the affairs of the State or of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The situations referred to are normally excluded from insurance policies and the Government therefore considered that compensation from public funds should be maintained in these cases.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps explain that the term &ldquo;riot&rdquo; is used in section 2 in its technical legal sense.  It is in this sense also that it is used in exclusion clauses in insurance policies.  So, for example, if three people enter premises in the middle of the night, damage or set fire to them and run away, that alone would not constitute a riot.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that the riot provision in the new section 5(1) refers to damage caused unlawfully by &ldquo;one or more of a number (exceeding two) of persons riotously assembled together&rdquo; rather than damage caused unlawfully &ldquo;by three or more persons ... riotously ... assembled together&rdquo; which is the formulation used in the 1981 Act.  The drafting of the subsection in this way is simply to remove any doubt there might be as to whether damage caused by one or two persons in the course of a riot is compensatable.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (1) also provides for damage caused by unlawful organisations as defined in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and by certain other organisations from outside the State. Damage caused by such organisations has, of course, always been covered by the general compensation provisions which have existed up to now.  The need for a specific provision arises because of the termination of those general provisions. There is an exclusion in the Bill in relation to damage, the cause of which originated from outside the State.  A common example of international terrorism <Col N="1867" /> is the hi-jacking of ships or aircraft, often for the purpose of trying to force a country to release persons lawfully detained in its prisons.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any qualification in the section, the possibility would exist of claims for compensation being made against the State in respect of ships or aircraft which, having been hi-jacked outside the State, are blown up or damaged here.  To prevent claims of this nature being made, the section contains, at paragraph (b) of subsection (1), a proviso the effect of which would be to ensure that no compensation would be payable where damage was caused to a ship or aircraft in the State as a result of an act done outside the State or as a result of an act done in the State by a person or persons who travelled into the State or the ship or aircraft in question.  An obvious example would be the case where an explosive device is placed on a plane before it reaches this country.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the issue of a certificate by a chief superintendent that he is of opinion that a specified act was committed maliciously by a person acting on behalf of one of the organisations mentioned in section 2.  An injured party would not normally be able to prove in court that the damage he suffered was caused by a person acting on behalf of or in connection with such an organisation and, accordingly, so that the provisions in such cases may have effect, the Bill provides a role for the Garda Síochána. Of course the refusal by a chief superintendent to issue a certificate would not prevent a claimant bringing forward other evidence to support his case.</P>
    <P>As the information on which a certificate will be based may involve matters of national security, subsection (2) of the section provides that a chief superintendent will not be required to disclose that information, or its source, in any proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill continues a provision that was introduced for the first time in our law by section 6 of the 1981 Act.  It provides for compensation for property taken from a building damaged <Col N="1868" /> during a riot and tumult.  Section 4 contains drafting amendments to the 1981 provision so as to bring the section into line with the wording of section 2 of the Bill and two other amendments intended to remedy anomalies which came to light during the redrafting of the provision.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this section, I would like to emphasise the fact that in the case of compensation for property taken during a riot the provision requires the further ingredient of &ldquo;tumult&rdquo;, that is, the persons must be &ldquo;tumultuously&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;riotously&rdquo; assembled together; in other words, there must be a riot in the popular sense where looting normally occurs. This added element of tumult is not required for compensation for damage to property caused during a riot as it is damage caused by riot <i>simpliciter</i> that tends to be specified in insurance policies as being excluded from insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill also continues with an amendment of a provision contained in the 1981 Act.  Section 7 of the 1981 Act provides that it shall not be a defence to an application for compensation merely to show that the damage to which the application relates was caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child. While, as I have already said, damage caused maliciously to property by such organisations as are mentioned in section 2 of the Bill was compensatable under the general provisons of the 1981 Act, the specific provisions in relation to that type of damage in this legislation has highlighted the fact that the damage may be caused by a person acting under duress.  In such a case it could be argued that an act, while done intentionally, was not done maliciously.  It is in order to meet this argument that section 5 extends the provision in section 7 of the 1981 Act so as to ensure that damage caused by a person acting under duress will not be uncompensatable merely on that account.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for full recoupment by the Exchequer of the cost of compensation awards made against local authorities under the new scheme.  The decision of the Government in this regard, will be welcome news to all local authorities. <Col N="1869" /> Sections 7 and 8 are consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>Apart from the burden imposed on them by payment of compensation, local authorities have also been concerned at the burden imposed by payment of their own legal costs as a result of defending successful claims.  No part of these legal costs is recoupable at present.  The Bill gives total relief to local authorities as regards both compensation and these costs.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter in the Bill to which I want to refer.  I have already mentioned that the 1981 Act, as it stands at present, will apply to cases of damage occurring before the passing of this Bill. For this reason, the full extent of the savings resulting from the enactment of this legislation will not become apparent for a year or two.  The expected savings, when all claims made under the 1981 provisions have been dealt with, are estimated at over £20 million annually.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I see that the first three pages and the first paragraph of the Minister's speech is somewhat different to the Minister's speech when this Bill passed through the Dáil. Presumably that is to answer the many points that were raised in the Dáil against the operation of this Bill.  I want to refer to that before I make my comment.  The first three pages of the speech deal with cases that were raised in the Dáil over the last days of discussion there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to transfer the liability from local authorities to the general public.  While the Minister wisely gave the figures for 1979, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in 1982 the bill for malicious injuries claims was £9.9 million as against £20 million to date, which indicates to me that the measure of breakdown in crime has increased considerably over the period of this Government.  For that reason there is an increase over the last three years of £10 million in malicious claims damages.  This Bill has been introduced to transfer to the ratepayer that <Col N="1870" /> liability which was the responsibility of the Government heretofore.  I will come to that at a later date.</P>
    <P>There will be an imbalance from county to county in connection with the section that deals with rioting and disturbances that may come from people across the Border and outside the country. If that is the case, there will be no equalisation of the moneys that are going to be placed on the ratepayers as between one county and another.  I can cite the cases of Donegal, Monaghan, Louth and Cavan, where people now living along the Border could have an increase in the number of malicious claims to pay because of their location, while people in counties like Clare, Limerick and the southern counties who are living in a more peaceful environment will have lesser claims.  The amount of money paid out in the greater Dublin area during the last three years &mdash; £12.5 million was paid out of the £20 million &mdash; indicates that crime is at a very high level there.  That is where I believe that law and order has broken down.  We have this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that we will be opposing this tooth and nail on Committee Stage.  The breakdown of law and order and vandalism between 1982 to 1986 is the reason for the increase. What will be the effect of putting the onus on the public?  This is worth examining. First of all, properties will have to be insured right away.  The projections and forecasts we have here to date from the insurance companies show that immediately this Bill goes through this House and is signed by the President there will be a 10 per cent increase on vehicles, boats, motorcycles and on commodities that are already heavily burdened, as most people who have to get young people insured at this time know. What will the position be as regards other institutions such as primary schools and educational institutions?  The projections are that insurances will rise by some 40 per cent in the case of primary schools and up to 30 to 35 per cent in the case of secondary schools.  The same applies to churches, lock-up shops, factories, warehouses, colleges, convents, etc.  There <Col N="1871" /> will be increases in insurance right across the board as a result of the transfer of liability from the State to those properties. The properties will now have to be insured and continue to be insured.  What will be the effect of the claims coming into insurances, as has happened with the motor trade?  Insurance charges will increase beyond the capabilities of the people to pay, as is the case with young drivers now.  Some young drivers may have to pay from £800 to £1,000 to get insurance cover for 12 months.  The same will apply when the claims continue to come in as a result of this new Bill.</P>
    <P>These increased changes are something that the people will not be able to meet.  Who will have to pay for the rioting under the claims that will come through under this new Bill?  I will tell you who will have to pay.  It will be the ratepayers. The ratepayers who are in business and who have properties, and who have not got relief under the domestic rate relief will have to pay.  The burden will be confined to the business people and property owners of this country.  It will not be spread on the taxpayers, as the Minister has said.  It will be spread only on a portion of the taxpayers who are already overburdened because they are eligible to pay rates.  It will not be spread over the domestic population; neither will it be spread on a blanket basis.  It will be spread on the particular electoral area where the malicious claim occurs, as has happened heretofore.  I see nothing in the Bill that changes that burden on a particular electoral area.  When a malicious claim arose under the old legislation the ratepayers in the particular electoral area where the malicious damage was caused paid for it.  The Minister did not say whether this has been changed.  Will ratepayers have to take responsibility for the burden that will accure as a result of this Bill being introduced?  I should like the Minister to clarify this point and allay people's fears.</P>
    <P>If property belonging to the ESB or An Bord Telecom is damaged the Government will pick up the tab.  There will be a saving of £4 million to county <Col N="1872" /> councils as a result of transferring responsibility from the local authorities and the Department to ratepayers.  That £4 million should be put into a capital reserve fund and used to take pressure off ratepayers who will be responsible for claims under the new Bill.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed what will be the position with regard to future claims and those in the pipeline against county councils? Will they go by the wayside?  When this Bill is signed by the President will liability be transferred to the Government? In the case of decrees which will be issued over the next few days, will the Government or the local authorities pick up the tab?  When will the new legislation come into effect?  This is very important because every local authority made provision in their estimates for malicious claims.  I ask the Minister to tell us if responsibility will be taken for claims in the pipeline and for decrees which are in train at present.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Bill.  It has no purpose other than to transfer liability from local authorities and the Government to ratepayers.  We, on this side of the House, cannot accept this Bill.  We will oppose it on all Stages.  I will deal with it in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying the malicious injuries code is to allow the owner of property, whether moveable or immoveable, which has been maliciously damaged to apply to the Circuit Court for an award for compensation to be paid ultimately by the relevant local authority. The purpose of this Bill is to remove that facility from the citizens of this State. In so far as any measure introduced by Government removes a facility from the citizen is seems to evoke opposition.  One must ask if the malicious injuries code is well founded.  One must ask if it is relevant in Irish society in the latter part of the twentieth century I think it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The malicious injuries code clearly reflects a paternalistic age.  It reflects an age when leaders in society had a duty to ensure that peace was maintained.  That was done by imposing on them, usually <Col N="1873" /> as property owners, the obligation to pay for any damage maliciously caused within their locality.  That principle was acceptable in a society where there was no established police force or where the rule of law did not run in an efficient manner. The idea underpinning the malicious injuries code was found here and in Britain 600 or 700 years ago.  In 1836 the Irish Parliament passed an Act &ldquo;for the following of Hue and Cry&rdquo;, which spoke of charging the hundred or barony with the cost of the damage caused.  In 1695 another Irish Act provided &ldquo;for the better suppressing Tories, Robbers and Rapparees and for preventing Robberies, Burglaries and other heinous Crimes&rdquo;.  The method of doing that was to impose on society the obligation to pay for crimes maliciously committed within their area. That is why in the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836 the idea that a court could impose on people living in a particular barony or parish the cost of a crime committed in that area was carried forward into our malicious injuries code and exists at present.  The purpose of this Bill is to abolish that code.</P>
    <P>In a sense it can be argued, as Senator O'Toole has argued, that the Bill deprives a citizen of the right to recover compensation except in the circumstances specified in section 2.  The question we as legislators have to ask ourselves is: where should the role of the State begin and, more importantly, where should it end? Quite frankly, I find the approach of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this Bill very hollow when one bears in mind the fact that they welcomed the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill which was enacted two months ago or thereabouts. That Bill simply provided that the cost of maintaining and treating accident victims in any injury action should not be borne by the health board but by the defendant of his insurance company.</P>
    <P>When speaking on Second Stage of that Bill I compared the situation envisaged under it to the type of situation covered by the malicious injuries code.  I made the point that in principle I supported that Bill.  In principle I support the abolition of the malicious injuries code because I do <Col N="1874" /> not believe that the State should pay for every difficulty or for every misfortune that befalls an individual.  If an individual suffers injury in a motor accident and has to be hospitalised, then the cost of that should not be borne by the State but by the person who occasions that injury, namely, the defendant in a case or, more likely, his insurance company.  A direct analogy applies in relation to the malicious injuries code.  If a property owner's property is damaged, then the cost of repairing that damage or compensating the property owner for it should not be borne by the State but by somebody else. If it is possible to make the person who perpetrated that damage responsible, well and good.  If it is not possible, then the cost should be borne by the insurance company of the property owner.  The sooner we get away from the idea that the State holds a vast net into which every bit of misfortune we have in life will fall, the better.</P>
    <P>One of the problems existing in society &mdash; I say this with respect to my friend, Senator O'Toole &mdash; which has not been helped by recent statements made by the leader of his party is the idea that, no matter what difficulty or misfortune befalls anybody, the State is there to pick up the burden.  This Bill gets away from that position.  This is a courageous measure and I ask members of the Opposition not to construe the principle underlying this Bill for shortsighted and shallow political purposes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made the point that the cost of insurance will increase, and I agree with him.  The Government must examine the insurance industry.  We have within this jurisdiction a most unsatisfactory insurance regime and an insurance industry which in its operation is not understood by the vast majority of citizens or indeed by most legislators.  In addressing ourselves to the problems which are normally resolved within the malicious injuries code, we must address the weaknesses existing within the insurance industry.  I do not want to refer in any greater length to that problem now, but I ask the Minister to bring my views to the Government in that regard because <Col N="1875" /> that is where the nub of the matter lies. So far as the basic principle underlying this Bill is concerned, I welcome that principle and the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to record that almost 30 years ago the then Minister for Justice set up an inter-departmental committee to consider the malicious injuries code. The committee took note of the agitation which had existed over the years calling for the abolition of the malicious injuries code, an agitation based upon the view that it was unjust for innocent ratepayers to have to pay for damage occasioned by other people.  While that committee was aware of the unrest, it did not recommend that the malicious injuries code be abolished.  It is important to mention that almost 30 years ago abolition of the malicious injuries code was being talked about and what this Government have now done is, in effect, nothing new.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made that the provisions contained in section 2 will impose a greater burden on local authorities. I do not accept that.  That argument is untrue.  My understanding of this Bill is that, if enacted, the situations provided for in section 2 will, if compensation is awarded, be ultimately funded by the State.  The Bill provides in a subsequent section that the Minister for the Environment will refund to the local authority all funds paid by way of compensation.  To suggest that the business community would have to bear a further burden by virtue of the contents of section 2 is untrue.  Section 2 provides that compensation will be awarded where damage is caused in the following circumstances: firstly, where damage is caused unlawfully by one or more of a number of persons riotously gathered together. Secondly, where damage is caused as a result of an act committed maliciously by a person acting on behalf of or in connection with an unlawful organisation; and, thirdly, where damage is caused as a result of an act committed maliciously by a person acting on behalf of or in connection with an organisation outside the State that engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the use <Col N="1876" /> of violence for purposes related to conduct or administration of the affairs of the State or Northern Ireland.  These three exceptions are reasonable.  Their existence does not depart from the overall principle I mentioned because they are normally excluded in insurance policies. In so far as we live in an unsettled land, a land that is unfortunately subject to damage committed by persons in the circumstances envisaged by section 2, I welcome them.</P>
    <P>I reject the false criticisms of this Bill. I fully support the principle underlying the Bill, namely, that the State should not be there to pick up the tab for everybody's misfortune.  I welcome the exceptions contained in section 2. I support the gradual removal of the malicious injuries code from our legal provisions, it being a code which reflects a paternalistic age from which we have departed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of malicious injury occurs mainly in large urban areas like Dublin, Cork and Limerick where the levels of vandalism, arson and malicious burglaries are at their highest.  There is no dispute about the fact that this Bill will abolish the present scheme of compensation for damage maliciously caused to property except when caused by a riot or by the activities of an unlawful organisation.</P>
      <P>Senator Durcan appeals for support for the principle of the Bill.  We must, however, consider the practical implications of the Bill.  Senator Durcan agrees with Senator O'Toole that the Bill, when implemented, will result in higher insurance costs.  The basic problem is that of law and order.  Increased insurance costs will affect schools and community and sporting groups because they are especially prone to malicious damage.  The Bill will also result in increased insurance costs for householders, motorists and businesses especially those businesses that are located in crime-prone urban areas.  The law and order problem is particularly acute in Dublin.  This is reflected by the fact that 60 per cent of £12 million paid out in 1985 for malicious claims related to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> I want to refer specifically to schools. Since 1982 following the high rate of crime and vandalism, insurance costs have increased by over 100 per cent.  The insurance industry predict that the proposals in the Bill will lead in major urban areas to a further immediate rise of 45 per cent in insurance premiums for primary schools and 30 per cent in the case of post primary schools.  In the course of the Minister's speech she said:</P>
    <P>However, it must be said that the people who benefit from the scheme are property owners while the cost of the scheme is levied on the general taxpaying public whether or not they benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I find this a curious distinction.  Who owns schools and who pays for them?  Schools are paid for by the Department of Education who get their funds from the general taxpaying public or through voluntary subscriptions from members of the general taxpaying public also.  In the same context, we had in the most recent Finance Bill levies on insurance companies and banks as though they were separate institutions from the individuals who make them up.  Who pays those levies and the resultant bank charges?  The taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the view that only a marginal increase will take place in car insurance.  Even if it is only a marginal increase it will be too much.  We are the most highly taxed car owners and motorists in Europe.  The Bill will increase the cost of car insurance by 5 per cent, in the case of comprehensive policyholders and by a higher percentage in the case of that large number of motorists who have third party fire and theft cover.  A further worry in relation to the increased insurance premiums is that this will lead to further aggravation of the problem of uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>With regard to churches and community centres it is estimated by the insurance industry that in urban areas insurance costs will increase by at least 12½ per cent. In the case of fire insurance the insurers estimate that it will rise by at least 10 per cent nationally as a result of this Bill with a much higher increase in the higher risk <Col N="1878" /> areas, such as, Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The final area I want to refer to in the context of higher insurance and its impact is that of businesses, especially small businesses in the Dublin 1 and 2 postal districts.  There is no question but that insurance premiums for these premises will shoot up, that is, if the owners are able to get insurance at all.  Who are these shop owners?  Are they property owners? They are already hard-pressed taxpayers trying to make a living from their small businesses in a crime prone inner city.</P>
    <P>The Bill will clearly increase the cost of insurance premiums in relation to damage caused to property by crime and vandalism.  While there will obviously be a saving for the Exchequer &mdash; this is the primary reason for the introduction of this Bill &mdash; there will be a very serious additional cost in respect of increased premiums for a variety of people and institutions and, in particular, the taxpayers who make up those institutions.</P>
    <P>A reduction in crime is obviously the only really effective way to reduce the cost of malicious damage.  The approach in the Bill is not the answer to the obvious necessity to fight crime.  The Bill will result in further costs being imposed on already over-taxed individuals and communities and, very regrettably, a further penalty on businesses, especially small businesses in the inner city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the Second Stage debate.  As I explained in my introductory statement the objective of this Bill is to restrict the scope of the malicious injuries scheme and thereby reduce public expenditure.  The Government could not justify the continuation of the existing scheme because of the severe financial burden it imposed on the taxpayer. The Government cannot see why the cost of compensation for damaged property should not be borne by those who profit from it, that is, the owners of property and insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment about the effect this Bill will have on insurance <Col N="1879" /> premiums.  I want to make it quite clear that it will have little or no effect on insurance costs for the ordinary citizen.  I would be very surprised if it has any effect at all on household insurance overall. Senator O'Toole claimed that there would be a 10 per cent increase in the cost of motor insurance rates.  I do not accept that claim.  My information is that if there is to be an increase in motor insurance as a result of this Bill it will be less than 5 per cent and most likely in the region of 3 per cent.  Therefore, there is no basis for the suggestion that there will be widespread and significant increases in insurance premiums.  Obviously there will be some increases for certain property owners.  I do not think this is unjust as the Bill is transferring the burden of insurance cover from the taxpayer back to the owners of property as far as malicious damage is concerned.  It is the normal practice in Northern Ireland and England and in most continental countries that the owner of property covers himself against malicious damage without financial assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that we are making exceptions for malicious damage caused by riot and subversive organisations.  It is not normally possible to insure against this type of damage.  Several European countries provide a scheme of compensation to cover one or other of these eventualities. It is because of these special circumstances that the malicious injuries scheme is being kept in a limited form. It is not envisaged that there will be a large number of claims under the limited scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked what the position will be in relation to existing claims and decrees.  Damage caused prior to the passing of this Bill will fall to be dealt with under the existing scheme.  The Bill will only affect cases of damage caused after the passing of the Bill.  Therefore, local authorities will still be liable for paying compensation in the case of damage occurring before the passing of this legislation subject to the existing recoupment arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> Senator O'Toole decided to pick the 1982 figure as a starting point for considering the increase in the level of malicious injuries compensation.  I would point out to the Senator that there is a three year limitation period within which proceedings for compensation for malicious damage must be taken.  There can, therefore, be a delay of up to three years in processing claims.  The figure for 1982 would reflect the amount of malicious damage caused within the previous three years.  By quoting the 1982 figure as a starting point he cannot say that the increase in malicious damage commenced in that year.</P>
    <P>He also seemed to think that the full cost of the new scheme will fall on ratepayers. At present part of the cost of compensation for malicious damage is borne by the local rates.  When the Bill is passed, there will be no liability in respect of malicious damage compensation on the rates.  The full cost of compensation under the new scheme will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Hillery also referred to the possible effects of the Bill on the schools and I dwelt on that at some length in my opening speech.  While I accept that malicious damage to schools in particular is a serious problem, this question was the subject of discussion between officials of the Department of Education and the Department of Justice and I understand that measures are being taken to improve the security in schools by the installation of better fencing and burglar alarms, toughened glass and such other security measures and I anticipate that this will have an overall beneficial effect on the level of insurance premiums for schools.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education currently pays a grant of £24 per pupil per annum to primary schools and this grant, together with a local contribution of £6 per pupil, is intended to cover matters such as heating, cleaning, maintenance and insurance.  I would like to assure Senator Durcan, who drew attention to problems in the insurance area, that I will convey his views to the Minister for <Col N="1881" /> Industry and Commerce on the subject as he requested.</P>
