      <P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to approve the placing of contracts to enable a new national school to be built at the Girls Convent School, Listowel Co. Kerry.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and to take the Adjournment at 8 p.m. For the information of Senators, I confirm that the House will sit three days this week.  The Finance Bill is virtually certain to pass through all stages in the Dáil today and it is proposed to commence Second Stage of the Finance Bill in this House at 12 noon tomorrow.  This ought to give Senators a few hours to study the final version of the Bill since <Col N="796" /> there may be amendments on Report Stage in the Dáil today.  Accordingly, tomorrow we will start with the continuation of the business for today &mdash; the Transport Bill and the Courts Bill &mdash; and move at 12 noon to the Finance Bill. Then from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take Private Members' time to complete the Fianna Fáil motion.  I understand the wish of the groups in the House is that we should then resume the Finance Bill from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. in order to allow the greatest possible opportunity for discussion; then resuming at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, to carry on with the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  If the Second Stage of the Finance Bill concludes on Thursday before 3 p.m. it is proposed to resume the debate on the Report of the Joint Committee on Development Cooperation in regard to Bilateral Aid.</P>
      <P>As already announced, present indications are that it will be necessary for the House to meet on four days next week, meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday to allow for a two-day debate on the Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill, and on Thursday and Friday to allow for two 12 hour-sessions on the Second Stage of the Constitutional Amendment Bill.  Assuming that those two days are fully occupied by that Second Stage, to meet on Monday the 26 May in the following week to take the Committee Stage of the Constitutional Amendment Bill. Since we are meeting on that Monday then the proper thing would be to meet Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of that week.</P>

      <P>Since we have notice of two further Bills being ordered here today and from our reading these two Bills will be introduced in this House, would the Cathaoirleach be able to tell me whether these Bills will be taken in advance of the Air Pollution Bill?  I would much prefer to see the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, come into this House before either of these other two Bills, because I think it is the most important Bill that is down for discussion among all the legislation that is to come before us.  I sincerely hope that we can be accommodated in having <Col N="797" /> that debate brought forward as soon as is possible after the Finance Bill and the Constitutional Amendment Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to confirm that on the tentative Order of Business which I have here in my file in manuscript, I have allocated Wednesday, 28 May, which is the first available day, for the Second Stage of the Air Pollution Bill.  Senators will join me in welcoming the fact that we have had two further Bills introduced in the Seanad, as well as the Clinical Trials Bill recently introduced. This is in confirmation of a promise made some months ago to me by the Taoiseach and confirmed in public to the Seanad by the Taoiseach when he was here last week.  This is a very welcome development.  I would like to say that my hope would be that the Air Pollution Bill, the Clinical Trials Bill and the Status of Children Bill should all complete their Second Stages before the end of July. These are three very important Bills. They are Bills that might benefit from a thorough discussion on Second Stage in the course of June and July, then we could have a pause before a Committee Stage discussion when the House resumes, possibly in September.</P>
      <P>I think it is well to mention this because it does appear with the amount of business which is now coming to us, some in the form of Seanad Bills, that during June and July there is a very distinct possibility of three-day sittings being required in order to achieve the objectives that I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Leader of the House said on the Order of Business about the importance of having a full debate on Second Stage of this Bill, I agree that it is a very important measure.  I would hope that the Seanad could complete examination of this Bill before the summer.  There has already been a considerable delay in the publication of the Bill and its introduction to this <Col N="799" /> House.  It would be desirable that the Seanad would complete the examination of the Bill and send it to the Dáil before the summer.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Robinson's anxiety in regard to this and share her relief in that the Bill has at last appeared.  I would like to say that when I talked of taking the Second Stage before the Summer Recess and perhaps taking Committee Stage in September, I was not talking of this in any sense of delay in its discussion by the Dáil.  In fact, if it would appear that by leaving it over the Summer Recess we would be delaying discussions I would not be in favour of that.  There would be little chance of the Dáil taking up the matter before late October which would give us the opportunity for following the course that I suggest.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986, is the latest in the long list of statutory documentation dealing with internal transport in this State.  I am not going to go through the long list of reports and tribunals and examinations of internal transport.  Suffice to say that like this Bill, almost every one of them purported to be a panacea for the trials and tribulations of internal transport in the Republic. To what extent the mandarins of the Department of Transport and Power have pressed their personalities upon this Bill, or for that matter the &ldquo;princes&rdquo; of Heuston Station, I am unaware, but I do know that even the most naive of us here cannot help but surface with the conclusion that it owes a great deal to a firm of international consultants, McKinsey, a name that has been bandied about in <Col N="800" /> debate in this Chamber for a considerable period of time.</P>
      <P>I have had the privilege of listening to Senator Lanigan who spoke quite eloquently about those international consultants and suggested that perhaps the time was nigh when they should be examined as to what their function in life was. It occurred to me that politics is a strange game because somewhere along the line somebody seemed to have forgotten that there was a certain catholicity about the employment of McKinsey.  The first employment of McKinsey was by CIE when they hired them to produce a document, which I am sure at the time they fondly imagined would mesh well into their vision of an internal transport system in which they would be the predominant agency.  Not long after that, the former Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Faulkner, hired McKinsey presumably with the same objective in view to produce a document that would in some way be the mirror image of the political necessities of the day.  Between them, the inevitable surfaced that when you employ a firm such as McKinsey it is merely a recognition of the old adage that you employ them to produce what you want and they will produce what you want provided you pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is important to set this Bill in some form of historical perspective. When this small State was established, one of the things bequeathed to us by our colonial masters was a proliferation of internal transport by way of its railway network.  We had a tremendous number of independent railway companies, although the four major ones were particularly well known to the public &mdash; the Great Southern Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Midland and Western Railway and the Dublin SouthEastern Railway.  In between we had this plethora of small railway companies operating on a quasi-provincial basis some of them even operating on a county basis.  Some of those provided the necessary stimulus and catalyst for song-writers like Percy French who wrote about at least one small little railway line in the south-west of the island.  It became <Col N="801" /> abundantly clear in a very short space of time that the investors in these railway companies had quickly come to realise that there was no return on capital invested, and certainly there was no incentive to invest any further money.</P>
    <P>It appeared that the combination of the First World War, the macadam road&mdash; which incidentally preceded the railways &mdash; plus the internal combustion engine was now contributing to the rapid demise of the railway system which, incidentally, had been built to service military needs in any event.  An attempt was made to rationalise the structure and as a consequence the number of railway companies operating in this island was considerably reduced.  That did not meet the problem in its entirety.  There was a reluctance on the part of those who had been in at the early days of railways and the industrial revolution, those who had benefited from the enormous profits that were to be made through railway transportation and those who had made tremendous profits out of the land rights associated with railway companies, to stay with what they regarded as a dying means of transport. Tremendous pressure was put on the Government of the day to take whatever remedial steps were necessary to preserve this essential element of the national infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We had the 1950 Transport Act which created the national transport company. The national transport company was regarded as a very brave exercise in its day, certainly on the part of a small State with a population of fewer than four million. Even then, there were difficulties. All the railway companies were taken under the umbrella of CIE, with the exception of the Great Northern Railway which traversed a geographic border. There was always a reluctance on the part of those in the Six Counties to accept that a single management could manage the railway company, North and South, for fear that that might be taken as an acceptance that there was a capacity to administer the nation.  Be that as it may, eventually the Great Northern Railway or that portion of it which operated between Dublin and the Border, was subsumed <Col N="802" /> into CIE.  We then had a national railway company.</P>
    <P>There were parallel developments in respect of the road system.  From the twenties &mdash; and I got this from reliable sources &mdash; it was not an unusual sight to see the Red Star bus race the Emblem Line bus to the bus stops to pick up passengers.  They were not too particular about whether their buses mounted the footpaths in this exercise to pick up available custom.  They were not too particular either about the maintenance of their vehicles.  Some of them even had all of the qualities which would demand the expertise of a rally driver to keep them on the road.</P>
    <P>A parallel exercise was carried out in order to rationalise that sector of transport. We had, as a first stage, the merging of all the independent operators who had no generic title in those days.  PAMBO had not yet been invented.  They were all merged into the Dublin United Tramway Company.  The concomitant provincial bus operators were taken into the Irish Omnibus Company.  The inexorable pressures towards rationalising an internal transport network came into full force.  These in turn, became integral parts of CIE so we were one of the rare nations in the world who could claim that we had successfully brought all the strands of transport together under one central management.</P>
    <P>However, the great difficulty experienced by CIE in all of these processes was their high profile.  CIE, as a semi-State company had a very high profile, certainly in excess of any other semi-State with the possible exception of the ESB, because everybody used CIE.  There was maximum public utilisation.  People knew when the bus was late.  People spotted immediately that if the train from Kingsbridge did not leave on time that that was a serious problem.  There was always a battle to provide the maximum balance of convenience to users.  People tended to forget, in respect of the bus services operated on a metropolitan basis by CIE, that Dublin was a medieval city bisected by a river and criss-crossed by bridges which made it virtually impossible for any <Col N="803" /> sort of organised scheduled services to operate with efficiency.  I can personally recall the enormous difficulties I had in trying to convince the city fathers that we should have busways and that we should have contra-flow systems.  In 11 years of constant endeavour with Dublin Corporation, I finally succeeded in having a contra-flow system at Parliament Street.  One can almost clear Parliament Street in four or five strides.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, all this image, which was constantly exposed to public scrutiny, led to an almost collapse of the morale of those who were not only charged with the running, management and operation of CIE, but those who worked in it.  At every turn of the wheel, we had economists telling us why the enormous subsidy which was being paid to CIE should be stopped.  We had all these burgeoning economists, who were about to make reputations for themselves, pointing out that there were better and easier ways of meeting the transport needs of the city and the nation.  All of them concentrated, almost to the point of exclusively, on the need to subsidise CIE.  They noted that CIE's subsidy was £10 million, then £15 million, then £20 million and so on.  They said that the subsidisation was out-running and out-pacing the rate of inflation. There was a massive preoccupation with the subvention required to maintain CIE and the national transport company.</P>
    <P>Of course, while this was happening nobody was commenting on the enormous sums of money which were being channelled into the private sector, because when the money was being channelled into the private sector it had grandiose titles like &ldquo;development grants&rdquo;, &ldquo;the provision of social employment&rdquo; or &ldquo;the development of research&rdquo;.  It had all sorts of names to obscure the fact that substantially the financing arrangements for these entrepreneurial exercises came from the State coffers.  CIE stood naked and unadorned to the public image by way of their subvention.  The public &mdash; and this is understandable because the public were only interested in when the bus got there when the train got there <Col N="804" /> and when the road freight lorry got there &mdash; never questioned, for example, the need to maintain, equip and enable to operate the law enforcement agency.  In this gregarious society of ours, it was accepted that we must have law or we would sink into the oblivion of death and destruction.</P>
    <P>It never occurred to them that was being paid not on a profit and loss basis but, purely, on a service basis.  It never occurred to the public, for example, that although we are completely wedded to the concept of neutrality since the formation of the State and have repeatedly made that statement, that we will not become involved in an international fracas of any description.  I certainly remember the eloquence of the late Eamon de Valera defending this nation's stand against Britain's call for the ports and its ultimate involvement in the war. We are wedded to the concept of peace. Nevertheless, we spend a great deal of money on Defence for which there is no material return.  Nobody focuses any great attention on that and, perhaps, that is as it should be.  For example, the biggest single employer in this State is local government &mdash; the Civil Service and the public service generally.  They are needed to maintain the infrastructural mechanisms which make this geographic unity of ours a State.  They do not make any profit. They provide a service and until recently nobody saw fit to challenge them to any great extent.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a nation's vitality is judged by its transport network. Movement is the beginning and the end of life.  If you are moving you are alive and when you stop moving you are dead. I am told that for millions of years the only form of locomotion known to man was Shank's mare which was the movement of his legs in order to go from one point to another.  That was the way early man moved with the climate and followed the herds in order to be fed.  I am told by my academic friends that the horse was first domesticated in the year 3000 BC and suddenly there were people who could travel at 30 to 35 miles per hour. That lasted for almost 6000 years until the <Col N="805" /> industrial revolution, when Stephenson had the wit to harness Watt's steam engine to a set of wheels and we had the first locomotive.  As a consequence, the railway systems have now adorned the globe.  Suddenly, in a very short period of time man could move at 60 miles an hour.  Within 150 years the speed of movement rose to something in the region of 32,000 miles per hour en route to the moon.  That is what transport is all about.  That is why the vitality of the nation is measured by the efficiency and the regard it has for its transport system. In fact, having spent a lifetime in transport I have long come to the conclusion &mdash; and it is not necessarily a subjective one in that it comes from a series of bad experiences, good experiences and a determination to learn as I went along &mdash; that transport as we understand it in western developed societies operates exclusively within the philosophy of growth.  The free market objectives much of which stand as the basis for this Bill, are quite clear and specific.  Profits and growth are taken as complete, absolute values.  Our society, and most western societies, have relied again in almost absolute terms on this phenomenon of growth.  It was pursued in purely quantitive terms and applied without reservation to all areas of human activity. Growth was the essential and the primary, almost the exclusive, measure.  It was pursued, among other reasons, because it was considered to be the one way to preserve employment.  It occurs to me now that the ever-increasing growth in the number of unemployed in this little State of ours and, indeed, throughout industrialised countries in the west constitutes a self-evident contradiction of that economic distortion.</P>
    <P>We all know, even if we pretend that it is not a fact, that growth is finite.  All of us live until we die; all of us grow until we reach maturity.  If we go beyond that we enter the world of abnormality. We are no longer regarded as being representative of our type or class.  This Bill is the child in many ways of the long list of statutory documents which have <Col N="806" /> emerged in respect of transport.  It owes a great deal to the current economic crisis because that crisis has focused acute attention on the transport industry, and, as a consequence, the domination of the transport industry by the forces of the market, a market which operates on a model of total competition with a view to formalising the dream of most political aspiratants, that of a transport policy.</P>
    <P>We have always claimed that the establishment of the national transport company was in many ways the microcosm of a transport policy.  We had achieved in the fifties to some extent, and many of us believe a substantial extent, what the Common Market is now striving for and what many in the Common Market regard as a dream or a myth.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of an article which was written by the Irish representative of the <i>Economist</i> intelligence unit and of the <i>Financial Times</i> when he said in regard to efficiency of State enterprises:</P>
    <P>The problem of efficiency in State enterprises is an extremely difficult one, chiefly because of the absence of any quantitative standard by which efficiency can be measured.  Even the profit test, that crude measurement of efficiency which exists as between private enterprises does not apply in the case of State enterprises which, although they may aim to avoid subsidy and to be self-supporting, are not intended to seek to maximise profits.</P>
    <P>The man who wrote that 20 years ago was Deputy Garret FitzGerald, the Taoiseach. It may well be that he has matured in time and has been required to measure up to the realities of life as the difficult circumstances are presented to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have had an opportunity of looking at this Bill.  They have consulted with their constituent members.  They have endeavoured to achieve a consensus viewpoint against the variety of demands upon their services.  I would be a fool not to admit that their major preoccupation is with the employment conditions and services arrangements in respect of the labour force employed by the company.  They issued a press statement on 14 March 1986.  By stressing that it is a press statement and advising of the date so that there will be no difficulty in ascertaining its basis and where it came from.  I want it read into the record because it is important as a formal statement of policy by the central trade union movement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need to go as far as to provide every Member of this House with a copy of it.  The press statement says that the CIE unions have considered the Government's legislation on the proposed re-organisation of CIE.  The unions support the idea of renewal and improvement of CIE services.  They think that this Bill is not the best approach.  The proposal to increase Government control over CIE wages and conditions is a recipe for chaos in the industrial relations of the companies that are proposed in the Bill. Unions are disappointed that the Government, in drafting the Bill, have totally ignored the views of the CIE workforce expressed through their unions.  They are critical of the proposals to separate the different sections of CIE into independent organisations under the Companies Act, particularly in the light of the experience of the taxpayer and the workers in Irish Shipping.  If intelligence or education mean anything it can be reduced to the simple definition of accumulated knowledge.  If history has any value it teaches one not to make the same mistake twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> The divorcing of the railway and the provincial bus services is not practical as the services share joint facilities.  This can only lead to a costly duplication of those services and the eventual deterioration of the service to provincial communities. The unions make the positive point that the proposed legislation should be amended in consultation with all parties. If suitably amended, this legislation would help in improving the services provided by the national transport company.</P>
    <P>That statement related to a number of references in the Bill which constituted major changes.  For example, section 6 of the Bill, provided for the establishment of three companies.  One is almost flabbergasted in the search for the reasoning behind this type of approach.  In all my years in transport I have accepted that the bulk of criticism levelled against the company, particularly in terms of the services provided to the community, was levelled against the Dublin city services. One could not read a newspaper without finding some reference to the appalling industrial relations set-up in Dublin city services.  Whatever criticism was levelled against the railways was levelled against them for the fact that they were responsible for the major proportion of the subvention needed to keep CIE afloat. Nobody ever took into account that CIE are required to maintain from their own resources their own permanent way, whereas everybody else uses the road services on the basis of paying whatever tax is imposed by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The logic of establishing a bus company for Dublin city is unassailable.  Nobody has raised any serious objections to it.  It is of sufficient importance, in terms of its contribution to solving the demographic problems that face a city which has within its boundaries one-third of the total population, to demand that some sort of exercise be undertaken to ensure that it is run at optimum efficiency.  It is not logical to challenge the railways for being responsible for the major subvention to CIE and then suggest that they stand alone with an expensive permanent way despite all the rationalisation techniques that have been introduced into CIE.  Despite the <Col N="809" /> abolition of signal men and the fact that there was a signal box every couple of miles in order to ensure that the safe passage of a train, and despite the introduction of electric signalling installations which now only require one cabin, CIE will have to meet the enormous expense on their own, unaided and without any inflow from any other activity, this subvention which has been their cross for years.  To suggest that the whole tide of history be reversed and that the provincial bus services be hived off to operate as a private entity in competition with the railway not only baffles me but suggests a distortion of thought which is totally unexplainable.</P>
    <P>Again, perhaps, it is because of this obeisance to the concept of competition &mdash; that everybody has to compete to be successful, that everybody has to be better without realising that the provincial bus services turn out to be better in terms of public appreciation than the railways &mdash; that the railways suffer.  If, on the other hand the railways should by dint of much effort, provide a service which is more palatable to the citizens of this State, then the provincial bus services fall apart and die.  This is an assault on the whole concept of an integrated transport system which was the dream of the early founders of the State and still remains the dream of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I was appalled when I read the Bill and discovered that in section 11, despite all the publicity in the past 20 years and certainly in the past decade for worker directors and for the recognition of the right of workers to participate at board level in respect of the enterprises that employ them, there is no specific provision in the Bill for the maintenance of worker directors.  It is another reversal of the tide in respect of human and industrial relations.  While there is reference to the appointment of other directors, there is absolutely no reference to the fact that worker directors are the only directors in this company or indeed any other company who recognise the principle and concept of worker directors who have to stand the test of the ballot box. <Col N="810" /> They are the only people who have to stand up and say why they should be elected as directors.  They are the only people who are required from time to time to answer to the constituents and that should have had some appeal at least to those helping in the drafting of this Bill who had some political background and who knew the difficulties of the electoral process and particularly the difficulties of re-election.  There is nothing in the Bill about worker directors.</P>
    <P>Section 14, which essentially provides for the dissolution, makes no provision whatsoever for conditions of service prior to the vesting arrangements.  If one man or one woman gives a lifetime of service to the railways in some shape or form and finds that because of some peculiar circumstances the particular exercise in which he or she was involved in now a constituent part of the road passenger provincial services and has to transfer there, it is not clear how the conditions of service are to be protected, what is to be done in respect of this transfer.  This has particular relevance in respect of clerical people employed in CIE.</P>
    <P>Section 29 which deals with the terms and conditions of employees &mdash; to me at least, and I am perfectly prepared to accept that this may well be a naive assumption &mdash; smells of ministerial interference to a point which in my judgement can only bring about in time industrial relations chaos.  There is no point in talking about free collective bargaining and the concept of free collective bargaining if there are all sorts of cop-outs along the way.  It means exactly what it says &mdash; free collective bargaining.  It means that people sit down and face a common problem and iron out whatever differences there are between them in the hope that in that process a mutually acceptable and palatable solution to the problem will emerge.  In the recent teachers' dispute that came into high relief.  If that type of process provides for arbitration that is what it should be.  My simple definition of the word &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo; is that somebody sits in judgment on the issue, arbitrates and decides one or other of the parties is right.  There is no cop-out; <Col N="811" /> neither side can go elsewhere to seek to upend that decision.  I can see within this Bill clear provisions by which that happens and will happen in CIE if the Bill goes through in its present form.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is not new; I did not have to wait for this Bill to be produced to be aware of this provision.  I have been around a few public State bodies and I have seen a few letters from the Minister for Transport telling the various boards that they have no business doing business with their trade unions or staff associations on the matter of wages.  I have seen the development of this type of command structure where from the dug-out of a ministerial office the generals in the field are told: you cannot do this, that or the other.  Then, when the bubble explodes one side or the other is blamed for the industrial unrest that is created.  Either one appoints a board to do a job or forgets about it.  The whole art of leadership is to delegate to people the responsibility for completing an exercise which you have in mind.  One does not sit over them all day watching how they do it and holding them to task when in your judgment they go wrong.  One has got to have sufficient faith in them to do it the way they see it should be done from the perspective of being on the ground.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that section 29 carries within it the seeds of an approach designed to affect with some stringency the complete element of wage control.  That is something that will not rest easy in the labour forces of whatever company are established.  It certainly will not rest easy with me, if I am approached by those labour forces with that constituting a problem.  I read the Green Paper which preceded the Bill and, as a matter of interest and purely as a national connotation, it just occurs to me that that booklet published by Dr. Garret Fitzgerald had an orange cover: the Green Paper is green and I understand the Act will be white.  Whether that means that it is all in the interest of the little nation that we serve I do not known but it was a peculiar coincidence.  The Green Paper says as regards mainline railways, for example, <Col N="812" /> that the Government have decided that they will be retained in the medium term and the breathing space provided by that decision allows time to consider whether (a) the existing railway network should be retained in the long term or (b) retention should be on the basis of a reduced railway network or (c) the railway network should eventually be closed down.  One does not have to be over clever to come to the conclusion that whoever set out those three options could hardly be described a railway afficionado.  Of course he is not.  In his booklet Dr. Garret Fitzgerald says the history of Córas Iompair Éireann, the inland transport monopoly, has been a less happy one.  This was some 20 years ago.  He was talking in terms of a comparison between CIE and other semi-State companies.  He went on to say that during the fifties following its nationalisation it cost the State in non-repayable grants over £20 million but that during the first half of the sixties a programme of re-organisation was expected to eliminate operating losses.</P>
    <P>Apparently he was not as good an economist 25 years ago as he is supposed to be today.  That expectation did not come to fruition.</P>
    <P>He further stated that since the results of the first year of this organisation programme suggested that these hopes might be realised even more rapidly than expected, that if in fact it becomes possible to eliminate the losses of this company which derived from its railway operations this would be an outstanding achievement for geographic, economic and demographic conditions in Ireland which are, to an extraordinary degree, unsuited to the successful operation of railways or indeed to any kind of public transport.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder why one of these bright boys who successfully aspired to become Minister for Transport should produce a Bill like that the one before us, given that his masters voice echoed in his ear?  It would appear that the acute, erudite contribution to <i>The Economist</i> and to the <i>Financial Times</i> all those years ago was to have an enormous later influence on <Col N="813" /> the Minister for Transport and Communications and indeed on Government policy.  If one has the Taoiseach expressing that view about railways and about public transport at large you could hardly expect his Minister to introduce a Bill which would be in direct contravention of those stated philosophies.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper went even further when it talked about buses.  It talked about the utilisation of post buses for example.  I do not know a lot about postmen but apparently the use of post buses in provincial areas as a substitute for scheduled bus services was on the basis of economics: it would be much cheaper. Apparently, somewhere in the Green Paper was the nuance that industrial relation problems might be fewer if it was a postman delivering human cargo rather than a bus worker.  I do not know much about postal workers but I do know that they generally react in the same way as everybody else in respect of industrial relations problems.</P>
    <P>It was not only postmen he was talking about but also about using taxis which suggested that he did not have much experience about taxis.  He suggested that taxis could be used as part of the transport infrastructure.  He was suggesting taxis for areas like Tallaght which is a besieged area in terms of transport.  There is absolutely no hope of a railway extension to Tallaght; at best all I can hope for is a bus expressway.  The Taoiseach was suggesting a combination of taxis and post buses to supplement and expand the transport facilities to an outlying area of Dublin which is growing apace and rapidly nearing the total population of Cork city.  I remember remarking at the time that perhaps the only reason he did not suggest rickshaws as a panacea for these problems was the climatic conditions which we enjoy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to suggest that it is what I think the Minister secretly believes it will be, a panacea or a partial cure &mdash; all for the transport problems which we allegedly face.  There is nothing in this Bill, and particularly in respect of its dictum that there should be three separate companies, to suggest that that <Col N="814" /> sort of dream can be realised.  There is nothing in this Bill to suggest in any shape or form that it carries with it either the imprimatur of those who have for a lifetime in one way or another shape or form, for good or for bad, managed CIE.  There is nothing in this Bill to suggest that there has been adequate consultation with the thousands of people who are employed in this enterprise to ensure that they will be protected.  There is nothing in this Bill to suggest that given complete consummation of its contents and given that it goes on to the stocks as a piece of law, it will improve the situation as apparently the Minister envisages.  If one goes anywhere in the world and examines any public transport enterprise and tries to examine it against the backdrop of financial stability he will be searching for a holy grail because it is not to be found anywhere.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Bill is designed to ensure that everybody pays his own way but implicit in it is the assertion that if you do not pay your own way you go to the wall.  The employees of CIE are very conscious of the fact that this was a relatively easy decision to take in respect of another semi-State company which had the nerve to get into commercial operations and had the nerve to engage in activites in the free market and take on all the mantles of private entrepreneurial skills, and got caught up in the economic recession and was promptly put into liquidation.</P>
    <P>There is a need to have enshrined in this Bill a mechanism to ensure that before that can happen in respect of any of the companies set up that both Houses of the Oireachtas have the right to examine it and make a determination upon it before it goes into effect.  That is not an unreasonable request to make because every successive Government have insisted in terms of their industrial relations problems that they should have the right as a fall-back if there were difficulties, to come back to this House and have the House either approve or disapprove of the settlement.  I am adamant that there should be that sort of mechanism within this Bill.  The Minister is no stranger to transport; he is the product <Col N="815" /> of a transport world albeit an insular one. The only knowledge he has of railway systems is a small little inter-company railway which operates within the 52 acres which constitute Guinness's breweries. Other than that, he does not know anything about railways except that he passes Heuston Station and that it is in his constituency.  But at least he is from the transport world and should know the dynamics of transport.  He should be prepared to sit down with the people who operate the first real genuine attempt at a national transport enterprise and ensure that whatever was agreed as constituting the elements of this Bill when the Act was produced due regard was had to all of these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have heard the voice of experience here from Senator Kirwan.  Clearly, his knowledge of the whole transport system and the experience he has gained down through the years will benefit people who are interested and pay attention.  He has explained the situation clearly.  He has outlined the history of transport and to some extent, the fears expressed by the workers over the various periods of investigation down the years and which in the final analysis are manifesting themselves in this Bill. There is the real question of job security and conditions of employment.  While we may talk in terms of 500 if the Bill goes ahead in its present state without sufficient safeguards being built into it we can be talking of anything up to 5,000 if one takes into consideration the possibility of the railway going to the wall, with the inevitable consequences for ancillaries and subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>We have a serious situation and I can understand how strongly the Senator feels about it.  I think it is necessary that Labour Party policy on CIE should be stated.  Labour policy always has and always will recognise the dependence of many workers and their families on CIE for a good livelihood.  The organisational structures must be geared to the provision of efficient public transport services and the provision of worthwhile employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> The Labour Party see CIE as being about people rather than management structures, operational methods or financial deficits.  That is why I share Senator Kirwan's strong views about the fears that are in workers' minds.  There has been a tremendous amount of investigation into CIE in the past not all of it has been very conclusive.  Even where it was conclusive it has not always been given effect to properly.  When we talk about people we are not just talking about CIE and their customers &mdash; who are an important element &mdash; but also about the staff and the people who depend on CIE.  We represent all these people.  CIE customers are the users of public transport and the purpose of CIE is to provide the public with a good transport service.  Therefore, we would never argue about efficiency. We want to see rationalisation.  We want to see improvements, and have encouraged this down through the years.  The public are entitled to a reasonable and efficient service.  We want it to be customer orientated, to be public orientated, to be flexible and non-bureaucratic. Any rationalisation that might take place must not overlook maintaining high standards of safety and passenger comfort.  It must monitor carefully changing customer needs and seek to satisfy them as efficiently as possible.  It must provide a variety of useful information. We would expect them in the course of any rationalisation to update their services. Every step must be taken to secure the highest standards from all their staff. We would not make any excuses for people not co-operating with that kind of thing.  This Bill is not the way to go about this.</P>
    <P>The nub of the problem is in the question of two or three companies.  When wages, conditions and so on are added to the question of the three companies the fear becomes that much more apparent. Apart from the safeguards not built in on the question of job security, section 29 and other matters, there is this terrible fear of the two companies as against three companies.  I do not know when the Minister is replying whether he will be able to make a very strong case for the <Col N="817" /> three companies.  He did not do so on Second Stage.  Perhaps, at the end of the debate, having heard all the points made by Senators, he will realise that there is a case to be made.  The whole question of the two versus three being the nub of the problem is something that has got to be resolved here on the basis of a suitable amendment that will have regard to allaying the fears of people who have worked in CIE for a long number of years giving long and hard service and who do not enjoy at the end of their days the very good pensions like they do in very many other places.</P>
    <P>CIE in recent times have made great efforts to perform efficiently and have worked well within the figures set down by the Minister.  Having regard to all points I made earlier on about the high standards of safety, I think CIE have lived up to the desires of the Labour Party and particularly in recent times.  We were painfully aware of many of the deficiencies which discredit public transport and particularly discredit CIE in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <P>The defence of public transport must go hand in hand with rationalisation and the question of making it, generally speaking, a good crowd to belong to.  It must provide for customer satisfaction, staff satisfaction and generally merit a more desirable point of view than the public can express about it at present. The reason for public dissatisfaction is that the public are not fully aware of the situation.  Perhaps this debate will help them.  They are not aware of the number of investigations which have taken place into CIE.  They are not aware of the hatchet job given effect to under the 1958 Transport Act arising from the Beddy Report, 1957.  At present two-thirds of the railways have gone.  It would not be difficult to wipe out the railway side if it were put in competition with someone else.</P>
    <P>With regard to the staff and their efficient performance, this requires an enlightened staff relations policy.  CIE by their governing legislation can maintain reasonable conditions of employment. That should not be interpreted narrowly <Col N="818" /> when discussing the Bill.  We must think in very broad terms in so far as those conditions obtaining at present can be eroded by legislation being too tightly worded or being so inflexible that it is not comparable with a situation where people work in a combination situation and then are moved into wide open competition where they will be more vulnerable.  We are anxious that our people pay attention to efficient performance.  They have been doing this.  They have been working within the ambit of the money available.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to make a blueprint for a perfect situation.  However, we should not overlook what may have caused some of the inefficiency in the past.  In this respect, one would wonder whether, in fact, while we had worker directors operating in CIE and semi-State companies, this on its own goes to make real industrial democracy, and where you have no function below board level for worker participation in any effective way, whether the desired results of co-operation, understanding and mutual agreement and better investigative procedures are agreed to as being desirable for the company to function properly and in the interest of the employees.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that CIE was one of the most investigated public bodies.  They are one of the largest Irish State companies and provide a service in all corners of the country affecting the lives of thousands of people.  They have been criticised always for their failures but never do we hear very much about their successes and they have had their successes.  The poor image in the eyes of the public is paralleled by the attitude of successive Governments who have generally regarded CIE as being a drain on public finances.  Therefore, when you are going to do something about it, even though they may not have the full knowledge of the thing, pragmatism is your answer.  You start to bring in something that will bang, bang, bang.</P>
    <P>Without having regard to other factors such as the question of the history of industrial relations which to my mind, apart from bad management, has been the cause of many of the problems that the public got into their mind, I do not <Col N="819" /> think the problems were that bad but the public have this belief about CIE and it finally gets to the point when nobody has a full understanding and when all the investigations will not bring about that full understanding.  Even I might add, that is difficult to do because probably many of the people who are investigating it, understand it to a substantial degree. On the other hand, the public, while they would agree it was fully investigated, they probably acknowledge that it is the least understood.  That is a very important one because it is a very complex situation. Anywhere you are dealing with such a large number of people and a workforce that works on the basis of combination, this kind of abuse is easily singled out. Consequently, the whole picture is never quite understood.  You can investigate all you like, the public will know you are investigating, but despite all the investigation, CIE, probably because of their complexity, are likely to be the least understood by the public.</P>
    <P>On the question of their remit from the State, sometimes this has been confusing, sometimes contradictory.  If they have to provide adequate and efficient public transport services, including socially necessary but unprofitable ones, they have to operate commercially.  To constrain their deficits, CIE themselves have had to decide which services were socially necessary and which would be discontinued. Therefore, when you come to the question of a decision to cut back or abolish certain services, you have to have some reversals in this thing.  Some political pressures said that you cannot go that way, so it does not happen.  Possibly the pressures have come down the years from Governments who first introduced something and then on the way the pressure reversed that process.  Consequently, the position now is, on the one hand, you have a degree of measures to start making changes in it.  Then you criticise the size of the deficit and then after pressure you realise that you have not established sensibly the criteria for dealing with that socially necessary aspect of CIE and supporting them on that basis.  This has been <Col N="820" /> a failure of Governments down through the years.  It is a real problem for all Governments.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with a situation where many of CIE's services are definitely of a commercial nature but this has not meant the CIE could enter into the ruthless competition which would have injured private operators of a similar service. The private operators could enter into the ruthless competition that could affect CIE.  They are at a disadvantage there.  This is due really to their unacceptability to the public eye or to Governments who by and large down through the years, have favoured private enterprise.  The favouring of private enterprise over State enterprise always brought forward in the people who were bringing in the idea of change and rationalisation, the whole question of the free market operation that Senator Kirwan dealt with so cleverly and so well.  The whole competitive behaviour in CIE in those conditions obviously did not have regard to the question of the social aspects of the company and how difficult it was to get the support on that basis rather than on the basis of being a commercial enterprise and thrown wide open to the whole question of competition.</P>
    <P>Because of the whole scene with regard to railways down through the years and the hatchet job of 1957-58, in current conditions, without understanding the thing fully either the public attitude might result in accepting advocates of the idea of the question of development of the road passenger and road freight which would act to the detriment of the railway and which would call into question of the railway.  Quite clearly, this is a very worrying area of concern.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about the question of rationalisation, we decide to split the company up into three companies. Then arising out of those three companies we are bringing in the question of competition from people who can be very ruthless when it comes to the question of competition.</P>
    <P>Some way or another it has got to be put on the record that there is a history <Col N="821" /> to CIE.  It is just as well that we might know something about that history.</P>
    <P>Between 1950 and 1956 the railway system was largely converted to diesel traction.  It was hoped that this would improve the company's finances but losses continued to mount despite that move for efficiency in 1956.  Again, possibly, due to the social aspects not being properly considered.  The Government on that occasion commissioned an economist to report on CIE.  That results in the Beddy Report of 1957 in which there was the conclusion that the railway should be abandoned without any serious consequences to the community and recommended the closure of all but 56 of the 373 stations and the integration of the bus and rail service.  Historically speaking, the fears expressed by Senator Kirwan and myself and the workers in CIE are very well founded on that basis. The situation is aggravated a little in this respect having regard to the fact that, under section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, it is possible for someone to decide by ministerial order that a railway branch line would close down and the hauliers in the area could come into the CIE stations, get details of what freight or what transport were available and other information that would be useful for them to go into competition with other parts of the railways.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I am reading this section wrongly.  The worrying aspect of this is that it is not down as one of the repeals of the present Bill.  The section goes a bit deeper but it seems, on the surface, that that is the general tone of the section. Even though some guarantee may be given in the course of winding up the debate, if there is an Act that is repealed that leaves the situation loose in that the Minister by ministerial order, without reference to the Transport Authority Act &mdash; not particularly this Minister but some other Minister maybe or some other Government, could walk in and, while there are guarantees under this particular Act but because another Act exists and has not been repealed, it is then quite possible that a problem would arise in the sense that the competition which we <Col N="822" /> feared originally from the beginning and which may have marked the deathknell of the railways could become a reality.  It could be an impediment to competition which they might enter into so that would make them that much more vulnerable. The fears are there and rightly so.  Somebody has got to stand up and allay those fears before this debate concludes.</P>
    <P>In the Transport Act, 1958, it was recognised that CIE could not be expected to make a profit.  A subsidy of £1,175,000 for each of the five years ending 31 March, 1964 was provided.  In the same year the great Northern Railway Board was dissolved and the section of the system in the Republic was allocated to CIE.  Arising out of that, many railway lines were closed in 1959 and closures continued every year up to 1963. The most controversial closure was that of the Harcourt Street line in 1958. Generally speaking, whatever else we might have thought about some of the branch lines, the actual decision to close down Harcourt Street was a public decision. It is now widely recognised as a bad decision.  Probably in strict financial terms that policy was a success.  At that time the profits on the Dublin service were not in a bad way and the operators were allowed to keep the profit.  That enabled them to remain within their subsidy.</P>
    <P>Another point which emphasises the concern about the whole question of railways as being vulnerable was dealt with by Senator Kirwan.  He dealt with the aspects both of the provincial buses and the railways.  He sees that either one can be actually vulnerable.  I would agree with that.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that railways are vulnerable.  A subsidy was provided for in the Transport Act, 1964 for the following five years.  In that case it was £2 million.  Again, CIE were instructed to balance revenue on expenditure.  This, of course, led to a further series of closures and, consequent staff reductions. There was one success, too.  There was a bulk rail freight service which carried 250,000 tons in 1964 to more than one million tons in 1969.  The overall deficit <Col N="823" /> increased only slowly during this period. A rapid increase in rail deficit was offset by profits in other areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to come to the point I made earlier where there was one series of line closures.  Is it any wonder that people get scared when rationalisation programmes are introduced?  The situation is bad enough with a private employer but where the State is the employer and it is the body that introduces legislation and gives the type of protection that is necessary and the amount of encouragement to go along with the question of rationalisation in making the company or institution more efficient and so on.  It is sad if, when that type of legislation is introduced, the proposals embodied in it keep the fears in the minds of the people who have to represent workers and try to get the best deal they can for them.  Having done this, the legislation still persists in having proposals embodied in it that keep those fears alive.  If one has regard again to the industrial relations situation down through the years, if that is the way the company have been behaving down through the years, the question of bad industrial relations can be well understood.</P>
    <P>For example, we are talking about investigation into CIE.  People have made many complaints about CIE.  There are certainly no complaints about non-investigation. As a consequence of more problems in CIE which were never properly resolved, particularly those of the railway, the Government commissioned the 1970 McKinsey report.  At that time provincial bus tours and hotels were profitmaking. Dublin city services and road freight were breaking even.  The railway side was, in fact, making a loss.  The report concluded that on purely financial criteria a decision to close the railway down would be more expensive to the nation than to improve the financial performance of the company, that is, the current financial performance on the basis of the 1970 report.  That is the financial performance of the railway.</P>
    <P>They suggested that this might be done <Col N="824" /> by making selected modifications in certain areas and some investments in the rail system as a whole.  In the following years, a number of changes were implemented, for example, in the railway system.  There were faster passenger trains, air conditioned rolling stock, the introduction of block freight trains, the rationalisation of freight railheads, the mechanisation of Sunday traffic, improved signalling but despite all that and all the co-operation they got, a limited number of closures were involved.  If we go back to the 1957 Beddy report and follow on to the 1970 McKinsey report we find that the railway has been taking a hammering.  It is quite clear where the underlying fears of the staff lie.  After the 1970 situation the financial position worsened rapidly despite closures.</P>
    <P>Several reports have been published in recent years.  For example, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies published a report on CIE in 1979 and there was a report by the economist, Sean Barrett, which was published under the title <i>Transport Policy.</i> From my discussions with the people who represent CIE workers and trade union officials, I have found that the majority of those who read Sean Barrett's book believe it contained a variety of inaccuracies and out of date statistics.  As a result of this CIE were discredited.  It seemed to the workers that this was deliberate.  I am not totally <i>au fait</i> with the contents of that booklet and I am not making the charge that it contained inaccuracies but people who are experienced in this area hold that view and have passed it on to me.</P>
    <P>Much of the analysis of the railway, for example, Sean Barrett's book, was based on a comparison of output.  This is the allegation made by the workers whom I spoke to.  They believe that he compared a nine months period in CIE in 1974 to a 12 month period in British Rail.  If that is correct and if the allegation is correct there is no way he could make a correct analysis.  Even if he did not compare the nine month period in 1974 against the 12 <Col N="825" /> month period elsewhere the fact is that it is not very easy to make a comparison with the rail systems in Britain.  I say that having regard to the way our transport is integrated.  There is probably some doubt about the results that Sean Barrett produced on that occasion.  If I were to make a case for Guinness workers who were loading ships at the North Wall, it would hardly be relevant for me to say I wanted for them the same rates and conditions as apply to dockers in Manchester or Liverpool.  Consequently, the book was probably an intellectual exercise.  I do not know whether it served any useful purpose for CIE.  The workers did not believe that it was done fairly and they expressed a lot of concern about it.</P>
    <P>The Transport Consultative Commission issued two reports.  The first was in March 1980 on transport passenger service in the Dublin area.  The second was in 1981 on road freight haulage. Again more rationalisation resulted.  I am stitching this point into the record deliberately because in the public eye it is believed that inefficiency has been allowed to flow on uninterrupted, that there have been no investigations, that there has been no agreement from the workers to rationalise the situation, no thorough investigative procedure before strikes broke out and so on.  All these reports are there and they are all in the history of CIE.  Unfortunately it is not that easy to get that across to the public but it must be made known to the public in the course of this debate that CIE are probably the most investigated company in the country, certainly the most investigated public body, and, as I said earlier, the least understood.</P>
    <P>Arising out of all those investigations and as a result of the Beddy report in 1957 railway lines were closed.  As a result of further investigations and reports there were more closures of railway lines. Many other alterations and changes took place inside CIE which we do not hear about in day to day discussions between people.  It is necessary for this type of debate to reassure the public that much has been happening in CIE and that it <Col N="826" /> has not been let drift.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time we have tried to deal with the rationalisation of CIE.  I hope that on this occasion this Bill will be more humane when it comes to the question of dealing with the employees of CIE, their families and the people who depend for their livelihood on the spinoff of CIE.</P>
    <P>The public do not think very often about how CIE were set up.  Their origins lie in the compulsory amalgamation of the various railways in the Free State into the Great Southern Railway Company, the GSR, in 1924.  In 1944 the Transport Act provided for the abolition of the GSR and the Dublin United Transport Company and their replacement by a new company, Córas Iompair Éireann.  The new company came into existence on 1 January 1945 as a publicly controlled private owned company.  The intention was that the profits of the DUTC should cross-subsidise the railway operation.  In 1947 there was an almost total cessation of rail passenger service due to a coal shortage as a result of the severe winter of that year.  That contributed to a heavy deficit of £1 million.  The following year the Government commissioned a report into internal transport in the Republic of Ireland.  The major recommendations of that report were that rail, road and canal should contribute equitably to the unkeep of infrastructure as part of a national system, that branch lines should be retained when that was in the public interest, that the Government should meet interest charges and that steam traction should continue in the railways. However, the company's losses continued.</P>
    <P>Despite all that has gone before we are in a situation now where there is a proposal before us to divide the company into three.  The fears being expressed by the labour movement &mdash; the Labour Party and the trade union movement &mdash; are that despite all that has been done and despite the recognition, very reluctantly, on some of the occasions of investigation on the question of the social aspect of it, the railways have never been able to pay their way.  This will present a difficulty <Col N="827" /> when we come to the question of the two versus three companies.  We will see the same thing happening again if the competition becomes too heavy the people who are responsible for reporting back to the workers will go back and reassure them. They will hold a ballot and it will be accepted.  The railway will then go to the wall because we will not have provided enough protection in the Dáil to give it a proper chance under its new organisational umbrella.  We need to give it a proper place in the competitive field.  CIE was finally nationalised by the Transport Act passed in June 1950.  The Grand Canal was taken over at the same time. The Company had responsibility for all rail and inland waterways and most public road tansport operating wholly within the Republic.  They were required to see that an efficient, economic, convenient and properly integrated system was provided. They were also required not to make a loss.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point of their being required not to make a loss, the company was integrated with the canals and some companies who used canals, such as the milling companies, the flour millers and Guinnesses Brewery used to send much of their goods by canal barge.  They decided that it was no longer efficient. Having a couple of horses pulling the canal boat up through a lock was not the way.  It was too slow and so a new method was introduced.  On the basis of the latter report I referred to, CIE now find themselves at the whim of the private companies who do not need their services any more.  To meet their own competition they dispense with the service that CIE are providing and as a result this throws CIE into a loss situation.  The point I am trying to get across is that it has been proved by investigation that it is very difficult to make CIE a paying concern, but that it is possible to make it efficient, have good safety standards, good air conditioned carriages for passengers, etc.  It seems that it is a mammoth task to try to make CIE, no matter what you call the new companies or what way you frame them, <i>in toto</i> go into competition where <Col N="828" /> it is very vulnerable to the private side of our enterprise and expect them to come out of it making a profit.  Not only are they not liable to make a profit but, if we insist on having three companies and put one of their own companies into competition with the others, without any kind of supervisory board it will not work.  One of them will hit the wall as a result of that.  No matter what undertakings the Minister gives on the question of conditions of employment etc., the staff have to be clear in their minds that the parent company will be responsible for any redundancies that will result and for absorbing that labour.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question of rail workers suddenly becoming redundant as a result of this unfair competition.  What happens?  Can you take a man who was a driver on the railway and find a suitable spot for him in the parent company?  It is very hard to give any meaning to an undertaking like that.  At least some sort of undertaking of the nature of protection of employment is essential.  The distinction between a guarantee of redundancy payment and a guarantee of a job is a very big one.  There are enough people on social welfare who are waiting for jobs, without us &mdash; when we have an opportunity to try to protect jobs &mdash; adding to that by not taking care of the way we word our legislation and by not giving as much security as possible in the context of the overall situation that CIE will subsequently be thrown into if this Bill is passed in both Houses.  Therefore, we naturally welcome proposals that will rationalise CIE but when the proposals contain a danger for public transport in Ireland as a result of a series of investigations that have never been very successful except for the co-operation the workers gave which brought about some success, we should get in and do something about it.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that at least CIE is not being broken up <i>in toto</i> as was recommended in the McKinsey report of 1980. What was of grave concern to the people who are actually dealing with the workers, the trade unions was that nothing had been clearly agreed or finalised, yet <Col N="829" /> rumour was abroad that the chief executive was advertising for people to apply for positions in these companies that were going to be set up.  That, if it is true, seems rather an extraordinary way of going about industrial relations problems. Certainly, and I will be quite frank about it, when I was representing workers I would not have stood for that.  I do not know if it is true and I am not putting it on the line here that it is true but it was something running through the minds of the people who were in the course of trying to have constructive consultation. They were faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> in that the top man responsible was actually advertising for people to take up positions in companies that have not yet been legislated for.  That seems to be a little bit extraordinary.  Maybe I am getting it wrong.  It could be that a certain kind of executive was needed and it was advertised in that way.</P>
    <P>We must take into consideration all of those things and the knowledge that the workers have from the various investigations down through the years and that what it means to them is the question of jobs, pay and overall job security.  We can understand their views.  We would be very remiss if we did not put it as hard as possible to the Minister that it is imperative that the Government give to their employees the best possible that is available.  I frankly do not think that this Bill will do that.  I think there are many factors in it that need to be looked at and I will refer to one or two of them.  I hope that as a result we can introduce some changes that will make it a little more palatable for the people whom we would like to see protected.</P>
    <P>By protecting the staff and getting their agreement on rationalisation and getting them to work the system you are also protecting your customers.  That is very important.  God knows people have heard me labouring the right of the community often enough.  I do not shirk from it now.  There is a way of dealing with this so that the community's interest can be protected and the workers' interest can be protected much more effectively without denying the community its right <Col N="830" /> to efficient service, cheap fares etc.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the full proposals are going to be when this Bill becomes law because obviously there is going to be more consultation with the unions.  It should not be on the basis of a <i>fait accompli</i>&mdash; take it or leave it.  If we make the alteration at this stage it will certainly ease the situation a great deal when the company is established, whether it is two or three.  The more we put into the legislation as regards security of employment and the other guarantees that are necessary, the better it will be for industrial relations for the future.  As I said earlier on, industrial relations have been a terrible bugbear in CIE.  I said I was not happy about the whole question of worker directors.  I am not suggesting in the course of rationalisation that you can enter into anything else.  It is not the be-all and the end-all of things.  There has got to be something below the board of directors to make industrial democracy work properly and possibly this is where the company missed out down through the years.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party would be opposed to the measures that would permit private operators of road transport further opportunities, because of the vulnerable situation our people would be put into, to provide, for example, scheduled or stage carriage services.  Such operations which may operate profitably at peak demand thereby tend to undermine those off-peak socially necessary services which are not profitable.  We do not go along with anything that would present further opportunities.  The opportunities that have been there in the past have been taken up.  Profitability will become the thing when the social end of the service which cannot make a profit will fall foul of these other opportunities that are thrown open to private operators. Naturally we are concerned about this as well.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Road Transport Act it is the Labour Party view that the licence to operate road passenger services should continue to be controlled as at present.  I do not think there should be liberalisation in the conditions under which licences are <Col N="831" /> issued.  The law should be strengthened and enforced to eliminate the activities of illegal and charter bus operators.  We specifically as a Labour Party would want to defend the integrated public transport structure which exists in CIE as presently constituted.  We would seek to extend it wherever possible and to improve its coordination etc.  I mentioned earlier that we do not think the Bill is going the right way about satisfying the minds of the people who have to give effect to this service which is meant to be more efficient.  As a consequence it is better that we pay much more attention to the attempts at present to introduce legislation that might help in no way towards good industrial relations, job security or to allay the fears in general of the people in CIE who should be entitled to look forward to long years of working rather than being faced regularly, through investigation procedures, with the threat of redundancy, closures, etc., hanging over their heads.</P>
    <P>On the question of the proposed restructuring, the component of social necessity in each of CIE's services by road and rail must be clearly identified. Nobody has done so yet.  In some of the investigations there has been a broad sort of reference to it but it has got to be clearly identified.  As far as I am concerned, like it or lump it, we are stuck with this component and it must be paid for by the State, even by going to the point, if necessary, to show it above the line as revenue on the company's accounts.  That is the way we look at it. The way we further look at it is that an end must be brought once and for all to the nonsense, and that is what it is, that somehow public transport can in general be operated in modern conditions on a commercially profitable basis.  I frankly do not think it is a possibility.  The whole question of the social concern must be re-emphasised and identified; otherwise we are going to be faced with bad relationships which we have had to overcome in recent times.  This will arise because fears have not been allayed in legislation.</P>
    <P>Many of the CIE services especially in <Col N="832" /> Dublin need to be re-examined with a view to restructuring.  We would not argue about that.  We appreciate the DART feeder service.  It is a welcome development in Dublin.  We would even go so far as to say that perhaps further traffic management schemes might be essential to give more effective use or more priority to public transport in our cities.  That is something we would see as necessary as well.  I hate coming back to the Harcourt Street busway but it is on everybody's lips.  We in the Labour Party think of the Harcourt Street busway as being constructed as part of the Dublin rapid rail transport plan.  We welcome the one man bus operation even though it took a long time to come in.  It is hard to put the finger on who is actually responsible for that.  I do not know if I am correct or not but if memory serves me right the Tavistock Institute made an investigation into industrial relations in CIE about 25 years ago.  I am not sure whether the people at the top wanted to know too much about that because I do not remember any effective industrial relations ever arising out of it.  After all, if somebody commissions a report and the report makes recommendations and there is no follow through or if there is difficulty, it will certainly be highlighted in the press.  I cannot remember any outstanding effort to bring about changes in the industrial relations code as a result of that report.  If there is to be a central bus station for Dublin consideration should be given to the question of its construction in the sense of its being part of the rapid transit system.  We are concerned about the railway.  The Labour Party recognise that the railway has an important role to play in Irish public transport and we see it as playing that role for the foreseeable future.  We see it as an indispensable alternative and complement to the main roads.  It is unrivalled in speed, comfort and safety for passengers. It has an important part to play in freight transport and in carrying heavy and bulk loads and dangerous substances.  If the railways are to be weakened how is the efficiency in those areas to be maintained?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> If we are to keep in mind the question of the transportation of bulk loads and dangerous substances and if we are to maintain speed and comfort for passengers we can hardly set up two companies to compete with one another.  One might start to reduce the other to so weak a position that the essential matters could not be dealt with as efficiently as might be the case in a much bigger situation where there would be much more supervision and a much more efficient input.  I do not know where the railway operation stands with regard to competition on the internal air transport but it is certainly fuel efficient and it has long term potential for automation.  It is obliged to maintain its own infrastructure.  As a result of this obligation there is an unfair burden on the railway compared with the roads. There is a distortion between the two in terms of competition.  The Government should fund railway infrastructure in the same manner as it funds the roads.</P>
    <P>We are happy with the rail electrification. We should continue along this line where possible.  We are hopeful that the rapid rail transit system may find its way to Tallaght, Clondalkin and other areas of greater Dublin.  Such places, too, as Lucan, Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth can be regarded now as forming part of Dublin, for instance.</P>
    <P>There are other CIE services, in addition to the railway, the road freight service. When one is dealing with the question of the road freight services one has to define clearly what the role of the railway is in freight carrying and decide exactly what is most appropriate for it to carry.  The road freight haulier side of CIE is not given sufficient opportunity to compete with private hauliers all over Ireland.  That is an area which could be developed.  There are the questions of permitted weight, safety precautions, vehicle emissions, working conditions etc. which are all problems.  We would want the regulations in these areas enforced vigorously.  We believe that such an approach can be made to both road freight and the railway.  If we enforce the conditions properly in respect of both, not only should CIE road freight go into <Col N="834" /> greater competition all over Ireland but if the operation is supervised correctly it could have very beneficial environmental effects.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with the history of reports concerning CIE and I want to make some observations about what the Bill represents.  One of the special cares of the Government, that is the employer, is to secure employment for the benefit of the families of their employees.  I did say in my contribution earlier that this Bill does not offer that security.  This is the nub of the problem and it is aggravated by the question of three companies as distinct from two.  We have a situation here whereby people are employed by the State.  They are employed to provide service which is useful to many others in society in so far as that service satisfies the needs of many.  It is the forging link with the social needs of society.  This is a very important aspect that is generally overlooked when we come to the question of rationalisation, threatened or potential privatisation.  The ownership of the means of production of that service is not like ownership on the private side which is vested in the hands of relatively few people, for example in the case of capitalism where the means of production &mdash; lands, factories, mines, etc. &mdash; is in the hands of a few.  The State in this case is the owners.  Consequently one cannot deal with the problems by following the lines of capitalism whereby the inevitable results will be that the three companies will go their separate ways.  I hesitate to say it but at least one of them will find its way into liquidation or receivership. The least profitable or nonpaying side will be left in the hands of the State.  The survivor of the competition between the provincial buses and the rail will be on offer to private interests.</P>
    <P>That is the way I see it developing if we do not take another look at the Bill and build in some safeguards that can protect the workers and their families. This can be done best by having two companies rather than three.  The idea behind this form of reorganisation can only suggest to the workers concerned that the calculation of the utility or value <Col N="835" /> of all factors of production of this social service is being subjected to the criteria that apply to the production of commodities. They are not producing commodities. They are producing a service.  There is no way you can deduct the expenses from the receipts of businesses when you are dealing with a national transport service which has a substantial built in social element.  One cannot measure this State company by the criterion of keeping prices high and production costs low so as to maximise profit.  It does not work that way.  The Bill suggests those tendencies. I do not want to say that these intentions are doubtful because I have great trust in the Minister but the workers who do not know the people behind this plan are entitled to have some doubt about the real intentions.  I heard the approach described as a bastardised version of service and co-operation because it was born out of a failure to write safeguards into the Bill I do not know whether that was meant sarcastically but it has been said.</P>
    <P>When a private enterprise goes into receivership the property is taken into consideration when creditors are being paid off but here we are dealing with the whole question of the land and all the other instruments of production which remain the common property of the people.  If it remains the property of the people it ought to be governed by the people for the people.  In that context it must be based on the criteria of social service and co-operation.  The competition which the Bill encourages will do away with jobs in these companies just as happens elsewhere in capitalist societies. It may seem strange for me to make that argument but it is not new.  We have always listened to the argument that competition actually increased jobs and was very good for the economy but if one looks at the nature of competition one finds that there is another word for it and that is the word &ldquo;war&rdquo;.  Some of the advertising we have seen in the papers from supermarkets is incredible.  They are outlining their prices and telling us where they are cheaper and where their <Col N="836" /> quality is better than that of their competitors and so on.  Recently there was the deal whereby H. Williams bought Tesco, held it for a couple of weeks and then sold it to another supermarket chain at a vast profit.  Apart from assisting a selfish greedy system the competitors are saying in essence that if they can get all of the business for themselves, whether that business be in the area of supermarkets, transport or anything else, they do not mind who goes to the wall in the process. We have recent evidence of this as I have outlined.  The criterion is to get every ounce of the market for themselves.</P>
    <P>Can one imagine asking the railways to enter into a competitive field like that? We are often told that competition is the rule of all production, that it is good and stimulates progress.  I was born in 1920 and I do not ever remember competition to the extent that it prevails today.  It is much more violent now.  I think I am entitled to call it a war because that is what it is.  Competition is a nice word.  If people in competition want to be honest about it, it means that at the best it is pursuing your own advantage at someone else's loss and that is what is going to happen to CIE.</P>
    <P>If CIE break up into three companies somebody else will pursue their own advantage in this free market competition situation where CIE will be vulnerable and this will cause a war, the result of which can be only the loss of permanent jobs in CIE.  An example of commercial war is where a certain market is demanding a service and there are, say, 50 different companies who market that service.  Any one of those companies, if they could, would keep that market for themselves.  They would struggle desperately to get as much of it as they could. They may not always get to the maximum but that is what they aim for.  The obvious result is that the market is glutted and the service sinks into cold ashes.  Who do Members of this Chamber think will sink into the cold ashes if CIE, and particularly the railside, is faced with that sort of competition?</P>
    <P>Most of us see the way competition is proceeding in this modern day and would <Col N="837" /> regard it as a war.  It is the whole question of getting the business for oneself.</P>
    <P>Take the worker who is concerned about this situation, the real provider of the service.  How does this scramble affect him?  His boss or higher executive in the eagerness of his own war has to collect into one neighbourhood an army of workers.  When he has them well drilled in his marketing propaganda, he has them equipped for a special task and that task is to make profit.</P>
    <P>However, when the glut comes every &ldquo;private&rdquo; who has been depending on a steady demand in the market and who has been acting in a way that gives him no choice, goes to the wall.  If a soldier has been recruited to go into competition and that competition fails because of the strength of someone else, what becomes of that soldier who is one of those affected by the person who put him into competition? Take it in the context of CIE redundancies as a result of this competition.  It may be argued that the Dáil would have to discuss receivership or liquidation. This would not mean anything other than that they would become redundant by statute.  It is still putting people in a very vulnerable position.  I am not suggesting that you can secure anybody for the rest of their lives.  By throwing them into an area of competition which is war-like, the State as their employers has an obligation to ensure that the maximum amount of protection is written into the legislation which as while not giving them total security, at least gives them a chance of survival.  If they do not survive, a means, although difficult, would be found for absorbing them into the parent company.</P>
    <P>CIE employees have been brought up in an atmosphere whereby to exist was by combination rather than competition. Combination is impossible to the profit makers.  It is necessary for them to have a war.  If the organisation is split into three companies the people who are used to warring commercially will come out on top.  The Government must think more deeply on this.  The competitive principle is driven home by splitting the company. In the final analysis the employees will be fighting for the right to work.  The <Col N="838" /> principle of first in last out need not necessarily apply.  By legislating properly and having a proper understanding of what is involved, and building in the necessary safeguards, we may circumvent much of that.</P>
    <P>If one man survives when he starts competing with himself as a result of other major competition, he is in the same league with people who are at war for business.  He is fighting in a different sense, he is fighting to feed himself and his family.  That can only be done on the basis of depriving someone else.  There is a danger here of cynicism growing into it and someone like me asking for an exhibition of brotherhood.  On the one hand we have major overall competition that puts one of these companies into liquidation.  Arising from that, if it is railway workers who are redundant, and who are not suitable to be taken into the parent company, a war starts as to whether they should be retained.</P>
    <P>The principle of first in last out need not apply.  If CIE have bus drivers trained, it would be difficult for a train driver to say I must be trained as a driver.  If they have enough drivers and conductors on reserve it would be difficult for the railway worker to establish a claim to a job as a driver.  The Minister and his advisers, Senators here might think this is emotional.  Let us look at what happened in the docks: there was a stepping up of mutual antagonism between the stevedores and the dockers.  If someone gets into the queue for a read, someone counted the number of people he needed and the rest had to go off.  All sorts of corruption began to creep into the system.  Certain families started to take control in the docks.  Many abuses arose because of this competition.</P>
    <P>I pay a great deal of attention to redundancies. I and another senior trade union official had the unenviable task of negotiating away 1,100 jobs over a period of five years.  It does not matter how well the people are going to be compensated. We were negotiating away jobs that would never be replaced.  One is caught in the position of negotiating away those jobs arising out of this competition.  Not <Col N="839" /> only were we negotiating away the jobs of the people we directly represented but inevitably the people who depended for their livelihood on being carriers, shippers and so on were also affected by our decisions.  This system continues.  It is a serious matter to talk about putting CIE, through legislation, into a situation in which, based on past experiences of rationalisation, they may be competing with one another.</P>
    <P>We know what happens.  There is great isolation when one becomes redundant or is unemployed.  At a certain age there are no jobs open to an unemployed person. The situation is that one starts to turn in on oneself.  Unfortunately, there is a stigma attached to it.  People consider that one has become a lazy loafer, or something like that.  Unemployment carries a great stigma with it.  Naturally, we become emotional about it.  Of course, I am.  I am not saying all decisions should be based on emotion.  I am not saying that decisions that are arrived at have an element of emotion in them.  While not comparing a football team to Government or any other organisation there is very little forward movement unless there is a little emotion thrown into the arguments leading up to the final decision. It has got to be there.  If we think about the people we represent and have had the privilege of being elected to represent, we will be a little emotional about the situation.  The trade union representatives at the moment who are representing the people in CIE are being a bit emotional about it, of course, and rightly so.  I trust that out of that emotion we will be able to tease out what we believe is the right way to approach this Bill. Perhaps when we get to the Committee Stage, suitable amendments can be put down and will be accepted.  That would alleviate some of the problems.</P>
    <P>That course of action will not solve all the problems.  It will make many of the problems less acute.  We have to think seriously about the Committee Stage of this Bill and deal with the question of suitable amendments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> I believe that the Government is an organisation for the control and security of the rights of people.  When they have their own people, who are employed as a result of the legislation, they have a very serious responsibility to give good example to other employers.  We are dealing with the question of Government being an organisation for the control and security of those rights which the men cannot secure for themselves without regulation.  They must get regulation. The Bill, in my view, does not deal adequately with this fact.  We are going to finish up in the final analysis, with dispossessed people.  If there are not adequate guarantees in the Bill for people who may reach that extreme, then we are in difficulty with regard to the whole question of settled labour relations in a place that could very well do with an improvement in their labour relations.</P>
    <P>I feel that three companies will lead to what I have described as the &ldquo;going to the wall&rdquo; of thousands of jobs rather than the 500 jobs suggested.  The 500 is an obvious figure at this time.  Let the boys loose and let the competition start and 5,000 is not such a big number when we have to have regard to many other things that are happening in society.  I believe that two companies would give the people who are taken out of this large combination a better chance.  At least it would greatly improve their chance.  It would give them a much fairer start.  It would certainly give a more even chance of making the best of body and mind, because with two companies they would not have that extra bit of competition from their own company.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill such as, for example, the formation and registration of subsidiary companies to which we would be opposed.  We would be opposed to the concept of splitting up the company. Any of the proposed three new companies, which would be registered under the Companies Act, could be liquidated. That is the way the Bill is written at the moment.  Perhaps when the Second Stage reply comes, we may get more enlightenment on this point.  If not, we <Col N="841" /> will have to bring in suitable amendments.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Bill seems to conflict with the same undertakings the Minister for Communications gave to the ICTU deputation.  This is the information which the ICTU gave me at a meeting on 25 October 1985.  I do not know whether they are correct in that or not.  The Minister is the one who can answer that.</P>
    <P>The name and capital formation of companies are referred to.  It must be emphasised here that the break-up of CIE into three companies is contrary to the wishes of most of the men's unions, if not all.  If it is enacted, the trade unions see the Bill as being one which will throw the companies into major conflict with each other.  Obviously, if they are in competition with each other you can follow my line of argument about competition: it can only be to the detriment of some of them.</P>
    <P>The principal object of the company can impose difficulties subsequently on the road section.  We are concerned about that point.  It could lead to unrestricted competition between the subsidiary companies, as already stated.  By and large, there are many areas of concern for the people in CIE and for the unions in general.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points. Senator Kirwan was making very much the same points as I have made.  Possibly I have taken a while longer to make them. I have said it in a different way.  Nevertheless, it was necessary to reiterate some of the points made and to try to drive home this point about the Bill being suitably amended to allay the fears and alleviate the concern of the people who represent the workers, as well as the workers themselves.</P>
    <P>I would just like to say that I spoke earlier about the questions of the worker directors and of industrial democracy. Historically speaking, even though the industrial relations are quite good in recent times, there have been problems. Certain measures must be taken with regard to the future reorganisation in the area of industrial relations to see if it <Col N="842" /> is possible to have a supervisory board under the parent board.  If the Minister could not see his way to choose one such board, we would prefer two worker directors and we believe the question of having two is the real argument.  Inevitably, the only way to allay the fears would be by way of putting two workers' representatives, one from the railways and one from the provincial buses, on to that supervisory board.  They would supervise the management of the other two companies. Our amendment would be in the direction of two companies.</P>
    <P>The question then arises even by putting two people on the board, does that satisfy industrial democracy?  Quite frankly, I do not think so.  Industrial democracy is much deeper and wider.  It involves the whole question of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I have a document in front of me which was about to be introduced into Guinness, Dublin, at the time when I had a share in it.  We were at a stage when industrial relations were developing in a deep way.  It started off with a working party and then a steering group.  Inevitably, a brewery council was set up.  We got into the areas that it should represent. Annually, the managing director of the parent company would come over and every employee would be released from work for one hour, over one week, when the company would actually give details of the whole trading position, for example, losses, gains, new enterprises being entered into, the political reasons why they did not open in some other area, and so on.  That has never affected the company in the sense that information leaked out which would be advantageous to somebody else.  It was done openly by way of slides and lectures, and a question and answer session.  It helped to lessen the traumatic effect in the rationalisation programme and following on from that helped personnel to settle down very well.</P>
    <P>Those brewery councils worked very well.  They covered areas such as health and safety, general purposes, pensions and social welfare, economics, communications <Col N="843" /> and involvement.  The council was split into sub-councils.  They had departmental involvement groups.  Perhaps the Minister would read this document: &ldquo;Participation and Involvement in Guinness, Dublin.&rdquo;  It is quite an experience in the question of industrial relations.  It will be helpful not only in the context of future trends in CIE but also generally speaking, for anybody to read it.  Perhaps the Minister for Labour would read it.  It has something that is unique.  It has the potential of developing into other areas. Companies may not be as large.  The consequences are that one is dealing with employees who are best informed about their work, wages, conditions and the whole question of communication and prior consultation.  It deals with communication in an educational way, upwards, downwards and horizontally.  I suggest that it would not be a bad idea if somebody gave it a thought.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude on this particular point by reopening the question of the 1958 Act to show the concern that has been expressed about it.  Perhaps the Minister's reply would give us information which might allay the fears of people who are concerned about their jobs and their futures.  If we do not repeal that 1958 Act, does it not, in fact, make the railways in CIE much more vulnerable? If that is the case, what can be written into the Bill, if anything, to protect CIE? Would the Minister be prepared, if there is no way round it, to ensure that some other Minister or some other Government might not be able to use this method of damaging the railway section of CIE? If it is not repealed under this Bill and if it is there for use &mdash; if I am correct in this, as far as I know one can only check up to 1976 on the question of whether or not it can be repealed &mdash; it is a concern that is hanging over the heads of people. Serious consideration has got to be given to the repeal of that Act.  If the Minister gives his word in replying to Second Stage that we will not find ourselves under some Minister or Government dealing with the whole question of liquidating or getting <Col N="844" /> rid of CIE as a result of that Act, that will allay fears.</P>

      <P>A casual reading of the Bill would probably mean that you could come up with a decision that it is a progressive measure.  Indeed, the Bill is progressive within a given context.  It depends on the ultimate situation as it will develop, say, four to eight years, or five to ten years.  The Bill goes in the right direction.  Like anybody travelling, it is not concerned very much about speed, but about the direction in which they are travelling.  They stop from time to time and ask the way.  The reply is: &ldquo;where are you going&rdquo;?  You say where you are going, and you are then pointed in the direction that suits the person to whom you put the question.  He may put you to the right or to the left because you are at a crossroads.</P>
      <P>This Bill has many crossroads.  Basically, there is nothing wrong with the Bill is a given context.  If in a commercially orientated context the Bill is all right.  If the orientation contains, along with the commercial, vulnerability, exploitation and examination eventually and if it contains the basic social responsibility and obligation to be faced by the Government, then the assurances given by the Minister are more acceptable.  The assurances that I refer to are: first, he dismisses completely, and with justification, the people who talk about privatisation because his assurance says, and states quite clearly, it is not on the road to privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also give assurance about the State enterprise.  In fact, it would seem from his assurances that he believes in State enterprise.  That calls for some examination of State enterprise in our commercial context within these islands, in Europe or anywhere.  There are circumstances in which Government intervention can be considered.  I call it Government participation because it is more positive; intervention is something that we will only bring in the last minute because it is a bad thing.  We should not be talking about intervention at all in our <Col N="845" /> society.  If we have to have it, we will let it in.  State participation is different.</P>
    <P>The Minister, or those who think like him, has indicated clearly by giving Government and Cabinet support to this State enterprise that he believes not only in the maintenance and continuation of the State enterprise of which a basic ingredient must be service to the people in this transport system but also that there is a future for other such enterprises, and that it is not an evil thing for the State to go into virgin territory, untouched by the private entrepreneur for the variety of reasons which I need not spell out: he does not want to do this because it does not seem that he should speculate in this area as it would not produce a profit.</P>
    <P>I am not denigrating profit.  I am making a factual statement.  This is the nature of private entrepreneurship.  I am not saying that it is an evil thing.  We have to live with it.  It is a fact of life.  The State takes over because of a particular failure, or their own failure.  If the State continues to lose against the yardstick of profitability, the people who did not take it over in the first place are the first to claim that the a State enterprise idea and theory is wrong because it cannot make a profit. State intervention happens in the case of weak members of the commercial society.  It also happens in untouched virgin territory.</P>
    <P>CIE is a transport company that is not a virgin unit untouched.  It is a transport system that was obviously going the way of all transport companies in practically all the countries in the world.  It is nothing peculiar to Ireland.  It suffered initially &mdash; and always will &mdash; from the kind of criticism levelled all the time at it even when the Government does its best, as it is doing here, to face up to its social responsibilities in giving a service to the public in general.</P>
    <P>The people who conceived the idea of CIE in the early days were not thinking of labels.  They were not thinking about private enterprise as against State enterprise. They were not concerned about these arguments, lengthy and fulsome as they can be and are.  There is always the attaching label that there is something <Col N="846" /> repugnant about State participation both in the virgin territory and in the weak territory.  Note that I did not use the world &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; again, but &ldquo;participation&rdquo;. These people were not concerned about this.  They saw what had to be done.  They saw that a transport system had to continue and had to be maintained and they did it.  They were pragmatic economists.  They did what was necessary with action.  Now, they faced the problem of the future, too.  Who can tell what changes will emerge in five to ten years in any given situation?  By this I mean that it is difficult in these fast-changing, modern technological societies in which we live to legislate far into the future.</P>
    <P>I would say that if workers are more afraid today about this awful word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo;, there is no such thing as a redundant worker, it is their jobs that are redundant, and not the workers.  This terrifying word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; has specially hit a State-supported, financially-aided enterprise.  This fear would be lessened, if not eliminated, provided the environment produced a higher degree of full employment.  You would not have to wait for the young people to be offered voluntary redundancy or imposed redundancy. They would move out in a full employment society with more opportunities where there would be less apprehension. There is apprehension about the motivation behind the Bill.  Notwithstanding assurances, workers are afraid. I shall deal with that later on.</P>
    <P>I have divided the Bill into two parts &mdash; one part dealing with all the sections appertaining to and impinging on the needs and the fears, the protection and the phraseology in the legislation to protect workers' interests.  The second part is the basic component of the Bill dealing with the companies.  In relation to the two and three company proposal &mdash; I tried to reduce it to simplistic terms so that people would understand more clearly where the issues are and what they are &mdash; we are not talking about two companies or three companies, but one company or two in the provincial areas outside Dublin City.  If it is simplified in <Col N="847" /> this way we will get to grips with the rudiments of the company's proposals and what is behind them.  Is the yardstick to be commercial viability?  I shall deal with this later.  Some of what I have to say is theory.  Other parts of what I have to say will contain some reservations.  It may well be that there are parts of the Bill that I disagree with.  There are some, especially the guidelines section which bears the resemblance of statutory wage control.  I have to be convinced that this is necessary.  If we give what appears to be a commercial, flexible situation to the companies and then have a restraining paragraph in the Bill, that is inconsistent, if not unjust.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that most of what I have to say would be regarded as theory. I support this claim by saying that if we do not get the theory right the practice will hardly be right.  I am conscious that I am examining the question of State enterprise, that we call CIE, and that it is being broken into sections for identification.</P>
    <P>Prior to the setting up of CIE in 1944 it should be noted that the condition of the transport system in the country was such that the decision was right.  The Government of the day had no other option in the face of their responsibility to provide and maintain a transport system to meet the social and economic obligations clearly indicated.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Reorganisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the planners at that time made the right decision in the conditions facing them because the conditions existing then, as the Minister pointed out, had changed over a period of time.  The situation then called for substantial subvention by the Government.  Prior to that there was, as we understand it, cross-fertilisation. There was nothing peculiar about this.  It was not perceived as a national deviation from economic norms and practices; it was happening in other countries.  The financial cross-fertilisation initially contained inside the transport system was replaced by external subvention or subsidy from the people at large, the taxpayers' money through the Government. The obligation to subsidise was never questioned; the principle was accepted. What was questioned and became an issue was and is the ever-increasing size of the subsidy.  When that subsidy was observed to relate directly to a degree of inefficiency some mismanagement and the deteriorating industrial relations along with political complacency, apathy and interference by the Government in a way that did not assist the State enterprise, it is not surprising that the present <Col N="849" /> Government decided to tackle the problems inherent in such a structure.</P>
      <P>It is probably true to say that such an exercise as now proposed in the Bill might have been usefully mounted some 15 or 20 years ago.  The main objectives of the Government have been clearly spelled out by the Minister to keep the deficit under control without major disruption of services to the public or employment, to improve morale and the working environment generally in CIE, to improve the reliability and attractiveness of services at the lowest possible fares and last, to obtain greater transferrency of the allocation of costs between the various CIE activities.  I will come back to that fourth item at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I want to say that no reasonable mind in the areas of politics, trade unions, management, workers and the members of the public could possibly look with disapproval on these objectives.  I want you to understand that I am making a justifiable claim here in the area of efficiency.  I am probably the only trade union official in these islands who gave strike notice to a semi-State company in the Republic &mdash; I operated in Northern Ireland and in the Republic &mdash; that if it did not introduce industrial engineering with the objective of efficiency, I gave them three months before they would have a strike.  That is some claim.  So you need have no fear of the motivation towards efficiency from me or my colleagues in the Labour Party or indeed the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what the people in all the areas I have referred to may question is the means, the methods to be adopted to get to these objectives which I have spelled out, that is the four objectives spelled out by the Minister.  Nevertheless, I have to say that whatever changes in the Bill in its present form are established as necessary out of debate in this Chamber and elsewhere, these will not in my view be of a major character.  They will not upset the direction or the tone of the Bill, but the qualification is that certain conditions must be met.  At the same time whatever about the dimensions of the proposals to amend, the greatest extent of agreement should be sought between the parties concerned. <Col N="850" /> That is fundamental in this experiment.</P>
    <P>At this point it is only right and proper that I make reference to the Government package approved in 1983, as the Minister stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...aimed at not only reducing CIE's cost to the Exchequer over a five year period but also paving the way for a new operating environment in CIE.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>The package also provided for the payment of the subvention above the line in recognition of CIE's social role in providing commercially unprofitable but socially desirable services.</P>
    <P>That is a basic ingredient which must be maintained if we believe that State enterprise in the context of CIE is to continue and be maintained.  The third important factor in this package is to be seen in the statement by the Minister:</P>
    <P>An obligation was placed on CIE to reduce the level of the expenditure in real terms by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1988 so as to obtain a reducing subvention in line with reducing expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the Minister's claim that the targets for 1983, 1984 and 1985 have been met is factual.  I am bound to say that those people who believe that must give credit where it is due, to the initiatives of the Government, the Minister and his Department and to the people who implemented the proposals.  The Minister and the Government are in the happy position that the Bill is now part of an ongoing process, to go into detail, to actually proceed along the lines indicated by the package.  I am not giving credit to the Minister just to please him so that I may get agreement from him in pleasing me on some changes that I want.  I am doing so because it is right.</P>
    <P>If I, or my colleagues, seek changes it is because we believe that they are right. We believe that because they are right the Minister must acquiesce and must agree to make the changes that inevitably will be sought.  The Bill then must be <Col N="851" /> viewed against that background and interpreted as a logical follow-up to the changes established in the three years 1983, 1984 and 1985.  The Bill tables more precise steps to be taken as a means to the four objectives referred to earlier. These could be described as methods of implementation.  I have said already that while objectives will be accepted methods may be questioned: means to get to the objectives may be questioned. There is nothing remarkable about this. There are so many parties involved, it is nearly inevitable.  These changes, as we come across them, on Committee Stage will be crucial and present us with the forum for the crucial debate on how everybody will move forward in unity towards the objectives contained in the Bill.  It is essential that agreement is sought and obtained.  If these appear to be reasonable in the context of the Bill I would suggest that they should be accepted, especially if they do not represent a major departure from efficiency, good management, easier identification of commercial results, good service to the public and the normally acceptable protections for the workforce.  In other words, I do not think that the Labour Party will be unreasonable in the conditions they seek to satisfy.</P>
    <P>The parties concerned in the proposed operations, the Government, the workers, the management and the public representatives in both Houses, are involved.  The role of management at this stage is simply to wait until they see what form the structures will take which they will manage.  Their role will come later in co-operation with the workforce on the ground at the workplace.  That is where the implementation will take place.  We have to examine what kind of structures should be there to implement the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The workers occupy a different position. They are actively involved now looking at the proposed structures, assessing their future role and no doubt stating their views.  They have done this. Their immediate concern is to examine the overall new situation proposed arising <Col N="852" /> from the proposals contained in the Bill relating first, to the terms and conditions of employment and second, to whether the new structures will in any way endanger their future prospects and livelihoods. I am saying that in the context &mdash; I am probably guilty of reiterating or repeating myself &mdash; of not having a proper employment environment but one where the fear has deepened about the possibility of closure and redundancy.  It is imperative therefore that their views are given consideration as well as the views of the public representatives who may put forward suggestions or proposals on their behalf.  In this connection agreement is vital rather than anything which would appear to be imposed.  The latter situation, the imposing of these solutions, would surely not make a positive contribution to the more progressive activation or motivation desired and necessary to make the new operations work harmoniously.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that agreement with the workers is established I should like to examine their role as active participants in co-operation with management in what I see as a progressive experiment always allowing for the qualifications that I have made.  It could be claimed that the management-worker relationship is the most vital element in the working of any service in any unit of production, distribution or business or business complex. It has to be observed that far too seldom has the full potential of the workers' contribution to efficiency and productivity been recognised and usefully employed. Management need the co-operation of workers.  More especially in State or semi-State structures it is important that the concept of partnership is fully recognised and given meaning.</P>
    <P>The basic ingredient of ownership and an unbalanced sense of power in private industry giving rise to conflict does not exist in State enterprises simply because State enterprises are the property of the people, properly understood, and the workers are co-partners in that ownership held in trust by the Government on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I am making the point that we must have a situation of accepting the concept of the people owning the State enterprise and the Government simply holding the State enterprises &mdash; all of the enterprises &mdash; for the people.  Once the concept of ownership on a co-partnership basis is established by proper communication and intelligent participation by all concerned then you do not have the conflict of the power struggle with the property owners that exists in private industry leading from time to time to conflict and bad industrial relations.  If workers can see and appreciate that through enlightened communication, management and workers in such enterprises will be activated by the idea of full co-operation on the basis of partnership, on a common ownership basis, then we should be going forward in a more harmonious manner than heretofore.  Industrial relations should in these conditions improve and produce a high performance record.</P>
    <P>I have said that these matters which will require amendment pertaining to and impinging on the livelihoods, the fear, the apprehension of the workers, the question of closure and redundancy and terms and conditions of employment are negotiable. They are not so difficult and unwieldy that people cannot come to conclusions about them.  There should not be a problem provided each side approaches these problems and the amendments, on Committee Stage, with mature reasonable minds and a compromise, I am sure, will be reached.</P>
    <P>The second part which I said I had divorced from the first part is the question of the company structures.  I already said that people talk about two companies and three companies.  One school of thought is for two companies; another school of thought is for three companies.  I simplify this by saying let us talk about one or two companies outside Dublin.  It seems to me, reading the arguments for two companies outside Dublin that this separateness and therefore competition might reduce proper co-ordination which might lead to the result that the workers are afraid of.  That is the two-company concept. <Col N="854" /> It seems to me that the Minister and all concerned in that school of thought about the two companies outside Dublin feel that they will be able to see the transferency of the commercial enterprise and its operation, the transferency of the costs.  I submit seriously that the same transferency can be seen inside a one company context.  You could have two divisions.  It is an administrative exercise and if that is the only basis on which the Government and the Minister want two companies rather than one all outside Dublin, then it is fairly weak ground.</P>
    <P>Again, it would seem &mdash; properly &mdash; that the Government and the Ministers feel that the two-company structure will in some way that is not clear to me provide the basic ingredients for better industrial relations in so far as management will be nearer, or the boards will be nearer the workers.  I do not accept that. There is a gap always between a board and the hierarchy of management down the line.  The management who make decisions quickly and specifically and operate always having at the back of their mind good industrial relations and less possibility of estranging workers on the job are not members of a board.  It therefore depends on how effectively any board, whether in a private enterprise or a State enterprise delegate the authority to the management on the ground.  That is in the industrial relations department. It is not a matter for the board.  I cannot conceive members of a board of any company walking around the shop floor or the workplace every day to keep in touch with workers.  I can conceive of the delegation of authority outside the managerial hierarchy at the ground floor getting the participation of the workers. That brings me to this point: it is not only a question of industrial relations, important as these are.  It is a question of proper participation.</P>
    <P>Worker directors are one matter.  I was a worker director in the Sugar Company long before the worker director legislation came in.  I made a point of moving among the workers.  Every director does not do that.  It is not a question of the managerial staff on the ground simply <Col N="855" /> relaying instructions to workers as to what has to be done, how it is to be done and in what time it should be done: it is a question of evolving to a situation where the workers are taking part in decisions. In the State enterprises they are actually part-owners of the enterprise and it will be more present to their minds that they are active participants.  Do not ask me about structures.  The worker-directors concept to me is a move in the right direction.  If this CIE experiment, either one company or two companies, is to prove a success, such factors as the structures at the ground floor, at the workplace and quick decisions, given the authority to make them are the essence of success in providing proper worker participation in a company in which they feel that they should be recognised as equal partners.  That is participation. People call it industrial democracy &mdash; to a point.  It is participation so long as the workers see that they are actively participating in decisions, in why things have to be done, in the knowledge which has to be given to them before they understand why decisions are made and what the objectives are.  In other words, I am suggesting seriously that the structures at the ground floor, at the workplace, will have to be re-examined or examined because it is virgin soil, there are no structures at the ground floor.</P>
    <P>The two bases therefore on which the two-company proposal is put forward are fairly weak because these could operate inside a one-company context, one company, one board and, I say, two divisions. That is one option, instead of two companies. Administratively, if you want to see which side of the division is losing money you cannot see it with two divisions under one board and one company. But &mdash; and this is the fear that the workers have &mdash; if you have a divorcement between rail and road outside Dublin workers have this fear that eventually the non-profitable section will not be subsidised. It will be closed in conditions and in circumstances they will not like and they have to be reassured that this will not happen.  They will have to be told with <Col N="856" /> clarity what exactly will happen to them if closures ever come.  It seems to me, to be fair about it, that the Bill is not aimed and is not orientated towards closing: it seems to me that the basic motivation, reading the words, indicates the continuation of the CIE in new format.  I believe that there is no great difference between the one company outside Dublin and the two companies outside Dublin.  If the two company idea is continued with, the workers will feel that it is imposed on them and that they have rejected the basic concept that it actually makes the whole two structures more competitive and therefore more financially profitable. This could be done inside a one-company set-up.  I will finish on that note and come again with my Labour Party colleagues at the Committee Stage to the amendments we feel pertain and impinge on what the workers require but the Minister will have to have another think about the one-or the two-company concept.  People are talking about two or three companies.  I suggest that they think in terms of one company or two outside Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome also the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill as my colleagues have done.  I regard this piece of legislation as being one of the most important that has come before us for some time and it deserves our very careful consideration.  Communication is a basic necessity for any nation and more especially for a country that is relatively sparsely populated, such as our own.  This Bill deals with the major re-structuring of our national transport company, a company that, as Senator after Senator has indicated, has served this nation well for many decades and which has a workforce that is respected throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The local station master, the local CIE employee, in every village and town in Ireland is respected and known as an integral part of the community and is a servant of the population and of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the issue of transportation is relevant to every town and village in the country any action we take or propose to take with regard to CIE will affect every <Col N="857" /> citizen to some extent.  Therefore, we must think very carefully about the multitude of issues that this Bill places before us.  I, like my colleagues Senators O'Mahony, Ferris, McGonagle and Harte, would at the outset like to express serious concern about the Bill in its present form and reaffirm that the Labour Party will be seeking amendments to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party established a special committee made up of trade union officials and CIE workers following the publication of the Government economic strategy <i>Building on Reality.</i> This committee had consultations at that time and, again, subsequent to the publication of this legislation.  While I know and readily acknowledge that the Minister has been most responsive to the points raised in discussions with my Labour colleagues, I wish, in general terms, to re-echo and support the case put last week in this House by my Labour colleagues, Senators O'Mahony and Ferris and reaffirm today.</P>
    <P>I know that it is not the Minister's or Government's intention to weaken the position of CIE workers in a re-organised situation.  I accept that the Minister will see fit to alter the Bill to ensure that that does not occur.  I accept the aims of the Minister, as outlined previously in his own contribution and acknowledge that he, too, wishes to safeguard the rights of workers and protect the transport infrastructure of the country and the rights and conditions of the many people employed by CIE throughout the land.</P>
    <P>While every taxpayer will readily and happily support the notion that State and semi-state companies should pay their own way, there must also be a realisation that transport is a public service and is seen as such in all other countries, even in countries who supported private enterprise is absolute.  The argument is obviously stronger in a country like our own where the need for public transport is more clearly and obviously seen.</P>
    <P>We have not yet faced the decision whether we want such services and whether we can or will pay for them or <Col N="858" /> whether we want State involvement only in the areas which will have no interest to the private sector because they cannot yield a profit to the investors there.  The strategy has been that an integrated system could cross subsidise the weak. That strategy has been in everybody's interest.  That view seems to have lost current favour in a climate where we like to isolate the cost factor of each component element and make value judgments on the basis of purely economic analysis of putting each component under an economic microscope. We must be aware of the cost of everything and the value of nothing.</P>
    <P>The new buzz words on a commercial basis as used last week in this debate by Senator Lanigan no doubt find favour with and are attractive to most people at first glance.  It is of great importance that the resulting structure of any reorganisation would not effectively isolate and allow to die any sector of our integrated transport system.  I know that this is not the Minister's intention and I am sure that he will accommodate reasonable amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill.  The package that can emerge with the proper pruning and the proper redrafting and amending will be of benefit to taxpayers, which is a substantial aim of the Minister.  It will also be of benefit to the workers and to the travelling public alike which must equally rank high on the Minister's priorities.</P>
    <P>I come from a part of the country which has neither a good railway system nor a good road system.  Wexford county roads are simply falling apart for lack of finance.  The current black topping cycle is once in 25 years.  A recent deputation to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment made clear that no further money would be available for county roads.  The situation in that regard is not likely to improve in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>When it comes to railways the people of Wexford are treated purely and simply like second class citizens in this State. Since the start of CIE's programme of new railway carriage building, Wexford has not seen a single new carriage except <Col N="859" /> when one visits Dublin where they are seen heading off to Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway.  Wexford did not even get CIE's second best coaches which are called AC stock.  These coaches were taken off the lines that receive the newest models.  Wexford was left with ancient, uncomfortable wagons which would not be acceptable on mainland routes elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Wexford has for some time been used to carriages which would be described as cattle wagons.  This is often the foreign tourists' introduction to our national rail services.  It is a regular occurrence to have trains without light or heat on the Wexford-Dublin route.  Trains have left Dublin on the Wexford line and, before reaching Bray, having set out in perfect condition, have suddenly become devoid of heat and have plunged into darkness. There is no buffet service on this line for the people to have a cup of tea or a bit to eat.  I understand that the reason given for this is that following the most tragic Buttervant accident the older wooden carriages were taken out of service for safety reasons.</P>
    <P>This is a valid and reasonable excuse. But why is this line constantly downgraded? Why do the passengers on this line fall so far behind in the priority over other mainline routes.  It is no longer acceptable to me or to the Wexford people that this primary line, often the tourists' first glimpse of Ireland and the service of our national transport system, should be treated in such a shabby fashion.</P>
    <P>The journey from Rosslare to Dublin takes three hours and 15 minutes.  One would reasonably expect basic facilities to be afforded to passenger on board a train for this length of time and especially when this line is used by so many foreigners. First impressions are lasting.  They formulate their view of the country they are visiting.  I make an urgent appeal to the Minister to address these problems and bring pressure to bear on CIE to ensure that improvements come about.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Harbour is the main port of entry into this country from Europe for <Col N="860" /> foreign tourists.  It has a railway line running right onto the pier.  It is nothing short of ludicrous to see trains leaving Rosslare Harbour immediately prior to the arrival of the continental ship.  The passengers, in what they can only assume is some sort of ludicrous Irish joke, can see the trains pulling out of the station as they are about to dock, leaving them without the means to get to Dublin.  I am certain that such a situation would not be tolerated in any other country.</P>
    <P>I understand that CIE have planned to build diesel rail cars at their Inchicore works and are awaiting permission from the Minister to sanction this project.  If it was sanctioned, the 180 workers at CIE Inchicore works would not be made redundant at the end of 1987 when the present carriage building programme comes to an end having completed the 124 carriages that are currently scheduled. These rail cars would be ideal for the Rosslare Harbour route.  They can be used as two carriage trains or in much larger configurations in high season according to demand.  They can be scheduled to meet the boats as they arrive and they can also work mainline routes to Dublin and westwards to Cork to facilitate tourist traffic.  The urgency of the situation is again underlined most forcibly when we see the recent decision by British Rail to operate inter-city high speed trains to Fishguard on the Welsh side of the ferry service.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation and goodwill of CIE and the Minister, it would be possible now to provide a thoroughly modern service to the passengers travelling between Great Britain and Ireland through the southern corridor.  This surely is not beyond the wit and capacity of CIE to provide.  It certainly in sheer volume terms would be a profitable operation.  The contribution to the economy from the United Kingdom is obviously very large, estimated for the south-east region alone to be in excess of £20 million annually.</P>
    <P>Briefly, regarding the uncertainty hanging over the railway lines in Wexford someone somewhere in CIE wants the lines around Wexford closed.  That is my <Col N="861" /> firm belief.  Over the last five years the matter of the closure of these lines has come before the board of CIE again and again.  Is there some sort of madness going on with some people in CIE who wish to decimate these lines?</P>
    <P>If the line between Rosslare and Limerick Junction is closed, how are passengers arriving in Rosslare with Euro Rail tickets going to travel to Cork, Kerry, Limerick or Killarney?  The mistakes of the past in closing down lines is very well known.  I mention the lines between Waterford and Tramore and especially the line between Waterford and Mallow which was closed in 1966 and left major towns like Dungarvan and Fermoy without a rail service.  People were told at that time that they would get buses to replace the railways but this has never transpired.  Anybody who is familiar with the roads between Wexford and Waterford, particularly the New Ross-Waterford link through south Kilkenny, will be in no doubt that buses can never replace the rail on this link without a colossal input of cash in improving what is an appalling stretch of road.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that just over three years ago he had to ask the board of CIE not to proceed with the closure of the line between Rosslare and Limerick Junction.  On 10 February 1983 the Minister met a deputation from local elected representatives from the South East Regional Development Organisation, from the South East Regional Tourism Organisation, together with local politicians, Members of the Dáil and Seanad, Members of the European Assembly and the two CIE worker directors, a total of 39 people, one of whom was myself.  On that occasion the Minister remarked that railways seemed to have a lot of support in the south east.  This committee was set up by my colleague Senator Michael Ferris.  I want to remind the House that the feelings of the representatives and people of the south east region have remained every bit as strong and that the people of Wexford demand the sort of improvements that have long been necessary <Col N="862" /> to make it an up to date modern rail link.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a recent development in the railway link to the south east and that is the closure of the Barrow Bridge at New Ross.  The Minister will be aware that the Barrow Bridge was damaged by a ship some three or four weeks ago.  There is a tremendous anxiety in the south east that the accident to the bridge, which has resulted in the closure of the link, will be used as an excuse to carry out a plan to cut off the rail link permanently.  I would request the Minister to reassure the House and the people of Wexford that that particular rumour has no truth whatsoever in it.</P>
    <P>Currently, passengers from Campile to Waterford are ferried by bus.  A train used to leave Rosslare to Campile with passengers and return to Rosslare Harbour but CIE headquarters in Dublin ordered the engine to be transferred to Inchicore and the result is that at the moment no train services exist on this line.  The Minister I hope will put our minds at ease on this question.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the importance of this particular route for the beet growers of south County Wexford.  Wellington Bridge Beet Depot is a crucial factor in the agricultural economy of the south east.  It is the major collection point for sugar beet which is ferried by rail then to the various sugar factories, not only ensuring the survival of those industries which provide useful and welcome employment in the areas but also providing vital and important profitable business to CIE rail.  It is important to ensure that this bridge is fully in operation before the beet campaign starts later in the year. Some two years ago CIE removed the goods trains that ran the Wexford-Dublin route placing another strain on the national primary roads when other countries, particularly the United States, are looking again at rail transportation to take the pressure off road links.  I should like to mention to the Minister and to bring to the attention of the House the whole situation surrounding the operation of private buses.</P>
    <P>Last week Senators Killilea and Lanigan <Col N="863" /> made great play of the services that these private operators are giving to the Irish people.  They never said anything about the illegality of these operations.  I would suggest to them that they reread the 1932 Transport Act where they would find that most of these operators are operating outside the law.  When will the Minister address this problem and answer the question as to whether we have any policy on the matter or any responsibility on the matter?</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Communications was Minister for Justice, the trade unions in CIE met him on this matter and made a detailed submission.  They met his successor, Deputy Seán Doherty, TD, when he was Minister for Justice and have again met the Minister for Communications in his present capacity.  They have asked again and again when will a clear line of policy be taken on the operation of private bus operators and when will the Minister act against those who are operating outside the law?</P>
    <P>Senators Killilea and Lanigan paid glowing tribute to these operators who quite simply cream off the best and most profitable routes, provide a service on imported buses some of which leave a great deal to be desired and free from any obligation save their own obligation to make money, laugh all the way to the bank.  If we want transport to be provided only on the optimum routes at optimum times of the week between our major towns and cities so be it.  Let us state that but let us at least admit that that is what we are condoning by our inaction in this regard.  It is estimated that CIE lost £4 million last year in revenue through the operation of private bus companies.  They do not provide service for people with free travel such as old age pensioners, invalidity pensioners and other categories unless they have cash in hand.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the future arrangements after the enactment of this legislation for the administration of the port of Rosslare which currently is administered and operated by CIE.  It is one of the few elements of CIE which returns a handsome and regular profit.  The <Col N="864" /> Minister might have awoken a somewhat slumbering CIE with regard to their attitude to Rosslare Harbour when he included in <i>Building on Reality</i> the suggestion that there might be a port authority appointed to this harbour.  CIE which did nothing for a considerable number of years to develop and enhance what is a marvellous national asset in the wake of that publication suddenly galvanised themselves into action and made frantic efforts to meet all the interested parties in Rosslare and to present to us the local representatives, to the Rosslare Harbour development committee and to others a magnificent plan which we welcome and endorse wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>CIE went out of their way to take on board many of the modifications suggested by the port users and public representatives and the package that has finally emerged is certainly one that the people in the south east, the people of Wexford in particular, wholeheartedly support and endorse.  The first stage of this package, which involves a considerable investment of public moneys, is building of a custom clearance facility for coaches.  That facility is under way save one.  Unfortunately, it has become a little bit unstuck.  The comprehensive plan is exactly what Rosslare needs and what it needs now not in some distant time in the future.  It was the intention of CIE to fund this capital development from their own profits but not starting until 1987 and having a completion date in 1989 or 1990 at the earliest.  It is important that this project is completed if this important national asset is to be available to the people of Ireland and not wasted because it is a fabulous facility that will enhance Wexford, the south east and the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commented briefly on one particular committee that operates in the area, that is the Rosslare Harbour Development Committee which is a sub committee of Wexford Corporation chaired by the mayor of Wexford and is representative of all the various interests, the port users and so on.  They are concerned at what <Col N="865" /> will happen to Rosslare Port when this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>They have particular interests which they are anxious to press with the Minister. They are the provision of a port development plan that will incorporate the provision of a double ramp to meet the proposed jumbo ferries which will be operational in 1988.  The need for the completion of the port development plan before Spring of 1988, including the provision of the new passenger terminal facilities.  The proposed new Sealink ferry is being planned to commence operations for Spring, 1988.  The Wexford relief road is also planned for completion in that year.  The impact on Wexford will be very severe if the adequate provision is not made for CIE to have the on shore facilities to cater for these developments.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to an article that appeared in <i>The People</i> newspaper Wexford on Friday last, May 9, headed &ldquo;Government Red Tape May Stop Work at Rosslare Harbour&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>Government red tape is holding up a multimillion pound development at Rosslare Harbour.  Sanction has been given for a new customs building at the port, part of a £5 million package, but the Department of Finance will not release the money.  Now the port authority, CIE, has warned that work may be stopped on the building.</P>
    <P>The hold-up is another blow to the Rosslare Harbour Development Committee &mdash; already pressing for an early completion to the overall development project.  I wants the CIE package to be finished two years early to help attract a £60 million Sealink investment in the port.</P>
    <P>I have motions from the National Union of Seamen calling on CIE to expedite the onshore developments needed in the port.  All the interests in Wexford underline again and again how this vital national asset has been allowed thus far to be wasted, and they now call for action.  At a recent meeting between the Rosslare Development Committee and representatives of CIE, a spokesman for <Col N="866" /> CIE, Mr. Finnegan, indicated that the money would not be available to CIE until 1987.  I appeal to the Minister, as I have done privately, to take a personal and direct interest in this matter to ensure that this commercial development is allowed to come into immediate fruition and to use whatever it takes to get across the bureaucratic red tape which is holding up the implementation of a scheme that all parties involved, port users, local authorities, CIE, agree is in the national interest and will not be another white elephant but rather will be a proper use of public moneys that will bring profit to the port and great benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Bill is of vital national importance. It impinges on every village and town and affects, to some extent, every citizen.  It is right that we have taken care to ensure that the Bill which is passed in this House meets all the criteria laid down.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the specific problems of rail and transport in Rosslare Harbour and the amending suggestions put forward by the Labour group so that the Bill will provide us with a comprehensive and integrated transport system for the benefit of all people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of being repetitive in what has been a long debate on Second Stage on important legislation.  I pay tribute to the Minister's opening speech on Second Stage for provoking such a debate.  It was a very interesting speech.  When I look back over the Dáil and Seanad Official Reports on the introduction of amending legislation in relation to transport, there are few so complete reviews of the history of the public transport system from the early days of the foundation of CIE as an integrating mechanism to its present difficulties. Equally there are brave personal statements in the speech which have themselves been provocative of the discussion we have had so far in this House.  There is no need for me to be repetitive because there has been a current running through the speeches made, particularly those by Labour Party Senators. Senator Flor O'Mahony spoke for all of us when he spoke about such <Col N="867" /> amendments as are necessary in the areas of protecting workers.</P>
      <P>My few words are motivated by two or three rather personal matters.  I am probably one of the most frequent CIE users in Leinster House.  I travel by train from Galway to Dublin frequently, sometimes once, twice or three times a week. I have another experience in relation to railways in so far as part of my childhood was spent living in one of the railway houses and part of the duties of the tenants was the opening and closing of level crossing gates.  I have spent a great deal of time listening to arguments and the case for people who gave their lives to CIE, pensioners who have told me what they felt about the inadequate pension provisions.  Where I lived as a young person in County Clare was once integrated into the Limerick market place in a curious way.  The small station which served us locally was one which brought women who had made butter, people with eggs, people with different products, who were going to the market place to sell their products.  I am not arguing that that state of society should be assumed to exist in 1986.  Where it is relevant is that at that particular time it was suggested that these people who were integrated into the local economy would be facilitated by the substitution of bus services for rail services.  As it happened the bus services could never have materialised given the road network that was involved.  In other words, there was no real connection between roads, rail and buses.</P>
      <P>In relation to my last preliminary remark I had a very interesting experience yesterday of a combination of provincial bus and rail services.  The train from Dublin to Galway stopped at Athenry.  It ran into difficulties.  All passengers were transported courteously by CIE staff in buses to Athenry where we disembarked and got on the train.  We arrived in Dublin a little late.  I am pleased to see that another rail user, Senator Dooge, has joined us.  He is one of the most frequent CIE users in Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> These personal reflections encourage me to take an interesting view of the Minister's speech.  I regard it as a brave speech in so far as it reviews the history of CIE.  It also makes the case for a transport policy.  There is a fundamental philosophical error at the core of its thinking and I think of some of the documents from which it derives.  These are not the fault of the Minister.  They are the fault of those who had the power and influence on the board of CIE over the years in giving terms of reference to the consultants they asked to prepare plans for the future of transport.  I make it very plain.  I believe that the terms of reference they gave to the consultancy firms were ones derived more from a sense of panic of demonstrating both financial transparency in relation to the different activities of CIE and commercial viability rather than a social philosophy.</P>
    <P>I will take up a sentence in the Minister's speech as an illustration of what I am saying.  It is sometimes said that we live in the age of the motor car.  I remember nearly 20 years ago attending a seminar on transport policy and these were the arguments made for transportation, the criteria if you like.  Certainly people said that it should be efficient and that it should facilitate participation.  By participation they meant the kind of people I mentioned earlier, people who were from rural communities, and who used the old rail services to travel to the nearest provincial market to sell their surplus products. There is another sense in participation and this is where both Houses have to make a decision.  It is in relation to the non-motor car owning population of this country &mdash; those who rely on public transport, those who cannot afford motor cars, those who are too old to drive motor cars, those who are too ill to drive motor cars, those who are too young, those who are feeble, those who simply were nervous or whatever.</P>
    <P>The argument that we live in the age of private transport cannot ever defeat the principle in transport policy of requiring a transport system that will allow full participation of all of the citizenry.  That <Col N="869" /> is where this issue of the tension between commercial viability and social purpose comes in.  To some extent it is referred to in section 8 of the Bill.  I hope that section 8 will be able to be strengthened to take account of that requirement.  I would go so far as to say that when we look at a future concept of civil law in terms of citizens rights and participation, that the structure of a transport policy which would not enable them to participate fully mitigates their full participation in the society.  I lived in the United States where this is so.  It is a society where many of the people who are in the poorer areas and many of the older people in the ghettos around Boston and so forth are the victims of the absence of a public transportation policy.</P>
    <P>Another purpose of transport in the reorganisation of CIE, which I feel it must facilitate, is industrialisation.  Here one has to ask what system will best facilitate industrialisation as widely spread as possible to meet the demands of a country that is filled with young people who need work and also a country that has changed its industrialisation strategy from centralised industrial provision to more regionalised and localised industrial provision. We have gone in the direction of looking for smaller number of jobs more dispersed throughout the country with the necessary implications of freight movements and of the movements of people.</P>
    <P>There is, related to that, the question of regionalisation.  I could not stress sufficiently the importance of the transport arrangements that exist within a region for a region's sense of identity.  Symbols are important here.</P>
    <P>Even though there was by omission no reference to the future of the western line in one of the principal documents referred to in this debate, I was not one of those who believed, when new stations were built on the eastern side of the Shannon, that this was a symbolic sign to us all to begin making alternative arrangements for getting to Dublin.  I attributed no sinister purpose to that, but others did.  As many of us travel every week we realise what the absence of a rail facility would mean to us.  Perhaps one is talking <Col N="870" /> too negatively in terms of closure.  After all the Minister's Bill, which is the Bill that has come from Government, is not a negative Bill.  What it purports to do is to reorganise.  What I am suggesting is that the documentation upon which it is based is one that is too heavily weighted in favour of commercial viability.  I welcome commercial viability.  I am not one of those people who suggest that every time we spend £1 publicly we have gained something.  There is waste sometimes, and money can be better spent.  You prune a tree by cutting the branches that are interfering in the middle, not by cutting the tree itself.</P>
    <P>This leads me to some of the proposals that have been made.  They must be tested by their implications across three major groups of people.  Firstly, the taxpayers want transparency.  They want to see where money is being spent in CIE and on what it is being spent.  They are getting that at the present time.  There is an increase in morale in the workforce as a result of that.  Secondly, the implications in regard to what the consumer may hope for.  Here is the most difficult one. I believe that there are many people who have no faith in the future of rail, for example.  It is a long time ago since the chief executive of CIE wrote in his memoirs that `Ireland is too small for railways'.  We need people who are committed to rail.  Perhaps I am now making the case for the separation of rail and bus?</P>
    <P>Here I come to another central assumption in the speech on the problems of CIE with which I quibble.  I offer a simple choice to politicians to judge and it is this.  Is it the absence of a transport policy over the years that has created the greater difficulties for CIE, or has it been the absence of an appropriate set of managerial arrangements?  The Minister's speech has come down in favour of the second &mdash; a set of managerial arrangements which allows expertise on buses to be separated from rail in provincial areas and to separate the expertise required for the greater Dublin area from the provincial areas, that this will automatically allow a regeneration of transport to <Col N="871" /> occur.  I humbly suggest that the first option &mdash; the absence of a coherent transport policy that clearly and explicitly builds the entire question of the social purpose of transport, addressed to all these vulnerable communities I mentioned and addressed to the issue and purpose of participation, to regionalisation and industrialisation as well as greater efficiency &mdash; is a more appropriate place to look for the problems of CIE.</P>
    <P>I read too, in the speech of the question of consultation.  Many of my Labour colleagues have spoken on this and I said it is not my intention to be repetitive.  I agree with Senator McGonagle, who laid a particular stress on the meaning of the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  I said I use CIE services at least once, perhaps on average twice a week.  I could not count the thousands of times that suggestions have come from the people who work in CIE about the improvement of services.  If we are talking about a regenerated CIE and one that will be effective, it will have to be one that will build morale by consultation from the bottom up.  A study has been prepared and these are the rough forms of it.  Workers are called in to watch or listen to something and are asked &ldquo;are there any questions?&rdquo; Lever Brothers, when they were making soap, did that in the eighteenth century in Britain.  It is not appropriate in the twentieth century.  If you want to use some rather dubious managerial principles about specialisation at top level management, it also behoves you to look at what has been happening in the history of industrial relations, where they are successful across the industrialised countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>There are a few other issues that have been deliberately mentioned by the Labour group of Senators that are extremely important.  I have often met old railway persons who were multi-generation employees in CIE.  The people were known as railway families because grandfathers, fathers and their children worked in CIE.  They had a commitment that went beyond their own working lives.  Remember this was the <Col N="872" /> strength of the commitment to the company and McKinsey did not even devote a line to this in his report.  They were the people who, if they were at the wage-labour non-salaried level, had a very inadequate pension structure made available for them.  Equally it could be said that there are a number of improvements in these issues which we can debate.  These can be solved and be met by providing by way of guarantee for the kind of participation that I mention.</P>
    <P>There were a number of important points made in this debate.  First, that there has been an improvement in CIE's overall performance resulting in an increase in morale among the workforce. Improved conditions and consultation give a definite future towards transport. This point is very important.  People give their lives to driving large vehicles under great strain, perhaps with not enough passengers on them to be commercially viable and they are the ones who could be taking jobs driving private vehicles as a great danger to public lives more regularly on the roads and in the cities and towns of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will offer an imaginative idea to the Minister.  A Minister for Transport in the history of CIE could have come along and said that he would have banned private motor cars altogether from the city centre in Dublin and made it necessary for people to use buses or taxis to come into the city centre.  That was one of the options put forward in 1966 by one of the principal transport consultants in Ulster. He suggested that the dice be loaded deliberately in favour of public transport. We have allowed a situation to emerge in which the people within CIE have found themselves defending what they should not have to defend.  The day that the social role within transport is abandoned the people who will be abandoned are the non-private motor car owners.  The issue is a very simple one.  It is whether they should be allowed to call the shots and determine the shape of transport policy for the coming years?</P>
    <P>There are issues which have surfaced in the debate which I am sure the Minister, because he has attended here, has given <Col N="873" /> great attention to.  I thank him for this because it is important that these points be satisfied.  It is into section 8 that the social role of transport policy in the future must be built.  There should be some form of guarantee given in relation to the future of some transport provision in the name of participation, industrialisation and regionalisation.</P>
    <P>The second major issue is the fundamental one.  There is no disagreement about specialisation for the greater Dublin area.  I spoke yesterday of a combination of bus and rail that brought me to Dublin.  Why set up wasteful competition between bus and rail?  The previous Senator spoke about those who have no commitment to serving non-commercial routes, breaking the law and entering the transport market and taking £4 million which belongs to the public transport system.  Those people are stealing that money from their fellow citizens.  It is availed of by those who want to travel cheaply.  They are in the same category as people who want to have a bet without paying tax.  There is need for some continued joint use of rail and bus at provincial level and for the elimination of wasteful competition.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in relation to the security of employees, the history of employees is that their protection has been the least when companies have folded.  They have asked for, at least, the minimum protections that they enjoyed under their terms of employment.  They say that under the existing statutory company, CIE, they enjoyed a range of securities and are entitled at least to that.  It makes a mockery of this modern managerialism to say that if you removed those, then you could start saying that when you had broken your umbrella into the three sections you could hope for a better way of keeping out the rain.  I think equally that the whole question of consultation with those in the unions should be better agreed.</P>
    <P>We have had submissions that told us how we can built the company from the ground up.  Consultation from the CIE worker on the ground up to the top is what they want.  There should be accountability.  I pay tribute to the Minister <Col N="874" /> in this regard for making reference to his views on transport policy.  Any changes in transport policy should come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas for discussion in terms of their social implications as well as their commercial viability.</P>
    <P>In relation to the movement of workers, if one moves to two companies instead of one, the transitional arrangements should be ones that give the maximum protection to the workforce.</P>
    <P>Finally, this is the point we have to decide in the end.  It is rather like asking the question: &ldquo;why did people have drawing rooms or sitting rooms and re-arrange the furniture without asking what purpose the room was there for in the first place.&rdquo;  Transport policy of the new age which the Minister refers to in his speech must have two clear components in it. The taxpayers are entitled to transparency in expenditure and to efficiency in expenditure.  There are consumers who are vulnerable and there are many potential future consumers who will use the public transport system and their rights must be provided for in the Bill.  The workers themselves have been well spoken about by Members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I have faith in public transport.  I believe that as more and more of our industrialisation breaks away from great megacentres, even moving now as it has from regional centres down to rural towns and small villages, as settlement and residential patterns are changing with people moving away from the larger conglomertions and as the natural birth rate increases in even the most remote areas, we will deeply regret any arrangement that damaged the concept of an integrated national transport policy.  What is a national integrated transport policy? What we have is some form of that but it could be more efficient if it was given a better chance.  To break it is to take a risk.  I acknowledge that the greater Dublin area is different but in the provincial areas there is a need for the integration of bus and rail if the morale of the staff, the viability of the service and a future for rail in the provinces are to be secured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister is moved to respond in an amending way to what has been said from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Members of the Seanad who are participating in the debate on this Bill to reorganise CIE into a tighter and more effective organisation. Many of the points made reflected the individual experiences of Senators and this added a special dimension to their value.  Some of the points were particularly cogent and relevant to issues raised by the reorganisation of CIE; others were clearly day-to-day issues, which I am sure the chairman and board of CIE, who have been following the developments in discussion of the draft legislation with understandable interest, will wish to examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> I have been greatly impressed by the points made by Senators.  If I can find fault at all with the debate in the House, it is perhaps that due recognition has not been fully given to the achievements of CIE in the past three years.  I recognise that this has been referred to by several Senators, including the last speaker, Senator Michael D. Higgins.  Certainly, it was absent in the contributions from a number of Senators.  Therefore, it is no harm to reiterate that a great deal has already been achieved.  Ever since that last and dreadful year of 1982, there has been magnificent progress in each succeeding year.  It is well worth reiterating this point and to give credit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the credit given to me by Members of the House.  It is important that credit be given to everybody within CIE who feel that they have played a part in this turn around.  Because there is one thing sure, if this House spent its time lamenting further disimprovements in CIE, it would get a lot of coverage: by its nature, praise does not get the same coverage.  Nonetheless, it is important that it is recognised within the organisation of CIE that a great deal has been achieved and moreover it has been achieved without any significant cuts in the workforce and without any massive reduction of service.</P>
    <P>The public discussion, which the announcement of the reorganisation in <i>Building on Reality</i> generated, has reflected what appear to be the major concerns and, understandably, many Senators, too, have dealt with these matters. These points are so important that I feel obliged to reply to them at some length here today.  They take the form of concern for the new structure in terms of the long term future of CIE, the new structure itself, questions of services and finally, but by no means least, the concerns of the CIE workforce.</P>
    <P>A number of Members of the House have criticised the Bill as being McKinsey by the back door.  I reject that claim. McKinsey proposed the complete disestablishment of CIE into three completely separate companies, or in other <Col N="877" /> terms, the complete abolition of CIE. The Government rejected the McKinsey concept.  That is not to say that it rejected the idea that there was no scope for improvements in CIE.  On the basis of the McKinsey report some changes were called for.</P>
    <P>Against the very many criticisms of CIE in years past, I believe that it would be impossible to find a representative cross-section of public opinion which would accept that there is no scope for greater efficiency and effectiveness in CIE.  This is what the Bill is all about.  It is not about dismantling CIE.  It is not about closing railway lines.  It is not about terminating bus or other services.  It is not, most particularly, about decimating the CIE workforce.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not in any way interfere with the rights, duties and obligations of CIE.  It simply provides for reorganisation in the interests of CIE operations and its future.  It is an effort to separate at operational level the various CIE activities into more compact units, more manageable units, which will have a greater potential for responding to needs within the individual unit and to CIE customers. It is an effort to eliminate some of the bureaucratic practices which must inevitably arise in a big, extensive organisation.</P>
    <P>While there may not be unanimity, there is a lot of support for the re-organisation of CIE.  The differences are in the area of the organisational arrangements which are most likely to achieve the results desired.  In considering a new structure for CIE various options were looked at and the Government came to the conclusion that the retention of the board with three subsidiary companies would best serve the long term interests of the travelling public and the CIE organisation.  Some Senators have suggested that it would be more sensible to leave the railway and the provincial buses as an integrated unit.  This seems to have been inspired in the first place by a suspicion that the isolation of the railway was a preliminary stage to closing down the whole railway and, secondly, by a belief that rural bus services would be <Col N="878" /> better served by a no-change situation.</P>
    <P>The following advantages of the approach based on three subsidiaries will interest Members of the House.  They are: the units are smaller, more manageable, but even then it should be borne in mind that the smallest of the three companies will have close to 2,500 employees.  It is possible to have more precise objectives from which management and workers will be able to identify. It provides scope for a more intensive effort by the separate managements in their respective specialised areas &mdash; rail and bus operations are very different. There will be scope for greater flexibility in decision-making and a facility for a quick response to competitive challenges from outside the CIE organisation.  The allocation of use of properties will be a function of the parent board and so any potential conflict can be immediately resolved in a definitive way.  Employees will be closer to management and a separate industrial relations arrangement should be a valuable asset in quickly resolving any difficulties which arise and managements in the individual companies will unavoidably find co-operation in co-ordination of services of significance for their bread and butter.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that these proposals are designed to ensure the future of the railways.  I need hardly remind the House that the Government record in that regard speaks for itself.  The retention of the railway is not, however, a basis or a justification for not seeking an improved performance from the railway or indeed the other services.  Neither is it a basis for avoiding a situation where greater transparency as to where the costs in CIE arise or how they are met.  Greater transparency will yield a more general appreciation of the value for money which the rail and indeed the road services represent for the annual Exchequer contribution to CIE services.  To bring about that transparency it is essential to disaggregate the CIE operation to the limited extent of separating responsibility for railway operations from that of buses.</P>
    <P>The new organisational structure does not mean that the railways and the provinicial <Col N="879" /> buses will go their separate ways. They will continue to be dependent on each other as they are at present and disruptive competition will not be permitted by the board; they will be striving to serve the people better.  It must be emphasised that the board of CIE will have the key role in approving the plans of the companies and in supervising their performances and this will automatically embrace the scope and extent of competition between them.  There will be no unbridled competition between the companies. On the contrary, it will be limited and geared to the overall interests of CIE.  The board will see to it that Irish Bus and Irish Rail continue to provide the best possible integrated public transport service in so far as that is possible and that the rail and road services continue to complement each other.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have referred to the reorganisation of CIE as providing a potential for liquidation because of the change in structure.  Others have spoken of it as a real threat to the three subsidiaries. The theoretical possibility of liquidation or winding-up is there for all State companies registered under the Companies Acts.  The existence of such a risk, no matter how minimal or remote, is hardly a justification for not using the company type arrangement in the interest of using the nation's assets in the best interest of the community.  Such risk is indeed so remote that it can be dismissed for the following considerations:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The dependency of CIE on Exchequer support is well established and no change is planned for altering the financial support arrangements which are now in place for a long period during which there has never been any challenge to the general financial viability of CIE;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the situation does not for a moment bear thinking about if there were no annual subvention and no State guarantees for CIEs capital borrowings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the parent board is a statutory body <Col N="880" /> and changes to its structures, responsibilities, functions can only be brought about by legislation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in reorganisation the board is losing none of its functions but it is delegating the subsidiaries to carry out operational functions on its behalf;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the parent board will be involved in the formulation of the plans of the subsidiaries and is responsible for monitoring the performances of subsidiaries: these procedures would automatically bring to light any financial risks inherent in the activities of the company;</P>
    <P>&mdash;CIE activities are well known and clear and so the likelihood of a new major risk element emerging suddenly can be fully discounted.  The Department of Communications will continue their role in relation to supervision of general policy issues of the board and their subsidiaries and their performance <i>vis-á-vis</i> plans and targets;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the very first objective of reorganisation is to improve CIEs potential for development.</P>
    <P>The general arrangements for monitoring the board and the companies constitute safety nets against financial risks, no matter how remote, of the companies becoming unwittingly involved in activities which would put their future at risk.</P>
    <P>My last point on this issue is that if the theoretical possibility of any of the subsidiaries seeking trade were to become a reality the responsibility of the board of CIE in that area would remain and the board would continue to own all land and buildings, as it does at present. I will be proposing amendments to put beyond doubt that the security of employment of CIEs employees transferred to the companies will not be one whit diminished by this Bill.  In other words the board retains overall responsibility for all the activities which the Oireachtas in legislation over the years assigned to that body.  In the unlikely event that any of the companies cease to trade the CIE <Col N="881" /> board would resume full responsibility for the activities involved and for the employees of the board transferred to the company and the amendments I propose will put this beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Privatisation has also been mentioned as one of the risks attaching to the new arrangements.  This Bill disposes of that argument succinctly and effectively by simply prohibiting the sale or disposal of shares of the subsidiary companies which must remain the property of CIE.  I would like everyone to accept my unqualified assurances that this Bill does not put CIE on the market in any sense, that the changes in organisation are in the long term interest of the country and of CIE and the permanency of CIE rules out the possibility of services being at risk.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators made suggestions about expressing explicitly in the Bill the social nature of some of the CIE services.  The Government are committed to the social role of CIE by their formula for calculating the annual subvention to CIE by paying the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; as revenue for social services rendered.  The CIE capital projects which they have approved, the State guarantees given for CIE capital borrowing and the acceptance of responsibility for the interest charges on DART and indeed for £30 million of the short term borrowing of the company accumulated over recent years.</P>
    <P>May I say at this point in relation to the social obligations of CIE that there are a number of views as to how they should be quantified.  I have looked at what they do in other countries and in the overwhelming number of countries a general assessment is made because, despite the fact that arguments are put forward to this effect, it would be impossible for central government to be assessing the social role of each and every bus route or each and every train route or each and every bus service and each train service.  Moreover it is not wise, in my view, that politicians <i>per se</i> should have a direct role in deciding where an individual service exists and to what extent.  It is because of the sort of interference that such a role implies in the past that CIE <Col N="882" /> had got into such a mess because CIE were not left to run their day-to-day affairs and were not left to make these assessments.  I strongly feel that the role of Parliament and the role of Minister is to say the extent of CIEs operation in general which is the social dimension and pay for it and leave CIE to run their own affairs.  That is the policy that has been pursued over the past three years and it has had notable success.</P>
    <P>The annual subvention is given to CIE to pay for essential services for people throughout the State who are dependent on public transport services which would have disappeared long ago without the very considerable Exchequer support, over £300 million in the three year period 1984-86.  The restructuring of CIE does not bring about any change in CIE's social role.  The CIE social services will continue to be subvented and hopefully as a result of the more compact organisation it will better meet the needs of the travelling public.  The most important provision as far as the social role is concerned is the financial provision in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>There has been understandable anxiety among CIE staff about their future.  I hope this Bill puts an end to that uncertainty. The staff are fully aware of the limited impact of the reorganisation on employment.  The limited number of redundancies occurring in CIE which, I must stress, would have arisen regardless of the restructuting provided for in this Bill, are being dealt with on traditional lines within that organisation.  The CIE workforce have a vital contribution to make in the smooth adjustment to the new structures.  I believe that they will co-operate fully and that their efforts in the future will fully justify the trust which has been reposed in the board and the new companies for the future.  The reorganisation is an opportunity for CIE and their employees to demonstrate the real value of the organisation.  My wish for the new CIE is one of growth based on their extensive assets, and entrepreneureal flair and the very valuable and varied staff resources and skills.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed as I have said <Col N="883" /> at the extent of the pessimism as to the future of CIE in a few of the contributions to the debate.  Some seem to be losing sight of the important turn-around in CIEs financial performances in the industrial relations field in recent times.  For instance it is well worth reciting here in this House that, in relation to Dublin city services which has been the only major problematic area as far as industrial relations is concerned in CIE for a long time, in the past two years almost there has not been one man day lost due to a strike except a few hours lost by a very short strike in the last couple of weeks.  That is a remarkable improvement and I think everybody deserves to be congratulated for it.</P>
    <P>I will also underline as I have on many occasions the importance of certainty about services.  Senator Higgins referred to the fact that there have not been policies by the Minister to encourage people to use public transport services rather than motor cars.  Unfortunately the transport function is not entirely within my Department.  The Department of the Environment does have certain functions in this regard.  However, one of the areas which has led to less use of public transport in the past has been strikes and threats of strikes.  Thank God, that seems to be put in the past.  We have not for a long time enjoyed such industrial peace in Dublin city services as we have for the past two years and long may it continue. I believe if it continues that there will be a substantial growth in the use of the city bus services and a further improvement in the future outlook for all who work there.  When a subvention formula was announced in mid-1983 there were doubters. That has proven its worth and is now recognised for its merits.  I am convinced that the restructuring of CIE as proposed will likewise be successful.</P>
    <P>The pessimism and doubts about the future of CIE are not alone unfair to the board's employees but are outdated.  The CIE experience in recent years has clearly shown what the board's workforce can do and the way forward.  Before I return to a number of detailed issues <Col N="884" /> raised by Senators I think it is only right that we should put this Bill in the context of the future reform of transport, that is in the process of taking place.  This House has already passed the Air Transport Bill and the Road Transport Bill.  These two Bills together with this one which is one of about ten transport Bills which I hope will have been enacted by the end of this year.  We have recently circulated to the House the Harbours Bill which deals with the reorganisation of major harbours.  We have before the Dáil the B &amp; I Bill providing for the finance to cement the reorganisation and recovery of that particular company.  We have already passed the Canals Bill transferring the canals from CIE to the OPW.  There is also the Dublin Transportation Authority Bill which is before this House and there are a few more.  Without comparison, this year will have been the greatest year for legislative reform of the transport area for many many years, if not ever.  Those Bills will also be accompanied by a White Paper on the national transport policy which follows the publication of the Green Paper which was published some months ago.  In turning to a number of the detailed issues raised by Senators I would like to say, first, in relation to the very interesting speech by Senator Higgins, which was the last speech of the debate and which I found extremely scintillating indeed, there has been much talk about a national transport policy.  This Bill is part of a very huge reform of the transport sector, not just the State transport sector but of the transport sector in general in this country.  However, for some people a national transport policy means different things than for other poeple. Of course transport is a living thing and things change and I do not think we are ever going to have a sort of Ten Commandments of transport which are set in stone for years to come.  By the nature of things it is a developing process.  At least we have tried to set down in one document the essential points of all aspects of transport.  Indeed I have been very agreeably surprised by the quantity and quality of submissions that we have <Col N="885" /> received.  I hope that when all the legislation I have referred to is passed and the Green Paper is published, people, both inside the Houses of the Oireachtas and outside will feel that a good job has been done in setting a healthy scene for transport for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Senators Killilea, Fitzsimons and Fallon saw risks of greater bureaucracy in the reorganised CIE.  In fact the direct opposite is the intention and this I believe will be realised.  The management and staff of the individual companies will be in more compact units with the main objective of focussing on their own operations and ensuring that the services offered are the best available.  What is involved is a form of decentralisation in the interest of the travelling public.  This is a point that Senator Higgins also referred to.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea praised the CIE education and training programmes and the board's concerns about safety.  These are very important issues.  The re-organisation of CIE will not lead to any decrease in zeal or effort in ensuring well trained staff with safety as a major priority.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald and others inquired as to the reality of separating provincial bus and rail operations without difficulty. No problems are anticipated arising out of operations from common locations because of the board's role, (i) in allocating the use of properties and (ii) in coordinating on competition issues.  Extensive co-operation rather than competition are envisaged as the general basis for the operating climate.  Several Senators were critical of the names for the new companies.  I have already referred to my own lack of conviction about their aptness and, as I explained, I am considering the matter further.  Indeed I would welcome Senators' suggestions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons referred to the lack of motivation among CIE staff.  The reorganisation should be a base for generating improved morale with management nearer it workers and the customers.  The success of the new companies will be <Col N="886" /> quite dependent on the enthusiastic and highly motivated workforce.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned a number of detailed points which require answers. He quoted from <i>Building on Reality</i> in an effort to demonstrate that the Government are committed to the development of the road network but to retrenchment of the railways.  I am afraid that his presentation did not do justice to the capital allocations approved for railway coaches, railway signalling and communications, the support given to DART and the level of subvention support provided.  Furthermore I have made it clear on a number of occasions that I am prepared to examine on their merits any CIE proposals for capital investment.  This is not to deny the Government's plans for road development. The Government are influenced in meeting the needs of the nation as a whole and roads are also an important part of our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I want to assure both Senator Howlin and Senator Ferris that CIE are reinstating the services disrupted by the accident at Barrow Bridge.  It is being dealt with as matter of priority.  I do not agree that the Bill is in conflict with either what I said to or wrote to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in my letter of 8 November 1985.  I might say in that context one or two Senators were under the impression that there had not been any consultations with the unions.  I want to tell the House that I did have a very productive meeting with the trade unions in November of last year.  I have had several more productive meetings with members of this House and others interested in trade union affairs in the recent past which have also been extremely helpful and constructive.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony also raised a number of issues that I need to reply to. He fears that the Bill, as it stands, will lead to the disintegration of the integrated CIE services.  That point of view was shared also by some other Senators. I hope in what I have already said I will have convinced them that the CIE organisation will continue to integrate their services to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I accept that the CIE audited accounts show costs and revenues etc. in relation <Col N="887" /> to specific CIE sectors and the board's annual reports contain a considerable amount of interesting information.  The accountancy arrangements are not the primary reason for reorganising CIE.</P>
    <P>At present some of the individual items in the accounts have to be included on an allocated basis because some costs are incurred for the CIE organisation as a whole and likewise some of the revenue is based on charges for integrated services. The existence of separate companies will, however, make it possible to identify costs and expenditure actually incurred and received in relation to specific operations. The existing agreements between CIE and the unions and organisations about pay and conditions will not be affected by the reorganisation.  They will continue to apply until they are replaced by other agreements.</P>
    <P>I have taken advice on the use of the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; in section 17 of the Bill.  I can confirm that the word embraces not only land but buildings and permanent fixtures as well.</P>
    <P>As regards the new arrangements for control of fares and rates, I am sure the House will agree that Government control is reasonable because the Exchequer subvention amounts to about one-third of the board's expenditure.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern on the question of policy directions. I should point out that policy directions could not be in conflict with CIE legislation and neither could they relate to day to day matters which are functions of the board and the companies.  The State's overall responsibility is a full justification for that provision.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to private sector bus operations.  As the House is aware the Bill under discussion does not cover the licensing of bus services.  I am, however, very much aware of the issues and problems relating to private bus operations.  Difficulties of operators who are carrying out operations contrary to the law were mentioned.  That is one side but we cannot forget the adverse effects of such activities on CIE and their role in providing socially desirable services <Col N="888" /> which are unprofitable.  My interest in this whole area is shown by my decision to review the Road Transport Act 1932 and the inclusion of an individual chapter on provincial bus services in the Green Paper on Transport.</P>
    <P>There I outlined a number of suggestions for consideration and I intend to plot the way forward in a White Paper later this year.  I have received the views of the various interests concerned in relation to the Green Paper and I will take them into account in coming to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Last week in the course of the debate a number of Senators mentioned the need for discussions with me on some aspects of the Bill.  These discussions have taken place and in a constructive atmosphere. I can understand the continued existence of some concern despite my many and detailed explanations and assurances.  As a consequence and in deference to the views expressed, I have been considering a number of amendments which should meet most of the concerns of Senators and clarify the situation substantially. Indeed, a Chathaoirligh, I have always taken the view in bringing legislation before either House that the very purpose of that procedure is for Parliament to improve the legislation.  I welcome very much the constructive suggestions made by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>My approach has been to take a fresh look at the Bill and to see the possibilities of it for meaningful changes which do not undermine the principles and effectiveness of the proposed legislation but which would clarify issues which are sources of concern.  I have, accordingly, been examining the text as regards the possibility of dealing more explicitly in the Bill with the co-ordination of CIE services, the protection of existing working traditions of the CIE workforce, the industrial relations arrangements, the declaration of interest by directors of the new companies and the possibility of labour interest representation on the subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that some of these issues are complex and I am not, accordingly, in a position to give <Col N="889" /> any unqualified commitments as regards precise amendments today.  Legal implications and legal drafting have first to be got out of the way.  As a result of this exercise, I expect to introduce a number of substantial amendments for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, a Chathaoirligh, may I say that once before I have been involved in a major reorganisation &mdash; perhaps an even more complex one than this &mdash; in the case of the Posts and Telegraphs Services Act. Likewise, during the passage of that Bill I have very many worthwhile suggestions from Members of both Houses and that Bill ended up as a much improved Bill. Then, as now, there was a great deal of concern and apprehension among the workforce of the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think, in the two and a half years that have elapsed, it has been shown that none of those concerns was justified.  Both of those companies are doing exceedingly well, much better than before, and I believe the result of this legislation as amended, will be precisely the same for CIE &mdash; a more vibrant, <Col N="890" /> healthier and better company, and a more efficient company serving the customers well and motivating the workforce. That is its purpose.  Thank you very much.</P>
