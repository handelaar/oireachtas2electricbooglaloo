      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  Since the Minister for the Environment who will be taking No. 1 will be otherwise engaged from 11.30 a.m. until 1.30 p.m., if No. 1 is not concluded by 11.30 a.m. the debate on it will be suspended and resumed at 2 p.m.  It is not proposed to sit beyond 5 p.m. this evening except in the very unlikely event of No. 1 not being concluded by 5 p.m.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate the comments of the Leader of the House on when we will have legislation to cover the events which took place in the High Court yesterday concerning the ownership of the Derrynaflan find of an archaeological value; the legal implications of that case and the implications, in particular, for other objects already lodged in the National Museum?  My reason for raising this on the Order of Business is that I am sure in our discussion when we resume on the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill we will be talking about future events and future protection. If we cannot raise it in that way would it be appropriate to raise it as a matter of urgent public concern under Standing Order No. 29?</P>

      <P>According to the business as at present planned and as discussed with representatives of the groups, the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill will be taken in committee from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.  If completed, the Report Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill will be taken on Thursday or Friday of next week.  In other words, before this House rises for Christmas it will have discharged the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill which, as the Senator is aware, will cover all future cases of this type.  In regard to the case that has passed, there were some indications that there was going to be an appeal to the Supreme Court.  Of course it is a matter for the Government as to whether they would want to introduce special legislation to deal with that case.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 33 to 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; contained in section 4.  I may be incorrect in my interpretation but it appears that the loan definition in section 4 is so designed as to limit the prohibition on the charging of a tiered interest rate to loans made to a member on the security of a dwelling.  It is a little wider than that but just for the sake of simplicity I put it like that.  When it is placed in the context of the power given to the Minister in section 3 &mdash; which is the societies to grant people the authority to make loans other than loans on dwellings &mdash; can the Minister tell me if that is a deliberate decision?  Arising out of my amendment, is he satisfied that the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; will mean that any interest charged on bridging finance will not be the subject of a tiered interest rate application?  It may be anticipated that the definition &ldquo;of a mortgatge of a freehold <Col N="810" /> or leasehold estate or interest in a dwelling&rdquo; is sufficiently wide to cover that but the purpose of this is to tease out from the Minister the reason behind the definition of a loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of a loan as defined in section 4 (3) is to prevent the societies from charging tiered interest rates on loans for the purchase of dwellings. The societies occasionally advanced loans for other purposes and, as they are not part of the primary purpose for which the societies were established, it was not considered necessary to prohibit the societies from charging tiered rates for loans which might be of a commercial nature.  In the interests of the generality of society members, if societies advanced loans for commercial purposes it seems reasonable that they might be allowed to charge higher rates than those prevailing in relation to loans for home purchase which is, of course, still the primary purpose for building societies being in existence.</P>
      <P>In so far as bridging finance is concerned, this section would not necessarily prohibit the charging of higher rates in the advancing of money for bridging finance with the intention of house purchase. I should, however, remind the House of my speech on Second Stage in which I mentioned that in a submission from the Irish Building Societies Association to me earlier this year with regard to bridging finance they said: &ldquo;There is no reason why this finance should not be offered within the building society system and at a substantial cost saving to the house buyer.&rdquo;  I have indicated several times that it is my intention to allow the societies to make this type of finance available and, dependent upon the performance of societies in exercising that new responsibility, I would be influenced in making decisions as to the further types of new loans which the societies might be permitted to advance under section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that bridging finance is what might be termed finance of a risk nature and consequently it is reasonable that it should carry with it some rate of <Col N="811" /> interest higher than the interest which might be charged on a loan secured by way of a mortgage.  On the other hand, if societies who intend to advance a loan on foot of a mortgage secured on property, are extending bridging finance to a member so as to arrive at that arrangement, they should be prepared to do so at a rate less than that which is currently being charged by other financial institutions for bridging finance purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy with what the Minister said concerning the non-application of the restriction on tiered interest rates to commercial or quasi-commercial loans from a building society.  I am a little unhappy that it appears clear that tiered interest rates will be possible on bridging finance arranged by a society because of the combined effect of the definition &ldquo;loan&rdquo; plus, of course, what the Minister said and section 3, which we have already considered. Loans may be advanced with or without security.  A typical security in the case of a bridging loan would be a letter of undertaking from somebody.  I note that under section 3 the Minister can make conditions &ldquo;other than conditions in relation to the rate of interest chargeable on a loan&rdquo;.  Therefore, it is not open to him under section 3 to say: &ldquo;I will give you permission to give bridging finance provided you do not charge more than X per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is not a fatal flaw to the whole scheme of things but the Minister should keep an eye on it because, as he quite rightly pointed out in his Second Stage speech, the whole purpose of the exercise with regard to briding finance is to reduce the cost to people.  A close watch should be kept on how this actually works in practice and also in the context of further building society legislation to which the Minister referred to in his Second Stage speech and to which Members of the House are obviously committed.  In those circumstances, I ask the Minister to keep a close watch on this because I am not sure that it is tightly enough drawn to meet the ideal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="812" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator is making but I have been relying on the general regulatory power of the Minister under section 3 and the new areas of lending which may be made available to the societies are dependent on the Minister making regulations empowering them to do so.  I indicated from the outset that bridging finance was the first of those areas.  Four of the societies in their submission indicated that they believed they could make bridging finance available at a cheaper rate than is currently available from the financial institutions.  It would be reasonable for the Minister to decide, based on the experience of seeing the societies operate that new responsibility, what other areas of lending to allow them to enter into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes wonder whether some of the societies have given full consideration to some of the areas which they suggest they would like to become involved in. Once the societies are allowed to enter into some of these new areas, they will find themselves in an appreciably more competitive marketplace and competing with institutions who have developed very sophisticated marketing and financial skills.  For example, the societies have suggested that they would like to get into the business of operating checking accounts but my understanding is that checking accounts are not a profitable operation for many of the institutions who have literally centuries of experience in their operation.  First, they will have to be careful in designating the areas in which the societies can operate and, secondly, the societies will have to show that they are able to provide a service as good as, if not better than, that being provided by those who presently operate those services. If, for example, in the case outlined by the Senator, the societies were to operate bridging finance in a way which appeared to be more punitive than the existing arrangements, clearly the Minister would not be very disposed to invite them to participate in other new areas of lending, nor might he be disposed to allow them to continue to operate bridging finance if, as a result of their intervention into that market, became a more <Col N="813" /> expensive rather than a less expensive venture from the point of view of the borrower as they have suggested it will.</P>
    <P>Bridging finance is, by its nature, risk finance and consequently in any market conditions there will be a premium charge for bridging finance.  It is not secured in the way a mortgage loan is, and it is intended to be advanced for a relatively short period of time.  One of the points made to me was that, if the society who is considering advancing mortgage finance is also the lending institution for bridging finance, it might well be that that society would not be overly disposed towards having the mortgage deed executed as speedily as it otherwise might because it would show additional profit for so long as the bridging finance was extended.  I do not believe the societies will operate in that way.  If they do, they will quickly discover that they are not making a sizeable intervention into the bridging finance market.  It would also become evident very quickly and it would not impress from the point of view of further regulations or powers being conferred on them on foot of section 3.</P>
    <P>The situation to which the Senator is adverting is more than reasonably covered through the general control provisions contained in section 3 and the definitions of section 4.  Section 4 is primarily intended to eliminate the charging of tiered interest rates in respect of mortgages advanced on homes and for that reason the definition in section 4 (3) is cast in the way it is.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a general question on the ground which we have just covered.  He has just been talking about the possibilities of the building societies entering the bridging finance market and this is a very good thing.  He promised in his Second Stage speech, and has been mentioning now, that it is the intention to introduce new building society legislation and this is only the first of a series of Bills.  I would like <Col N="814" /> an indication of into what areas he thinks building societies should or could expand.  If he sees difficulties in the building societies going into other areas, as he obviously does from what he has just said, into what areas does he feel they can now expand because the building societies feel their hands are tied behind their back and this is a restrictive Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned home improvement loans and it is my understanding that building societies are already giving home improvement loans. People can go to building societies and say: &ldquo;I want to top up my loan and spend that money on improving my home&rdquo;.  It is bogus to talk about this as something new because it is going on already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little bit puzzled by the Minister's attitude to the question asked by Senator Ross because he drifted between section 3 and section 4 in his reply to the amendment and he raised matters which should be questioned.  He mentioned that bridging finance is risk finance because it is not guaranteed by anything.  I do not know any financial group who would give bridging finance unless it was against a guaranteed loan already offered by another financial institution. The bridging finance is given against a letter of guarantee from some other institution that a loan is being granted.  Could I have an answer to this <Col N="815" /> question about bridging finance?</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 5 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (e), line 32, to delete &ldquo;the arranging by a society&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the prohibition of a society directly or indirectly earning commission by arranging&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 seeks to give the Minister additional powers.  In order to explain what I think might improve subsection (1) (e) it is necessary to consider the way in which the subsection is drafted.  It seems to be drafted in a very peculiar way because section 1 (a) says the Minister may prescribe rules in respect of &ldquo;the prohibiting or restricting of the charging of redemption fees&rdquo;.  In other words the Minister can prescribe rules to prohibit or restrict the charging of redemption fees.  He cannot prescribe rules allowing the charging of redemption fees so he is correctly limited to changing the present situation where redemption fees are restricted or prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies to subsection (1) (b), (c) and (d).  In all cases it is quite clear from the context what the Minister wants to do.  In the case of subsection (1) (b) he can make the loan available; in the case of subsection (1) (c) he can restrict the right to require a member to effect insurance; in subsection (1) (d) he can preclude the question of additional costs; and in subsection (1) (e) the Minister may prescribe such rules as he considers appropriate concerning the &ldquo;arranging by a society through an insurer or an intermediary nominated by it for the purpose of mortgage protection insurance&rdquo;. Under that he could make rules which would make it legal and would double the commission.  In my opinion there is nothing which indicates, what I presume is the Minister's intention, that the society should not be able to benefit by <Col N="816" /> reason of being involved in the provision of a mortgage protection insurance policy for the purpose of its member.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to substitute for the words &ldquo;the arranging by a society&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the prohibition of a society directly or indirectly earning commission by arranging&rdquo; so that it is made clear what power the Minister has and what he intends to do with it.  He will have the power to restrict the earning by a society of commission by being involved in mortgage protection insurance business.</P>
    <P>Arising, therefore, out of the amendment there are two things I want to ask the Minister.  Is my interpretation of what he wants to achieve correct?  In other words, does he want to avoid a situation where the societies are getting commission as a result of being involved in mortgage protection insurance?  If my interpretation of that is correct, would he agree that my amendment makes it much clearer than the way in which the thing is drafted at present?  Therefore, would he agree to my amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a somewhat complicated situation.  If the Senators consider the five paragraphs set out in section 6(1) they will quickly realise that in each of the first four paragraphs (a) to (d) the section is dealing with the changing of existing practices: the prohibition of charging redemption fees in paragraph (a), the making available of valuation reports in paragraph (b), the barring of the right of a society to earn commission in relation to home insurance in paragraph (c) and the precluding of a charge of legal fees in paragraph (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (e) is different in that it relates to something which in general the societies do not operate at present.  It is included because of a particular personal desire of my own to see home mortgages or loans advanced for the purchase of the family home being secured through some form of insurance protection.  In July of this year I changed the arrangements in relation to SDA loans so as to ensure that automatically incorporated into the loan <Col N="817" /> repayment is the price of mortgage protection insurance.  This means that, in the event of the death of the mortgage holder before the terms of the mortgage has expired, the insurance automatically meets the outstanding liability so that the other spouse or dependants have no further liability and have clear title to the family home.  That has proved to be extraordinarily popular with the borrower and it is run on a group basis without, for example, the requirement for any medical examination being carried out or medical tests being passed.</P>
    <P>The societies, of course, naturally and correctly, require their borrowers to have adequate insurance protection on the family home but, in the main, they do not require that the borrower should have mortgage protection insurance.  It would be my hope, if regulations are made under this paragraph, that the mortgage protection insurance would be arranged similarily to the arrangements which I have introduced for the SDA loans, on a group basis and hopefully, on the basis that there would not be a necessity for individual medicals to be met and passed. For that reason, I felt that, different from the home loans where obviously medicals are not required, in this particular case if it were found possible to achieve the objective of general mortgage protection insurance it would best be achieved on a group basis.  In that regard it would be reasonable to allow the societies to arrange the insurance and earn whatever commission were necessary but on the basis that the mortgage protection insurance charge would be incorporated into the overall loan repayment on the mortgage rather than being charged out as a separate item.</P>
    <P>If it is found possible to see a workable system devised under paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 6, it would be my intention that it would be approached in this way.  Because of the aspiration to have a general mortgage protection insurance regime prevail, I consider that it would be easiest or best achievable on the group basis that I have outlined and with the obligation for a medical to be obviated.  If I were to place that obligation <Col N="818" /> upon the societies to carry out that function, it would be reasonable that the societies ought to be allowed to have an income deriving to them through the operation of what I believe to be a sociably desirable insurance protection system from the point of view of the spouses or dependants of mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>The Senator is somewhat incorrect in his assumption that it was my intention to prohibit the charging of commissions by the societies in relation to this type of insurance.  In fact, just a minority of the societies make that type of insurance available but not on a mandatory basis at present.  What I would aspire to do, if it were found possible, would be to introduce a system which would be mandatory in relation to all mortgages and incorporate it into the mortgage repayments. Consequently that would be achievable only by the society advancing the loan.</P>
    <P>It has always been a source of puzzlement to me that very many people who take out what are, in the context of their income, substantial loans repayable over an extended period of their working life and often with a heavy repayment profile, do not take what I would regard as the basic step of protecting their spouses or dependants by implementing a mortgage protection insurance policy.  I have now introduced that as a mandatory feature of the local authority SDA loan schemes and if it is found achievable &mdash; and I have indicated to the societies that I would like them to put forward some proposals to me as to how it might be achievable and built into the mortage repayments &mdash; I would like to see it being extended to this type of home loan finance as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for explaining what he means.  It is fair to say that the Second Stage speech which was, indeed, an excellent speech did not make clear the details of what the Minister has now said.  It is important that the Minister put on the record of the House what he intends there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the mortgage <Col N="819" /> protection insurance is a very valuable insurance and should normally form part of any prudent person's arrangements when taking out a mortgage.  What I do not understand at all is that the Minister on the one hand says he would not in these circumstances prohibit the society from earning commission in respect of arranging this insurance.  At precisely the same time, what he is effectively doing under paragraph (c) in respect of fire insurance on the property, is saying: &ldquo;You may not earn commission on it&rdquo;.  It is equally prudent and necessary for persons to have fire insurance on their property and to have mortgage protection on their property.  From the point of view of the societies they have, if anything, a greater interest in having fire insurance on the property because in the absence of fire insurance, if a fire should occur, they have no security at all.</P>
    <P>In the other case where a person falls upon hard times and the breadwinner dies, at least there is the security of the property there and a negotiated settlement can be reached between the parties. But in both cases insurance is necessary. The Minister in one case is saying: &ldquo;You are having nothing to do with that insurance and you may not be involved in that insurance&rdquo;.  On the other hand he is virtually encouraging them to get involved in insurance.  I do not understand that logic.  It does not make any sense to me whatsoever.  For that reason I am puzzled, not by the Minister's determination to have mortgage protection insurance but by the suggestion that mortgage protection insurance should be a different category of insurance from ordinary fire insurance, that in one case the arrangement should be made to positively encourage the society to provide it themselves as part of their package and obviously to earn commission on it and, in the other case, the structures are being put into place whereby the societies will not be able to earn commission.  I do not see the logic of those provisions at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I try to explain it by the simplest of analogies.  Any insurance <Col N="820" /> company will offer fire cover, to take the example the Senator gave, on any property even if it has a knock in the central heating; no insurance company will offer mortgage protection cover on a mortgage upholder if he has a knock in his heart.  The only way in which that risk person can get mortgage protection insurance is by virtue of having a group policy operating which will cover automatically the bad and the good risks.  In addition to that, there is a greater interest on the part of the societies in seeing adequate fire and protection cover on the property on which they have the mortgage extended.</P>
      <P>While the individual under paragraph (c) is now being given the right to arrange that insurance themselves or with the building society which is allowed to continue to compete for the placing of that fire or risk cover with other insurance brokers or intermediaries &mdash; paragraph (c) does not debar them from doing that &mdash; there will be continuing interest on the society's part in ensuring that cover is maintained whether it is through them as brokers or through some other broker because they will want evidence that their interest in the property is adequately covered.  On the other hand, the only real interest in seeing mortgage protection insurance continue is the interest of the spouse or the dependants and in most cases those people will not even be aware of whether or not the mortgage holder has mortgage protection insurance in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more fundamental thing is the example I gave at the outset.  The mortgage holder in poor health would find it just impossible to arrange mortgage protection insurance.  He or she will find it possible to arrange fire cover on their homes.  There is a distinct difference in the two types of insurance in that a catgory and, indeed, perhaps the category whose dependants most need the mortgage protection insurance will find themselves debarred from that insurance.  It was for that reason, in relation to the local authority loans system, that we arranged that the mortgage protection would be on a group basis and would <Col N="821" /> automatically be built into the repayments. If it is found possible to secure it in relation to building society loans the intention in paragraph (e) would be that it should be operated similarly.</P>
    <P>I accept the point the Senator is making that there is a difference in approach between paragraph (c) and paragraph (e) but that is because it is a different type of insurance and for a different purpose and to protect the interests of the different category of people, namely, the dependants rather than the mortgage holders or indeed the society's interest in the property which is what paragraph (c) is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two matters to raise on the section.  One is the Minister's intention and I very much welcome all of what is included in this section by way of the necessity to do something for the prospective mortgagee, indeed the mortgagee of the future.  The first thing I would like to deal with is subsection 1 (a) &mdash; the prohibiting or restricting of the charging of redemption fees.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware of the fact that the associated banks do provide mortgages; they have mortgage departments.  In order to gain access to their facilities, in fact, they charge an entrance fee.  Whatever about the redemption fee that the building society may charge a mortgagee who is departing from that building society, there is an entrance fee charged by the associated banks, certainly by one of the associated banks, in relation to entering into their particular facilities.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to consider the position of bridging finance as it applies to prospective purchasers of houses in the HFA and SDA loan area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something to which we have been giving some consideration and I hope it may be possible next year to do something in that connection. <Col N="822" /> It is not as far away as it may sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the other matter, and this does not properly fall within the brief of the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill and I accept that but it might be an opportunity for the Minister to at least say in a response to my question that he will take up with the Minister for Finance for ongoing discussions with the banks or with the Central Bank the fact that there is an entrance fee charged by the associated banks.  It would seem to me to be the same kind of charge as the redemption fee charged by the building societies.  I think they fall, roughly speaking, into the same area of quite unacceptable charges by financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several things that arise here.  Senator Ross, in fact, made an analogous reference in his contribution on Second Stage.  He wondered why similar legislation was not being introduced for financial institutions.  The fact of the matter is that the control of financial institutions falls within the remit of another office holder.  Anyway it is not normal to endeavour to deal with or regulate different branches of society in one sort of omnibus Bill.  I was struck in the past few weeks in this House by some of Senator Ross's contributions.  It seems to me that what he would ideally like to see is an annual single piece, the Single Irish Act, in which all legislative proposals would be contained in this one omnibus blockbuster.  They would relate one to the other and the House could then debate them presumably for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be a way of doing business.  It certainly would make life interesting and perhaps less pressurised for some Ministers.  The responsibility of individual office holders is to deal with the areas within their remit.  While I know and I welcome the fact that the banks have again become more interested in the question of home loan finance, they do not fall within the description of building <Col N="823" /> societies, nor are they friendly societies. From that point of view, it is not appropriate for me to deal with the banks' activities in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to an application fee which the banks might charge, one would need to know the composition of the fee of what items of service it might or might not cover in connection with the application, before one would be in a position to make an adequate or fair comment on it.  I think that if the application fee is merely a fee which the banks feel they can charge and derive profit from in the interests of their shareholders, that situation, like so many situations, should best be dealt with through the marketplace.  If the Senator would consider the powers of the Minister under section 6 (1) (a), the prohibitions on charging redemption fees, that I hope will bring about a situation where if mortgage holders feel they are being charged punitive rates and realise there are more attractive home loan finances available in other parts of the market, they may consider rearranging their home loan facilities.</P>
    <P>If that develops and the banks discover they are debarring themselves or restricting their opportunities to participate in that switching market through the charging of application fees, I suspect that bank application fees will evaporate rather quickly.  This is the situation, of course, that I adverted to which has happened in other countries when the more institutions who became involved in offering home loan finance the less the restrictive practices which traditionally had pertained managed to survive in the conditions of the real and extended marketplace. I believe that is what will happen in this country in the next three to five years and, indeed, as I said on Second Stage, I regret that I have had to introduce section 6 as part of this Bill.  I had hoped that the marketplace and the winds of change that are already making their presence felt in a very real and, from the point of view of perhaps some operators, chilling way in the marketplace would have brought about the changes which unfortunately I have now <Col N="824" /> had to invite the House to see implemented through Statute on a voluntary basis by the societies.</P>
    <P>I suspect the application fee the Senator refers to being charged by the banks will similarly be blown away on the winds of change and competition.  If it is not and if it is found to be an unfair and unnecessary charge and if the banks continue, as I hope they do, to express their increasing interest in the home loan market, then it would, of course, be appropriate for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to deal with that matter either by encouraging the banks to adopt voluntarily the code of practice or if he finds, as I did in relation to the societies, that they are not prepared to adopt that code of practice, unfortunately perhaps some piece of legislation similar to section 6 might be felt necessary.  I would not like that to be taken as an indication that I feel it to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I have heard previously, but only on a small number of occasions, the complaint made by the Senator in relation to the banks charging application fees.  I have no knowledge of and I would need to have knowledge of what the application fee actually covers, what services being provided by the bank in connection with the applications are to be covered by the fee before it would be appropriate for me to pass judgment, as it were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand fully what the Minister says in relation to the fact that he should stick to his own Department and I congratulate him on his conscientiousness in this regard.  I think it is a little absurd that he should come to us and say that the building societies are the brief which he carries and that the banks come under another officeholder.  The world in which the building societies operate is not a world of isolation.  The world, as the Minister seems to recognise in some parts of his contribution, in which the building societies operate is a large financial world which is becoming more competitive all the time.  It would be absurd &mdash; I hope I do not understand the Minister correctly &mdash; for the Minister to <Col N="825" /> say that he has introduced this Bill without talking to the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and without considering the spin-off effects this Bill will have on the general financial world.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous for him not to have looked at this in the context of the banks and the way in which the banks are operating as well because the building societies and banks are operating in the same world.  When a Bill like this is being considered, the rules which apply to these societies should also be looked at in the context of the banks.  I should like the Minister to say whether the banks will be looked at by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just ask the Minister if, following the passing of this legislation, he could bring to the notice of the Minister for Finance the question of what I regard not as application fees but as acceptance fees.  I know what happens is that the fee arrives on your statement following your acceptance into that mortgage arrangement with the bank rather than as an application fee for something that may or may not be accepted.</P>
      <P>The banks should be congratulated, certainly one of the major banking groups in this country should be congratulated, on the way they have maintained the interest rate in recent weeks and months rather than going down the road of the 3 per cent and the rather heavy additional interest that has been charged on mortgages generally, particularly bearing in mind that they are less profitable than the building societies and that they had less scope to do what they did than the building societies had.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the question of the issue by the societies of the valuation report to the prospective mortgagee. Given that this debate is about to conclude, would it not be better to wait until 2 o'clock and deal with it then because we probably have about ten minutes to deal with this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I try to cover a few of the points that have been made?  Senator <Col N="826" /> FitzGerald may rest assured that I regularly make a number of points to the Minister for Finance and we have had some discussions about other institutions making home loans available.  In relation to some of those discussions, may I refer to a reference which he made to the societies recently increasing their mortgage rate by 3 per cent?  The analogous increase for SDA loan purposes announced by the Government last week was 1 per cent and we may, perhaps, have some opportunity later in the debate to ascertain the realistic level which might have been charged by either group.</P>
      <P>The whole question of regulation or deregulation of the financial institutions and those who provide financial services is of extreme interest and I suspect will be addressed by Governments here as in other countries.  It is not appropriate for me to introduce legislation which controls the banks.  That is a question for another office holder and I am quite satisfied that, if that legislation is necessary, he will address it.  In the United States there is a new method of financing home loans, where blocks of mortgages, after they have been extended, are then placed on the financial markets and sold off.  If that were to be introduced here, if the Minister for the Environment dealing with the building societies had to deal with banks to extend loans he could find himself dealing with the stock market and having to deal with whatever the Irish equivalent of the big bang is &mdash; the little bang or perhaps in the Dublin context, more appropriately bang, bang.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned a fortnight ago, I was in posession. I was beginning to talk about South Africa's relations with its neighbours. We call them the front line states. It is important to examine this aspect of the problem in a discussion on apartheid. South Africa has, of course, in its usual malevolent way, involved its neighbours in the problem of apartheid in the region.</P>
      <P>I read a recent report which shows that the front line States, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Malawi, Botswana and Lesotho, and perhaps one or two others claim that South African aggression has cost them 10,000 million American dollars since 1980.  That has been the cost of the various aggressions carried out by the South African regime in Pretoria against them.  That 10,000 million American dollars is greater in value than the total amount of foreign aid which these countries received in that period.</P>
      <P>South Africa has carried out direct invasions in Angola, Mozambique and Lesotho, three of its neighbours.  South Africa has also in a calculated way disrupted oil supplies to Angola, Mozambique and Malawi.  There is a calculated evil in all of the attacks which South Africa carries out on its neighbours.  Most of the attacks are carried out on rail and sea communication points.  One has to understand the geography of these countries. They are linked to South Africa in the sense that many of their railways go to South Africa which naturally has a better developed rail link etc.  The South Africans bomb and destroy by sabotage and by direct military action &mdash; nothing covert at all, absolutely overt, out in the open &mdash; railway lines in Angola, Mozambique and Botswana.  The same thing happens at the sea ports of the coastline states among their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motive in Pretoria is to try to destroy the economy, the movement of economic goods and services within these countries.  In a calculated way Pretoria <Col N="828" /> tries to destroy the internal communications and the facilities in these countries to get their exports out or to get their imports in.  If and when the international community impose full sanctions, the idea will be to bring down the South African regime by economic methods or measures.  By being involved economically with South Africa, the front line States are forced, of necessity, to move their goods through South African ports and via South African road and rail links.  The South Africans are saying to the western world: if you destroy our economy you are also destroying the economies of these countries in the front line with whom you purport to have friendly relationships.  That point is also very well made by the South Africans to their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Economic chaos has resulted from military attacks.  Pretoria knows very well that military attacks in a country with a weak economy breed greater economic chaos.  There is one very telling figure, that is, about 100,000 people have died in the region since 1980.  We do not have accurate figures on how many people actually died as a result of bombings, shooting or whatever.  We do know that the majority of them died from starvation and famine, especially in Angola and Mozambique, as a direct result of military intervention by South Africa in these countries.  They died as a result of the chaos which destroyed the food supply. That was no accident; that was all part of the calculated campaign of the regime in South Africa to destablise as far as possible and to destroy ultimately their neighbours.  They tried in this very calculating manner to draw all the front line States into the economic morass they see coming from full blown economic sanctions &mdash; if the international community had the courage to impose them.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about the internal political set up within South Africa.  It has been a major plank in Pretoria propaganda to try to give the impression that the nationalist political groupings in South Africa are all subversives or Communist inspired.  All Members of this House have received <Col N="829" /> various propaganda leaflets issued from their Embassy in London.  The theme of many of them has been to impress upon us as Members of this democratic House, that the Pretoria regime is essentially a democratic regime fighting forces of subversion and of Communism.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist Party, the ruling party in South Africa, is purely representative of the white supremacy regime in that country.  It probably represents 90 per cent of the white population.  Its <i>raison d'être,</i> the reason it is there, is to represent the white population and the white interest alone.  It makes no bones about that.  It is there also to preserve and to perpetuate this policy of apartheid.  There are other political parties or political groupings in South Africa representing some of the non-white population, some of them to the right of the Nationalist Party and some of them slightly to the left, or at least more liberal than the Nationalist Party.  All in all they are quite insignificant in terms of the amount of influence they wield among the white population.  It is interesting to note the move towards the more right wing HNP Party which is a ultra-white supremacist party in South Africa.  It moved from getting just a few thousand votes in previous years to a point in the most recent contest where it had nationally about 200,000 supporters in the white community. In a by-election of less than two years ago it won its first parliamentary seat.</P>
    <P>If we could move and have a brief look at the political groupings on the nationalist side in South Africa &mdash; that is, the non-white side in South Africa &mdash; we see that the largest non-white political grouping is the ANC, the African National Congress.  This is one of the oldest nationalist political parties in Africa and was formed in 1912.  It was originally set up to fight racial discrimination and to fight for majority rule. It has had among its leaders in our own lifetime people like Albert Luthuli who won a Nobel Peace Prize and nowadays its political leader is Nelson Mandela who had been in prison for the past 20 years. The ANC is socialist in character but it <Col N="830" /> draws its membership from all elements of thought throughout South Africa, and from some thoughtful elements among the non-black community in the country. It has within its membership groupings from all religions, Non-conformists, Catholics, the Anglican Churches, Moslems and so on and even some people from the black consciousness movement, who believe in total black control in South Africa.  I should point out that the ANC has been illegal since 1960 and has not been allowed to function as a normal political party or a normal political grouping.</P>
    <P>In 1983 a new political grouping was formed, the United Democratic Front. That was set up in the wake of Botha's constitution which was to establish separate white assemblies.  This new constitution greatly increased the power of the president and it provided assemblies for Indians and Africans but the whole arrangement was so constructed that the white majority nevertheless could always out-vote these separate assemblies.  This meant that in democratic terms they were totally meaningless.  At that time in 1983 there was very widespread oppression throughout the country which exists at the present time.  It was probably the beginning of the more violent present problems which we see in that country and there was brutal repression.</P>
    <P>Tens of thousands of people came together at that time at one particular meeting &mdash; I think it was in Johannesburg &mdash; and set up this new party, the United Democratic Front (UDF).  It is important to point out to the House that 600 separate groups, including youth, sporting, trade union, religious and womens' groups throughout the country, have affiliated to the United Democratic Front.  Its constitution sees South Africa as a multiracial, single country with no bantustans.  Since the state of emergency in 1985 as part of the repression we find that thousands of the UDF members have been arrested and at least 40 of its leaders have been detained.  There are many people among its leadership and <Col N="831" /> membership who also have been murdered.</P>
    <P>Another significant political grouping in South Africa is INKATHA.  It was set up in 1975 by Chief Buthelezi, Chief of the Zulu tribe or clan in South Africa.  In fairness to Chief Buthelezi and to INKATHA, they refused to accept &ldquo;independence&rdquo; for the homelands.  They are unequivocally opposed to apartheid but they are not quite unequivocally opposed to the imposition of sanctions.  As a political grouping in that country they have somewhat tarnished their image in recent years by their attacks within Zululand on United Democratic Front supporters. We have all read of these things in recent times in the newspapers.  This has been exploited very much by the South African regime.  I make these points of criticism about INKATHA because it was giving a stick to the Pretoria regime to beat the anti-apartheid movements throughout that country.  Pretoria quickly seized upon the INKATHA attacks on the UDF people.  With their censorship laws they made sure that the newsreels sent to the western world were newsreels of black people attacking black people in these townships.  The whole idea of that was to give the world the impression that the troubles in South Africa were more related to inter-racial problems between coloured and black people rather than the problems caused by apartheid.</P>
    <P>My criticism of Chief Buthelezi and his movement INKATHA is that he played into the hands of the South African regime by his failure to control the people who carried out these attacks.</P>
    <P>We had an ANC friend from South Africa to see us last week and he made the point to us about a recent survey &mdash; and I have read this recently in a report also &mdash; that showed that only about 8 per cent of all non-white people in South Africa support INKATHA or would see INKATHA as a realistic nationalist government when that stage is reached in that country.  That survey was carried out among Zulus as well as Indians and other Africans.</P>
    <P>

      <P>Since 1985 we have been a part of the European Community sanctions programme against South Africa. With the permission of the House I will read into the record the areas of economic sanctions because I want to make a point about them that is particularly relevant to this country: They are the following:</P>
      <P>(1)&nbsp; A rigorously controlled embargo on exports of arms and para-military equipment to the Republic of South Africa;</P>
      <P>(2)&nbsp; A rigorously controlled embargo on imports of arms and para-military equipment from the Republic of South Africa;</P>
      <P>(3)&nbsp; Refusal to co-operate in the military sphere;</P>
      <P>(4)&nbsp; Recall of military attachés accredited to the RSA, and refusal to grant accreditation to military attachés from the Republic of South Africa;</P>
      <P>(5)&nbsp; Discouraging cultural and scientific agreements except where these contribute towards the ending of apartheid or have no possible role in supporting it; and freezing of official contacts and international agreements in the sporting and security spheres;</P>
      <P>(6)&nbsp; Cessation of oil exports to the Republic of South Africa;</P>
      <P>(7)&nbsp; Cessation of exports of sensitive equipment destined for the police and armed forces of the RSA;</P>
      <P>(8)&nbsp; Prohibition of all new collaboration on the nuclear sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are eight points there.  Of all those points, in the economic area very few for them would hurt Ireland.  We do not export arms to South Africa.  We do not send them sensitive equipment for <Col N="833" /> the police or armed forces, such as certain electronic equipment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.  We cannot collaborate in the nuclear sphere since we do not produce nuclear energy.  For that reason it is very easy for Ireland to go along with these measures proposed by the EC.  If we are to go for full blown sanctions against South Africa we will impose a certain hurt upon ourselves.  I submit to the House that we must be prepared to accept hurt.</P>
      <P>The last year for which we have complete figures of trade with South Africa is 1984.  Ireland's imports from South Africa amounted to £17 million.  I am quoting this from the official Irish trade figures.  The imports fall into the categories of minerals, textiles, fruit, coal and fertilisers.  We exported to South Africa £39 million worth of goods and services. These were mostly machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and certain metals. Our figures show that we exported about £39 million worth of goods but the South African trade figures show that they received about £44 million worth of goods from us &mdash; there is no great discrepancy there.  Nevertheless, there is quite a large measure of discrepancy on the Irish import figures.  The Irish trade figures suggest that we purchase about £17 million worth of goods from that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discrepancy would appear to be because of the fact that Irish trade statistics do not show imports and exports in and out of the Shannon Free Zone &mdash; a free trading area.  They do show up in the South African figures, which is an interesting point.  We know that there are two major South African firms operating in the Shannon Free Zone.  Approximately 1,000 people are employed in those industries.  The imports are coming into these industries because they are in the area of precious metals and hard metals.  It is quite obvious that the discrepancies <Col N="834" /> I have been talking about &mdash; between our figure of £17 million and the £44 million suggested by South Africa &mdash; are in the imports to those industries to enable them to carry on their business in Shannon.  Let is be stated clearly in this House and elsewhere that if we go for full blown no holds barred sanctions, we put that trade in jeopardy and we put those jobs in jeopardy.  We have a moral obligation, I suggest to the House, to do just that.</P>
    <P>If this country of all countries &mdash; an ex-colonial country &mdash; were seen to give a lead in imposing meaningful full blown sanctions, and if the rest of the world followed us, we would very quickly bring an end to the racist regime in South Africa.  In that country there is a fundamental denial of human rights and dignity. The whole system is profoundly immoral and profoundly illegal.  World opinion is moving against South Africa; that is happening increasingly.  We have witnessed what has happened in the United States of America.  The Congress of the United States of America &mdash; both Houses, and these measures were taken prior to the recent congressional elections where there were shifts from Republican to Democratic majorities &mdash; voted to impose a whole range of economic sanctions against this regime &mdash; far more than the White House was suggesting &mdash; against the resistance of the White House and its present incumbent.</P>
    <P>The consciousness of the non-white majority in South Africa is now so roused that it will lead to nothing less than a national revolution.  It is, in my opinion, unstoppable at this stage, Our country is a member of the United Nations.  We have signed all the human rights declarations. We have supported the United Nations in its unequivocal condemnation of apartheid.  We are committed to the rule of law enacted in democratic assemblies, which takes account of all sectors of population.  For that reason and for all the other reasons I have stated in this submission &mdash; today and a fortnight ago &mdash; I suggest to this House and to this country that we take the moral leap and declare total, unequivocal, unconditional <Col N="835" /> sanctions against that country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Africa has been attracting worldwide attention for the wrong reasons for quite some time now. We had the appalling famine in Ethiopia and north-east Africa last year, which sent shock waves across the world.  We have the continuing shame of apartheid in South Africa, which has attracted worldwide attention on almost the same scale.  South Africa's system of apartheid is a frightening example of man's inhumanity to man.  History has many instances of minority groups being denied basic fundamental rights by majority groups, but in South Africa we have the majority group being denied basic rights by a relatively small minority.  The population of South Africa is about 30 million. That is made up of 4 million whites, 21 million blacks of various tribal origins, about one million Indians and 2 million people of mixed race.  The fact of apartheid is that 4 million people keep more than five times that number in total subjection. Eighty seven per cent of the land is reserved for the whites who make up only 15 per cent of the population.  Black people, who make up over two-thirds of the population are confined to one-eighth of the land.  That is a clear indication of how the black population are being deprived of their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1948 the policy of apartheid &mdash; of separate development as they chose to call it &mdash; has been put into effect by the South African Government.  Separate development implies that different groups of people develop at different rates.  Development could be looked on as proceeding at a rapid rate for the white section and as being non-existent for the 21,000,000 black population.  That is what they chose to call separate development, and this policy of separate development is extended to moving big sections of the black population into small areas where they are kept in a state of deprivation without any reasonable hope of being able to advance themselves.  That is basically what the policy of apartheid is all about.  A minority white population <Col N="836" /> has chosen to deny the majority population of their rights through the development of this policy.</P>
    <P>The joint committee had several discussions and examinations on how apartheid is kept in operation. Everything that is learned about it is a clear indication of the ruthlessness of a relatively small minority group and their determination to keep the majority groupings in total subjection.  Far from there being any indication of a worthwhile change taking place, as recently as yesterday it was announced that there will be further restrictions on news coverage.  It is obvious that the powers-that-be are determined to suppress as much information as possible and to prevent accounts of the atrocities committed there leaking to the outside world.  That is a clear indication of the determination to continue as they have been doing for quite some time.</P>
    <P>The report states and I quote:</P>
    <P>Evidence given before the Committee suggests that Apartheid operates as a system of Government which attempts to balance two conflicting objectives, the exclusion of blacks from urban areas (to prevent them demanding rights) and their inclusion in the cheap labour market to man farms, mines, services and manufacturing. In balancing these objectives an urban black presence is tolerated as a privilege and not as a right.</P>
    <P>Apartheid is effected through violence and repression which ensures a basic denial of human rights and of free speech.  It is also effected through a number of legal mechanisms i.e.</P>
    <P>(a)  race classification</P>
    <P>(b)  territorial separation</P>
    <P>(c)  movement control</P>
    <P>(d)  control of employment</P>
    <P>(a)  Race</P>
    <P>The South African population is classified under the Population Registration Act of 1950 into four groups.  White, Mixed, Indian and Black.  Classification is for life and all other groups have lesser rights <Col N="837" /> than whites.  Blacks are further classifed according to tribal origin to establish a basis for independent tribal states.</P>
    <P>This is used as a pretence that something is being done to set the black population up in kingdoms or in states of their own, whereas, in fact, the real purpose is to herd them together and to ensure that they will have little or no opportunity of self-advancement and that their opportunities of gainful employment are rigidly curtailed.  These are the purposes behind this structure.</P>
    <P>Under the Homelands Act, 87 per cent of South Africa's land is allocated to whites.  The report also draws our attention to the pass laws which are designed to control the movement of the black population in a very restricted way so that there are only certain places where they are allowed to go.  Their movements are constantly under check and freedom of movement, as we understand it, is totally unknown to them.  The determination under the apartheid system would appear to be to ensure that that continues.</P>
    <P>On any objective examination, it must be concluded that apartheid should be unreservedly condemned.  It is a cold-blooded, callous and very often brutal denial of the rights of the majority by a small but powerful minority.  Apartheid must stand condemned as one of the great shames of the 20th century, a century that has had much to be ashamed of in Hitler, Stalin, concentration camps, atom bombs, assassinations, massacre at the Olympic Games, genocide, abortion, hijacking of planes, food mountains and famine, pollution and acid rain.  The list of the factors which should cause people to be ashamed of the century we live in and our approach to life contains many examples and apartheid ranks high in this catalogue of shame.</P>
    <P>History tells us that man is often inhuman to his fellow man and a vandal to his environment.  It is shameful that the treatment meted out to negroes and coloured people by the white men of other generations should continue in <Col N="838" /> South Africa into the last quarter of the 20th century.  It will cause future generations to wonder how the insensitivity of the savage could extend into the age that brought man into outer space.  The evil effects of apartheid are not confined to South Africa.  By the pressure, power and influence of the Government of South Africa these evil effects extend into the neighbouring states.  Paragraph 16 of the report states:</P>
    <P>In considering this aspect of the question the Committee has drawn, in the first instance, on the experience of its delegation which visited Lesotho and Tanzania in April 1985.  The delegation noted the interdependent but unequal relationship which existed between South Africa and Lesotho. Lesotho, in common with other independent states in the region, is economically dependent on South Africa through its membership of a Common Customs Union and through its reliance on South Africa for essential supplies.  South Africa is also an export market for surrounding countries.  In turn South Africa relies heavily on migrant labour from these countries particularly in its mining industry.  All these factors contribute to the economic and thus political vulnerability of its neighbours to South African policy.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 of the report states:</P>
    <P>the delegation's experience and evidence heard by the Committee tend to confirm that South Africa uses its neighbours dependence on it in two ways:</P>
    <P>(i)  in terms of a stronger economy exploiting the weaker and smaller</P>
    <P>(ii)  in political terms i.e. in order, internally, to maintain its policy of Apartheid and the structures going with it.  A major aim of South African foreign policy is to keep its neighbours under control, both militarily and in economic terms.</P>
    <P>This is used as far as possible to the advantage of the white population of South Africa and to the disadvantage of <Col N="839" /> the people of the neighbouring States. Paragraph 19 reads;</P>
    <P>South Africa could only apply direct pressure on Lesotho (and has done so since the delegation's visit, resulting in the downfall of Chief Jonathan's Government) by cutting off supplies at any time.</P>
    <P>South Africans have worked themselves into a position where in order to force their will on some of the neighbouring States and to bring about the sort of circumstances that are favourable to them, they simply cut off supplies and in that way force these people into an agreement with them or into subjection as the case might be.  This is intolerable and is deserving of the worldwide condemnation that has been heaped on it. Paragraph 21 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The Committee heard evidence on the effect of South African policy on development in neighbouring countries from the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement (IAMM) and from Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) workers in the field ... South Africa has destabilised the entire South African region whose states, as a result, had no real freedom of action. NGO representatives who had either direct or planning experience relative to Swaziland, Mozambique, Lesotho and Botswana, felt, in general, that Apartheid was a direct cause of underdevelopment in all of these States. South Africa had to establish unequal, exploitative relationships with neighbouring countries partly because they were small and partly because it wished deliberately to frustrate their self-sufficient development.</P>
    <P>This is a glaring example of those with power curbing the potential of those who are weaker.  In these circumstances aid was achieving very little in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>This is another genuine cause of shame to those who are guilty of imposing such conditions on neighbouring people and <Col N="840" /> going out of their way to prevent these people reaching an acceptable standard of living and ensuring, by every means possible, that they cannot be regarded as being an independent people.  The activities of the authors of apartheid are not confined to their own country.  It is an evil influence that extends from South Africa into many of the neighbouring States.</P>
    <P>Peaceful change or violence are the alternatives.  It cannot be expected that over 20 million people will continue indefinitely to be totally under the thumb of roughly four million people.  That does not make sense.  One of the most striking lessons of history is that people will not continue to allow themsleves to be trampled on indefinitely.  History shows that even minority groups will in the long run find some way of upsetting or unseating the despots who make life unbearable for them.  If that is true with regard to minority groups under oppression &mdash; and history gives several examples of it &mdash; it is certainly true that a majority group will not indefinitely put up with the existence that the majority, over 20 million people, have to suffer in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The alternative is for some sort of enlightened approach on the part of the ruling group and a gradual extending of rights to the majority but there are no genuine indications that that is under way.  The fear that must be generated in the minds of people is that, if peaceful and constitutional means are not seen to be making headway, there is always the danger of violence taking over.  There are many examples of violence and that is why it has been found necessary to strengthen the censorship regulations to ensure that people outside never get the full story of what is happening within.</P>
    <P>There are examples of brutal treatment of the black population by the police and countless examples of that had come through before the censorship became as rigid as it is at present.  It is a well known fact that thousands of people, many of whom are school going children, are kept in prison without any charges preferred against them, or without any indication of how long they will be kept there before <Col N="841" /> charges are preferred against them.  That, in itself, should be disturbing to the conscience of mankind.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the only way to bring these people to their senses is to cut them off and impose sanctions, in other words a boycott of the State which practices this wrong system of Government. Sadly, some people, for selfish reasons and because of the dangers they might cause to their own economies, are not willing to impose all-out sanctions on South Africa.  Governments who take this type of approach are yielding to the pressure of big industrialists and big firms who accumulate wealth as a result of their dealings with South Africa.  Recently we had some encouraging signs that the conscience of even big business people is being pricked by the atrocities in that part of the world.  Recently we had a decision by Barclay's Bank to pull out of South Africa and the American firm, General Motors, had done so prior to that.  It is hoped that example will be followed by other big firms and that in the long run the pressure of the outside world and the loss of business and trade will force the South African Government to be more considerate of the people whom they now wish to keep in a state of perpetual oppression.</P>
    <P>Development is altogether too slow.  In time to come historians will judge the people of the 20th century as being inconsiderate to a high degree because effective action was not taken to end this disgraceful abuse that prevails in South Africa at present and has done so for long enough to have got corrective measures under way.  We are a small country but nevertheless we have influence because we do not have the same kind of vested interests in various parts of the world of other industrial and big trading nations. Thus, we are in a position to view the situation that pertains in different parts of the world more objectively and also because the history of our own country is a story of people fighting against oppression.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident that it is the determination of our Government to use what influence they have in the EC, in the <Col N="842" /> United Nations and in other assemblies to draw attention on the widest possible scale to the abuses that prevail in South Africa and to convince people to take every measure to ensure that such atrocious treatment cannot continue for much longer.  I have no doubt but that is the approach our representatives abroad will take at all times.  I am happy that contributions in the Seanad have made it clear that that is what the Members of this House would like the Government to do at all levels.  We wish then first, to convey to the widest possible audience our horror and rejection of the very notion of apartheid and everything it stands for and, secondly, that if total sanctions are necessary to bring these despots to their knees then they should be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I want to avail of the opportunity to compliment the joint committee on the work they put into this latest report to be debated in the House.  On 27 November when the report was introduced by my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, we heard a very forceful, extraordinarily strong and interesting contributions from both Senator Bulbulia and Senator Michael Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose, it is a subject on which it is easy to have strong views.  In common with all my colleagues who have contributed to this debate, I abhor the policies of apartheid that are operated by the Republic of South Africa.  It is appropriate that the Oireachtas should debate issues of this kind.  Indeed, successive Irish Governments have shown their concern by concentrating to a considerable degree the not inconsiderable amount of funds provided through our development and aid programme.  I had the opportunity of visiting South Africa on a number of occasions, mainly by virtue of having to pass through that territory on the way to Maseru, Lesotho where many Irish nationals, from the semi-State sector and from some Departments of State, are doing a marvellous job to assist the development of that ancient if fledgling <Col N="843" /> State to get off the ground.  The Lesotho people with their Queen &mdash; I think the King may be back there since the change of Government, I just do not know for the minute &mdash; call their country the Kingdom in the Sky because of its exceptionally high altitude; it is all over 5,000 feet elevation.  From my first visit to one a few years later, I could see the great development that had taken place.</P>
    <P>I saw what could be accomplished with aid and that brings me to the only difference of opinion I have with all my colleagues here.  I do not support the idea of all-out sanctions, and this is not because I am against sanctions against the Government of South Africa.  It is because I fear economic sanctions would impinge to the greatest extent on the people at the foot of the ladder, namely, the 21 million coloured people who reside in that Republic.  After reading and hearing Chief Buthelezi speak, I was impressed by the case he made.  I know the Zulu people are a great race; they have tremendous poise, presence, dignity and as a race they are very significant and are easily recognizable.  That is the tragedy of South Africa today.  It is proper that all the civilised nations should endeavour to force a change of policy in the way that country treats the children of its nation.  This is the great dilemma, how best to bring about a change that will be of material benefit to the people who reside there.</P>
    <P>The Republic of South Africa is undoubtedly one of the finest countries in the world.  Their infrastructures are very well developed compared with practically any other of the 51 countries on the sub-continent of Africa.  A lot has been brought about by much hard work and planning and, having regard to the fact that it is a very rich country in resources, it was easier to bring it up to that stage of development than in most other cases.  The Bantu system of education there, where the Government handed over education for the coloured population to this particular system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was mentioning in passing that I thought a disadvantage in South Africa was that the Government had handed over the area of education to the Bantu system, to the black population themselves.  That does not equate with the facilities and the services available to the white population.  This, in itself, gives the black population a slower rate of development and a slower rate of progress which tends to compound the problem there.</P>
      <P>I recognise the role our Minister for Foreign Affairs has played at EC level and in the United Nations on this topic. He has played a very significant role in focusing the attention of the international fora on the underlying injustices in that State.  The Minister can justly say he has portrayed the wishes of the vast majority of the people of this country.  While it is a very difficult question and one that brings great sorrow to people when they comprehend it, I want in conclusion to appeal to my colleagues who have made such moving speeches on this very clear and very strong cause for all-out trade sanctions against this republic, in whatever action they feel justified in advocating to have regard to the poor people, the people at the lowest levels of the economic ladder and ensure that our actions do not make their position worse even in the short term.  That is important. When we examine the marvellous work development aid &mdash; even though it may be relatively small in itself &mdash; can achieve for areas in countries like Lesotho and see the developments in Swaziland, in that region in general, I believe that in those areas we can do more to encourage this regime to adapt a more human face and to guarantee the equality of all its people.</P>

      <P>As proposer of the motion concerning this report of the all-Party Committee on Development Co-operation, it falls to me to reply briefly to the excellent debate which has been in progress in this House over the past couple of weeks.  I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and for his own contribution to the discussions and <Col N="846" /> Senators from all sides of the House who made contributions, all of them unequivocally condemning the vicious, immoral, utterly discredited regime of apartheid in South Africa.  Apart from the last speaker, all of them called for the fullest possible sanctions in order to assist as rapid and as peaceful a change as possible in South Africa.  I thank Senators Michael Lanigan, Eoin Ryan, Bríd Rogers, Michael D. Higgins, John Connor, Andy O'Brien and Charlie McDonald for their contributions to the debate and I express my thanks and appreciation to the Minister for his attendance during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>By way of reply to my colleague Senator McDonald, with whom I have in the past had differences of emphasis in matters of foreign policy, I would like to talk about his call for a more moderate type of approach towards sanctions.  I am afraid I must accuse Senator McDonald of being somewhat dated in his attitude towards South Africa and in particular in his attitude towards Chief Buthelezi and his half-hearted approach towards sanctions. I can do no better than quote various other African leaders who, far better than any of us, have a pertinent knowledge and a distinct and clear appreciation of apartheid and of sanctions and of the effects sanctions will have on various countries in South Africa who live regularly day by day, week by week, cheek by jowl with this vicious, oppressive regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has gone on record inviting the international community to take immediate steps to isolate South Africa by imposing mandatory economic sanctions.  He appealed and I quote &ldquo;to all who love democracy to support the cause of the people of South Africa.&rdquo;  In the first instance sanctions were called for by Chief Albert Luthuli, Nobel Peace Prize winner, many years ago.  It is really rather sad that 25 years later we are still in the position of calling on the international community and in particular the US, Britain and Germany, to cease being selfish and to cease having a narrow view of sanctions and to get out there and <Col N="847" /> assist in the peaceful evolution of change in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Chief Albert Lithule, the Nobel Laureate and President of the African National Congress, 25 years ago made the first call for sanctions and issued a demand for isolation of apartheid based on his experience and an appreciation of how international connections have operated to give political creditability and, indeed, military strength to this racist regime in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The former West German Chancellor, Herr Willy Brandt, spoke about the matter of sanctions in an unequivocal way and nobody can accuse Herr Willy Brandt of not having the greatest knowledge, appreciation and awareness of developing co-operation which was the context which perturbed Senator McDonald. Indeed, Herr Willy Brandt is a world expert on development co-operation matters.  North-South, his seminal work is quoted in the course of every debate on development co-operation.  He urged Britain, the US and West Germany to impose economic sanctions and he said:</P>
    <P>The majority in South Africa demand that apartheid is brought to an end.  Many expect pressure from abroad and are willing to pay the temporary price.</P>
    <P>He added then that economic sanctions against Pretoria had failed because its principal backers, the US, Britain and West Germany, refused to take action and Herr Willy Brandt went on to say:</P>
    <P>The governments of these nations should be told that it is their duty to use their great possibilities to exert leverage on South Africa.</P>
    <P>I think we have to take the words of somebody like Willy Brandt, Chief Albert Luthuli, Robert Mugabe and, indeed, Archbishop Desmond Tutu into account when we are speaking of adopting a lesser attitude towards the pursuit of economic sanctions.</P>
    <P>Archbishop Tutu, who has become a world figure as a result of his avowed espousal of the cause of his native people in South Africa and who risked arrest for <Col N="848" /> treason when he openly called for all-out mandatory sanctions, said:</P>
    <P>Our children are dying, our land is burning and bleeding.  I call on the international community to apply punitive sanctions against this government to help us establish a new South Africa &mdash; non-racial, democratic, participatory and just.</P>
    <P>I will also quote somebody else who looked for all-out economic sanctions. Bishop Serotse of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in South Africa said at an emergency convention held in Northern Transvaal and presided over by Bishop Serotse:</P>
    <P>I call on the international community to apply economic sanctions against the government of South Africa to pressurise it to surrender the reins of power to the oppressed majority.</P>
    <P>Since we spoke on South Africa in the context of this particular debate a fortnight ago in this House, I had the opportunity &mdash; courtesy of Trocaire, the Catholic Agency for Relief and Development Work &mdash; to meet with representatives of a Catholic Archbishops' Conference of South Africa who were visiting this country as part of an education seminar under the auspices of the Irish Anti-apartheid Movement.  It was my privilege to meet with Bishop Wilfred Napier of South Africa and with Bishop Slattery of Northern Transvaal, an Irish, Tipperary-born missionary and both of them had recently been part of a delegation to meet the State President Botha. They had hoped to put before him their appreciation of the problems being experienced by their community in South Africa and their wish to see a more rapid, incisive and meaningful reform of the system.  They were accompanied by Cardinal McCann, and Archbishop Hurley of Capetown also an Irishman who has been courageous and unequivocal for many, many years in his condemnation of the condition to which his people are reduced by the oppressive régime of apartheid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> The delegation from the South African Catholic Archbishops Conference were cruelly disappointed by the reaction of President Botha.  There had been a certain perception that President Botha was prepared to move more swiftly and rapidly in the area of legal changes to accommodate the anxieties of the non-white population of South Africa, but it was the considered view of the delegation from the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference that, in fact, this is some sort of media myth.</P>
    <P>President Botha was quite determined, quite unwilling to accept the points they made, totally lacking in a facilitating attitude and, in fact, the bishops emerged feeling completely let down, disheartened and devoid of all hope or feeling that there would be any change brought about constitutionally by means of Government to redress the manifest injustices which are being experienced by the non-white community in South Africa.  They talked about it being in the South African context now past midnight, and by that they meant that it really was too late to pursue change in a constitutional way &mdash; I think that is a fair interpretation of what was meant.</P>
    <P>I must again repeat that I feel that my dear colleague, Senator Charlie McDonald, is somewhat out of date in his support of the line being taken by Buthelezi in his call for more moderate, selective type of sanctions which would be effective in his view because they would in some way assist development in Southern Africa and not be too harsh on the black population of South Africa.</P>
    <P>Winnie Mandela has sprung to world separate attention as the wife of the imprisoned black leader, Nelson Mandela, who has languished now for more years than I care to remember in South Africa.  When Winnie Mandela was asked what her views were on sanctions she had this to say:</P>
    <P>My own views have always been well known.  I have always been quoted as one of those who are calling for sanctions against this country.  I have called for total sanctions, mandatory sanctions. <Col N="850" /> We are asking the international community to assist us in saving the lives Ian Smith could have saved if he had listened during the HMS Tiger talks.  We believe sanctions are the only other road open for us, the only measure that is peaceful.  Anyone who says anything to the contrary is a benefactor of apartheid.  One can understand why: those whose pockets are filled with gold from Pretoria's coffers obviously oppose sanctions and hypocritically pretend sanctions will hurt blacks.  We bury people every day, we see blood flowing around us.  With all that is happening, with us living in ghettoes and owning 13 per cent of our land, are we still supposed to suffer when sanctions are applied to this land, when we have suffered so much?  Those whose pockets get fatter and fatter, who get their reward from Pretoria, will talk that kind of language.</P>
    <P>That is tough, unequivocal and it might be considered too full blown by many, but it is spoken with feeling and emotion.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech, subliminally perhaps, or subtly, gave an indication that perhaps emotion was misplaced.  I hope I do not in any way give an incorrect indication of what I felt about this comment in his reply to this debate.  I felt he thought that emotion was somehow misplaced when we were speaking about South Africa.  I can understand why perhaps many people would think this is so.  One would wish to see the debate conducted in a rather desiccated, objective, cool, analytical fashion.  All of those attitudes towards such a debate, of course, are praiseworthy and necessary if one is to arrive at a reasonable, reasoned and considered conclusion.  Nevertheless, I contend that in the context of apartheid and in the context of oppression, denial of civil rights, human liberties and in a context of total inequality based on skin colour, emotion &mdash; by emotion I mean fine emotion, not over-the-top, full blown ranting emotion, but emotion based on feeling and on an appreciation of what the situation is about &mdash; is necessary in a <Col N="851" /> debate on apartheid in any forum where such debates take place.  I make no apologies for introducing that kind of emotion into whatever contribution I ever make an apartheid either in this House or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more than any other Senator who has contributed to this debate I have unique insight and particular perceptions and sensitivities in the area of apartheid and in what I am actually talking about. I bring what I hope is an added dimension because of that awareness and that sensitivity, to this debate and a dimension which is worthwhile, which challenges, which focusses, which invites Senators to get stuck in and to make contributions which are meaningful, perceptive and challenging.  There was a growing number who contributed to this debate.  In general debates on developing co-operation in this House have tended to be predictable as to who will make contributions. Members of the all-party committee generally try to speak and those charged with responsibility for Fine Gael for development co-operation matters. This time I noticed some additional speakers contributing to the debate.  That is good and has to be welcomed as wholesome. I certainly feel it is one of the functions of the all-party committee to reach out to Members of the Oireachtas and to stimulate the debate which will in turn one hopes reverberate outside this House and be heard in the community outside.</P>
    <P>I am still somewhat unhappy about our approach at international level in the UN and particularly in the EC on the matter of sanctions.  I do not for a moment doubt the fact that we are absolutely and totally opposed to apartheid.  Our voice has been raised in all fora firmly and clearly in denunciation of the regime in South Africa.  I feel that the fact that we are the only officially neutral country in the EC must prompt us to have an officially neutral stance on South Africa and to be out there giving a moral lead, a coherent lead calling for greater change and pointing out the hypocrisy which surrounds the stance towards all-out sanctions of <Col N="852" /> Britain and West Germany and indeed in the UN, the hypocrisy of the United States whose foreign policy over the last few weeks is being internationally and publicly seen to have elements within it which are highly questionable and indeed suspect.  There is something extraordinary in an attitude which allows for sanctions to be ok in the context of Nicaragua, Syria and Libya but which will not countenance sanctions in the context of South Africa and that is precisely and clearly as Senator after Senator has said because vital national interests of the UN, of Britain and of West Germany are threatened when all-out mandatory sanctions are being considered against South Africa.</P>
    <P>I think as a neutral country and as a country small but with moral force, we should be in the business of pointing out that kind of hypocrisy and of refusing to, in any way, even appear to collaborate with it or to go along with it or to countenance it or to, by our silence, appear to condone it.  That does concern me and it concerns me very deeply.  I hope it does not sound like the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> but I will continue to keep a very close eye on what happens when motions concerning South Africa are debated in these world fora and I shall not hesitate to speak up if I feel that in any way we could have a stronger voice, say more, have more foresight and be more unequivocal in our attitude towards sanctions.  As the Catholic bishops said, it is past midnight.  This regime, as I said in my earlier contribution, is rising in a death agony before the world.  We have stark choices.  We can assist a peaceful evolution towards change by running with the sanctions option or we can wring our hands and sit back and witness what will be a violent bloody revolution which will have repercussions throughout our world, our one world.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I would make it clear that I do not want it to happen in that way; I care too much about South Africa and about the people of all races and of all colours and creeds who make up that living vibrant, exciting community and who are part of what is one of the most <Col N="853" /> beautiful countries in physical terms in the entire world and one of the richest countries in mineral wealth and in natural advantages.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by thanking Senators once again and thanking the Minister of State with special responsibility in this area for being present during the debate and by saying that once again it is my contention that the Seanad distinguished itself by debating an all-party committee report from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do wish that the same scrutiny and examination were given to these reports in the other House because there is really no point in setting up these committees and encouraging people to submit presentations to them and in having Members and staff get involved in various work if the reports are to be gathering dust on shelves.  That is not good enough. Certainly in the context of the cauldron of South Africa such an approach would be reprehensible.  Thank you very much indeed.</P>

It is in relation to the question of the valuer's report being made available to the mortgagee by the building society &mdash; the report prepared for the building society which up to now has not been available to the mortgagee.  I hope the Minister will ensure that it will be made available once this Bill is law.  I want to acquaint the Minister, if he is not already aware, <Col N="854" /> of the position relating to these reports to building societies.</P>
      <P>As I made clear in my Second Stage speech on this Bill, I am the nominee of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute in this House.  They nominated me onto the industrial and commercial panel and the public representatives of Ireland elected me.  I had to be elected to my nominating body.  The reports going to building societies come essentially from two different professional groupings. They come from either architects or auctioneers. They do not come exclusively from either one or the other.  The Minister will appreciate that, if an architect goes out to view a property for the purpose of advising the building society as to value, he may or may not be acquainted with the market value of houses in any city or town.  His profession and expertise are as an architect.  Where he is sent out to advise on the extension to the house or the condition of the house, that might be more appropriate where it relates to the architect.  When the valuer goes out he is normally part of a practice which engages in buying, selling and regularly advising on the value of property in the house market.  Therefore, to the extent of his remit, which would not extend to advising on extensions and improvements to a house, he might have a good idea of how it should be done, but he is not the all-time expert on that because that is the architect's role.  The valuer is the person who is most acquainted with the value and the architect is most acquainted with the condition of the house.  The architect will even be prepared to admit that he is not necessarily the expert on structures.  If there is real structural failure in a house that is more the remit of a structural engineer rather than that of an architect or a valuer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To what extent will the issue of this valuation report be helpful to the mortgagee because it will come from two different groupings of professions?  It is not tight enough in the sense that it talks about a valuer's report, but perhaps that valuer's report should be linked in to those engaged in the practice of valuing. <Col N="855" /> I do not necessarily mean members of the institute of which I am a member but those who are engaged in full time practice as people who are available to the public to advise and value.  The Minister may retort that if you are going around long enough and often enough as an architect you will know the value. Sometimes with the fluctuating market that can occur, it is difficult for a professional valuer to be sure of the value he is recommending to the building society. Perhaps I will return to that point when the Minister has had an opportunity to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point Senator FitzGerald raises.  As he said, the practice varies from society to society and people from different professions are used.  In the main these valuation are carried out by valuers rather than members of other professions.  There is no doubt that if, for example, an architect or a surveyor is used on a regular basis to produce these reports, he will very quickly, through the experience of his day to day carrying out of these valuations, come to have a ready and real appreciation of property values. It is important to stress that these valuation reports are precisely that.  They are reports which are designed to satisfy the society that their interest in the property would be secured or covered if the property were to be again offered on the open market.</P>
      <P>It does not purport to carry out a structural examination of the property or advert necessarily to any defects which might be in the property but which would still not result in the property having a lesser value than the extent of the society's interest in the property.  It is important that that should be made clear to the potential borrower.  I accept that in any arrangement to make valuation reports available to the borrower, who is after all paying for them, their attention should be drawn to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points the Minister is making.  Has the Minister <Col N="856" /> considered, as part of the regulations that presumably he will be dealing with in due course, what I regard as the preferable option, namely, that the report of a valuer who has experience in structures, be he an architect or engineer, would be part and parcel of what is provided to the building society and to the prospective mortgagee in order to try to give a report which is substantial, not just on the value, but on the condition of the house?  The building society will want to have their security properly set up by way of the investment they are making and the individual buying the house will be forewarned before he or she buys that there are areas that have to be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>The valuing of property is not as simple as some people suggest.  With regard to older properties, there is very rarely a house with the same value as another house on the same street.  There are different changes of mood and demand relating to the types of houses people will acquire at a particular time.  There are different areas of market demand.  There are people who will buy one house and not buy another.  It is the nature of things. For example, it is much harder to sell a three storey house than a two storey one. People are seeking two storey houses now rather than three storey ones.  Three storey houses in the Dublin scene have become much more difficult to sell than two storey houses.  Many market trends and changes occur which require an expert to deal with them.  It is not something you can just gather together in a few minutes.  You also have to be somebody who has a natural instinct for knowing value.  Architects, by and large, are not people who have a natural instinct for knowing value.  They are interested in concepts of design and so on.  Those people could be used to supplement the necessary form of the report that would issue from the building society to the prospective mortgagee if these things were brought together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very least the Minister should ensure in the regulations that what is issuing from the building society in the report is not one of a whole series of little caveats against such and such.  It should <Col N="857" /> prominently display the fact that this is simply an opinion on value and it does not purport to be in any way related to the condition of the house and that, if you are not 100 per cent satisifed as a prospective mortgagee, you should, go out into the marketplace or come to our society and we will advise you.  There is a panel of people you could go to who would be able to get you a structural survey or, in the case of older houses, the building society might encourage people to get timber surveys done.</P>
    <P>I know a surveyor who bought a house about three years ago.  He was in the house for a few months only when he discovered he had a major epidemic of merulius lacrymans.  This may not be known to everybody but it is familiarly known as dry rot.  He had this disease in his house.  He is an expert surveyor and as a member of the Institute of Chartered Surveyors he should have been able to find that, or at least have taken steps to get his house surveyed as to the condition of the timber which, after all, is now done with much precision by mechanical equipment of one kind or another.  They can measure exactly the extent of moisture or dry rot that might be in the house.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to follow the line I was taking a few minutes ago, perhaps he would ensure that prominent in the letter from the building society including the report on the value would be encouragement for a prospective mortgagee to have the house he is thinking of buying surveyed by somebody who is an expert on structures.  If he has any idea that that may be a problem.  When the house is over 20 years old it is in the best interest of the purchaser to ensure that a firm of timber specialists have a look at it to ensure that the purchaser is not running into the great deal of expense, dry rot can lead to.  We do not need to be told anything about dry rot in these premises &mdash; the Seanad Chamber is out of action because of dry rot.  It affects many buildings all over this city. There is an epidemic of it at present. A little more than what the Minister is <Col N="858" /> suggesting is necessary in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to indicate in my earlier reply that I felt it would be prudent, if valuation reports were to be made available to the borrower, that their attention should be drawn to the fact that the report is merely an assessment of the market value of the house and does not necessarily indicate that the house is free from structural defects or any of the other dreadful diseases which Senator FitzGerald invited us to consider which attack houses in the Irish climate from time to time.  That would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>I am a little frightened at his other suggestion that perhaps the provision should be extended to provide not only for a valuation report but also for a structural report.  A large part of the purpose of this Bill is to reduce the cost to the borrower especially at the time of purchase. If we were to invite ourselves down the road which the Senator is pointing us towards it would not take us long to realise that introducing a requirement like this would inevitably have to increase substantially an element of the cost at the time of purchase.  A full structural report would almost certainly be far more expensive than a valuation report.  It is reasonable to require of the societies that they would draw the attention of the borrower to the fact that their valuation report is just that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that this section should be read in conjunction with section 79 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, which places an obligation on the directors or an officer of the society to satisfy themselves in the interest of the society that the property on which the mortgage is being advanced has a market value of at least the amount of the advance.  That is the legal obligation upon the society.  There is no obligation upon them to draw the applicant's attention to other structural problems, faults or defects.  I join with the Senator in saying it is an important consideration which potential purchasers should give to their purchase.  We are talking about what is probably, in most instances, the single largest purchase most people will make <Col N="859" /> in the course of their entire lifetime.  It would be prudent on the part of the purchaser to seek a structural report.  I do not think it would be fair to require of the societies that they should seek a report of any nature other than the report which satisfies them that their interest in the property is adequately covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay for long on this but I want to make one point.  If you received a report from a building society, namely, the report relating to the house you were thinking of buying and it came from a professional person would you not assume that it covered all the other things a professional practice might look at?  If you get a report issued by an architect relating to value and he does not say anything about the structure, the condition of the house, or possible dry rot, would you not think it is reasonable to suggest that the prospective mortgagee might think everything is all right?  You may think everything is going to be fine because a professional company or practice has said the house is fine and there is nothing wrong with it.  That is the figure they think is secure for the purposes of the building society and it is in good nick.</P>
      <P>I do not get the impression from the Minister that he will ensure that when reports issue from the building society it will be prominently brought to the notice of prospective purchasers that it might be in their interest to have the house examined &mdash; not necessarily the structure except in exceptional cases where there could be doubts about the structure &mdash; by somebody who knows about the condition of houses or property generally. Prospective purchasers should be advised to go in that direction if they have any apprehension including that which I mentioned about getting the house checked out if it is 20 years old for possible dry rot or wet rot problems that might occur. I do not think this is simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a three page document which I got this morning on a recent decision of the courts in England relating to this matter.  It emphasises the point I am making.  We may be leading ourselves <Col N="860" /> into more problems than we realise unless it is prominently brought to the attention of those who are applicants for house loans that there could be potential risks involved.  I imagine the building society could issue a whole page of things that people will not bother reading.  They get them on the back of their insurance certificates as well.  Do people read all those things?  I am saying that it should be displayed prominently and I am not sure if the Minister agrees with me.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to costs.  I am not all that concerned about costs in this area because we are talking about building societies who are apparently financially more successful than any other financial institution in the country.  Presumably, the reports that are being made available to them by a firm of valuers or a firm of architects, or both, will be to their cost rather than to the mortgagee's cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister brought to the attention of the House the fact that this section must be read in conjunction with section 79 (1) (b) of the Building Societies Act, 1976.  Under the provisions of that Act there is no requirement on the building society to get a written report as to the value of the security. All they need do is satisfy themselves with regard to the adequacy of the security. In many cases they will be the same thing.  Obviously if a person is borrowing the maximum on a property you could not say whether or not it was adequate until you actually valued it in total and put a definitive market value on it.  There could be other cases where a person would be borrowing far less than the actual market price of the property.  In those reports there is no obligation whatsoever on the society to consider the market value.  Section 79 (1) (b) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...there will be available to every person who has to assess the adequacy of the security to be so taken a written report prepared and signed by a competent person (who shall not be an officer of the society) experienced in <Col N="861" /> matters relevant to the determination of the value of the security,...</P>
    <P>The person must be experienced in matters relevant to the determination or the value of the security, but his report need not determine the value; his report does not determine the value, it merely says that the security is adequate.  To think that in all cases, because this report will be made available to the members, it will automatically give them a value of their dwelling is incorrect.  It will merely give them a report as to whether or not the dwelling is adequate security for the amount of money they are borrowing.</P>
    <P>They might be buying a property for £100,000 and getting a loan of £50,000. If they got into their possession a report which said: &ldquo;This property has a value of somewhere between £70,000 and £100,000&rdquo;.  Obviously that is adequate security for a borrowing of £50,000.  The report could be as vague as that.  It is not necessarily that there should be a determination as to the value of the security, merely a determination on the adequacy of the security.  Perhaps in the majority of cases that will be the same thing but it is not always the same thing. It should be brought to the attention of the Minister and the public in general that the report they receive may not always be as definitive as they might have thought up to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Several points arise from that.  We have to assume that the majority of purchasers and potential borrowers will pay a fair amount of care and attention to the matter in hand.  As I said in the case of many people it is the single largest purchase they will make in their lifetime.  It is generally well known that the valuation report relates to the value of the society's advance and the society's interest in the property.</P>
      <P>I wonder if Senator O'Leary is not being a little too legalistic in his interpretation of section 79 of the 1976 Act. Section 79 (1) (c) includes the provision that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the report relates to the value <Col N="862" /> of any freehold or leasehold estate in the security and to any other matter likely to affect the value of the security.</P>
    <P>If that paragraph is read in conjunction with the requirements of section 79 (1) (a) and (b) it seems to indicate that not just the society's interest in the security but the overall value of the freehold or leasehold estate also has to be adverted to.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point which Senator FitzGerald has been pursuing I want as gently as possible to point out to him that I have already said twice this afternoon that I accept the point he is making and it would be my intention to include in the regulations relating to the making available of valuation reports a requirement that the society would draw the borrower's attention to the fact that the valuation report was just that and that it was much less than a structural report indicating to people the type of things which they might seek to have expert advice on from the point of view of structural defects.  Apart from including that provision, I would have thought it would be good commercial practice on the part of a society endeavouring to expand its activities and its membership to make advice like this available to potential borrowers.</P>
    <P>I had ten meetings with the various branches of the building society movement. In a number of those discussions with them I found myself saying on a number of occasions that it was not my function to advise the societies on their commercial practice or their marketing activities.  With changing market conditions and with the wind of competition which is beginning to blow and which will increase in strength, it is the societies who respond best to the needs of the customer who will be most successful in the medium and long term.  An interesting point was made at one of the meetings I attended that, in the future, the home loan market will be customer driven. That is a good thing.  I hope that many of the provisions of this Bill will help to bring that about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> In relation to the point which we are now discussing the majority of borrowers will understand the limited nature of a valuation report.  In deference to the points being made by Senator FitzGerald it would be reasonable to write into the regulations a requirement that the societies should draw the borrower's attention specifically to the fact that the valuation report does not advert to or deal with all of the structural matters relating to the property.  That ought to be sufficient.  I also suspect that more and more as market conditions change, one is going to discover that institutions involved in house purchase loans are offering advice and help of this nature to their borrowers and their potential customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain to the Minister what I mean by that.  Of course, I am being legalistic because this is going to impose a tremendous obligation on societies, one with which I agree.  I think what the Minister is doing is quite right and I support him in that but I just want to have it drafted legalistically in the proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the example of a person who is borrowing £50,000 on a £100,000 property and the valuation report says it is somewhere between £70,000 and £100,000.  I think that deals with the adequacy of the thing.  The report relates to the value of the freehold but what it does not do is to exactly define the value of the freehold.  I am not criticising the Minister here and I am not criticising the way in which it was drafted but everybody should understand that you are not going <Col N="864" /> to get a piece of paper here with a definitive valuation.  It is totally unnecessary for the Minister to do &mdash; even though I am glad he is going to do it &mdash; what Senator FitzGerald suggests.  The societies themselves are going to have in red ink the limitations of these valuation report.  If they do not do that &mdash; just as in the case in County Louth to which I referred on Second Stage &mdash; they may be held responsible for it.  I do not think there will be any problem in getting the societies to emphasise the limited nature of the report.  They will be emphasising it themselves to protect their own position. There is absolutely no doubt about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably right. This matter was also adverted to in the report of inquiry into the policies of building societies in regard to insurance related to mortgaged properties and valuation reports on properties, published by the Restricted Practices Commission in 1985.  In section 5 (12) it states:</P>
      <P>Recent court cases both here and in the UK would lead us to believe that even where the valuer's report had not been disclosed by the society to the borrower, the relationship between the valuer and the borrower would still be sufficiently close to raise a duty of care and to provide grounds for bringing an action for negligence against the valuer.  It seems to us, therefore, that the release of the report would not make any real difference from the legal aspect.</P>
      <P>That is quite an illuminating observation on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the point made by Senator O'Leary, taking the example which he has given of a borrower who seeks to borrow £50,000 on a property for which he is prepared to pay £100,000, I think that that borrower, who finds himself in a fortunate enough position to buy a property which he deems to be worth £100,000 and who has £50,000 available to him without having to have recourse to financial institutions, is almost certainly no daw.  He is going to realise that the valuation report only relates to the <Col N="865" /> £50,000 interest the society has in that £100,000 houses.  If he wants to satisfy himself that he is not paying above the market odds, either he does it through his own nous, or through the fact that he has hired someone from that admirable body who nominated Senator FitzGerald to this House, to advise him as to whether or not this is the market value of the property.</P>
    <P>I think the limited nature of the valuation report is well known to the majority of borrowers, but what is not understood by them is the fact that they are not allowed access to a report for which they are charged.  What this paragraph merely does is to allow them access to the document which has been prepared for the society by a valuer but paid for by the borrower, and where, as the Restrictive Practices Commission observes, there is a relationship between the valuer and the borrower.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to be seeking to establish a new body called the building societies consultative council which I think it is fair to say is a rechristening and reincarnation of the Building Societies Advisory Committee established by section 96 of the Principal Act.  I do not know whether that committee met or not between the passing of the Bill and the present day.  I heard a whisper they were appointed but that they did not meet, but I may be wrong in that.  However, I do <Col N="866" /> not think it would be an exaggeration to say that the frequency with which they gathered together was not such as to strain the public purse.  In those circumstances what I am anxious to do &mdash; not so much in regard to this Minister who has a particular interest in this area and I am quite confident will appoint a building societies' consultative council, but for a succession of Ministers &mdash; is to have a situation where this consultative council will actually meet and play a significant role in advising the Minister with regard to matters relating to the societies. Therefore, my first proposal is on the question of reporting annually and the other is that an obligation would be put on the Minister to appoint such a council rather than leave it open to the discretion of the Minister to appoint or not to appoint the council.  There is no reason why such a council should not be appointed.  Even if this Minister were to say to me he has every intention of establishing this council, that does not solve my problem because the next Minister might decide to terminate the council.</P>

      <P>It might be myself, but I will give an absolute undertaking that I will appoint such a body if I am the next Minister for the Environment.  I do not think that undertaking is worth much.  A future Minister may remove the members and by that method just cease to use this consultative council.  In the event of my amendment going through the Minister would be under a continuing obligation &mdash; and not only this Minister but future Ministers &mdash; and it is only right and proper that there should be such a body. I agree with the principle laid down in section 96 of the Building Societies Act, 1976.  I think there are ovbiously changes envisaged by the Minister in the composition of the societies and I am happy to support that.  There should be a continuing obligation on Minister to have this consultative council in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment for the same reasons as <Col N="867" /> Senator O'Leary.  Although I do not very much like the setting up of the building societies consultative council because I think it is a further interference with financial institutions, it should not be left to the discretion of this Minister, or any future Minister, to set it up when he feels like it or not to set it up.  If he does this there is a danger of his using it as a lever against the building societies in a situation of confrontation or of a Minister in the future saying &ldquo;I shall set up this council and they will tell you what to do&rdquo;. It should be statutory and permanent if it is not to be used as a lever for actually pushing the building societies around one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the spirit of what the Senators have been saying.  I can do no more than assure the House that it is my intention to establish the building societies consultative council and on the assumption that this Bill may be enacted before the end of this month, I intend to establish the building societies consultative council before the end of the following month.</P>
      <P>I cannot say whether the building societies advisory committee provided for under section 96 of the 1976 Act were ever appointed or if they ever met. Senator O'Leary seems to think they may have been appointed but, if they were, it was in the early days of the lifetime of this Act and certainly not to my knowledge or the knowledge of the relatively young and vigorous departmental staff who are now dealing with this area.  Our understanding is that the advisory committee were probably never appointed.  They certainly were not active.  As I have said, it is my intention to establish the consultative council before the end of next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain the reasons for the changes in the way the section is drafted. In the 1976 Act there was a provision for representation from the Irish Building Societies Association.  At that time the association represented the five major societies and the smaller societies were much smaller proportionately.  Since then <Col N="868" /> one of the five societies is no longer a member of the IBSA and the smaller societies have increased the scale of their activities.  One of the difficulties I have experienced is in endeavouring to have discussions with the building society movement.  I discovered that I had had nine meetings with the IBSA but, until very recently, there was no umbrella grouping which would allow me to have a meeting with the other building societies. They have now come together under the aegis of the Confederation of Irish Industry and I had a most interesting, useful and helpful meeting with those other societies some time ago.</P>
    <P>One of the real difficulties is that the IBSA members have a hesitancy about becoming involved in meetings or discussions which also involve the non-IBSA members.  It is very difficult for a Minister who has responsibility for a particular area to discover that, in relation to nine or ten societies, some of them are loath to attend meetings with some others.  It is difficult to get a representative voice. The stark fact is that the IBSA members represent the vast bulk of the home loan mortgage market, probably 80 to 90 per cent now.  Yet, on the other hand, in considering legislation and especially considering the more comprehensive legislation which I have referred to and which needs to be put in place, but which will be, if it is all done in one phase, one of the largest pieces of legislation in volume terms to come before the House for some years, it is important to get the view of the smaller societies whose aspirations or needs may be somewhat different from the requirements or aspirations of the very large societies.  Under the terms of the new section it will, I hope, be possible to hear the voice of the society movement both large and small rather than one umbrella group or another.  It is important that this should be so.</P>
    <P>In relation to this specific amendment it is relatively normal practice that sections or provisions like this are drafted on a permissive rather than a mandatory basis.  The intention is that the consultative council would be formed for the <Col N="869" /> purpose of giving advice to the Minister for the Environment of the day and this relates to Senator O'Leary's following amendment.  If the Minister for the Environment needs advice that body should continue in existence to make that advice available on an on-going basis. This advice sometimes may be of a somewhat sensitive nature and therefore it should be made available directly to the Minister, but it is also reasonable that the Minister should be allowed to decide whether he wants to give advice from an assembled group representing different interests or not.  From that point of view it is reasonable to make this provision permissive rather than mandatory.</P>
    <P>For example, if the Senator's amendments were accepted and the Minister for the Environment were not disposed to invite the advice of a consultative council he need merely establish them and put them on ice.  That would not fill any useful function.  We have to rely on the assumption that the Minister for the Environment will want to bring together those who have views, knowledge and expertise from different sectors of the building society movement into a consultative grouping such as this.  I want to make it clear to the House that this section was actually an amendment introduced to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil specifically at my own instigation because of my anxiety to have the consultative council established.  I can guarantee to the House, on the assumption that this measure will be enacted before the end of this year, that the consultative council will not only have been appointed but, hopefully, will have had its first meeting before the end of January.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one or two questions to ask the Minister on section 8.  First, I do not understand why the Minister <Col N="870" /> should have such all-embracing powers over this council.  Section 8 states:</P>
      <P>(4)  The Minister shall, from time to time, nominate one member of the Council to act as Chairman thereof.</P>
      <P>(5)  The Minister may, at any time, remove any member (including the Chairman) from office.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure what sort of a council this is supposed to be but if it is meant to be a council giving impartial, objective advice to the Minister, if it is meant to be a council which has expert knowledge of the building societies and is representative of all sections of society as well, I cannot see why the Minister should be taking these powers to dismiss and appoint at any time that he wishes.  If the consultative council is going to operate in this way it will only become another arm of the Minister in Government.  In other words, if the consultative council gives advice the Minister does not like it is likely to be dismissed or is it there only to give the advice which the Minister wants to receive?</P>
      <P>My second point is in relation to the powers and scope of the council.  Will the council be able to advise the Minister on the application of section 3 of the Bill which covers the powers of the Minister to prescribe purposes for which loans can be made and will it be able to advise the Minister on the future role and the expansion of building societies and the sort of areas building societies may enter in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the last part of the Senator's contribution is one of the primary functions which I would see the consultative council having.  I have been endeavouring to establish a working party with representatives from the IBSA and my Department and the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in relation to the preparation of the more comprehensive legislation but there are difficulties encountered in doing that and the difficulties mainly related to the reservation of the IBSA in having the views of the other society heard at that working party and, indeed, reservations <Col N="871" /> which they expressed at having the Central Bank participate.</P>
      <P>Part of my difficulty in all of this is that I am afraid the societies' attitude on some matters is a little schizophrenic.  They are anxious to move into some of the financial services areas normally provided by the banks yet, as the Senator will know, the main regulatory body for the banks is the Central Bank.  Yet the societies, while wanting to take on some of the powers traditionally enjoyed by the banks, do not want to have any dealings with the Central Bank.  One of the things that the societies will have to determine is whether they want to become more fully grown, wider, big, full, up-front financial institutions because they have to accept that they will then automatically move into the area of the aegis of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>At the last meeting I had with the IBSA I made the point that, if they were to be successful in a number of the objectives which they have outlined for themselves, it might well be that the Minister for the Environment would no longer have any function in relation to the societies because they would have at that stage moved entirely into the area of financial services and into the area where financial institutions generally operate under the aegis of the Central Bank.  I hope that, with goodwill on all sides, it will be possible to use the Building Societies' Consultative Council as the vehicle whereby an amount of consideration of the necessary legislation which has to come along as part of the package of measures that I referred to can be discussed and determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if Senator Ross was in the House when I was replying to a point which he made but the societies would like to have a measure similar to the British measure.  The British measure is 126 sections long; it contains 21 schedules and it runs to 286 pages.  It was several years in gestation and indeed major amendments I gather were actually proposed on the floor of the British Houses as it was being discussed.  Obviously if a similar measure is to be introduced here <Col N="872" /> it will require a great deal of detailed discussion and it should be incumbent on the Minister preparing that legislation to get the views not just of the major and mighty societies but also of the minor but still important societies.  I hope the consultative council will enable this to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could give me some sort of indication of the composition of the consultative council?  Who will the representatives be? What sort of bodies will they be from?  Is it anticipated that there will be three, four, ten or 12 members?  Is it anticipated that there will be representatives from the building societies, the savers, the borrowers, the Department or from where? I just cannot in my mind crystallise the sort of direction in which this consultative council will be going and from where its members will be drawn.  Why is it necessary for this Minister or future Ministers to have quite such all embracing powers in that he can appoint, dismiss, re-appoint any members at any time or any chairman at any time?  I would have thought that there is a value in appointing people for a certain amount of time and then maybe reviewing their performance to see whether they should still be in office.  To appoint them just at the whim of this or future Ministers gives an instability and it leads to the suspicion &mdash; and I am sure it would not be the case in this Minister's term of office &mdash; that if the Minister does not like what they say or if they do not give the right advice, the council are liable to be dismissed. I would like to know why these powers are there because I would have thought people should be there on merit and if they give advice which is not liked, they should not be dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I omitted to refer to that last point which Senator Ross has made when I was replying earlier. The provisions which enable a Minister to remove members of a committee or council from office from time to time are not unusual.  I hesitate to either elevate or denigrate this body by referring to <Col N="873" /> it as a quango &mdash; it hardly merits the title &mdash; but there is provision in legislation generally for a Minister to remove members from office.  Section 8 (3) allows the Minister to appoint so many persons and any persons so appointed shall hold office for such a period as the Minister may specify.  In practice you will find that the Minister would appoint people for a three or a five year period.  It would be most unusual if the Minister had to resort to the powers of section 8 (5) to remove a member from office but it might well be that a member might become permanently ill and the illness might be such that the person would not be in a position to offer his retirement and, if he happened to represent a particular interest group, the only way of getting the view of that group might be to endeavour to replace him.</P>
      <P>The 1976 legislation specified that on the advisory committee there would have to be representatives of the Department of Local Government which Senators will recall was the former title of my Department, the Department of Finance, the registrar, the Central Bank and the Irish Building Societies Association and such other bodies.  Those sort of organisations are the areas obviously which would be drawn on to comprise some of the membership at least of the consultative council. I would like to think that it would be possible to have savers or borrowers represented in some way but there is not to my knowledge any representative group of savers or borrowers.  It might well be that the Minister might decide to appoint a sensible member of the general public who was not himself either a borrower or a saver but who had some particular useful expertise to offer perhaps of a legal nature, dare I say even of a financial services nature, and who could make a useful input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is very likely that a Minister will have to use the powers of subsection (1) (5) but I do know of a particular committee which was appointed in this way without a provision for a period of appointment or a provision for removal and the Minister involved who <Col N="874" /> inherited this provision had extreme difficulty in that whilst he discovered he had the power to appoint further members to this committee there was no power to remove and there was no provision for a person coming to the end of his or her term of office.</P>
    <P>These are fairly standard provisions and I do not think the Senator should worry or seek to read anything particularly sinister or odious into them.  The simple fact of the matter is that the consultative council is to give advice to the Minister.  It is in the Minister's interest that he tries to make it as representative as possible of the various groups who may have expertise to offer on how the building society movement should develop and expand.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say &mdash; I do not think Senator Ross was here when I was replying to the Second Stage of the debate &mdash; that I made it clear to the building societies, at all times in my discussion with them, that I had a totally open mind as to their future role and the extent of their participation in the financial services area.  The discussion document which I published in the spring of this year was based upon the interdepartmental report which had been prepared.  They should not take it as necessarily categorically representing mine or the Government's confirmed and unchangeable view.</P>
    <P>It was up to the societies themselves to prove the case which they wish to make in relation to any of their future activities. If I were convinced in relation to any of those points I would endeavour to convince my colleagues.  I am afraid we got a very short distance down that road and I hope the establishment of the consultative council will provide a vehicle for the societies who wish to express a point of view and to convince others &mdash; because there are others in a range of Departments and offices who need to be satisfied before fundamental decisions about the future of these major institutions are taken.  It would be my earnest hope that this consultative council will provide that vehicle.</P>
    <Col N="875" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is far from satisfactory. Accepting the Minister's assurances I do not understand why it is necessary in section 8 (3) to put in &ldquo;...and any person so appointed shall hold office for such period as the Minister may specify&rdquo;. If that is the case I would have thought it would be more logical for the Minister to appoint them for three years, five years or a certain period of time, but not to give that sort of arbitrary power to the Minister or to future Ministers.  It would be more sensible to have in the Bill that those who are appointed shall serve a period of years and then possibly be reappointed.  I do not understand why such arbitrary power should be there.</P>
      <P>I know it is normal in Bills of this sort to give such all embracing powers to Ministers but not in all cases.  I would have thought that in this Bill which was drafted unfortunately in a slightly confrontational atmosphere such powers were not suitable because it appears to me that they could be abused.  When the Minister says there might be circumstances in which people ought to be dismissed, there might be circumstances in which an appointee to this council should be dismissed, there might be circumstances in which they were ill or incapacitated, I do not understand why those circumstances should not be specifically written into the Bill.  It would be more sensible to limit this Minister's and future ministerial power in that way by writing into the Bill the circumstances in which people could be dismissed rather than allowing appointment, dismissal and term of office completely at the discretion of the Minister.  Would the Minister consider an amendment on Report Stage stating the circumstances in which people could be removed from office from this body?  The danger is that it will be in the consciousness of those appointed that they are there to give advice as long as the advice is welcome but only as long as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have pointed out these are relatively standard provisions which are contained in legislation generally when bodies of a similar nature to <Col N="876" /> this are being established.  The reason those provisions are repeated in legislation, I respectively suggest to the House, is that the House of the Oireachtas over the years have always acted on the assumption that Ministers are in the main reasonable people.  These are standard provisions which need to be included to deal with an extreme situation which fortunately very rarely arises.  I hope the building societies will welcome the establishment of this council because it would give them a specific vehicle whereby they can convey and discuss their views with representatives from various arms of Government and regulatory bodies.</P>
      <P>Looking at some of the areas which were specified in the Building Societies Act, 1976, and the provision to remove people from time to time, if the Senator is attributing some sort of sinister motive to me, I would be inclined to suspect that the representatives of a particular arm of Government would be the ones who would be most fearful that I might seek to remove them from the council.  I really think the Senator is being over-fearful in the views which he expresses.  It is important to the Minister that this council should provide the advice which hopefully will help to from the basis for the preparation of the subsequent and much larger legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one further point to which the Senator has referred in a more temperate way this time than when he spoke on Second Stage on the matter. This Bill was not conceived from malice or because of confrontation.  I referred to this fact in the other House and said that whilst it is, of course, the right of any organisation, group or individual to express their views, political or otherwise, on the performance of the Government of the day or indeed the Opposition of the day or individual Members of Parliament and I respect that right &mdash; it is not the right of any group or individual to misrepresent situations or to introduce elements of personal vilification which, unfortunately, has happened in relation to this area, and I was the sufferer in recent times.  I made it clear to the House <Col N="877" /> that irrespective of that I would continue to introduce the legislation and endeavour to establish a vehicle whereby there could be meaningful discussions leading to the necessary and substantial subsequent legislation.  At all times I made it clear to the building societies that I accepted that there is a need for at least one, and possibly two other pieces of legislation, and I am inclined to the view that it may be more in the societies' interest that the comprehensive legislation should be divided into sections so that the more urgent part of it from their point of view might first be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the changes in the British legislation which will allow British societies to operate outside Britain.  If rumours are to be believed, it may well be that they may turn their attention to the Irish market, as it were, as an experimental springboard, a market which they would regard as relatively similar to their own and in which they might dabble their toe before embarking into mainland Europe.  I am conscious of the discussions at EC level regarding the preparation of a draft directive towards the aspirations of having the internal market arrangements come into effect by 1992.  I am also conscious of the intervention of the banking groups into the home loan market.  There are other suggestions being floated as to new and interesting ways of introducing finance into the home loan market area.  Consequentially, it is very important that building societies generally &mdash; and each society in particular &mdash; examine with care the attention their marketing skills, their approach towards technology, their attitudes towards their members, both investor members and borrower members. They should pay every attention to detail because the market for the future for building societies will be for the brave, the adventurous and those who are conscious that the market will be customer driven.</P>
    <P>The change that is going to occur in this entire area in the next five to ten years will be considerable indeed.  Unless societies no matter how large or successful <Col N="878" /> to date, are very aware, conscious, and responsive to that change, I fear they may encounter considerable difficulties for themselves.  I hope this consultative council will help to bring about in a speedier way than might otherwise have been possible the introduction of that more substantial legislation.  I hope in the consideration of that legislation every reasonable attention to the views of the societies will be given and that the fundamental decisions will be then taken <i>vis-á-vis</i> their role relative to other financial institutions in the financial marketplace.  It would be my intention to approach that task with, as I said, an entirely open mind.</P>
    <P>I do not mind saying in the House that there are suggestions in the discussion document with which I do not personally concur.  I indicated, and could not have made clearer to the societies, my open-mindedness on this matter.  I also met with the societies more often this year than had been the case in the previous three years.  It is both unfair and hurtful to hear it represented that this legislation was approached with a spirit of malice or contentiousness.  That is quite simply not true.  I have been a Member of this House and the Dáil for some 17 or 18 years.  I would regard it as a particular insult to have it suggested that any office holder would prepare legislation based upon those approaches and an insult to Government to suggest that they would accede to an office holder introducing legislation on those bases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that there was a public perception of malice and confrontation.  I stand by that statement and there is a perception not only amongst the public but amongst people in the financial institutions that this Bill was punitive because of confrontation.  I am afraid I have heard that too often not to say it, because that is a perception <Col N="879" /> which is abroad outside this House.  It is thought by many within the building societies and without the building societies that the motivation behind this Bill was not purely for the good of the borrowers. That is a fact and that remains.  I did not say, nor do I say, that it was motivated by malice on the part of the Minister and I feel he is a little oversensitive about this.</P>
      <P>Under section 8, the council is being set up in this atmosphere which &mdash; let us reduce the temperature a little in here by saying this &mdash; is not the most agreeable atmosphere between the Government and the building societies.  The Minister should probably not have the powers over the council which he has.  When the Minister referred earlier to a situation in which these powers could be used, he referred to illness.  That could be specific but just now in his second reference to it, he referred to these powers being used only in extreme circumstances.  I do not understand what sort of an extreme situation that is, but I would like the Minister to explain what sort of an extreme situation he envisages in which these powers should be used for dismissal and appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure to what extent it is being productive to continue this discussion.  Whatever the Senator's perception is about the relationship there might be between the Government and the building societies, I would have to say that there is also a very wide perception that there is not the best of relationship between the societies' borrowers and the societies themselves.  If the Senator cares to reflect on quite an amount of the comment which has been made regarding this legislation since its publication, he will realise that much of that comment did advert to the fact of the bad feeling which exists between borrowers and the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That ought not be the case because, first, the societies are by definition friendly societies, mutual societies.  Their original purpose was to come together and to invite from some of their members <Col N="880" /> sufficient money to enable others of their members to build and provide their own homes.  They have moved a long, long way from the original concept.  I recall a colleague, an office holder, telling me in the last few months that, when he first took out his mortgage which cannot have been more than 30 or so years ago, he was interviewed by the entire board of directors of the society.  At that time that society was clearly operating on a much smaller level but operating much more on the basis of the original concept of building societies as friendly societies.</P>
    <P>One of the things which needs to be discussed, for example, is whether it is appropriate for the societies to continue any longer as mutual societies, what their status ought to be.  They realise and accept that that is one of the questions which needs to be addressed in the context of any further legislation.  I can do no more than give to the House again my assurance that I want to see the consultative council established in order to enable the processing of ideas regarding the preparation of this further comprehensive and major piece of legislation. It would be my intention to ensure that the representatives of Government on that consultative council approach the task with an open mind.  I would like to think that all of those who might serve on the council would do likewise.  Senators in the House will have to appreciate the basic difficulty facing any Minister endeavouring to deal with ten organisations where four, who have by far the major share of the movement, refuse to participate in discussions with some of the others.  Whatever the Senator's perception, I would also like to say that I believe it is fair for me to say that I enjoy the best of relations with quite a number of the ten building societies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very appropriate that we should be discussing this report of the joint committee.  We all know that at present the position with regard to cereals is very critical and the prospects for cereal growing generally in Ireland are not great.  However, there are certain ways and means we can adopt to ensure that cereal growing is made as attractive as possible economically and otherwise, because the reality is that for many many farmers now in tillage, there is no alternative to cereal production at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tillage in essence means a substantial amount of cereals on a rotation basis. Those farmers cannot easily get back into another line of production for financial reasons.  They have not the wherewithal to stock the land with sheep or cattle and <Col N="882" /> it goes without saying that milk production is no longer open to them.  We are producing approximately 950,000 acres made up in actual figures of 710,000 acres of barley and between winter wheat and spring wheat and oats almost 250,000 acres.  The situation has changed dramatically in the last 12 months in the cereal growing.  The Commission in Brussels has been considering the question of surpluses and over production within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and the farm price package in 1986 clearly reflects their attitude to these problems.  The Irish cereal growers are suffering a major loss of revenue which could be upwards of £13 or £14 million in a full year.  That is the reality because of the co-responsibility levy with high quality standards &mdash; which effectively is a disguised price instrument &mdash; and delayed intervention.  Therefore, the indications are that the actual economic survival of many Irish cereal growers is in grave doubt.  There will be a significant reduction in the acreage of cereal in Ireland in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The joint committee of which I am a member in considering the question of cereals were of the opinion that the Commission's proposals have helped to widen regional disparities within the Community. There were already major disparities and our committee were of the view that the proposals would only widen that disparity.  The fact that the small cereal producer in Ireland is being penalised to the same extent as the large cereal producers in the United Kingdom and or in the Paris Basin is a total contradiction of the Commission's stated policy on maintaining the family farm unit, a concept we in Ireland hold very dear and to which we aspire in the various facets of farming, not alone in cereals but in all branches of farming.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk these days about cutbacks and the dangers they will cause to the basic fabric of the common agricultural policy.  There is a very real danger that the Germans and the French will agree to cutbacks in cereals as is being mooted by the Commission.  They in turn will then compensate their farmers <Col N="883" /> by national aids.  Of course, as we well know Irish farmers, whether in cereals, milk or beef, will not have any fall back on such national aids.  This is the reality and we must be very mindful of it.</P>
    <P>The joint committee are extremely concerned about that kind of evolution. We could be heading into a rationalisation of the common agricultural policy and the question of national aids could be difficult, if not impossible, to contemplate in an Irish context.  Over the years we have benefited very substantially by virtue of our membership of the European Community.  This year we will have received, as a nation, approximately £900 million from the EC.  Over a number of years we have been the average beneficiary to the tune of a figure in excess of £500 million.  That is taking a number of years into account.  Therefore, it stands to reason that the European Community is important from our point of view.  It is also important that there is agreement on the various areas relating to the CAP but of course, we must not have agreement at too dear a price.</P>
    <P>We would be of the view that the very serious developments generally in agriculture demand and require further negotiations on the part of the Government in Brussels.  There is a very definite erosion of the fabric of the CAP in that Community preference is not now being observed.  There are £18.2 million worth of imports of cereals or cereal substitutes into the Community.  These have been fairly conveniently ignored by the Commission's proposal.  The imports are causing the huge surplus.  Without them the surplus produced by the Community would be manageable.</P>
    <P>One has to acknowledge that imports into the Community are, in the main, involved in and tied up with the question of GATT arrangements and agreements. As a member of the EC we must be mindful of the fact that GATT is the vehicle by which important trading arrangements are conducted and we must <Col N="884" /> make certain that the GATT arrangement does not work totally and completely against us.  We must acknowledge its relevance in the context of surpluses of whatever products into the EC.  This situation arises not alone in cereals but in the dairy product sector and in beef and so on.  These various imports are causing major surpluses.  Without these surpluses we would have production levels that would be manageable and would not lead to this massive and expensive intervention system which is questionable.</P>
    <P>When one refers to intervention, one should not lose the opportunity to make the point that intervention was never intended except as a place where surplus stocks would be placed.  It was never intended to be a place to sell produce or to place a produce that otherwise should be, and indeed could be, sold in the market place.  That is a factor that we have been inclined to forget.</P>
    <P>We had the Chernobyl disaster earlier in the year which would obviously be a major factor in the context of cereal production since vast areas of land in Russia, and other places from which Russia was getting cereal imports, are no longer suitable for cereal production. This would give scope for production within the European Community.  We should also bear in mind that a similar disaster occurring in Europe would dictate to us that we should be very mindful of the need to have substantial stocks to counteract such a disaster.  One is hopeful that it would not happen but one must always budget for the unpalatable.  Irish cereal growers will be severely affected by a number of points put forward by the Commission.  They have been in effect since last July.  We have the co-responsibility levy which is in force since 1 July and also the higher quality standards. Certain areas of production will be severely hit.  The production of spring barley for many farmers will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to cereals generally is in grave doubt.  Looking at the cereal production scene at the moment, we have spring wheat and barley which, <Col N="885" /> by and large, give the lowest yield and the lowest production.  The Minister, who is a very efficient cereal producer, will be well aware of that fact.  There is a tendency nowadays to produce about 80 per cent of our wheat as winter wheat. Roughly 20 per cent is spring wheat. There has to be a differential of approximately half a tonne per acre to justify the extra costs involved in the production of winter wheat to enable people to have an advantage.  Ironically, where seasonal factors can have a major effect on production, the 1986 winter wheat, which would have been ready for harvesting in August, was very severely hit by weather conditions, whereas spring grown wheat just hit the right harvesting time in September when we had a unique spell of fine weather.  One cannot logically make a case depending on exceptional circumstances during any given year or years, but it does point out the absolute uncertainty of cereal production.  In regard to winter wheat there are the added costs of nitrogen, sprays etc. which mean that all those who collectively produce 120,000 acres of winter wheat must get that extra half tonne per acre as against those who are collectively producing approximately 40,000 acres of spring wheat.  I mentioned that this year was exceptional but, by and large, winter wheat production obviously has a certain advantage.</P>
    <P>No matter what area of agriculture one talks about these days one finds oneself talking about the need for better quality. The quality for the EC requirements is quite different from the Irish requirements in the cereal sector.  In 1985, 15 per cent of our wheat found its way into intervention whereas this year the figure was almost nil.  The normal figure would be approximately 3 per cent or 4 per cent. In regard to winter and spring barley the difference is mainly on acreage.  We have approximately 500,000 acres of spring barley, 75,000 acres of winter barley and 105,000 acres of malting barley.  Obviously the malt and barley acreage is fairly definite.</P>
    <P>The acreage will reduce as efficiency increases because quantities of barley <Col N="886" /> have grown on a contractual basis for malt making purposes.  Winter barley as shown by the figures has little advantage over spring barley.  It is so different from wheat.  I referred earlier to quality and one of the big factors we have to think about on the quality front is the moisture content.  We have to meet a requirement of 14 per cent moisture if our cereals are to qualify for intervention.  In 1986 it went from 15 per cent to 14 per cent.  This is attainable only through artificial drying mechanisms.  By using combine harvesters, cereals of that moisture level cannot be obtained whereas our colleagues and friends in Europe can, from the combine harvester, produce cereals with those lower moisture levels.</P>
    <P>This automatically leads to extra cost. To bring cereals from a 20 per cent moisture content level to a 15 per cent moisture level will cost approximately £23.  If we are to get it down to 14 per cent it will cost £5 or £6 more.  Obviously that extra percentage point would be very hard to attain in the first instance and it would be quite costly as well.  The real problem is that it will add to the cost of cereal production and make the whole question of cereal production a problematic factor.</P>
    <P>The other major problem is the hectolitre weight which in simple teminology is the weight for a given volume of grain. It is equivalent to the old bushel weight of wheat, barley and oats.  The level above which we must be aiming is a figure of 76.  It must be downwards from 76 and a figure below 72 grain will not be acceptable at all.  From 76 downwards we are talking of a 1 per cent reduction in price which is quite substantial.</P>
    <P>In relation to imports which are a real threat to barley producers, we have tapioca and we have soya bean which is a high protein food but would not be of such consequence as tapioca which would compete very seriously with Irish grown barley.  We can combat this to a certain extent by the production of corn gluten. We must be conscious of the fact that with an EC arrangement and price fixing, tapioca is available here at world prices. We must look at the alternatives to <Col N="887" /> cereals and if there are to be lower acreages of cereals in the future, the obvious ones are peas, beans, rape, vetches and so on. The Minister might have some observation to make on this.  Perhaps one could talk about a figure of 25,000 acres in total there.</P>
    <P>It is difficult &mdash; and there is no point in saying otherwise &mdash; to find the alternative to any substantial change or reduction in acreage.  We have many small farmers who produce a lot of our wheat and a great deal of our barley.  Only 10 per cent of our total number of producers produce over 200 acres of cereals and that would be 5,000 people: our total cereal producers number 50,000.  We have only 10 per cent of those in excess of 5,000 acres. We have 10,000 wheat producers who produce 15 acres of wheat or less, and we have a higher figure from 15,000 to 20,000 who produce less than 14 acres of barley. The point I want to make quite clearly is that grain production is not in the hands of the large farmers only.  It is in the hands of 50,000 farmers at present.  Those 50,000 farmers are involved in other lines of production as well and we must be mindful of that.  At present there is an output production figure of 2 million tonnes and there is a requirement of 3 million tonnes.  We have scope for producing more.  To what extent can we replace over 225,000 tonnes of wheat which we are currently importing?  We have 90,000 tonnes of the Canadian hard wheat, which we could replace substantially. By and large, we are back to the old chestnut of quality.  There are 225,000 tonnes of wheat which can be readily replaced which is imported at present from the United Kingdom and France.  The same applies to other cereal products.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities examined these and various other aspects of the whole cereal area.  Persons have had the opportunity of examining the document and have views to express.  I do not intend to dwell any further on this matter, except to say that we are now placed at a very major disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> cereal production <Col N="888" /> in this country.  We must be mindful of that and we must make sure that the appropriate steps are taken to ensure that cereal producers are not faced with too great a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on this report on cereals from the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. The proposal coming from the Commission would have serious effects on the agricultural community and on the country.  I often wonder if the EC Commision are fair to a country like Ireland. The situation, as it applies to milk, should also apply to cereals.  We are in a unique situation geographically.  We are an island to the west of the European Community and our climate is different from the rest of Europe.  We are subject to more rainfall and, therefore, it definitely affects cereal growth.  This has been obvious for the past two years when the cereal growers and the tillage farmers had a rough time and their incomes were drastically reduced because of climatic conditions. The EC Commission should endeavour to have a uniform level of income for all farmers throughout the Community.  While certain decisions would be fair to our partners in Europe, those decisions if applied to our country, would cause our level of income to be lower than the income of farmers in other countries because of our geographical location and the amount of rainfall in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community production of cereals has risen at a faster rate than Community consumption plus other market requirements. The Commission makes proposals which include price restraint, the co-responsibility levy, quality standards and access to intervention.  All of these proposals would have serious implications for the grain growers, the tillage farmers and especially for our economy.  A price restraint, or a 3 per cent co-responsibility levy, together with price cuts of over 10 per cent as a result of the changes in quality standards for feed grain, and the intervention price for bread wheat fixed at the same level as that applying to feed <Col N="889" /> wheat, barley and maize in 1985-86 are proposed.  The purpose of the co-responsibility levy, the report states, is to develop Community outlets and also to give producers an indication of the nature of the market situation.  There is a levy of 3 per cent on all grain marketed, including inter-farm sales and grain delivered by producers for processing and return to the producer.  The small producer can apply for a refund of the levy on the first 25 tonnes of production but 25 tonnes is very little and does not give much scope.</P>
    <P>The quality standards are very demanding for Irish farmers.  The report suggests that access to intervention is to be confined to wheat of not over 14 per cent moisture content, as opposed to 15 per cent moisture content in previous years.  The moisture content, especially with our climatic conditions, is much higher than that.  It will definitely put our tillage farmers to extra expense in buying drying equipment and storage, which they will not be able to afford.  The farm modernisation scheme should be implemented.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the £3.5 million which was earmarked for the farm modernisation scheme &mdash; which the Government seem to be determined to save &mdash; should find its way to the farmers who are anxious to improve their buildings.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is attentive to the debate but I have a few complaints to make.  I am talking about the cost to grain farmers of providing storage and drying equipment to ensure a moisture content of 14 per cent or less in grain. The farm modernisation scheme should be implemented to ensure that these grain farmers or tillage farmers can be provided with aid for drying equipment and storage.  I understand the £3.5 million which has been earmarked for the farm modernisation scheme for the past couple of years &mdash; it will be matched pound for pound by the EC &mdash; is not being utilised. That is a shame.  I know there is new farm modernisation scheme and I have had complaints already from applicants who applied to participate in this scheme. They said they would be prepared to commence <Col N="890" /> work in October.  Because of necessity they commenced the work &mdash; I am speaking of farm roadways which are important.  They had to build these roadways to take slurry out but the inspector did not call until two or three months later.  They were then told that because the work was done they would not get a grant, that the work should have been approved prior to its commencement in order to qualify for the grant.</P>

      <P>The matter I am raising is that:</P>
      <P>In view of the immediate threat to items of archaeological value posed by the decision of the High Court yesterday in relation to the Derrynaflan Find, the Seanad be informed of the Government's intention in relation to action, including such legislative action as is necessary, the legal implications and the Government's plans for the protection of such objects as are already lodged in the National Museum and at other locations managed by the State.</P>
      <P>I would like straight away to thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating me in raising this matter under Standing Order No. 29.  I would like to thank the representatives of other groups in the Seanad for facilitating this process and also for their support earlier for this resolution being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Senator representing a National University of Ireland constituency, I have been contacted by a number of people who are concerned and who are also professionally engaged in the area to which the Derrynaflan find and the consequent court decision relates.  In the discussion <Col N="891" /> within our own group of Labour Senators we were unanimous in trying to find a way in which we could reflect the urgent public concern that has been expressed concerning the decision yesterday.</P>
    <P>What is being called into question is something very important and that is that the High Court has decided on the matter of possession of an artefact or set of artefacts which, in the view of all of us, would be part of the national heritage.  It has not decided on the matter of ownership and we are in an unfortunate position now where we must look at the protection that exists for objects that are part of the national heritage and realise that, in the first instance, in the period of time between the High Court decision and the Supreme Court decision, we are vulnerable to serious aversions which are not in the interests of the sustenance and protection of the national heritage.</P>
    <P>I ask for clarification in that regard because I am also aware that we are in the gap before the coming into effect of the National Monuments Bill which, when enacted, will protect us in the future.  It will protect our sites and our heritage significantly.  But what is to take place in the interim?  It is to that that public concern is addressed.  To judge this matter purely in terms of possession raises the most serious questions concerning our heritage.  For a start, different Governments have always been advised &mdash; and they have taken the advice to a greater or lesser degree &mdash; by professional people who have made the elementary point that an object is important, not only in its own right but in the context in which it is located and discovered.</P>
    <P>Thus, in every civilised country sites are protected.  It is realised that the pulling of objects from the ground and destroying the earth layers and the other evidence that surrounds the object &mdash; in other words the rooting of it out of its context &mdash; is an act of enormous damage to the archaeological site in question.  It seems that not only has that dimension of the object in context been ignored in <Col N="892" /> the court decision but also that the very ownership of the object and the question of what constitutes the national heritage has been placed as secondary to the basic issue in law of possession or, more technically, the adjudging of bailor or bailee rights.</P>
    <P>I find it rather preposterous to find an object, such as the one that was the subject of yesterday's decision of the High Court, being adjudged as an object without contextual significance, handed into possession and the judge deciding as to whether it should be handed back and asked to adjudge whether value had been added to it.  In fact, the depression I reflected in the National Monuments Bill debate as to what the public attitude is towards objects like this, deepened when the argument in the newsprint concentrated on relative values to the exclusion to some extent of the more general points of the contextual value of these objects.  However, there were some fine articles in this regard in the Irish newspapers today.  But, by and large, the public have concentrated its mind on the very large sum of money that was mentioned in the court.</P>
    <P>What is terribly important is that we realise the inadequacy of our protection at present.  We are now entering a period in which we do not enjoy the protection of the new amending legislation.  It is not at all clear what protections are there between now and the period of the adjudication of the appeal to the Supreme Court.  Perhaps the Minister of State can advise me on this.  I am anxious that my mind and the minds of those who have asked to bring this matter before the Seanad be placed at rest.  Perhaps the advice of the Attorney General's Office in relation to retrospection will be that you cannot reach back and construe the placing of objects in the past as falling within the ambit of the decision given yesterday.  But is this adequate?  Is a construction based on the retrospective nature of a decision a sufficient protection? If that is not sufficient, then the question of emergency legislation arises, such as is necessary in order to protect as, I am asking, what is already placed in <Col N="893" /> the National Museum and I very clearly specify &ldquo;and at other locations managed by the State&rdquo;.  I am aware that, because of the inadequacy of the resources perhaps, we have objects that are lodged in other places.  We have not provided sufficient facilities for them to be placed on display.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the nub of my argument is entirely the vulnerabilty of the national heritage.  I am placing that prior to every other consideration.  Comments have been made on the decision that have concentrated on the issues of trespass, that after all, the objects that were discovered were discovered by people who were trespassing on land.  They were equally &mdash; and this is less so in my consideration; we are dealing with this in the National Momnuments Bill &mdash; using an instrument or set of instruments which will be heavily controlled under the legislation we are proposing.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation has arisen. Was the compenation adequate?  I will return to these points for just a minute but, to my mind, they are not the most important aspects of the case.  The most important aspect is the one of adequacy of protection.  I am worried because of what the court has decided.  It is a matter that the Supreme Court will have to adjudge.  It is my own belief, as we stand in the year before the fiftieth anniversary of the 1937 Constitution, that there is need for a constitutional protection of the people's property such as the national heritage constitutes.  Property rights and citizenship rights and possession have to be made contingent on these other greater rights which affect not only our lives today but which affect our history.</P>
    <P>The newspapers have correctly drawn our attention to what might take place following this decision, should the appeal not take place.  It has been suggested that perhaps there are over 20 other possible finds of equal significance and value to that of Derrynaflan undiscovered in Ireland.  It has been described by one paper as possibly unleashing &ldquo;a gold hunt&rdquo; in the country.  The mind boggles at the idea that in 1986 a country that has signed international agreements, that has participated in prestigious international <Col N="894" /> events one after another &mdash; some organised by UNESCO and others organised by other prestigious bodies abroad &mdash; should be left vulnerable to the degree that you would have people with instruments trespassing and moving onto sites of national archaeological value and proceeding to root objects out of the ground, destroying our possibilities of reconstructing valuable parts of our past and that they could then enjoy the protection of the courts and that we would have the benefit of looking at them drinking champagne celebrating the fact that they had become Christmas millionaires.  I asked myself whether I was living in a civilised island at all.</P>
    <P>I understand the statement has already been made by the Minister of State for whose presence I am very grateful in the House this afternoon that an appeal will be stated to the Supreme Court.  It would be useful if the Minister of State repeated unequivocally his commitment to protecting the nation's heritage and, perhaps, as he has so many more resources than I have and has more expert advice available to him, told us what his plans are in this regard in relation to protecting the national heritage otherwise than in terms of the legislation brought before the Houses already.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about the depressing aspects of this entire saga and the decision which has led to a commendable public outrage.  Several people have commented on this to me.  I know from the Senators who are speaking &mdash; and I understand from those on all sides of this House who this afternoon supported this move &mdash; that they reflect from their different constituencies and from the different areas they represent this sense of public outrage as to the position we are in.</P>
    <P>We are at risk since February, 1980, when the discovery was first made and the items were handed to the National Museum.  It occurred to me this morning when I read the report that the National Museum in the judgment were allowed £25,800 &mdash; £24,000 of which had been paid to the British Museum; £1,800 for photographic work &mdash; to wonder if we <Col N="895" /> were reducing the National Museum to the level of some kind of technical ghetto at which people who go looting around the country and destroying the national heritage can arrive with their objects to be repaired and to be photographed and to be handed back to them under the protection of the courts?  It is an outrageous situation in relation to our national heritage that we live with this judgment.</P>
    <P>I do not belive we can get out of this by saying the judge had to decide within the law.  The Supreme Court will decide that.  I emphasise that the issue of possession has been commented upon by the High Court.  The Supreme Court will decide issues such as the issue of ownership. There are other issues involved as well as deciding the whole circumstances stated before the High Court.  A High Court judge can begin at any end of an object, at any end from his own reasoning about where he wants to begin.  The issues in this case were not simple bailor-bailee relationships governing only the question of possession and the return of an object placed in possession from an individual or a State institution or whatever.  He could have addressed straight away the question of ownership and the whole consequences that flow from the current argument on our treasure trove.  Who is to say?  Even when that has been struck down, we are left with the issue as to which objects have been hidden and which objects have been lost.</P>
    <P>At the end of the eighties many people had made distinguished contributions to what constitutes the Irish heritage, part of which we have put on tour abroad in the United States and elsewhere.  Many visitors come to our country and admire what has been made available, the painstaking work that has been carried on by people with very minimal resources.  Are we to accept a situation in which the national assembly of this would be almost casual, to what we could achieve?</P>
    <P>Others can, if they wish, develop this issue of trespass, the issue, for example, of whether the landowner owns particular objects.  I am not happy with that kind <Col N="896" /> of definition myself.  The concept of the nation's heritage constituting a category of property is the one that I will press for in 1987 when the case for amending the Constitution, I hope, will be lodged.  Such a definition exists, and the time has come to accept that.  What right has an individual or set of individuals to set about destroying our possibilities of reconstructing the story ourselves, the whole imaginative past that we have had and so on?  What right have they?  Even in relation to institutions which have themselves limited resources, the strategy has always been to err on the side of caution in making sure, for example, that only the most experienced and trained people will have access to sensitive sites and so forth.  The idea that people can be made millionaires on the basis of what we have just said, by a decision of the courts yesterday, makes it an extraordinarily sad day for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that many people have said this issue can be resolved if we can face the issue of adequate compensation. I do not agree.  I think people who act responsibly should be compensated. Here the distinction between the amount recommended, as is reported by the National Museum and the Government, is a matter that could be debated. It seems to me, however, that there is a fundamental issue that precedes that and it is the issue as to what is the status of the objects and the value of the context in which they are placed.</P>
    <P>I commend the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; a paper I do not find myself always able to commend &mdash; for its excellent article by Ian Baird in which he mentions what happened to the Clare find of 1854 in my own parish where I was reared myself, when objects were gathered by a local broker and sold to be melted down.  What happened a cape of gold which weighed 100 ounces, and was sold and melted down by a Cork goldsmith and so forth.</P>
    <P>These are tragic cases.  One could understand insecure peasants believing that they had stumbled on riches and thinking that by selling them they would marginally improve their lot but over 130 years have gone by and we are not talking <Col N="897" /> about people discovering gold under bushes.  We are talking about people being free to go out with instruments that are declared illegal in many countries in the world, to trespass, to go on to national sites and then to be secured by such headlines as &ldquo;Finders Keepers&rdquo;.  That decision, which comes at the culmination of a series of events that began in 1980 reflects a great deal of urgency.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is limited to one and a half hours and I know there are other speakers and for that reason my contribution will be brief.  It is unfortunate in my view that it has taken a serious setback of this kind to underline the sad and unforgiveable fact that our laws concerning national monuments are woefully inadequate.  What is worse is that the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, does not in my opinion come to grips with the problem.  I hope that in the forthcoming debate on Committee Stage I will be proved wrong.</P>
      <P>There have been criticisms of this House.  Some people have claimed it is an anachronism, superfluous, out of touch with the real world.  I do not subscribe to those views.  I think that recent legislation which has gone through this House would show otherwise, in the amendments that were tabled and incorporated in legislation. This motion puts a finger on the pulse of the widespread concern felt at this time.  I hope the debate will contribute to a positive resolution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill will be taken here next Tuesday and there are 67 amendments tabled.  That is an indication of the interest this House has in this area.  A very important section of this Bill, section 2, deals with the restriction in the use of detection devices.  Senator Higgins has referred to treasure trove and the general behalf of &ldquo;finders keepers&rdquo; and this aspect of the matter is not dealt with in the Bill.  People use detection devices and detectors to discover hidden treasure and they use fairly expensive instruments; they put a lot of time into it <Col N="898" /> and expend a lot of energy in digging up the ground.  In some ways I am not totally happy with section 2 and I hope the cure does not turn out to be worse than the disease.  That is something we will be dealing with when the time comes.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the important question of ownership.  Senator Higgins has referred to this and I would take a slightly different view from his.  This is an important question and for that reason I have tabled a new section, section 22, which is short and which I would like to read: It states:</P>
    <P>Where an artefact or object is considered an archaeological object and is acquired by the National Museum otherwise than as a gift, payment shall be made to the owner of the land on which such artefact or object was discovered. Where the amount of the payment is not agreed an appeal may be made to the Historic Monuments Advisory Committee whose decision shall be binding.</P>
    <P>That section may not be considered perfect or indeed totally adequate but, in my view, at least it attempts to deal with the problem.  There is a belief &mdash; shaken, I agree by this case &mdash; that the right of ownership of land extends to everything on or in the land.  It would extend, for example, to a disused item of domestic or agricultural use such as a spade, a bucket or something of that nature.  If the Derrynaflan hoard were above the ground what would be the position?  It would no doubt have belonged to the farmer who owned the land.  Because the farmer did not sanction or allow the use of certain aids, it would seem to me wrong to assume that the finders could be keepers.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned in this House, and I will just very briefly refer to it again in passing, the situation as regards the Book of Kells.  The Book of Kells is in Trinity College but the people of Kells believe that this book belongs to Kells.  Suppose the people of Kells or somebody representing them took that Book out of Trinity College by some means &mdash; it would undoubtedly be a criminal act &mdash; but in <Col N="899" /> the light of this case, they would not be condemned for doing that because the actual taking away of the hoard from the land was not condemned.  In my view it is exactly the same case.  It has been said that the court decision is incomprehensible and of course it is.</P>
    <P>More aspects of this case are also incomprehensible, and I ask the question: why was that particular course taken?  According to reports in the papers, Mr. Justice Blayney had decided in July last that the hoard found in Derrynaflan Island, Littleton Bog, County Tipperary, on 17 February 1980 should be returned to Mr. Webb and his son.  That decision was made last July.  The State was claiming an allowance for work done in restoring the chalice and the hoard. That was a waste of time.  The State should have been attempting to prove that the Webbs had no legal right to the hoard.  Mr. Justice Blayney said he had no doubt that the staff of the National Museum honestly believed the State was the owner of the hoard and what work they did was done in that belief.  But was that sufficient, he is reported to have asked, in the light of the fact that they had notice of a claim by the Webbs to have the hoard returned to them?</P>
    <P>May I quote a very small extract of the judgment from today's issue of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on page 4, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>I consider that the fact that they had received notice of a claim resulted in a situation in which they ought to have been aware, irrespective of what they believed, that there was a risk that the claim was valid and they necessarily accepted that risk.</P>
    <P>I think that it is a serious indictment, not alone of the National Museum but of the whole structure concerned in the State also.  I know it was a very difficult situation for the museum.  The Webbs are reported to have said that they would have been satisfied with a reasonable settlement and, of course, that begs the question, what would be considered reasonable?  Perhaps what is meant there is &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;.  In any event, who <Col N="900" /> decides?  Nevertheless, in this situation I think the £10,000 offered was far too little.  According to reports, the museum decided to offer £200,000 to the Webbs after the chalice was found but the Government overturned the decision and stipulated that £10,000 should be the maximum reward.  That was a serious mistake.</P>
    <P>I know it is easy to be wise with hindsight. I know that in paying a large award the museum might be considered to be condoning trespass and encouraging it when the question of landownership comes up.  I think it is agreed it is criminal to excavate an archaeological site and to interfere with the history that is written into the fabric and into the layers of that site.  It has been said that it would be better to leave this hoard for another 100 or 200 years and to get the full picture by ensuring the proper excavation.  Under the new law it would be a statutory offence on conviction or indictment liable to a fine not exceeding £50,000 or 12 months in prison or both to use a metal detector on an archaeological site.  This hoard has great monetary value.  Evidence from the Webbs show that the hoard's value on the open market, if there were no restriction on it being exported from Ireland, would be £5 million to £8 million.  Evidence for the State was on the basis that the hoard could not be legally sold outside the country and on this basis its value was £5,536,000.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the legal aspects of this case.  There are ways of getting around the law; there are more ways of killing the cat than choking it with milk.  I believe that the value is far in excess of that amount, more than ten times as much.  It is priceless, it is something that cannot be replaced.  It has an important cultural value and is part of our national heritage.  Senator Higgins referred to the commendable public outrage which is widespread at this time. This debate is very timely and I hope that out of this debate something positive and immediate will be instigated.</P>

      <P>I would like briefly to support the two previous Senators in <Col N="901" /> seeking a statement from the Minister responsible in this regard.  As Senator Michael D. Higgins said there is a very substantial degree of public disquiet in regard to what has happened.  As the public see it, a person was trespassing, a person was using an instrument long considered by those experts in the field as a dangerous damaging instrument and now considered by public opinion to be an unsuitable instrument and an instrument declared in the Bill now going through this House as an illegal instrument. Senators will be gratified that the Minister in charge of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill has met in the amendments now tabled the criticism of this House that the original form of the Bill contained penalties that were far too mild for the use of such an instrument.  It has not only greatly increased the financial penalties but has added the threat of imprisonment to the use of such instruments.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is in the future. What we are talking about is a case in which such an instrument was used, in which a hole was dug with whatever degree of energy and expertise the finder and his son possessed and there was removed from that hole an object which has now been valued at over £5 million. The public looking at what happened and watching their television sets last night with the news of the judgment which was made and the news of the celebration of the finders were perturbed.  If one were asked to summarise the reaction of the public which one has heard during today, it indeed is the reaction which one finds in chapter 51 of <i>Oliver Twist</i> by Charles Dickens: &ldquo; `If the law supposes that,' said Mr. Bumble ... `the law is a ass &mdash; a idiot.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am precluded by Standing Orders from doing more than giving this public opinion and I hastily say that I do not consider that this is necessarily true.  I certainly am not suggesting that the judge who ruled on a very narrow issue in the court is either an ass or an idiot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action which was at issue was an action for the return of this chalice to the finders and it specifically stated in the <Col N="902" /> judgment and I quote from that judgment as follows:</P>
    <P>The action is not concerned with the ownership of the hoard and will not determine its ownership.</P>
    <P>The concern that has been raised by Senator Michael D. Higgins and shared by Senator Fitzsimons is this very fact of ownership.  What happened in court yesterday was not concerned with the main point of ownership.  It is a matter of regret also, as Senator Fitzsimons has said, that the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill which will clear this House next week and be passed on for consideration to another place does not deal with that issue either.  It is a matter for consideration for the Minister in charge of that Bill &mdash; who is not the Minister present with us today &mdash; and for the Senators who have been expressing an interest in it whether it will be possible on Committee or Report Stage within the scope of that Bill as read a Second Time to amend it in such a way as at least to start the process of clearing up this doubtful legal area in regard to ownership. There is an urgent need that the question of treasure trove needs to be determined without delay either by the courts or by the legislature.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion in the leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that the question of treasure trove was a sort of popular lore which had now been found to have no foundation and is, in fact, almost like the belief that if you followed to the end of the rainbow you would find a pot of gold and that it had not much more foundation than that.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk for a few minutes about the reason there was a belief that there was still a law of treasure trove in this country.  I have had occasion to advert to this matter because I have been and am now a member of the Council of the Royal Irish Academy and was at one time an officer of that body.</P>
    <P>The situation during the last century when many of the great treasures of our national collection were acquired by the nation was that they were acquired through the Royal Irish Academy and <Col N="903" /> that was facilitated by the fact that the Royal Irish Academy in the year 1860 asked for and was granted the right to deal with treasure trove in Ireland.  It carried out that task of acquisition throughout the next 30 years, until the National Museum was founded and it then handed over its collection to the National Museum.  Since then the Royal Irish Academy has always considered that it was the <i>de jure</i> authority for treasure trove while the Museum was the <i>de factor</i> authority in the sense that large purchases were financed by the Museum, through the Academy.</P>
    <P>The situation which has arisen here is a most unfortunate one, but it is not the only case in the history of treasure trove in Ireland in which there have been difficulties. It is perhaps interesting to recall that the item of our public treasure which can be most closely compared with the Derrynaflan chalice also had a difficult history; I refer to the Ardagh chalice. The differences were there.  There were difficulties in both cases.  In the case of the Ardagh chalice court action was avoided by an astute handling of those difficulties.  In the case of the Derrynaflan chalice court action was not avoided and there is a suspicion that a good deal of this may be due to a maladroit handling of the whole business.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to go into this in any detail, I think it likely that if the National Museum, which is the repository of our treasures, the material part of our heritage, were given a greater degree of autonomy and greater power to make its own decisions in regard to such questions as the acquisition of treasure trove, this question might not have risen.  I do not think there would be any doubt in anyone's mind when I say that the intervention of a dead hand may well have produced the present impasse because the Department to which that dead hand belongs is well known to all of us.</P>
    <P>We have got ourselves into a mess.  I talk collectively &mdash; not the Seanad but the State &mdash; acting on behalf of all of us.</P>
    <P>A simple law is needed putting the position of ownership of treasure trove <Col N="904" /> beyond any doubt.  Whatever happens by appeal to the Supreme Court or by special legislative action in regard to the present case, the message we must give the Minister, and through him give the Government, on this occasion is that speedy action and proper foresight are needed to make sure there is no repetition of what can only be described as the Derrynaflan debacle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Tipperary man I would prefer not to have to say anything on this matter at present.  At the same time I agree completely with most of what has been said by the three previous speakers.  It is a sad state of affairs that nobody seemed to know who owned important things of this kind without having the matter dragged through the courts.  Years ago legislation should have been brought in to finalise matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>My principal reason for speaking is that one might get the impression from Senator Higgins that Michael Webb was a looter.  We are fortunate to have a man of Michael Webb's calibre in Ireland.  I have known him for a number of years. He is a member of the county museum committee and of the national monuments committee in south Tipperary.  He has given us much advice at meetings down through the years.  We were lucky that it was a man like Michael Webb who discovered the chalice because he took great care to ensure that it would not be damaged in any way whatsoever.  If someone else had stumbled on it accidently they could have damaged it in such a way that it could never be repaired or perhaps we might never have heard about it.  Michael Webb realised that it was a very valuable chalice.  He went to the National Museum, told them of the discovery and brought it to them.  That was the first time we heard about it in south Tipperary.  He did not run off to anybody else with the chalice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that he was drinking champagne last night to celebrate.  It would be hard to blame him for that.  I am sorry Senator Higgins is not here because I read recently that the <Col N="905" /> Bishop of Galway in the past used always have a glass of champagne after his lunch. I do not think Michael Webb ever thought the value of the chalice would be placed at £5 million.  I am quite sure that if in the very early stages a genuine offer has been made to him by the National Museum he would have settled for it.  I know he is a man who wants to see this chalice remain in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of metal detectors. There is something in the National Mounments Bill about fines for people caught with metal detectors.  It is like closing the door when the horse has gone because that practice seems to have eased up, at least in Tipperary.  About two years ago or so you would see people with metal detectors out every day at castles, old ruins and cemeteries, going over them with a fine comb, so to speak.  I doubt that there is much left in the ground to be found.  What I would be afraid of is that other valuables may have been discovered and not reported to anyone.  We should be grateful to Michael Webb for what he did.  He would have been only too pleased in the early days of the find &mdash; maybe not now &mdash; to accept a just award for that valuable find.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this issue of such major national and vital importance to the whole area of our heritage and culture should have come up so promptly for discussion in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is appropriate also that the House that has taken it first, by way of this debate as requested by Senator Higgins, is the Seanad with its vocational structure, its distinguished history and the concern it has shown for the whole area of heritage, culture and the arts in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated by all Senators the case is now going to the Supreme Court. I want to assure the House that the State will take all steps open to it to avoid delay in the processing of appeals to the Supreme Court in this very important issue on the Derrynaflan hoard.  In view of the fact that an appeal is being taken <Col N="906" /> to the Supreme Court, it would be inappropriate to discuss the specific implications of the High Court decision.  I have taken advice on that matter and the weight of the advice is not to go too deeply into specifics.  However, within those constraints I hope I will be of assistance to the Senators who are so concerned with this issue.</P>
    <P>The second important point I would seek to make is to clarify what precisely the High Court decision was about.  I know that the Senators have already done that but I think there is a general misconception, and probably understandably so, presented if you like by the newspaper in a popular and a readable form.  Arising out of that there is a misconception entirely of what the High Court decision was.</P>
    <P>In order to allay public concern in this matter it is important to note that the decision of the High Court yesterday was concerned with the narrow technical grounds of the Law of Bailement.  The High Court did not decide the question of ownership.  Significant issues have not been addressed because of the grounds on which the case was brought.  That was the reason.  The law relating to the protection of archaeological sites and objects as it now stands is not affected in any way by what happened.  It is, therefore, still unlawful to excavate archaeologically without, or otherwise than in accordance with, the licence issued for the purpose by the Commissioners of Public Works. Let me repeat, the decision of the High Court does not affect the law of property, trespass or the statutes preserving the heritage.  Therefore, I seek very much to join with the Senators in straightening out this important element of the case.  It had nothing to do with ownership.  The judge went out of the way to say that he was not called on to address the question of ownership.  There is a serious misconception abroad that that is what was being decided.  Put at its simplest, the finders deposited the Derrynaflan hoard in the Museum under certain conditions laid down by themselves and they asked for the Derrynaflan hoard back under those conditions.  That is the narrow technical <Col N="907" /> area in which the case was heard and brought.</P>
    <P>The Senators will be aware of the Government's determination to update and reform the law relating to national monuments and archaeological objects. In this respect it is important &mdash; although it generally is not done because of the pressures of immediate legislation &mdash; in the field of legislation to have some type of system by which we begin examining the various flaws we have rather than waiting for some crisis to arise before we get involved in it.  This is possible in the area in which I am involved, the Arts and Culture area, where we may operate at a more leisurely pace than other Departments so far as immediate legislation is concerned.  We have an obligation to do that in our area and I am doing it because I became very conversant with this danger that existed with the finding of very important Spanish Armada wrecks off the coastline in Sligo.</P>
    <P>The National Monument (Amendments) Bill, 1986 extends the powers of protection and preservation under the existing Act and introduces new regulations in relation to the use of metal detectors and the protection of underwater wrecks.  When this legislation becomes law, the use of metal detectors at protected sites or anywhere else where the purpose is to search for archaeological objects, will be subject to licence.  The power to decide the circumstances in which licences are issued and the conditions imposed therein will introduce a regime of controls which will ensure adequate protection of sites under State protection and generally.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is not the Government's intention to subject the use of metal detectors for legitimate purposes such as tracing pipes and cables to control under the National Monuments Act.</P>
    <P>There were some important points brought up by Senator Fitzsimons and he gave us the benefit of his ideas as regards amendments which he will be putting down.  The more appropriate place to discuss those would be on Committee <Col N="908" /> Stage of the National Monuments Bill. In the light of the impending appeal I feel it better not to go into the very specific areas which will be covered by the proposed amendment by Senator Fitzsimons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the appeal has not been lodged the Minister should surely have no inhibition in commenting on the grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Senator was out he missed two important points.  The most important of all was a tribute to himself for having put down the motion and also a tribute to the House of which he is a Member saying that it was an ideal form in which these should be discussed. I also explained that we were losing no time so far as appealing to the Supreme Court was concerned and that I had taken advice on this matter.  Arising out of that advice I decided not to go into too many specifics but within that limitation to try to be as helpful as I could to Senators.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that the increasing rate of improper exploitation of our heritage is posing a great strain on the resources of the the State in the protection, conservation and presentation to the public of important objects of our heritage.  As a community we must reserve the right to protect our heritage in an orderly and appropriate fashion.  In this context, it has been said that if the Derrynaflan hoard had not been discovered in the way it was, it would never have been discovered.  This is something we have heard very many times.  I reject that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were proposals for archaeological excavations at Derrynaflan in the past.  It is a national monument and a very important one.  These did not materialise at the time.  However, an archaeological excavation is today a <i>sine qua non</i> of comprehensive conservation and presentation schemes at national monuments.  We will have seen this in the excellent work that is being done around the country.  Derrynaflan is a national monument and the Commissioners of <Col N="909" /> Public Works have a well established programme of conserving national monuments. It is quite certain, therefore, that in due course a proper excavation would have taken and will take place at this site to recover all the historical evidence before structural conservation is undertaken.</P>
    <P>I have become very conversant with the work of the National Museum.  One thing that has impinged on me which is not generally known or acceptable by the public is the extraordinary importance of not disturbing the surroundings in which a hoard, find or some artefact is found because of the scholarly material.  The exercise that can be done around it greatly enhances the value of the object if it is properly excavated and properly done by trained archaeologists who know their business and will not disrupt and destroy irreplacable evidence from the past.</P>
    <P>I would also like to address the specific question of the status of objects already acquired by the National Museum.  The overwhelming majority of these have been acquired by agreement.  I am advised that where such agreements exist there is no reason to think they would be overturned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard can the Minister say a little more as to whether that is based on the advice of the Attorney General's office and whether it feels it is sufficient and can be extended to all objects in the National Museum, particularly those not acquired by agreement? I am not obstructing the Minister but I am trying to clarify the position in the interim between now and the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is based on the advice of the National Museum who are in constant contact with the Attorney General's office on these matters.  I had occasion to go into that matter in recent times so it is not something that has suddenly arisen out of this difficulty.  I am very happy in that respect, as far as the other artefacts are concerned.  The outcome of the Supreme Court appeal in the <Col N="910" /> Derrynaflan case will have major implication for the legislative provisions governing our heritage.  The further amendment of legislation, as necessary, will be speedily completed when the Supreme Court judgment becomes available.  A constitutional referendum in the matter may be necessary and will be considered at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to again express my appreciation of the fact that this matter was brought so promptly to the Floor of the House.  I would like to assure Senators that all necessary steps will be taken and with all urgency, to defend our heritage.  In the light of the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal and in the light of the developments from this case already, the law will be strengthened in all ways that are needed and if necessary, proposals will be brought forward to make appropriate changes in the Constitution. I can assure the Senators in the strongest possible terms that they need have no fear about our will and our determination in this respect.  In doing so, I am sure I would have the unanimous support of this House and of the Dáil.  I am also sure, in the light of the reaction that I got today, that we would have the overwhelming support of the people at large in any kind of referendum or in any way necessary to bring about those changes that will safeguard our heritage. We are the beneficiaries from the past. We have a major obligation to hand on all those incredible treasures that we are lucky enough to have intact.  We also have an obligation to present them to the public in the most attractive possible fashion, as has been done as far as our archaeological artefacts and treasures are concerned in the new treasury in the National Museum.  We will continue with that work.  That is a matter of presentation and display.  We will also continue with the other important work that has now come up, that is in ensuring that we will defend and care for our heritage. If necessary, we will change the laws.  I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to say that in the House.  I am very <Col N="911" /> thankful to the Senators for the excellent contributions that have been made.</P>
