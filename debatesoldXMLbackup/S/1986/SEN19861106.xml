      <P>I indicated last night that we would be taking items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the Order Paper. Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance is engaged in Dáil Éireann on some Supplementary Estimates and, accordingly, No. 1 will not be taken.</P>
      <P>No. 2 which is the Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, is an order of the same Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, as is item No. 4. Therefore, it makes sense that we should order our business so that those two items are taken in succession. Accordingly, my suggestion is that we take the business on the Order Paper in the following order: commence with No. 3, which is the Second Stage of the National Monuments Bill, and then proceed to No. 2, the consumer information Order, and then resume the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to suspend the sitting of the House from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., or at some convenient time depending on the speakers. For example, if a speaker finishes at 12.45 p.m. we should then adjourn until 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will we have an opportunity during our proceedings <Col N="1356" /> today to discuss any statement that might emerge as a result of the alleged use of false Irish passports to secure entry into another country with whom Ireland does not have aggravated relations? I am referring specifically to the newspaper coverage of the alleged use of false Irish passports by people who are citizens of another country to enter a third country. Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach might advise me.</P>

      <P>Coming from a county like Kerry, which is rich in historical monuments and archaeological remains, I welcome this Bill. It is long overdue. It is also welcomed by people interested in the preservation and the continuation of our heritage. If the Bill succeeds in its principal objective, that is, in the control of metal detectors and in the provision of better protection for historical wrecks in <Col N="1357" /> our territorial waters and in setting up a register of national monuments, it will ensure that future generations can enjoy and appreciate our rich heritage and that the unnecessary destruction and vandalism of many of our national monuments and sites will cease.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to previous legislation. The National Monuments Acts, 1930 and 1954 were never fully enforced. The powers given by those Acts were weak. As a result the number of protected monuments in Ireland is minimal. Denmark, for example, a country which is much smaller than Ireland, has approximately 25,000 pre-historic monuments conserved and preserved. The 1930 and 1954 Acts envisaged respect for private property, allowing the owner to act freely with structures on his property except, on the rare occasions when he would be restrained by the commissioners. As a result, we have lost many valuable monuments. This Bill goes some way towards reversing this position.</P>
      <P>Under the new legislation a monument or archaeological area listed on the proposed new register of historical monuments may be recorded by the Land Registry at the Registry of Deeds as a burden on the property. This is the situation in Sweden, a country with a long history of preservation of monuments. The Minister referred to that in her Second Stage speech. In Sweden national monuments are properly regarded as having national rights which exceed those of private ownership. Permission must be applied for and granted from an authorised body before they can be interfered with. Such rights have to be recognised by would-be developers, as well as by property owners. With the establishment of a register of historical monuments and archaeological sites throughout Ireland property owners and farmers will be more aware of the existence of monuments and archaeological areas on their properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new legislation an owner will have to give two month's notice to the Commissioners of Public Works before he can interfere with a monument. This will give time for a decision to be <Col N="1358" /> reached as to whether the heritage interest in the site should be recorded by archaeological excavation. If not already recorded the site is given legal protection or allowed to be utilised as desired by the owner.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister indicated that the work of identification has been proceeding at a more rapid pace recently. By the end of the decade it is hoped that a comprehensive archaeological site and monument record should be available for the whole country. The availability of such a record to planners, farm development officers and to the public generally should be most useful in bringing about a greater awareness of the monuments and archaeological sites in localities.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the damage caused by farm schemes around the country especially since we joined the EC. Farmers are encouraged to carry out major improvements on their lands, such as the removal of fences, hedges and large boulders. We have lost out considerably because of farm modernisation policies. I have first-hand information that numerous ring forts have been bulldozed away in the name of modernisation. It is difficult to blame the farmers, most of whom were probably not aware of the significance of the archaeological sites on their lands. They were often encouraged by advisers to bulldoze their lands.</P>
    <P>It seems ironical that, on the one hand, we have State agencies trying to preserve sites and, on the other hand, we have State agencies promoting the destruction of sites. It has been mentioned previously by many commentators that we have lost out considerably in rural areas because of farming activities, especially over the last ten years. I hope this Bill will ensure that this destruction will not continue. It is important that a register should be drawn up as soon as possible. It has been looked for, for many years. A commitment has been given that it will be ready by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to a number of surveys being carried out at the moment in County Kerry. AnCo must be complimented on their efforts although <Col N="1359" /> their work may be overlapping with work the Office of Public Works should be carrying out. Nevertheless, they are carrying out very important surveys on archaeological sites and in regard to the identification of monuments. One such study has been completed recently in the Corca Dhuibhne peninsula. It has proven very interesting. At the moment there are three surveys taking place: one is in the Castleisland area; one in south Kerry; and one in north Kerry. No doubt much information will be got from these surveys. When the Office of Public Works are making a record of monuments in County Kerry, I am sure they will use this information. Nevertheless, they should avoid, of course, unnecessary expense.</P>
    <P>There is a place for AnCO in the preservation of historical monuments. AnCO could make use of their apprentices in renovating old buildings. It should be pointed out that such renovation should be under the supervision of Office of Public Works archaeologists. Because of the deterioration of so many monuments and because of the lack of a work force to carry out necessary repairs, we must act sooner rather than later as regards preservation and renovation. AnCO and the local communities, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, have a role to play.</P>
    <P>The most urgent matter now is preservation rather than identification. We may reach the end of the decade without identifying all our historical monuments. They may have weathered away or indeed been destroyed. In County Kerry much damage has been caused by the weather, and freeze-thaw action especially, on the unprotected walls of castles and abbeys. There is an urgent need to waterproof old walls. Certainly the Office of Public Works will never be able to do all this work, which could be done by AnCO. It is common to see ivy growing on buildings. Ivy can be a great destroyer. It is often considered a preservative but, in actual fact, it can cause a lot of structural damage. Even cleaning ivy off the monuments would be important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> I should like to refer to the length of time it takes the Office of Public Works' employees to renovate buildings. I know work on buildings is very slow and must be carried out meticulously. Nevertheless, Ross Castle in County Kerry is being renovated for the past five years. Donegal Castle is undergoing similar renovations. When tourists come to Killarney they expect to visit Ross Castle. It is advertised in brochures. The tourists find that these sites are not accessible to them. Last summer the Skellig Rock was closed to tourists. It is easy to understand the frustration which some tourists experience. I know the sites are closed for the right reasons. Nevertheless, work should proceed more speedily on these monuments.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that our monuments are attracting more and more tourists every year. A figure of three-quarters of a million tourists visited our national monuments last year. Over 500,000 visited Glendalough. Three hundred thousand tourists visited the National Park in Killarney. There is a case to be made for the promotion of our national monuments and their preservation from a tourist aspect alone. The case I was making for AnCO would help to get over this problem of renovation and to speed up the work rate, which is unacceptably slow at present.</P>
    <P>One of the most controversial aspects of this Bill has been the proposed control on metal detectors. The Minister has pointed out that individuals who enjoy this interesting hobby and who have the right intentions will not be threatened by this legislation. However, the fact that archaeological sites or historical remains attract people using metal detectors means that this legislation would be inhibitory in the sense that any person who is caught on a site with a metal detector can be prosecuted. There may be an outcry from some groups against this. However, there are other activities that people who use metal detectors can profitably engage in. There are vast areas of country that will never be considered archaeological sites on which they can certainly experiment. There is another <Col N="1361" /> aspect which should also be encouraged among people who use metal detectors. Except for the use of metal detectors some of our archaeological remains would never have been discovered. The case has been made that when an object has been removed it is very difficult to trace where that object has come from. There may be other remains that may never be discovered because an object was removed from a site. In the past some individuals have behaved very responsibly with metal detectors and should be complimented on some of the finds which otherwise would never have been made.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer briefly to the legislation governing our underwater heritage. Coming from a county such as Kerry, with numerous offshore wrecks, this has a major significance. It is only right that our underwater heritage should be protected. Nevertheless, diving groups should not be discouraged from diving to discover historical wrecks. It is only proper that legislation should exist in order to ensure that when wrecks are discovered they are not then destroyed.</P>
    <P>There is a growing interest, especially off the Kerry coastline, in the numbers of wrecks that have been discovered. There is certainly a tourist aspect to this. Groups should be encouraged to come here to dive but it should be made clear to them that they cannot interfere with the wrecks or with objects they find until they are checked out by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that there is a new Historical Monuments Council. Somebody asked me recently why it was not called the National Historical Monuments Council. The original title was the National Monuments Advisory Council. I am even more interested in the fact that local authorities will now be given the right to go ahead and set up local historical monuments advisory committees. This is very important. I can see great scope for such committees. For example, we could overcome many of the problems that have been experienced in the past, such as the problems regarding the farming community, by including members of farming organisations on such a committee. <Col N="1362" /> People from farm advisory services should also be on the committee as should also members from local historical societies, and from the teaching profession. Teachers have a major role to play in the future preservation of our monuments and in developing an awareness within their classes of the importance of the preservation of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of local history within the schools should be developed. In the new history syllabus it should be recommended that a large section of the new history course should deal with local history. As a former history teacher myself, I always felt that the students enjoyed dealing with local subjects rather than with some remote wars that took place 300 years ago. The way history was taught in the past left a lot to be desired as regards the basic appreciation of our heritage and of our local environment. The local advisory committee could be very important in the development of the local awareness that I am speaking about here today. I hope the councils will go ahead and establish committees. Local councils will have a major role to play also in ensuring that this legislation is enacted. They, too, in their work should ensure that the excavations they carry out will be well checked out beforehand to ensure that they are not damaging any archaeological sites. In the past local authorities have been guilty of damage to archaeological sites and to national monuments just because it was convenient and expedient at the time. They will have to be more responsible as regards their attitudes to our heritage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Bill. From various articles I have read about it and from what I have heard from commentators, like Ó Riordáin, I understand that this type of Bill has been sought for years by people interested in this area. I am glad it has at last come before the House. I hope it will have the desired impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill. As Senator Deenihan said, it is one that has been eagerly awaited by the professional people who have been working so tirelessly <Col N="1363" /> in this area for a long number of years. While reading through the Bill, I find that the only Minister mentioned in it is the Minister for Communications. I cannot see exactly where he fits in. I presume, even though it is not in the definition section which is unusual, that the Minister is the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It has been rather distressing over the last number of months to read on a number of occasions in the national press about artifacts or pieces of ancient sculpture disappearing. That is something which I hope will be taken extremely seriously. Every effort should be made to ensure that people are discouraged from doing that. The penalty section in this Bill is not severe enough. Thoughtless persons for the aggrandisement of their own back garden take a &ldquo;shine&rdquo; to a piece of ancient sculpture which would constitute part of a national monument. The level of the fines &mdash; a maximum of £1,000 or six months in prison &mdash; is absolutely inadequate to stamp out this kind of selfishness especially if it should spread. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the penalty section. The work of the Commissioners of Public Works is very wide-ranging and while many people might accuse them from time to time of being rather slow there is no doubt but that their work is of an extremely high standard. It is extremely thorough. We are entitled to give the Bord of Works and the people who are employed by them, greater appreciation for the standards they maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have examples of that in the midlands, for example in Holycross we have had a marvellous reconstruction programme. In Duiske, Graiguenamanagh the restoration of the church by the local parish has been a great success. For a long number of years, since the former Deputy Gibbons was Parliamentary Secretary in the Office of Public Works which was a long time ago, and again when Deputy Begley held that post, I have been campaigning to have Dunamaise Castle taken over and maintained by the Department and by the Office <Col N="1364" /> of Public Works. It is difficult to know exactly how much progress has been made on this matter. It is not only that it is a historic monument but it is one that appears on the oldest maps, dealing with Hibernia with a history going back 4,000 years. It is not a monument the restoration of which can be looked upon as being offensive in any way to any sector of the community because its history ended well before the Reformation. It is relatively small. The history of the O'Moores represents a very fine chapter in Irish history. At one stage I was told that it was the property of a Lord Congelton whose ancestors in the last century or the century before lived in that area. I know that apart from this Bill, the commissioners had power to acquire by compulsory acquisition properties of national interest and since this is set in one of the most beautiful and scenic parts of the midlands I am not altogether pleased at the slow rate of progress that the Office of Public Works have made on this application. I would ask the Minister who has certainly made a name for herself in her short period in office &mdash; she has not only worked assiduously but has decorated the Office of Public Works &mdash; to apply her great energies to bringing to a successful conclusion the acquisition of Dunamaise Castle for public ownership without any further delay.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill dealing with the restriction on the use of the detection devices, is extremely important and I know that for many years the museums and the Office of Public Works organised digs on various sites throughout the summer months. I would like to see, perhaps, for next year the Office of Public Works organising a preliminary sweep of all the national monuments with their own metal detectors using possibly the university archaeological students during the summer holidays. At least this would be an effort to ensure that artifacts that may be very close to the surface would be recovered by the State. It would not be an impossible task systematically to cover all of the national monuments in the control of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>To take the example of Dunamaise <Col N="1365" /> Castle I think since that place was burnt down and the O'Moores were just dispersed there surely must be, especially in the pit of the place under the building itself, many artifacts which have lain undisturbed for the last four and a half centuries.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome the provisions in section 4 for the establishment of the Historic Monuments Council. That is an excellent addition to the present services. I note with interest the representation the Minister has proposed for this council which I would look upon as having a most important role to play in conserving the monuments throughout this country.</P>
    <P>It is most appropriate that all of the university colleges should be represented and also Bord Fáilte, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, the Royal Institute of Architects and the Maritime Institute of Ireland but I feel that perhaps there should be strong representation on that from the museums. I should like to see the General Council of County Councils represented because it is important that such a body should have an <i>entre</i> and a liaison with the local authorities across this country. From the point of view of respecting the rights of private ownership I should like to see the landowners with some input and some representation and perhaps the Minister might very well consider nominating a member from the IFA or one of the larger farming bodies to that council.</P>
    <P>It is important that at a time when there is a diminishing respect for the rights of private property, especially in the student season when some people under the guise of sportsmen do not seem to mind where they let off a shot even if is in your back garden, that the people who own the land, especially monuments not taken into care, should have representation. I ask the Minister to consider that, bearing in mind that she has up her sleeve, four or five other posts for persons she considers ideal from the point of view of making contributions to the work of the council. Of late, through AnCO schemes especially, local communities with the co-operation <Col N="1366" /> of the Office of Public Works have made a valuable contribution. If I were to cite Aghaboe Abbey which is the ancient seat of St. Canice and St. Kieran in the diocese of Ossory which is in South Laois, I think that with the co-operation of AnCO and the Office of Public Works the hard-working local committee have achieved remarkable success in conserving the ancient and historic ruins there between Ballacalla and Borris-in-Ossory. I do not know what the overall cost of that work was, but whatever it was it was indeed very worthwhile. The fact that so many young people had the opportunity of having a course in stone masonry there must be of immense value to that particular locality in County Laois. From that point of view I would hope that the board would expand that service as far as possible throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are a number of national monuments of various sizes in the care of the Office of Public Works. I will name a few of them in my own county, St. Fiaces Church which is outside Carlow and that remarkable Romanesque doorway near Killeshin Church. The maintenance could be better in all of these. From a conservation point of view we may not like to be using too much Roundup or sprays of that kind. Even though I do not expect that someone should be paid a full salary to act as maintenance man or caretaker of these monuments I think it must be within the powers and the limits of the financial constraints of the Office of Public Works to spray the gravel areas at least once a year so that people can gain access to these very remarkable and beautiful monuments which are reminders of our past culture and history without having to walk through nettles and briars. Some of these are maintained exceptionally well and, I suppose that applies to Killeshin to a lesser extent but it should be possible to keep them all in good order especially when they are signposted, it is embarrassing if they are not maintained to some acceptable standard. I hope the Minister will look at these. If you fly a flag on a monument I think it should be readily accessible and <Col N="1367" /> we should not expect our tourists to carry a pair of wellingtons with them or a slashhook. I think that is important. There is an excellent regional office and staff in Portlaoise. I do not know if they have anything to do with those monuments or whether they confine themselves to schools and extensions and the development of public buildings. We should endeavour to keep the flag flying. In the area of national monuments everyone is impressed by the craftsmanship of those people from far-off generations who have gone before us.</P>
    <P>This is an area where the availability of finance should not be an inhibiting factor. After all, I suppose it is the most popular part of the Department of Finance although I held the view for years that Finance should be broken up, that there should be a very definite budget section and spending section so that the same people would not be doing the three card trick with two sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it is becoming a national monument itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not like to see that happen. I ask the Minister, now that she is a powerful personage in that office and can wield more power than she herself may realise, to create that impetus in the board and to ensure that adequate finance is allocated to this section of the work. It is very important that with the damage occurring to the environment and the absolute lack of interest shown by a percentage of our population for anything of the past, for history or for tradition, that the Department be entitled to allocate more resources so that these monuments can be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see greater co-operation between the national monuments section in the Office of Public Works and the Department of Lands. If we consider some of the more remote valleys in the Slieve Bloom mountains which have beautiful and refreshing vistas they do not have very many national walks like the walking trails in Wicklow such as the Wicklow Way, or the Kerry Way for the <Col N="1368" /> Kerry mountains and lakes. There is one in embryo in the Slieve Blooms. I think the committee there which is based on the VEC would appreciate an input from people with experience in the Office of Public Works to try to open up that area for leisure purposes. With that, we must also have an educational input so that old artefacts and stones and landmarks that are there will not be disturbed when people are aware of their importance and their significance. It is important not to disturb the environment especially when it has come down almost 2000 years.</P>
    <P>I do not know who should be responsible but since the Minister is responsible for most things in this area I think she should make an effort to go the whole way because in all these areas we have too many splinter groups. It is true that Bord Fáilte would have an input but they say that they have no money and will do nothing. They do not have the staff.</P>
    <P>This year I was very glad to see the Office of Public Works taking over responsibility for the canals from CIE. I do not say the canal system is a national monument but the infrastructures reflect the craftmanship of stonemasons and other craftsmen and I think are important. The canals are a facility and amenity that would cost millions of pounds to reproduce at the present time. I want to compliment the Government and all concerned with the easy transfer of control to the Office of Public Works. As a politician with almost 30 years experience I can rest assured that the system is in good hands and will be maintained. It cannot be maintained unless the moneys are assigned to it and that is why I would hope that the present Minister, with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, will ensure that adequate resources will be made available and that proper funding will be provided so that she can relax in the knowledge that the works she has responsibility for will be undertaken with the maximum speed. I know it can display great efficiency but it is important that the finance should be allocated to it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to mention Daingean in County Offaly. It was the old <Col N="1369" /> reformatory run by a religious order which served many generations. When it closed down they had a capitation grant of 7/6d a week. I do not think it went very far towards reforming anyone. I mention that because miracles were expected from these places but there was little funding put into the system. We have a lot of artefacts and various things in store there. I should like the Minister to consider allocating some area of that for a small agricultural-type museum. I know that An Foras Talúntais land at Johnstown Castle has a very nice agricultural museum. I think it is the only one in the country. I have not seen one anywhere else. The only other place I have seen a rural museum is in Fermanagh. It is the Mellon Institute, off the main road, either between here and Enniskillen or here and Belfast. It is a very impressive place. It is well worth a visit. Since there is so much in Daingean perhaps the Minister might consider making even a small area available there for some of the stuff. There is huge accommodation there and it would make the place more interesting. We should also have a second rural museum. Daingean is fairly central, in the midlands near Tullamore. It would be an ideal location and provide a public usage for the facilities we have there.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill. I hope it will be financed to ensure that its objectives will be met and that we will be able to move on them speedily. I wish the Minister and the board every success with the provisions contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>A Leas Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo agus focal gairid a rá faoi. Is dóigh liom gur Bille an-tábhachtach é agus gur Bille é go mba cheart a leithéid a bheith tugtha isteach sa tír seo fadó, mar go mbaineann sé le stair, le litríocht, le dinnseanachas agus béaloideas na tíre seo ar fad agus dá bhrí sin measaim go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go bhfuil an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach agus go gcuirfidh an Bille seo an tábhacht sin os comhair an phobail agus go mór mhór os <Col N="1370" /> comhair daoine óga. Mar adúirt mé tá forálacha an Bhille seo fite fuaite le stair ár dtíre, seanstair ár stíre, stair ár muintire, stair a bhfuil eolas uirthi á chailliúint insan aimsir dheireannach seo, tá faitíos orm. Níl paróiste in Éirinn nach bhfuil seanfhothracha, nó sean teampaill nó reiligí nó rudaí eile mar iad atá fíorstairiúil ar fad agus níl mórán eolais orthu faoi láthair ag daoine go ginearálta. Fiú amháin san bparóiste inár tógadh mé féin, sa mbaile &mdash; tharla go raibh mé thíos ansin cúpla seachtain ó shin &mdash; agus bhí seanmóir ag an sagart insan seipeal an Domhnach sin ag tagairt do na háiteacha beannaithe a bhí san bparóiste.

Luaigh sé iad agus luaigh sé na blianta a cuireadh ar fáil iad agus an stair an-tábhachtach ar fad a bhí ag baint leo. Tá inscribhinní, cuir i gcás ar chuid de na teampaill sin a chruthaíonn gur bunaíodh iad san seachtú aois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fothrach i dteampall nó i reilig an pharóiste a théann siar go dtí an seachtú aois agus níl aon amhras ná go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint le leithéidí sin de fhothrach agus go mba cheart go ndéanfaí caomhnú air agus go gcoinneófaí é sa riocht inar cheart dó a bheith. Faraor ní mar sin atá, mar tá an seanteampall sin imithe i léig agus ní bheadh a fhios agat le breathnú air anois ná ag féachaint air go bhfuil aon tábhacht ag baint leis. Ach cuireann sé i gcuimhne dom an dán breá sin atá againn mar oidhreacht i litríocht na Gaeilge a chum Seán O Coileáin, &ldquo;Tigh Molaga&rdquo;. Is cuimhin le cuid mhaith daoine é, is dócha. Bhí sé ar chlár shiollabas na litríochta na scoileanna agus tugann an file cuntas ar an teampall. Tagann sé i dtreo an fhothraigh nó an teampall seo le tuitim na hoíche agus labhraíonn sé leis an teampall mar seo: &ldquo;Eidhean ag eascar ós do stua,/neartóg rua id urlár úr,/tafann caol na sionnach searg/is crónán na n-eas id chlúid./Mar a nglaodh ar fhuiseog mhoch/do chléir ag canadh a dtráth/ní bhfuil teanga ag corraí <Col N="1371" /> anois/ach teangtha gliogair na gcág.&rdquo; Anois, sin sampla den rud atá i gceist agam. Sean teampall a bhí imithe i léig, a raibh, mar a dúirt an file, eighneán ag eascair as a stua agus é ag tuitim as a chéile. Tá go leor leor eile teampaill agus fothracha mar é atá ligthe i léig agus ba cheart caomhnú a dhéanamh orthu agus iad a thabhairt insan riocht, mar a dúirt mé, ar ceart dóibh a bheith.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom sin a chur i gcomhéacs an Bhille seo mar go bhfuil tábhacht anmhór ag baint leis an mBille seo leis na rudaí sin a chaomhnú &mdash; dinnseanachas, an béaloideas agus an stair atá le fáil tríd na fothracha ar fuaid na hÉireann. Tá tábhacht eile ag baint leis na fothracha sin go dtagann go leor leor daoine anseo ó thíortha iasachta gur mian leo na háiteacha seo a fheiceáil agus rud éigin a fhoghlaim futhu. Daoine iad a chuireann spéis, cuirim i gcás, i stair, agus níl aon amhras ná go bhfuil tábhacht mhór iontu do chúrsaí turasóireachta agus do thionnscal na turasóireachta mar nuair a thagann daoine go dtí an tír seo bíonn fonn orthu dul go dtí Cluain Mhic Nóis agus áiteacha eile mar é atá ar fud na tíre. Níl amhras dá laghad ach go bhfuil tábhacht an-mhór le forálacha an Bhille seo le haghaidh na daoine go mor mhór iad siúd a thagann chugainn thar lear a dhíriú ar na háiteacha seo ionas go bhféadfar iad a chur ar an eolas go bhfuil siad ann agus an tábhacht atá ag baint leo. Ba mhaith liom tagairt ar leith a dhéanamh do alt a 4 den Bhille seo agus deireann alt a 4 go gcuirfear comhairle ar fáil leis an mBille seo a chur i bhfeidhm agus le aird ar leith a thabhairt ar an mBille seo insan am atá le teacht, is é sin nuair a bheidh sé in a Acht. Ba cheart go mbunófaí comhairle dá shórt agus go bhféachfaí chuige go mbeidh Gaeilgeóirí ar an gcomhairle sin, go bhféachfaí chuige go príomhga agus go cinnte go mbeidh roinnt Ghaeilgeóirí air. Is dócha gur mar sin atá agus gur mar sin a bheidh, go bhfuil sé sin in aigne an Aire agus in aigne na Roinne a bhfuil an Bille seo faoin a gcúram go mbeidh Gaeilgeóirí ar an gcomhairle a mbeidh ar a gcumas dul thart ag na fothracha agus ag na háiteacha sin <Col N="1372" /> go bhfuil an stair sin le fáil iontu le tátal a bhaint as na hinscríbhinní atá ar na fothracha sin, mar tá inscríbhinní i nGaeilge ar gach ceann acu agus tá siad ag dul i bhfad siar. Go hiondúil is sa seanGhaeilge atá na hinscríbhinní sin agus muna bhfuil eolas an-mhaith ag na daoine a bheidh ag déanamh scrúdú ar na hinscríbhinní sin ní bheidh siad in ann tátal a bhaint astu nó an t-eolas a bhaint astu atá le fáil iontu. Measaim mar sin go mba chóir go mbeadh agus go bhféachfaí chuige go mbeidh Gaeilgeóirí agus líon maith Gaeilgeóirí ar an gcomhairle sin. Tá mé cinnte gurab é sin atá ar intinn an Aire agus go ndéanfar é nuair a bheas an chomhairle sin á ceapadh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin focal gairid a rá faoi alt a 9. In alt a 9 déantar tagairt go mbeidh cead ag an gcomhairle nó pé dream a bheas ag féachaint i ndiaidh an Bhille seo agus á chur i bhfeidhm seilbh a ghlacadh ar na fothracha seo atá le fáil agus na hiarsmaí seo atá le fáil ar fud na tíre má mheastar dóibh go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leo. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin an-riachtannach go mbeadh an cead sin acu in áit ar bith go gceaptar dóibh gur ceart é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá mé an-tsásta go bhfuil an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach agus go mbeidh sé ina reacht sul i bhfad agus go gcuirfidh sé na háiteacha seo go bhfuil tagairt déanta agam dóibh ar lámh shábhála agus go ndéanfaidh sé cóiriú orthu mar is cóir dóibh agus go bhfágfaidh sé iad sa gcaoi nach mbeidh eidhean ag eascair ós a stuanna san am atá le fáil. Tá súil agam go mbeidh caoí agus slacht orthu agus go gcaomhnófar iad chun go mbeidh eolas orthu agus eolas le fáil orthu ag, go mór mhór, na glúinte atá le teacht in ár ndiaidh. Tá siad lán de eolas, lán de litríocht, lán de dhinnseanchas agus de stair ár dtíre agus measaim gur ceart an t-omós agus an tabhacht is dual a thabhairt dóibh agus fáiltím go croíúil roimh an Bille seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Is maith liom bheith ag éisteacht leis an nGaeilge binn líofa atá ag an Seanadóir de Brún. I will confine my remarks on this Bill to the second official language in which I hope I have some degree of fluency. I am very pleased <Col N="1373" /> to support this Bill, the National Monuments Bill, 1986, and glad, too, that the moving spirit and guiding light behind it all, the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, is in the House this morning to attend the debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to make further provision for the protection and preservation of national monuments and archaeological objects including provision for the regulation of the use and possession of detection devices and to make provision for the preservation and protection of historic wrecks, to amend and extend the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954, and to provide for connected matters. It is to be welcomed on many accounts. It is true to say that our archaeological and our architectural heritage is vitally important to us as a people and we owe it, not alone to ourselves, but to the generations who will come after us to ensure that it receives the maximum possible protection.</P>
      <P>The principal Act governing this area was passed 50 years ago and there was amending legislation 30 years ago. It is true to say that since then there have been major technological, scientific and mechanical discoveries and advances which have imperilled the priceless artefacts, treasures and antiquities which we are charged with preserving for the future. These advances to which I have referred are given recognition in the Bill and the very good and sound legislation which has served us well in the past is receiving the necessary updating which is what this Bill actually does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>History has taken its toll of our national monuments. When travelling through cities and towns and, indeed, the countryside of Ireland there are visible reminders of the depredations of conflict, war and violence which were so much part of our history. Ivy clad and nettle choked roofless ruins abound and they are a stark reminder to us of the harsher times that preceded us. This is in marked contrast to what obtains in other countries, notably our European neighbours. While visiting these countries it is a joy to worship, for example, in medieval cathedrals <Col N="1374" /> or to attend concerts in Roman amphi-theatres.</P>
    <P>In fact, last month I was extremely fortunate to have been at a concert in a Roman amphitheatre in Aspendos in Southern Turkey. I went there to have the experience of seeing how the accoustics were in 1986. I did not have quite the opportunity I anticipated because those arranging the concert, in their enthusiasm, felt that amplification was necessary. So there was the cacophony of the modern day amplification and the accoustics of the Roman era, It really did make for an overload of sound and a very high level of decibels. That is an example of how things can go a little bit wrong in even the best of settings. Again, I harp back to the fact that we do not have quite that facility here in the way they do elsewhere, though recent restorations of places like, for example, the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham are an example to us of what we can do with our antiquities.</P>
    <P>Many people will look at this House of the Oireachtas today and ask since there are so many problems in the country why on earth are our legislators spending time debating matters which do not seem to have special relevance to their every day lives. It is important to clarify why it is important to us to preserve and protect our national monuments. We have got to remember that our monuments, antiquities and artefacts help to define us as a people. They are about our national identity. They have been left to us by successive communities who have toiled on this land and they are a tangible reminder of the history of more than 5,000 years of life on this island.</P>
    <P>This heritage is constantly under threat of destruction with the growth of the advances which I have already spoken about. Mechanised farming, though it has much that is good in it, and metal detectors, which are the devices referred to in the Bill, have increased the risks to our treasures enormously. Obviously these developments in themselves are good but it is very necessary to have a legislative framework and a structure within which all these objects can operate <Col N="1375" /> in order to protect our heritage for posterity.</P>
    <P>There have been attempts in the past to introduce amending legislation by the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy John Donnellan. Both attempts were frustrated on the basis that more comprehensive legislation was pending and there were constitutional battles concerning the ownership of private property, some of which have been actually resolved but there are others which remain unresolved. The only criticism I have of this Bill is that I am disappointed that it was not possible to make it the comprehensive legislation so many people were hoping for and anticipating and that it had to confine itself necessarily to important measures but perhaps not the fullest scope of what is desirable.</P>
    <P>I am aware that all of those who work professionally in the area of museums, antiquities history and all the people in the various bodies throughout the country who cherish our heritage are keenly interested in this Bill and are in support of the measures which the Minister is introducing and are very pleased at her drive, enthusiasm and vigour in this area. She has been in office but for a short time and without being sycophantic in any way I would like to put it on the record that she has involved herself in her many briefs and has delivered to the best of her ability, given the resources available, in so many areas. By her very enthusiasm, particularly in this area, she has alerted many people to the value of the work in hand.</P>
    <P>The task of protecting our heritage is an enormous responsibility. Excuses that we lack resources will be regarded with a very jaundiced eye by those who come after us. I know we are in a tight budgetary situation and that we have economic chaos. Nevertheless I must compliment the Minister for going so far within those limitations.</P>
    <P>The section that has been a little bit vexatious and that has provoked criticism is section 2 covering the use of metal detectors. It is my view that the use of these devices must be rigorously controlled. <Col N="1376" /> I mean their use in areas where there are priceless treasures and artefacts, the idea of people having rein to use these anywhere they wish is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point &mdash; I am disappointed that it was not included in the Bill &mdash; that I have noted blatant and flagrant advertising of these devices for treasure hunting. It might be found possible to curb that type of sales approach in the context of the Bill because it appeals to something romantic in the young, it harks back to a treasure island, treasure trove and the idea of uncovering or discovering something of immense value and becoming rich, famous and notorious overnight. I feel that kind of appeal, when we have this sort of legislation, should be curbed.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill governing the use of metal detectors will be judged as being fair by most people. Enormous damage has been done to archaeological sites by these treasure hunters. I do not think it was ever really done deliberately. They did not understand that by excavating in an amateurish fashion they were in fact disturbing layers of subsoil, interfering with a delicate sensitive remnant of the past which could tell us more about ourselves and destroying that sort of self-knowledge and that awareness which is important to us. The net effect of that kind of depredation is to wipe out some of our history and that cannot be allowed.</P>
    <P>The use of metal detectors is not controlled at present and I think it is necessary under existing legislation to actually catch a person in <i>flagrante delicto.</i> That is what you have to do in order to be able to bring a successful prosecution. This Bill makes it an offence to bring a metal detector onto the site of a monument or into an archaeological area without the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works. There are also restrictions on the use of metal detectors elsewhere. This Bill will provide the necessary protections for our monuments against the activities of those who would plunder them.</P>
    <P>Some people may think that this measure is unduly restrictive. I would like to put it on record also that many people <Col N="1377" /> who use these devices are well meaning and are innocent of intent. There are others who are otherwise motivated and there are the careless and unthinking. I feel on balance this Bill has got this aspect of the matter right.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals, too, with the protection of wrecks on the bed of the territorial seas or inland waterways and it is to be welcomed. I believe I am right in saying that it is the first such piece of legislation specifically governing wrecks and underwater artefacts. This is an area which is receiving a lot of attention internationally. There has been an official from the Office of Public Works on a committee of experts in the Council of Europe who drafted a convention on underwater archaeology. That kind of input from our officials and people with expert knowledge is to be welcomed. I am sure it was not unconnected with the fact that this provision is part and parcel of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Any wreck which is more than 100 years old will as a consequence of this legislation be protected and the commissioners will be empowered to make historic orders in respect of areas where they are satisfied that important wrecks or archaeological objects lie. The net effect of all of this is to make it an offence to dive in prescribed areas for the purpose of, for example, exploration. The legislation provides a framework within which underwater archaeology can develop in a controlled manner and at a pace commensurate with the growth of expertise in what is a relatively new branch of archaeology. It is not, of course, only to apply to wrecks. It will also cover underway crannógs and places of habitation which since their establishment have become covered by water. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 4 allows for the reconstitution of the former National Monuments Advisory Council under the new title of the Historic Monuments Council. A rose by any other name sprang to mind. This will replace the former National Monuments Advisory Council and it will advise and assist the Commissioners in relation <Col N="1378" /> to any matter affecting historic monuments, archaeological areas and wrecks. It will have a wider representation than the former National Monuments Advisory Council and in the context of what I have said about the wrecks it will include representation from the Maritime Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that North-South relations and our common cultural heritage have been given recognition in the provision of the Bill because there will be an invitation extended to Queens University, Belfast to nominate a representative. It is wise to ensure that the Council will never go out of existence due to the simultaneous lapsing of the term of office of each member. That provides for continuity and clarity and is an excellent provision. The bodies who will be represented on the council will have something to contribute and will have an informed and significant role to play. Looking at the groups listed in the Bill I would argue that there is an overly academic bias attached to the representation, a certain weight in favour of those people with the academic professional approach or expertise to these matters.</P>
    <P>I wonder about Seán and Mary Citizen whom I feel have been excluded. I am referring to people with a genuine love, regard, interest and reverence for our heritage, for example, people in Waterford who are members of, the old Waterford Society or the Literary and Historical Society in Waterford whose passion in their spare time is field trips and lectures, books and a further knowledge of the past.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to see that An Taisce are not specifically mentioned and the museums also. Senator McDonald's point about having representatives of the farming interests included was a good one in view of the mindless destruction in many instances caused by developers, without any feeling of sensitivity for this area who have adopted a purely economic outlook in relation to the land.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, I was not aware of that. I still query the absence of Seán and Mary Citizen. I know that on the lower tier of the historic advisory committee Seán and Mary Citizen have their representation but I wish it was more direct. In setting up any body, council or committee hard choices have to be made. It is our function to make special pleadings and to point out areas where we feel legislation could be strengthened and wider perspectives could be sought. I will not be found wanting in my duty in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would call that a good day's work, killing two birds and so on. The local authorities are on the second tier, through the committee rather than the council. I feel it represents some sort of downgrading for the local authorities. I take Waterford as an example. I sit on Waterford Corporation and notwithstanding their meagre budget they are able, even within the context of such restraints, to provide funding to preserve and care, for example, for Reginald's Tower, a national monument which is in many instances, apart from Waterford Glass, the emblem of Waterford. The recognition that local authorities deserve in the face of their work over the years could have been given by inclusion on the council rather than the committee.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the setting up of a register of historic monuments which is a development of the listing procedure introduced in the 1954 Amendment Act. Landowners under present legislation must give the commissioners two months notice of their intention to interfere in any way with listed monuments. This provision will remain but under the new legislation a monument or archaeological area entered in the register may be recorded by the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds as a burden on the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> Farming families and people who have lived on the land for years are well disposed towards the preservation of monuments. We have seen fields where the machinery and agricultural activity has tiptoed around the rath, the mound or the area which enshrines and is a tomb and depository of the past. Within that is an unspoken reverence, which some may regard as a superstition, but is an instinct that this should not be touched. It has not been the pattern in the past. The farmer and the farming families who have had the land handed down over the generations wish to maintain that regard.</P>
    <P>Ownership patterns of land are changing. People with less sensitivity and people purely interested in efficiency factors and economic growth, all of which are laudable in themselves, have been responsible for tremendous destruction in a free cavalier fashion. It has happened in the past that people who have sought to buy land have not been aware at the time of purchase that there has been a monument of some sort on the land and have found themselves at the end of the day stuck with something they do not know how to cope with. All of that has been dealt with in this Bill. It will be known to anyone contemplating a purchase that there is a registered monument on the land and they can take account of that when they are deciding on their purchase. This will have the net effect of obviating resentment. It will create a climate of goodwill towards what we are attempting to do by way of conservation.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 deal with the powers of the commissioners and involve amendments to sections of the principal Act. I have spoken about section 14, the Historic Monuments Advisory Committee and the local authority input. The remaining sections deal with fees and fines, which come into sections 16 and 19. They are fines for offences specified in the 1930 Act which are increased by up to twenty fold. I do not think anyone should apologise for that kind of increase. We are talking about fines of £50 to £1,000. That is an area that was badly in need of updating. The existing fines are not and were not a <Col N="1381" /> deterrent to the mindless vandalism and the senseless destruction we all know about.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the level of fines and penalties as the measure of our seriousness or earnest of our intent. The six months in prison for grave offences is a further demonstration of our determination to guard what is ours. These sections show a change of heart in official attitudes and a willingness to introduce legislation with real teeth which will give security to these national monuments.</P>
    <P>We have got to remember that in the first instance what we are doing is for our own sake as a people. We have also got to remember that there is tremendous tourist potential and, therefore, economic advantage to us as a nation in preserving our heritage. This is an excellent Bill and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on it. I reiterate my congratulatory remarks to the Minister. I look forward to Committee Stage when we can tease out problems or add perspectives which may strengthen the Bill if they are accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Yes. I am under pressure but I will continue if that suits the House. I listened to the Second Stage debate on the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, with great interest. I am heartened by the fact that the provisions of the Bill are so sincerely welcomed despite the feeling on the part of several Members that they do not go far enough. I also listened with satisfaction to the tributes paid to the Office of Public Works for their care not only of national monuments but of this fine heritage property in which we meet. It is <Col N="1382" /> not so often that bouquets are bestowed in that quarter, and they are greatly appreciated. Could I also add here a personal thank you for the kind remarks directed to me and say that I am humbled at the enormity of my task.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly who opened the debate represents a county, County Roscommon, that has been to the forefront in taking measures to protect its archaeological and architectural heritage. While welcoming the Bill, he asked if it goes far enough when valuable artefacts are being removed from their traditional sites.</P>
      <P>Some of the points he raised will no doubt come up again on Committee Stage. I share Senator Mullooly's concern for the safety of ancient grave-slabs and other works of art which have for centuries lain safe in old graveyards and churches around the country and we are looking urgently at the question of how these should be safeguarded. I am of the view that, as far as possible, these precious artefacts should be retained in the localities in which they have originated but this presents problems in some of the more isolated sites. In the case of Clonmacnoise the grave slabs have been taken down from the walls on which they had been mounted and as many as possible of them will be displayed in the safety of the proposed new visitor centre. As far as the law is concerned, all we can do is to legislate for heavy penalties which will deter would-be thieves and we are doing this in the present Bill.</P>
      <P>The matter of treasure trove will, I hope, be clarified by the Supreme Court in the near future arising from the Derrynaflan case. It would be premature to make any statement about amending legislation until we have this clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 3 which deals with historic wreck sites Senator Mullooly suggested that the 100 years mentioned in the section should be reduced to 50 years. While this is a point which we could deal with on Committee Stage, I refer to it here in case there is a misunderstanding of our intentions. The section can, in fact, apply to any wreck <Col N="1383" /> which is considered to be of historical, archaeological or artistic importance, whatever its age, but there is a blanket coverage of wrecks of more than 100 years old. The figure of 100 years is, I think, reasonable in this regard and is in accordance with the consensus view in the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly expressed the view that the decisions of the Historic Monuments Council, particularly unanimous ones, should be binding on the Commissioners of Public Works. However, it is the Government and the Commissioners who must in the end accept responsibility and we could not have a situation where a body without the responsibility should have authority to make binding decisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge brought before our minds the pioneers of archaeological research and recording in Ireland. While the Office of Public Works still supply the shovels today as they did to Colonel Harry Jones at Dowth in 1845, that office today have a team of archaeologists engaged on the archaeological survey. Another team engaged on archaelogical excavations at national monument sites and on rescue digs such as that currently in progress at Dublin Castle, and a team of architects engaged on conservation and maintenance works at national monuments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the archaeological survey referred to by Senator Mullooly and Senator Dooge, I would like to say that since 1982 much greater resources have been devoted to this task. In our efforts to expedite the work we have not become more superficial. What we have done is to streamline the procedure by breaking it into three distinct phases.</P>
    <P>The first stage is what is called a paper survey. This covers not only an examination of Ordnance Survey maps, but research into all written material on the archaeology of the different counties, examination of estate maps and of independent surveys such as that done for County Roscommon to which Senator Mullooly referred.</P>
    <P>It also involves intensive examination <Col N="1384" /> of aerial photography with the use of the most modern technology. As a result of this research sites and monuments records, which are far more comprehensive than the Ordnance Survey maps, are being produced. These are of great assistance to planners, and to other organisations such as the Farm Development Service to identify monuments which may be affected by developments of many kinds.</P>
    <P>As well as producing this end product, the paper survey is an essential part of the whole archaeological survey process. The next stage is to do field work so that these monuments can be checked and classified by trained archaeologists and any other sites, which may not have come to light at the paper survey stage, located. This fieldwork leads to the publication of inventories, that is, comprehensive lists of monuments classified and briefly described. The third and final stage is the full report which is an academic analysis and discussion on the various monuments.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to assure Senators that there is a plan and that it is being implemented in stages, those stages which are essential for the protection of the monuments coming first and the academic stage being left to the end, by necessity.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge spoke of the reduction in grants for archaeological research occasioned by the Dublin Castle rescue dig. He concedes that rescue archaeology must have precedence over academic archaeology and therefore he cannot be disputing the choice made in this case. However, once that operation is out of the way, it would be the intention to bring the grants back up to their former level.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the lack of information about what is going on in relation to national monuments and Senator Higgins raised a similar question of education in relation to our heritage. I am sure if resources were available there is much valuable work which the OPW could do in this regard but at the same time I would like to place on record <Col N="1385" /> my congratulations on the very interesting material which they have produced in recent years.</P>
    <P>There are now booklets in relation to nearly all the major monuments, while the booklet `Irish Field Monuments' produced last year has been a major contribution to education on this subject. Fifty thousand copies have been printed and most of these have been distributed. Copies have been sent to each school in the country and many schools have ordered extra copies so that they can be used in the school curriculum. Senator Higgins' proposal to make slides of monuments available to schools would be an interesting extension of this first step.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of archaeology in schools and said it is time that in our schools we were given the opportunity to have the subject of national heritage or archaeology brought into the curriculum in a more structured way. He went on to say it is a pity that close to our national sites of importance there is not, in any of them, a centre where children could be brought and kept for a day or two to get a good guiding in the particular sites. As it happens we hope to take a short step in this direction this year. The supervisor at the Rock of Cashel is intending to provide a programme for school children there. In addition we have at Cahir Castle an excellent audio-visual presentation of the major monuments in the surrounding area and I would encourage school teachers in the area, if they have not already done so, to arrange to visit Cahir Castle with their pupils. It is the intention to provide audio-visual shows to the same high standard at other centres. The new visitor centre under construction at Glendalough will have an audio-visual theatre and another is being provided at Parke's Castle, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge suggested an RIA sponsored study or meeting of minds between archaeologists and scientists to consider the best methods to employ in meeting the challenges of the present and the future. This is an interesting idea and I would fully support the view that we must tap the wealth of knowledge and <Col N="1386" /> experience of all academic disciplines.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge expressed concern in respect of people engaged in genuine geophysical exploration and has asked whether the general licence issued by the Department of Energy will protect persons using electronic methods for the determination of metal deposits and oils. On a strict interpretation of the Bill the Department of Energy licence would not be sufficient and I propose to introduce an amendment to facilitate people engaged in genuine licensed geophysical exploration on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of documentation, I am pleased to be able to say that in our Sites and Monuments Records Office we are using the most advanced computerised facilities either here or in Britain. Apart from speeding up the production of sites and monuments records these facilities are storing information which can be easily retrieved and which will, in time, form part of a comprehensive computerised data base for all our national monuments.</P>
    <P>The comments of Senators Dooge and Lanigan in relation to the National Museum are outside the scope of this Bill. It is hoped, however, that they will be noted in the proper quarter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dooge that documentation is important and that the best documentation is to have the sites and monuments open to the public as visible, tangible evidence of the events which centred around them and I like Senator Lanigan's idea of developing facilities at monuments which would provide scope for educational &ldquo;summer camps&rdquo;. It will be noted that this Bill will facilitate this, in particular section 7 which provides for development of visitor facilities adjacent to monuments.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the 150,000 monuments in the country. The best estimate at the moment is that there are approximately 60,000 to 80,000 monuments in the State and it is the intention that when the surveys which are now in progress are completed, all the monuments will receive statutory protection. Inevitably only a small number of the most important monuments will be <Col N="1387" /> in State care. I hope that, as resources become available, the number in State care and open to visitors will be increased.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge stressed that, in his view, rescue archaeology should take precedence over academic archaeology and that rescue units should be set up to cope with the increasing incidence of cases requiring rescue digs. In reply to this, I point out that the policy pursued has been to require developers to bear the cost and engage archaeologists for these digs. The cost of a rescue dig is not usually very great when set against the overall cost of development.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins described the reaction of a group of developers on being advised that archaeological remains had come to light on their site. Their immediate thought was to find a quick way of disposing of the problem. I am glad to say that, while this reaction is to be expected, more and more developers are finding that the Commissioners of Public Works are in a position to give them guidance and help which they need to deal in a positive way with such a problem, that is, by engaging an archaeologist to investigate the site. In a certain number of cases they may reveal a very important site which warrants full protection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed Register of Historic Monuments and the section 18 provision which allows for registered monuments to be entered as burdens on land Senator Connor pointed out that section 18 applies only to unregistered land. This is so but this should cover 90 per cent of cases. This is as much as we found it practicable to do and it will be a great advance as heretofore a buyer of land had no way of knowing whether or not there was a monument on the site. I understand that the Incorporated Law Society have recently included national monuments restrictions in their requisitions on title, repairing an omission which has caused problems in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons wondered if the Bill would help to prevent the depredation of wrecks. The Bill by imposing more realistic penalties will help to deter <Col N="1388" /> predators but we will still be dependent on local vigilance and, of course, on the Garda to protect this aspect of our heritage.</P>
    <P>There were a number of points raised about the Historic Monuments Council. Senator Fitzsimons queried why the title was changed from National Monuments to Historic Monuments. Senator Bulbulia asked was it a rose by any other name. The reason for the change was that the term &ldquo;national monuments&rdquo; has a narrow definition whereas it is intended that the new council will concern itself with the wider field, including wrecks which are encompassed by the word &ldquo;historic&rdquo;. There is quite a definite reason for the change in the name of the council.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly, Senator Dooge and Senator Connor made a number of suggestions regarding the composition of the council and, indeed, many other Senators too. To meet these suggestions the size of the council would need to be increased considerably. If we took all the extra bodies and persons suggested by Senators we would double the size of the council from 18 to 36 instantly without any leeway for the Minister for Finance of the day to appoint anybody to it. While I am sympathetic to some of the proposals, we must face the fact that the line has to be drawn somewhere. If the number becomes too large it becomes unwieldy and my view is that about 18 is the optimum number.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown, too, that when organisations nominate representatives who have no personal interest in national monuments they do not take an active part in the proceedings. For this reason the Minister for Finance, in selecting five representatives for the reconstituted National Monuments Advisory Council, chose people with a special interest in monuments but who were also engaged in related activities such as agriculture. There are also representatives of local historic societies in those five extra people.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be a good idea, as Senator Fitzsimons proposed, to compel the council to meet at prescribed <Col N="1389" /> times. There would be very little point in the council meeting just to fulfil the requirements of the Act. In any event, I do not foresee any danger that the council will not wish to meet at frequent intervals.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons asked why there have been so few prosecutions under the National Monuments Acts. If the penalties were sufficiently severe, a small number of prosecutions would be enough to teach salutary lessons. One of the problems has been that the level of fines at present is ludicrous, to use the term applied by several Senators. There is also the problem of collecting evidence which would warrant bringing a prosecution. Under this Bill, it will now be much easier to secure a prosecution for unauthorised use of metal detectors.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzsimons's view of the importance of preserving old graveyards but as he rightly says this is a matter for the local authorities. It would be outside the scope of this Bill to provide funds for local authorities for this purpose. I was glad to note from Senator Willie Ryan that the Tipperary (South Riding) County Council are giving proper attention to the old graveyards in their area.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons was unhappy with the provision that a monument may be moved out of the area or out of the county. He would prefer that, if a monument has to be moved, it should go to a local museum. I heartily agree with this view but in many cases there may not be a local museum or at any rate a museum where the monument would be safe so we must provide for such contingencies. Senator Fitzsimons's proposal to fund the establishment of local museums is, I am afraid, also outside the scope of this Bill. Senator Fitzsimons refers to old workhouses, disused Protestant churches and thatched cottages. The fact that these are post-1700 does not preclude them from the provisions of this Bill. I repeat this because there has been some concern by reporters lest that might not be so. It does not preclude them from the provisions of this Bill &mdash; the fact that these and many other interesting monuments and buildings <Col N="1390" /> are post-1700.</P>
    <P>There is the question of resources. This is not something particular to this country. Throughout Europe, even in the most prosperous countries there is an acceptance that the extension of the view of what constitutes the architectural heritage has far outstripped the finances available for its preservation and this question of financing conservation is receiving much attention. In a fortnight's time I will be opening a conference on this subject which is being organised by An Foras Forbartha and I will be interested to see what emerges from this conference dealing with the whole vexed question of financing our heritage.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor referred to the economical aspect of our national monuments and advocated greater spending on monuments in order to get a return in the form of tourism earnings. Again, I totally agree with this. Expenditure on the conservation of our heritage should be looked upon as an investment. Unfortunately, we are living at a time of serious financial constraint and the time is not ripe for a major increase in investment in this area at any rate from the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor suggests that we appoint local people to watch archaeological sites against the depredations of treasure hunters. The OPW already employ 142 caretakers around the country and I will ask the commissioners to consider further extending this service. In fact, section 8 of this Bill provides for authorising persons other than officials to carry out inspections on behalf of the commissioners. This provision can be availed of to authorise interested members of local historical societies to enter on lands for the purpose of inspecting monuments.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor made very interesting proposals for promoting public awareness and interpretation of monuments other than those in the care of the commissioners and the provision of public museums. I could not agree more with him, but again I must say it is not a lack of legislation but a shortage of resources that is holding us back.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has some sympathy for <Col N="1391" /> metal detector users for the reason that as he said, the Derrynaflan treasure would not have been discovered but for the use of a metal detector. This is not necessarily the position. A number of years ago an archaeological excavation was mooted for Derrynaflan and, while that did not take place, the likelihood is that an excavation would have, in due course, unearthed the treasure. In that event the archaeologists would have been able to piece together more of the story, which is now regrettably lost forever, as to how the treasure happened to be there.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor asked for a word of explanation as to how the proposed Register of Historic Monuments will fit in with existing provisions for registration of land. The Register of Historic Monuments will stand on its own as a legal record of protection afforded to archaeological areas and monuments under the National Monuments Acts. It will be available for the purpose of searches on title to land. However, provision is made in this Bill to have such protection where appropriate recorded in the Land Registry as a burden on land. This initiates a process which will lead in time to registration of all monuments and protected sites as burdens on land, at which state the much desired blanket protection will have been achieved.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan referred to the role of AnCO and local communities in surveys in conservation works. The Office of Public Works are co-operating with AnCO on a number of projects. There has been a scheme in progress for a few years whereby the Office of Public Works provide training for apprentice stone-masons. I am delighted to say that includes many women. The plasterwork at Carrick-on-Suir Castle is being done by AnCO apprentices under the guidance of an Office of Public Works craftsman.</P>
    <P>There is a very interesting joint project in the restoration of Swiss Cottage at Cahir, County Tipperary. This is one of the best examples of a cottage <i>orner</i> in these islands. In this case the joint project is being undertaken by the local community, AnCO, the county council, the <Col N="1392" /> Georgian Society and by a very generous American benefactor, all of whom are co-operating with the Office of Public Works in the restoration of this unique building. This is a practice I would love to see extended.</P>
    <P>There are so many of our monuments and so much of our heritage that the State will not be able to reach at least for some time. It is an area we must explore and I intend to explore fully how the State, if you like under the direction of the Office of Public Works, can be involved in a joint venture with the private sector and other State bodies in restoring and preserving our heritage. It is up to all of us. The State could not possibly take on the job alone.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan referred to the local advisory committees and said that the committees should have representatives of the farming community, local historical committees and teachers. I emphasise there is no restriction at all on county councils on including such people on the advisory committee. Many councils already do so. I urge Senators who are also involved on county councils to ensure that first, these committees are up and running and, secondly, that they meet regularly. We need to instill far more enthusiasm at that level. That will help very much in what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald wondered at the delay in taking over the Rock of Dunamase as a national monument. The Senator will be happy to know that the problem of title in this case has been sorted out recently and the monument has recently passed into the care of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge structured his major contribution to this debate on the seven headings used by Professor Mitchell in his presidential address to the Royal Irish Academy in 1978. A number of other speakers referred to this address also.</P>
    <P>This address was entitled &ldquo;Planning for Irish Archaeology in the Eighties&rdquo; and was concerned to a large extent with the activities of the National Museum for which I am not responsible. Nevertheless I can safely say that the museum has <Col N="1393" /> improved considerably in recent years under the guidance of my colleague Deputy Nealon, Minister of State for Arts and Culture, and that at least some of the criticisms made by Professor Mitchell would not apply today.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the Professor's address did not purport to be a comprehensive plan for national monuments. As he pointed out, the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works has two arms, one architectural, the other archaeological. The address dealt with the archaeological arm but no report on national monuments is complete without reference to the excellent work done by the architectural staff.</P>
    <P>Many of the Senators who contributed to the debate have praised the excellent conservation work done at our major monuments. Many were mentioned from Kilmainham Castle down to small projects. This work, designed by sensitive architects and executed by skilled craftsmen, is a delight to all who visit our monuments and it is complemented by the interpretive service provided by the guides at these monuments. Perhaps enough credit has not been given to our guide services. The development of this service has been one of the great success stories of recent years. Each year we are extending this service to additional sites and the number of visitors is increasing all the time. In fact, there is a direct relationship between establishing a guide service and audio-visual facilities at our monuments and an enormous increase immediately in the number of visitors to that site. As a matter of interest, Mellifont Abbey was added this year to the list where a guide service is provided. This is one of the sites where Professor Mitchell felt there was lack of control. That control is now in place.</P>
    <P>Coming back to archaeology, the thing that strikes me on reading Professor Mitchell's address is the tremendous progress that has been made in the intervening years. For instance under the heading &ldquo;record&rdquo; the two criticisms made by Professor Mitchell were, first, the lack of publication, and secondly, the lack of resources devoted to the national survey. <Col N="1394" /> We now have inventories published for Counties Louth and Donegal and for the Dingle Peninsula. County Monaghan will be published later this month, County Meath is with the printers and in the next two years we will have County West-meath, County Kildare and parts, if not all of County Cork and County Galway published. I have every confidence that this monument will be maintained. I have already outlined the rapid progress being made with the publication of sites and monuments records.</P>
    <P>Over the past four years there has been a significant increase in the finance allocated for national monuments and much of this has been devoted to the survey work. Professor Mitchell said that in 1978 there were only six people engaged on it and he looked forward to increasing this to 30. I am glad to say that since 1982 there have been on average more than 30 people engaged on this work. The OPW's own staff has been increased and contracts have been placed with archaeologists, some of these under the aegis of UCC and UCG.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Protect&rdquo; the main proposal was that a sum of £5 million should be set aside each year for the purpose of purchasing monuments. I need hardly say that, regrettably, no Government have found it possible to make such funds available.</P>
    <P>The Professor saw the main objective to be that &ldquo;we must reach the position of Sweden where national monuments are regarded, very properly, as having national rights which exceed those of private ownership and have absolute protection from interference, except where permission to interfere has been granted by an authorised body&rdquo;. This is my objective. The Supreme Court has confirmed that national monuments may have rights which exceed those of private ownership and it is the intention that once every monument in the country is entered in the register they will have the protection sought by Professor Mitchell.</P>
    <P>With regard to the protection of underwater wrecks, it is clear that a different attitude now prevails than did in the case of the <i>Trinidad Valencera.</i> Preservation <Col N="1395" /> orders have been placed on three wrecks sites and every effort made to protect these sites with the statutory authority available under the current legislation. The commissioners have taken a leading part in the Council of Europe's deliberations on this topic and the provisions of the Bill now before us are based on the results of these deliberations.</P>
    <P>Reference to the active interest taken by some local authorities in their heritage was made by many Senators. Indeed we wish that every local authority would actively involve themselves in this field. The local authorities as well as the Commissioners of Public Works have powers and duties under the National Monuments Acts. I am glad to say that the local authority with which I am most intimately acquainted, Wexford County Council, have taken the bold step of developing a Heritage Park at Ferrycarrig three miles from Wexford town.</P>
    <P>There is an authentic Norman castle and a ringfort at Ferrycarrig as well as a replica of a round tower built in 1860 and the county council are availing of this basis and the scenery of the area to provide a suitable setting for a park which will have a wide variety of exhibits. They will include: a mesolithic and a neolithic habitation as well as a megalithic tomb; a standing stone and a stone circle; a ringfort with two houses; a monastery comprising church, four cells and guest house; a corn-drying kiln; a horizontal mill; a fulacht fiadh; a crannóg with four houses; a Viking boat which will be in a pond filled from the River Slaney and two Viking houses and a Norman motte and Bailey. It is planned to open the Heritage Park in the summer of 1987.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute also to the various learned bodies, institutes of learning and local societies who have been co-operating with the Commissioners of Public Works in preserving our heritage. I would like to mention particularly the Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College, the three University Colleges, the National Museum and the Maritime Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In general good progress is being made <Col N="1396" /> with the protection and conservation of our heritage and with developing a public awareness of its importance. More resources are required if we are to keep all the monuments the Senators would wish us to preserve. There have been significant increases in funds for national monuments under the present Government and I have confidence that when the economic situation improves further increases will be allocated for this important purpose. In the meantime, it is necessary for us to provide better legislation to ensure, as Senator Dooge said, that the machinery is in place. The present Bill will provide that machinery and I, therefore, ask the House to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, 1986,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 24th October, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> I extend a sincere welcome to the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce Deputy R. Bruton on his first visit to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion arises because I consider it necessary to introduce a legal measure to assist consumers in assessing the true cost of credit. The order, which will relate to credit provided to consumers only, and not to traders, will:</P>
      <P>(i) require advertisements that make reference to the availability and cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge known as APR. The APR may be shown by way of a representative example if no other means is practicable;</P>
      <P>(ii) require any notice-leaflet etc., relating to loans or credit sales which are displayed at a place where a cash loan can be obtained or a cash purchase made to show the true cost of credit using APR, and</P>
      <P>(iii) set out legally binding definitions relating, in the main, to consumer credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The APR can be defined as the total cost of the credit advanced as an annual percentage of the outstanding amount of the credit granted. In addition to interest, the total cost of credit will also include such items as administration costs, documentation fees, compulsory insurance and so on. In calculating APR, the interest paid on a loan is expressed as a percentage in relation to the declining principal outstanding over the term of the loan. This compares with the &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; system, at present used by some financial institutions, and very frequently in shops where the interest is based on the capital sum borrowed at the outset for the full term of the loan and does not allow for the fact that the principal is constantly reducing over the period of the loan; in other words, the real cost is considerably greater than that apparently indicated by the rate of interest quoted. As a rule of thumb the APR would be double that of <Col N="1398" /> the flat rate quoted in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>For example, take a loan of £250 with charges amounting to £50 &mdash; a total of £300 &mdash; repayable in 12 monthly instalments of £25 and compare this with a similar loan repayable in a lump sum of £300 at the end of 12 months. Both of these loans have a flat rate interest charge of 20 per cent. Under the first loan, however, the borrower has the use of an average of £125 only available during the 12 month period. He is, therefore, getting less for his charges than the borrower under the second loan who has the use of the full £250 for the entire 12 month period. The effective annual rate of the 12 monthly instalments loan would in fact be 41.2 per cent, while the effective annual rate of the lump sum loan would be 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The basic thrust of this order is to require that in any claim made about the cost of credit consumers not be misled as to what is the rate of interest and, secondly, that there be no way in which they can conceal charges that are bound up with the credit. What is going to be achieved is there in simple layman's terms.</P>
    <P>At present there is a serious possibility of consumers being confused, or even misled, as to the true cost of the money they are borrowing. I am introducing this order to enable consumers to compare the cost of credit offered by the different financial institutions and consequently to eliminate the possibility of consumers being confused as to the true cost of credit.</P>
    <P>The order will also require that, if an advertisement refers to the provision of goods and services on credit, the cash price and the credit price must be also shown, for example: &ldquo;£50 deposit and 12 monthly payments of £20 &mdash; APR 20 per cent, cash price £267.70, credit price £290&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The order will not apply to free credit or to licensed banks because banks are at present exempted from the provision of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, under which this order is being made. However, at present, banks generally use <Col N="1399" /> the APR system and with the co-operation of the Central Bank will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This order is aimed at having regulations with regard to consumer protection. In my brief contribution I want to refer to a few different areas related to this order. In the past many people have suffered because of the want of protection and we in public life are well aware of the number of people who have suffered. This might only be the tip of the iceberg. Many people we might not have heard about may have suffered deeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have problems with moneylenders to which I will refer later. Advertising is a powerful medium which is geared to trap. It is very big business. Because of advertising, in many instances, the cost of a commodity is doubled. All of us who have children know the power of advertising when we go to buy a toy for Santa Claus and discover that, after a short period of advertising, the particular product is sold out. We dealt with advertising when we discussed women in the media at the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. Advertisers would not claim to have any role to play in relation to social change. It might be a very negative one. Here we have a positive turnabout which I welcome very much. From now on the price will be quoted and also the interest rate so that people will know where they stand. I thought that a cooling off period would also have been included but this does not seem to be the case. I was led to believe from publicity some time ago that people who got into an awkward situation might have some brief period during which they could change their minds. This does not appear to be the case and it is a pity. We know of the hardship that many people experience because of increases in interest rates. At present we have an unfortunate situation with the increase in interest rates by the building societies. That will not be covered by this order, but we know from television and the media <Col N="1400" /> during the past few days that many families are in an impossible situation and homes have to be sold. That is wrong. Something should be done to protect people who are not able to cope with the problems due to these increases.</P>
    <P>We are familiar with moneylenders. In the past, even in my own town, we had this problem on a very large scale. Local people apparently do business for these firms who provide credit at exorbitant rates. Credit unions have done marvellous work in my own town and throughout the country and they take on people who would not be facilitated by the banks as they do not have collateral or security. Few people let them down. We owe a great deal to the credit unions and their role should be highlighted.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, 1986, is written in Dickensian English as apparently it has to be. It could have been curtailed somewhat. For example, it refers to the annual percentage rate of charge in Article 2 which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... annual percentage rate of charge&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by Article 3 of this Order;</P>
    <P>Article 3 (1) states:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of this Order and whenever this Order prescribes the use of the expression &ldquo;annual percentage rate of charge&rdquo;, that expression shall mean the total cost of credit expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted and calculated in accordance with Article 4 of this Order.</P>
    <P>Article 4 states:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, the annual percentage rate of charge shall be calculated in accordance with the First Schedule to this Order to one decimal place, all further decimal places being disregarded.</P>
    <P>It is further described in Schedule 1. All the facts could have been covered in a short paragraph. Article 5 of the order states that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> This Order shall not apply&mdash;</P>
    <P>to hiring agreements except where such agreements provide or allow for the title to pass ultimately to the hirer.</P>
    <P>In connection with the hiring of a car, there is the option in some circumstances to purchase at the end of the period. I wonder if this is covered totally, or if there is some way whereby creditors could avoid the order on that account? Article 6 states that any advertisement in which it is indicated that credit may be provided or arranged by the advertiser and which purports to show the cost of credit or includes any claims in relation to the cost of credit shall also indicate further information.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if both of those apply. For example, if an advertisement appeared in the newspaper which did not purport to show the cost of credit, would it come within the terms of the order? Subsequently, if a letter was forwarded by such a firm, would the details set out in the letter be considered as an advertisement?</P>
    <P>Schedules 1 and 2 set out the percentage rate of charge. They take up five pages and I think they are very comprehensively dealt with. I wonder if they cover every contingency. I am not familiar with this area.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which need protection and could possibly come within the ambit of such an order. For example, during the past few days I listened to Gay Byrne's programme and given in it was information about clubs which were set up in order to install central heating and double glazing. The people who contributed a weekly rate were formed into groups of 20 and had the works carried out at different stages. Apparently for some reason there was a problem about payment and, therefore, almost a total collapse of the clubs. The intention was good; apparently people were being helped, but through some unavoidable circumstances there is a total collapse. It is wrong that people should be in that predicament. I wonder if there is any supervision in that area? If not, there should be, because this is only one <Col N="1402" /> instance but it applies generally. Perhaps the Minister would look at that area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say, as I said at the outset, that this is a measure which was introduced to tighten up the regulations with regard to consumer protection and I warmly welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion before the House. I refer to the Minister's speech in which he said that this motion arose because he considered it necessary to introduce a legal measure to assist consumers in assessing the true cost of credit. He went on to illustrate further the requirement that advertisements, notices and leaflets must include and show the true cost of credit under the annual percentage rate of charge, the APR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the draft order. It is dealing, of course, with making further information available to consumers, specifically in relation to consumer credit. It is also a further measure of protection where consumers are concerned as it relates to goods and services and to accommodation. It relates also to another category, namely, facilities of any descriptions. That is a particularly wide definition and perhaps the Minister might comment on it. Taking that particular <Col N="1403" /> category at its face value on, facilities of any description, there is nothing left as it would appear to embrace all and everything. Anything that is not included would have to be specifically excluded. I was interested to hear the Minister refer to the fact that the licensed banks are excluded from the provisions of this measure, even though apparently they do subscribe to a measure of control decided by the Central Bank. It is a very general category that covers facilities of any description. I am not objecting to it, but I am simply drawing attention to the fact that it appears to be all embracing and, in the opinion of the Minister, it is very necessary and desirable that it should be so.</P>
    <P>I regard this order as necessary for the protection of consumers. Senator Fitzsimons alluded to the fact that there has been widespread misrepresentation and concealment of the true cost of credit by the providers of certain services. I am satisfied that misrepresentation and concealment have been widespread and to the extent that this measure is aimed at eliminating and coping with them, this motion deserves our support. The protection being provided will apply right across the board to all types of people. There is no doubt that unscrupulous operators have abused the ignorance or the innocence of certain people and have exploited them quite seriously over the years. This order represents a means of coping with that exploitation which no doubt the less well off and the disadvantaged have suffered most in our society. People have been misled and exploited regularly. While I have referred to certain types of people, exploitation has not always been confined to that particular stratum of society. Other sections have been the victims of misinformation and concealment of the true cost of credit. The shady dealer is not the only one who is responsible for this regrettable state of affairs. Some &ldquo;respectable institutions&rdquo; have shown a remarkable capacity to raise the cost of credit beyond <Col N="1404" /> what was originally indicated to the consumer. The Minister said the annual percentage rate of charge will take on a meaning that will be clearly and universally understood by all consumers. This protection which the order is providing is necessary. It will prevent the exploitation of those who have been exploited in the past. I welcome the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fair to say that never in our history have there been so many people in debt. A great number of people have extreme difficulty in meeting their commitments and others have absolutely no possibility whatsoever of being able to repay debts incurred for a variety of purposes including personal purposes. The attitude towards debts down through the years has changed. Some of this is due to changing economic conditions, plus job redundancies, an expectation of life and an expectation of income which subsequent years are unable to supply. There is also the attitude of banks. Major banks are not involved in the risk area we are talking about. The only people who can supply the high risk market are moneylending and hire purchase institutions who have to operate at a level of interest which is totally uneconomic for the consumers, but enables them to deal with what they consider high risk situations. I do not know what the percentage of failure is to meet the commitments within the group who operate in this sector but I assume it is quite high. As a result the unfortunate people who actually pay and meet their commitments are paying a considerably higher percentage. In that context, there is unanimous approval of the order which the Minister is introducing here today. It will help to enlighten the public and give them a certain amount of security. However, no amount of Government orders, legislation or regulations can ever protect the public fully. Therefore, there is a compelling need for greater education and understanding amongst all of us on how we manage our domestic and financial affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us enter into commitments with practically no facilities to honour <Col N="1405" /> them in full. If a person has not at least some spare capital &mdash; I am not talking about a high percentage &mdash; to purchase goods, consumer or otherwise, how can that person expect in later years to be able to make the kind of savings which he or she could not make prior to the time of purchase. In the context of home management, for the vulnerable groups in society who can be more readily tempted into making a commitment it would be helpful to develop a more enlightened and balanced approach towards credit as a whole. There is a trail of misery, of dread and almost devastation in some areas in all our constituencies. In some of our cities marriages have been breaking down because one spouse has not informed the other of commitments undertaken. Debts have been incurred to meet debts and interest rates have been charged which have been absolutely phenomenal. A presentation may be given indicating interest rates at 6, 7, 8 or 9 per cent but with compound interest and depending on the terms of repayment they could be four or even five times that. It is essential that we try to help as far as possible in enlightening the public in these areas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the banks are not really involved in this area and I think they should be. I am not suggesting that the commercial banks should get involved in risk capital where they have no possibility of getting returns for their shareholders, but if they are not involved, and continually hesitate to become involved, the moneylending organisations or individuals and the hire purchase groups will meet that situation. In broad terms we would like to see a further widening role for the main commercial banks in this area.</P>
    <P>Broadly, I welcome this measure. I hope it will have some effect in curing or at least reducing, some of the problems that have developed in this area. Finally, I would encourage the Minister to consider measures which would go further down the road towards education and enlightening the public as a whole in a more balanced approach towards incurring <Col N="1406" /> debts in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this draft. There are two types of people who have to borrow money &mdash; one type is the person who needs the money urgently and does not seem to worry at the time of borrowing about the terms of repayment of the loan. When such a person secures the loan to relieve his financial crisis he then has to pay back the loan at high interest rates.</P>
      <P>Senator Smith referred to the banks. The banking system in Ireland have a case to answer. As vice-Chairman of the All-Party Committee on Small Businesses I have been increasingly disturbed at the effect massive increases in bank charges are having on small firms. Moreover, the arbitrary manner in which these increases are being applied show total insensitivity on the part of the banks to the difficulties of small traders at a time of deep and prolonged recession in Ireland. Although our committee had several meetings with the banks over the past three years, their attitude towards small firms has disimproved. Bank charges are higher than ever, and still climbing rapidly. Interest rates on loans to small firms have increased relative to other categories of borrowers. Government action alone can redress the balance between small firms and the banks. I ask the Minister to take note of today's discussion and to try to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small trader and as a public representative, I feel I have a duty to continue in my endeavours to ensure that the banks become a service to small firms rather than a burden which they are at present. An urgent Government initiative to break the stranglehold of the main banking groups on small firms, on the farming community and on the manufacturing services sector is needed. The banks are abusing their monopoly position by imposing extortionate increases in handling charges on their small business customers. The typical retail business has suffered increases in handling charges ranging from three fold to twelve fold during the past two years. The result of this is that bank charges have become a <Col N="1407" /> major cost burden to these firms. I can quote instances of small business people who have had to lodge their money twice weekly and whose handling charges have increased from £30 last year to £800 this year. That is an alarming statistic. Most of the banks have installed computerisation systems and I know who is paying for these systems. We are paying for them, bank charges are a crippling and insensitively applied burden on small firms at a time of deep recession.</P>
    <P>There is widespread anger at the charge of 12p for each cheque lodged and the additional charge of £3.50 for each stolen or void cheque presented as part of a lodgment. It is hard to accept a cheque from someone in good faith and then when it comes back he is charged an extra £3.50 because the cheque bounced. There is also a charge of 35p for each £100 cash lodged or withdrawn. I am very critical of the 12p handling charge for each cheque presented to the bank. Small traders would have to cash fewer cheques for their customers if banks branches had similar opening hours to those of every other business, rather than the present ridiculous average of 22 hours per week. In rural areas in particular local shopkeepers are often obliged to accept cheques from their customers due to the lack of banking facilities and the limited bank opening hours. Shopkeepers, members of the licensed trade and other retailers are incensed when they are charged 12p for each social welfare cheque cashed by them for their own customers, although the banks impose no charge when these cheques are cashed directly by the recipients at a branch. The banks are operating a double standard in this situation.</P>
    <P>The so-called end of the cartel announced last year has not resulted in any improvement. The differential in interest rates to &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; customers, such as Government and large firms, and &ldquo;AA&rdquo; customers, which include most small firms has doubled. I would like to refer to the contrast between the penalty of ½ per cent per month interest charged on hard-pressed small firms who have <Col N="1408" /> exceeded their borrowing limits and the lack of interest on current accounts in credit. That rate is 6 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>We have had many complaints from dairy farmers regarding the restrictive terms attached to the Euro-money loans by the banks. The lending restrictions imposed by the banks for these loans were such that one had to ask if the banks had a vested interest in keeping our recession battered farmers on expensive overdrafts.</P>
    <P>One of my fears is that the treatment of small firms and farmers by the banks will give an impetus to cash transactions which will by-pass the banking system and some of these businesses will ultimately be forced into the black economy. With banking charges increasing from £30 in 1985 to £800 in 1986 people are being forced into the black economy. They are buying for cash and selling for cash and not returning their VAT. It is a serious, intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>I have a few proposals for the Minister. I call on the Government to investigate the possibility of authorising An Post and the building societies to provide full money transmission services to bring about some sorely needed, real competition in this area. Any necessary legislation should have Government priority. The Government should request the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to carry out an investigation of the present operation of the money transmission service by the banks to include an assessment of the banks own efficiency and cost structures. Although the Central Bank have statutory responsibility here, the low level of business confidence in the banking system requires that such an investigation would come from outside the banking area. The banks have to face the fact that they have a severe image problem at present, especially among small businesses. They need to take immediate steps to put their house in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this draft. The purpose of the draft, as the Minister has said, is to assist consumers in assessing the true cost of credit. We all <Col N="1409" /> know what the Minister has in mind. He is talking about the element of moneylending that operates in this country and in particular within the areas of large cities and bigger towns. There is a rampant amount of moneylending. It is right and proper that people who use moneylenders are made aware of the terms of repayments. Unfortunately, they are tied to the moneylender and do not care what they have to pay back as long as they get the money such as £200 or £300 to pay a bill. They know they must pay back the money over a certain period. They will take it at any cost. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>I would support the view that the banks might have a role to play in this. Most of the people who become involved with moneylenders are people on social welfare. Perhaps these people could be facilitated at their local bank branch. They should be encouraged to get into the habit of saving. The habit of saving has died, unfortunately, to some extent. This is a pity. It is a habit that everybody should have from the cradle to the grave. If one saves then the opportunities exist for further finances, whether it be banking or otherwise. I believe that the banks have a role to play. They should be more flexible with these unfortunate people who have to borrow small sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the credit unions for the great work they do. Could they extend their services? They like people to invest with them for a time. If a person then wants money later on, they readily get the appropriate loan at a reasonable rate. The advantage of the moneylender is that they call to the borrower's home on a weekly or two-weekly basis. There can be harassment, which we all deplore. It would be a good thing if credit unions could extend their activities. If they could have a weekly collection system that would eliminate once and for all the type of thing the Minister has in mind. Credit unions are a wonderful organisation who deserve credit. Perhaps the Minister could make an approach to them and ask if they could possibly extend their activities to include a weekly collection. Obviously they would have to charge extra because they <Col N="1410" /> would have to employ extra staff.</P>
    <P>I support the order. It is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately the problem will always be there if moneylenders can offer people sums of money. People are very glad to get the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Senators who have spoken have received this measure in such a positive way.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment briefly on the points raised by Senators in the course of the debate. Senator Fitzsimons raised the issue of why there was not a cooling off period in this order. This order is essentially dealing with advertisements and claims about cost in advertisements. We are drafting another order which will deal with a cooling off period in certain types of credit agreement. That is a separate job and that is why it is not here. The Senator suggested that the building societies might not be covered by this order. They are in fact covered by this order. Building societies will have to conform wherever they have advertisements. He mentioned that the English was not eloquent in the Bill and that it was complicated with the definition of APR. One had to pursue deeper and deeper into the Bill to find it. I understand the frustration but the way in which orders of this nature are set out is that they always have a section with initial opening definitions. Then the following section nominated particular things that must be included, not just as interest but other charges. The following section that he referred to specified particular exclusions. For instance, free credit and hiring agreements are excluded. The final section went into the technical way of calculating it. While I can understand the Senator's frustration, each of the different sections to which he referred was dealing with different aspects. We believed this was the best way to assemble it. Naturally, it has to be legally tight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also queried whether the exclusion of hiring could possibly exclude hire purchase agreements. <Col N="1411" /> This is not the case. The only hiring agreements that are excluded are those where the property and the goods do not pass. It is strictly hiring that is excluded, not hire purchase as is commonly known where, at the end of the hiring period, the goods pass to the person who is paying. The Senator asked whether advertisements not purporting to show cost would be included. This is confined solely to anything that purports to make a claim about costs. In other words, a shop that is saying that credit terms are available for certain goods would not be forced to quote APR's in such a general advertisement. But where inside it had specific claims about cost, either the cash price or the credit price, they would have to show the true rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Senator mentioned a particular case about central heating clubs that was recently discussed on the Gay Byrne Hour. I am aware of this matter. I have asked my Department to look into the specifics of this particular arrangement. At this stage I cannot comment on this matter. There is the possibility of a breach or misleading information which would come under the Director of Consumer Affairs. I do not know if there was a further suggestion of fraud in this case. Obviously, I am not in a position to comment on it in detail. Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and under the Consumer Information Act there are certain powers to control agreements such as this. We will have to see whether a breach occurred in this case.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard and a number of other Senators mentioned the banks and their exclusion from this order. While the banks are excluded at present from this order, because they are excluded from the Consumer Information Act, under a new Bill being introduced which is reforming the whole restrictive practices legislation and changing the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the banks will be included in future. The same point refers to Senator Lynch's proposal that a restrictive practices examination of the banks should be carried out. Under <Col N="1412" /> present legislation it would not be possible for the Restrictive Practices Commission to do that. When the proposed legislation, which was announced last week by the Government, comes into the House and is passed, it will be possible to apply this order and to have examinations of the banks under the Restrictive Practices Act. However, I would reiterate that the banks subscribe to the use of APR and have agreed in co-operation with the Central Bank to comply with this order.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith developed the question of the banks' role, particularly in relation to the problems of moneylending, as did Senator Fallon. I agree wholeheartedly that there is scope for more activity by the well-regulated credit institutions in dealing with the problems of low income families. I am concerned that people who are on low income are put off by the formality applied by the banks. The banks are not always sympathetic to the sort of items people need to spend money on. As I announced last week, I am approaching the banks and urging them to become more involved. I am convinced that this is commercial business. As a number of Senators have pointed out, people are successfully paying very, very high rates of interest on alternative sources. It is not a question of people being unwilling or unable to meet payments. Very much of this business is commercial. Obviously, no one can ask a bank, or a credit union, or anybody else who is providing credit to become a charity.</P>
    <P>The objective must be that a number of agencies who are involved in the credit business must see the special difficulty of low income families in gaining credit as a priority which needs to be tackled in a systematic way. While much of the discussion today was centred on moneylending, this measure is essentially aimed at consumer protection in the broadest possible sense. We are not just talking about moneylenders. We are talking about ordinary credit sale agreements in shops. We are talking about credit cards, Visas and so on that people have in their pockets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> This is an important measure to give information to everyone about the cost and availability of credit. It is a step towards tackling the other problem, in low income areas, of moneylending. When people have access to more information, and when the people who are close to them and who advise them have access to more information, they can be gradually weaned off reliance on sources of credit that are subject to abuse and to very high levels of interest.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch dealt at considerable length with the banks. He is aware that the Department of Industry and Commerce do not deal with the regulation of banks. All these issues, such as allowing new competitors into the banking area, are essentially covered under the Central Bank Acts. While our orders deal with all credit &mdash; in time when the banks come under the Consumer Information Act this order will require them to use the APRs in their quotations of credit &mdash; my Department do not have detailed supervision powers over the banks.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator Fallon raised the question of reform in the credit unions and, generally, the role of credit unions in relation to credit. I agree wholeheartedly with the thrust of Senator Fitzsimons and various other speakers on the great role which credit unions are playing in this area. I know of their success in dealing with moneylending problems in the past in particular areas. They have the scope and ability to contribute greatly to the remaining problem.</P>
    <P>However, Senators should be aware that credit unions too have to protect their members' savings. They are also bound by a legal requirement in their legislation of not being able to charge more than 1 per cent per month. A detailed weekly collection system that might imply heavy collection costs might put undue strain on the credit unions. Their presence in areas where they are not now present sufficiently strongly would be a great step forward. I do not know whether Senator Fallon's suggestion is one they could take on board but I <Col N="1414" /> will certainly bear it in mind in discussions which I hope to have with the credit union sector in the near future.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank Senators for their very constructive approach to this. Letting the borrower know is the first step in getting a much fairer deal for borrowers and for protecting borrowers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the Department of Justice assumed a greater responsibility in the administration of the courts. Leaving responsibility for change in the hands of the courts and a rules committee comprising judges and lawyers is a waste of time.</P>
      <P>I have a document here from the &ldquo;Business Insurance of the United States&rdquo; of 2 June, 1986. This is a very reputable company. This article is very damaging and can be very damaging to Ireland. They show the map of Ireland, and across the map is a bandage showing the position in Ireland on employer' liability, industrial accidents and insurance budgets in the Emerald Isle.</P>
      <P>Many US mutinationals, wooed by generous grants and capital allowances, have recently being enjoying &ldquo;tax holidays&rdquo; in Ireland. The initial start up attraction for foreign companies coming to Ireland included such financial incentives as</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" />&ldquo;tax relief on manufacturing profits through 31 December, 2000.</P>
    <P>repatriation of tax-free profits without restriction.</P>
    <P>a 100 per cent tax depreciation.</P>
    <P>But US multinationals today find that staggering employers liability insurance premiums in Ireland are eroding the profits generated by favoured tax treatment. With the average premium estimated at 1.5 per cent of a company's payroll, there is a little doubt that the cost of employers' liability insurance has become a burden for manufacturing companies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why does employers' liability insurance cost so much in the Emerald Isle?</P>
    <P>Blame is usually placed on court awards for on the job injuries, now frequently called &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; rather than compensation. Although certainly a major factor high compensation awards cannot be cited as the only reason for the present predicament.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has encouraged foreign investment to create new jobs in Ireland and to develop its unskilled industrial infrastructure. As an offset financial incentives granted to foreign investors included 100 per cent training grants. But US multinationals, as well as other foreign investors, could not be expected to transplant urban habits in rural Ireland without some friction.</P>
    <P>The friction, in this instance, came from employees. It is general knowledge that common law liability arises from the obligation that each person has to exercise care in his actions so that he does not cause bodily injury or damage to others. In common law, employees are entitled to damages only if an accident was caused by an employer's personal negligence. A worker has no claim against an employer merely because he met with an accident in his employment.</P>
    <P>But as trade unions increased in <Col N="1416" /> strength, the notion of personal liability diminished. The employee credo became &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; or &ldquo;if I get hurt somebody has to pay.&rdquo; One successful claim in a large company often spawned a number of similar claims.</P>
    <P>The bureaucratic structure of the unions has helped to centralise the legal process in Ireland. One solicitor often facilitates a large amount of minor claims by having them in one job lot. This tends to encourage small claims and it is often alleged that workers deliberately inflict minor injuries on themselves to jump on this bandwagon. Employers risk a strike by workers if they dismiss an employee that is suspected of injuring himself deliberately.</P>
    <P>The fault of the system, however, does not lie solely with the worker.</P>
    <P>Another major reason for high employers liability insurance premiums is the fact that employers in Ireland are not as attuned as US employers to health and safety loss control procedures.</P>
    <P>Most companies are in business to make profits not to be healthy and safe. Records show that the vast majority of work accidents in Ireland result from a failure to guard machines, slips, trips, falls and internal transport incidents. These accidents occur in Ireland with greater frequency, and although preventive measures are well known they are not always instituted.</P>
    <P>While many US multinational subsidiaries in Ireland follow health and safety guidelines strictly, a large number of managers and employers in Ireland fail to discharge their legal duties. This failure which leaves a law of change as the only barrier between employees and an accident, adds to high frequency claims experience and helps to drive up insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Only 20% of Irish employees are covered by existing statutory laws that prescribe legal standards for employers. But all employers in Ireland &mdash; including those not covered by general statutory legislation &mdash; are subject to common law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> Common law underpins the rights of workers to a healthy and safe workplace. Unfortunately, common law principles are often used by employees to support a claim &ldquo;after the fact&rdquo; rather than by employers as a code of good practice in order to avoid accidents.</P>
    <P>In common law, all employers in Ireland must provide their employees with:</P>
    <P>A safe system of work.</P>
    <P>Safe plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>Competent fellow employees.</P>
    <P>The broadest of employers' common law duties is a safe working place. This duty encompasses a proper instruction, effective supervision and safe work methods. Employers must ensure that the place of work is safe and that employees are afforded a safe means of access and egress.</P>
    <P>The common law duty of safe plants and equipment obliges an employer to provide and maintain proper machinery, plant appliances and works needed to do the job.</P>
    <P>The main body of legislation in Ireland, the Safety in Industry Acts of 1935 and 1980, imposes liability on the employer for securing the health, safety and welfare of employees. The laws also allow for criminal liability of managers.</P>
    <P>An employer's duty under the Acts include training employees, guarding machinery, lighting, ventilation and protection against falls, chemicals exposures and noise. The laws also require an employer to establish a safety committee.</P>
    <P>In addition, the 1980 Act obligates an employer to draw up a safety statement, detailing the provisions made by the company to safeguard the safety and health of the workforce, the extent of cooperation required from employees, the availability of safety training facilities and the measures taken to guard against specific hazards that are present in the workplace. When a company maintains a safety <Col N="1418" /> officer the statement must also detail his duties.</P>
    <P>Complying with this aspect of the law makes employers, insurers and corporate legal counsel nervous that the statements may serve as a written blueprint for employees who sue for negligence.</P>
    <P>Common law also requires an employer to select properly skilled people to manage and superintend the business. If employees are not judged competent the employer can be held vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of any employee where they result in injury of another worker. But regardless of how well trained or safety conscious a worker may be, accidents will happen.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that the human failure rate for routine production operations is about one in 1,000 and rises to one in 100 for workers in stressful conditions. As these figures indicate, employers would be wise to emphasise the &ldquo;safety place&rdquo; approach to claims control rather than rely on a &ldquo;safe person&rdquo; approach.</P>
    <P>While these measures might be construed as loss-control procedures, they are often the cause of high-liability claims experience.</P>
    <P>When courts are left to define negligence, it is not sufficient for employers to try to fit machines with guards, instruct the workers in their use and have supervisors watching to prevent violations. Instead the legal doctrine of the unsafe system of work has resulted in negligence &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; for accidents that are truly incidental to the nature of an employee's work.</P>
    <P>In most European Economic Community countries, these occurrences would be compensated by the State as social welfare accidents, rather than through an employer's liability insurer.</P>
    <P>However unlike other EEC member countries, compensation for High Court claims in Ireland is still assessed by a jury. Lesser cases are adjudicated in Circuit Court without jury involvement and awards are limited.</P>
    <P>Understandably, most claimants <Col N="1419" /> prefer to have cases tried in the High Courts, since the unpredictability of a jury usually means greater compensation.</P>
    <P>Insurers, therefore, often settle small cases out of court because they fear big jury awards, although cases that could potentially result in large awards are usually litigated.</P>
    <P>In the long-term view, however, insurers will probably be forced to litigate all cases in the hope of dissuading smaller claimants from bringing suit. While this may appear to be a minor solution, huge defence costs &mdash; usually provided outside of the policy limits &mdash; will undoubtedly keep premiums high. Policy holders can expect the problem to be compounded by the decreased number of insurers willing to write employers' liability insurance in Ireland. Increased insurance premiums hurt business because they add to the cost of goods produced in Ireland, making those goods uncompetitive with those other EEC member countries.</P>
    <P>But the insurance industry cannot be expected to singlehandedly change an inefficient system. Neither can employers.</P>
    <P>As is true in the United States, the court system needs to be changed. A proposal to abolish the jury system is being contemplated by the Irish Government but this is not a presentday solution.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world no employees would suffer on-the-job-injuries, insurers would pay no claims and employers would not have to pay liability insurance premiums. In the real world, however, all an employer can control is frequency and severity of accidents.</P>
    <P>On-the-job safety is the responsibility of both management and workers, although management should play a major role. Do remedies cost money? Yes, they do. Will the remedies save money? Yes, they certainly can. Why not look into what your subsidiary can do to help the employers liability insurance crisis in Ireland?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> Remember the only thing worse than a staggering employers' liability premium is no coverage at all.</P>
    <P>That document showing the map of Ireland and the bandage across it is being read throughout the United States by business people, especially people interested in export or going overseas to establish businesses. It is a sad reflection on Ireland and it might be one of the causes that will slow down people coming to this country and it should be taken very seriously. I will leave a copy of it with the Minister later.</P>
    <P>I will give a few examples of our employers liability in Ireland. Small contractors pay 20 per cent of the total wages bill for their employers liability insurance. Shops paid 5 per cent. This 5 per cent has increased by 30 per cent per annum compounded over the last three years. Cover is often not available and many risks are no longer covered. The minimum premiums are becoming more common, especially with the very big insurance people, Lloyds. Minimum premiums are not refundable so that if a person takes out an insurance policy for X number of pounds to cover something for 12 months and if it fails for some reason the balance of the cover is not refunded. It is not refundable and this is becoming a common practice.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the minimum premium is that the banks do not finance it. The banks are not charitable institutions; they are not in competition with the St. Vincent de Paul or the credit unions; they have to account for their money to their shareholders and they are not going to finance something where there is no refund or no equity in the event of it failing. If they finance a car or a machine and the company fails, at least they have collateral; they can recover the machine and they will get something out of it but with the minimum insurance premiums they will get nothing.</P>
    <P>A high proportion of business using the premium plans find these are becoming more expensive as a result of high interest rates. There is a new thing now with some insurance companies and one in particular &mdash;&ldquo;There is no problem <Col N="1421" /> about your insurance premium; you can pay it over 12 months in monthly payments.&rdquo; That is grand when you get it, but when you find at the end of the year that your insurance has gone up by another 30 per cent &mdash; the usual rate is about 2½ per cent per month &mdash; then your insurance becomes a dear insurance. People who have not got the capital at the beginning to pay out for insurance find it very handy to use this scheme, but they find it very expensive.</P>
    <P>Fire and theft is now a problem because malicious damage cover is to be removed. When the malicious injury and malicious damage cover is removed the estimated cost is 20 per cent upon existing premiums and that is only for a start because the insurance companies will find out that they pay a lot of malicious injury claims and pay a lot of frivolous claims. In the old days it was a pain in the back, but there is a modern one now which is whiplash: if the car stops suddenly one gets whiplash and one can get about £10,000 compensation because the company do not want the expense of going to court.</P>
    <P>The city centre is in the news a lot these days as it was a couple of years ago. Cover is not available without value connections and of course value connections mean that somebody who has a premises in the city must supply supporting business. That can be done through a multinational or a company that is nationwide and can transfer costs from one place to another and the company can average out give cover, but somebody who has a business in the city centre only cannot get cover. The city centre does not have to be Sheriff Street and the back of O'Connell Street: it has extended to Molesworth Street and on to Duke Street.</P>
    <P>I know of a case of a shop that had been insured for the last eight years with a certain company and certain requirements were made each year by way of safety, screens and walls and so on, and these were always complied with. There was never a break-in in these premises and a claim was never made but the insurance company decided they would not cover it any more. After a long battle with the solicitors they decided to cover <Col N="1422" /> the premises but the premium was five times what it had been and they gave no reason for it. Extra conditions applied also. Fortunately, the person was going to become his own insurer because he could not pay the premium but another insurance friend told him that he could get cover from another company which he did and he got it at the old rate and no restrictions were put on it. So, the insurance companies are not consistent. While I do not expect them to take on bad risks where they have no chance, I think they should take reasonable risks because that is what they are there for and that is what the business is all about.</P>
    <P>Capital liability is really a rip-off especially when exporting to the United States. A typical example of that is pharmaceuticals. The insurance premiums on exports of pharmaceuticals to the States is nearly equal to the amount of money they get for the pharmaceuticals. People had to stop exporting or, where they have good connections and fairly safe travel arrangements, they export without any insurance cover and become their own insurers.</P>
    <P>Another problem which exists in Dublin &mdash; and people are inclined to deny this &mdash; is the protection racket. When I raised the question of the protection racket in Dublin at the small businesses committee meeting one insurance company representative said in a chat with me afterwards that he could not admit that and he would not admit it, but he would admit it to me; if I wanted to quote him afterwards he would deny that he ever said it to me. I said: &ldquo;I will not quote you but I will quote the case&rdquo;. He said that they insure a number of businesses, particularly pubs where so much has to be paid out every week to gangs to give these premises protection against raids, in other words, to give them protection against these same gangs raiding them, that people have gone out of business and that is a very dangerous situation. Sometimes protection money has to be paid to a number of gangs. The Garda have enough of problems without this but it is a problem that will have to be looked <Col N="1423" /> into and it is very serious.</P>
    <P>Another insurance problem &mdash; I wouldn't call it an insurance racket &mdash; relates to travel insurance where you book your holidays and some companies, even though you have your own insurance, or even if you do not want insurance and are prepared to be your own insurer, insist on you taking out this insurance. You pay a high premium for it but then, to add insult to injury, when there is a claim on these insurances they want to deny the liability and they put people to very much trouble. I know a number of travellers who had genuine claims, who submitted the documents and were told these were the wrong forms although they got them from the insurance companies. Then when they completed the second set of forms these &ldquo;got lost&rdquo; and people got fed up and did not pursue their claims. That suited the insurance companies. It was a very easy solution for the companies. That is another rip-off and it should be investigated. When a person wants to travel and they go out with a company if they pay their insurance they should get compensation if they have a claim.</P>
    <P>There was a recent case of a person flying out of Dublin with Aer Lingus. When they were loading the plane that person's luggage was taken aboard. They were going to Portugal for a golf outing. When they arrived in London there was a telex before them awaiting the person concerned from Aer Lingus to say that the luggage was damaged and to get it seen to by the other carrier which was British Airways who were taking it on from there. British Airways came along and bandaged up the baggage as best they could. These people continued on to Portugal and had their holiday. When they came home they put in a claim to Aer Lingus who said they never got the claim &mdash; even though they had notified the owner that the accident had occurred in their own plane. Apparently, two separate departments did not communicate with one another. The person tried on a number of occasions to get money from Aer Lingus who kept on passing the buck.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> Now legal action is being taken. That is not good enough. If small companies do things like that we talk about back lane traders and the black economy but when you have the people flying the green bird doing it, it is a different story.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan referred to two insurance companies. He said there were two companies who offered cheap insurance and because of that they went out of business; if they wanted to stay in business they could not give cheap insurance. The truth is that one of the insurance companies, the PMPA &mdash; the old PMPA &mdash; went out of business not because of the insurance business but because of their other activities. They had something in the region of 30 garages in the country and they were the only insurance company in Ireland or the UK who ever decided to have garages to do their own work. The garages lost them buckets of money. Then they had their Friendly Society, the PMPS, where people invested their money. One man came from England and he put in £35,000, because he had sold his house and he wanted to build another one. When he came to build the other house he went to draw out his money and they told him: &ldquo;Wait until the house is built and we will give you a bridging loan in the meantime&rdquo;. He said: &ldquo;All right&rdquo;. They said: &ldquo;You will gain on the interest&rdquo;. Then they came back and said: &ldquo;We cannot give you a bridging loan but you go to the bank and get that&rdquo;. He took their advice and got the bridging loan. The PMPS went &ldquo;burst&rdquo; and now he has two loans to pay. He lost his £35,000 and he has to pay back the money he got and he will probably be paying it back for the rest of his life. That is one of the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The other insurance company was the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. That insurance company lost money. In their insurance offices in Ireland they were doing all right: they were making money but they had a couple of branches across the water one of them in London and it got to be known as the &ldquo;soft touch&rdquo; insurance company where anybody who had any kind of a risk could go in and get <Col N="1425" /> insurance. The result was that they paid out a fortune and then they had to go &ldquo;burst&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have to restore the balance in insurance for business. The cost of insurance should be a business cost like any other. In recent years too many other factors have come into play. We have to get rid of these factors and get back to the simple issue of liability insurance itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I am very much aware that many of the small businesses in this country no longer can afford the cost of public liability insurance or the cost of employer's liability insurance. Many of them have no insurance at all. Others are reducing their sums insured for fire or are reducing their indemnities in regard to public liability. If there is a fire or an employee is injured and if there is a claim under the public liability section, in that situation it is extremely serious for the business concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister when speaking on the other order referred to the fact that banks and credit unions are not charitable organisations and that is correct. Neither are the insurance companies. If they do not make a profit, whether on the writing side, on the investment side or on the general trading side &mdash; which is a combination of both &mdash; and if they continue to make huge underwriting losses, that is reflected in the premiums. How to solve the problem is the concern of insurance companies, traders, legislators and all of us. I realise that in many cases insurance cover is not available. In many industries, in many trades and in many of our cities and towns the availability of cover is a problem and for the small businesses that in itself is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report before us the Federated Union of Employers made the point that from 1982 to 1984 the increase in employers' liability premiums was, on average, an increase of 280 per cent; inflation over the same period rose 23.9 per cent. Some individual employers experienced increases of between 300 and 400 per cent. That is from a survey of the FUE members. In the construction industry <Col N="1426" /> there are many small businesses of the kind we are talking about in this report and they are experiencing extreme difficulty in regard to employers' and public liability insurance. Any of the allied traders such as joinery, find it almost impossible to get the cover they should have.</P>
    <P>I was recently asked to arrange insurance for a small builder and I tried six or eight companies before finally getting one quotation for a minimum premium of £2,500 for employers' liability and £1,000 for public liability. I was lucky to get cover at all. That is the market at the moment. It has become extremely difficult to arrange insurance of that type where there is public liability and employers' liability involved. The rates continue to increase all the time.</P>
    <P>Last year I came across a small light engineering business, an employer with one employee and I was lucky to arrange a cover for him for public liability and employers' liability for £500 which I thought was lovely. This year the company for the same risk without any claims are looking for a premium for £2,600. That has been the scene, it is going on and on and every excuse is being made. We know that huge claims are being made. Obviously that is reflected in the premiums.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to insurance as well that may not be fully touched on in the report. It is away from the small industry idea but I will mention it anyway. In my home town there is a football pitch owned by the AFC. Their public liability in 1983 was £250, in 1984 it was £600, in 1985, £5,000 was required and the premium was subsequently reduced, with an excess of £500, to £3,500. This year they are looking for £4,500. It is the same risk with no claims. That is escalating. The reason they give is that they are caught for the re-insurance and it is causing problems for them. This is not touched on very much in the report. Re-insurance is playing a major role. The Bradford fire and the fire at the national stadium in Brussels is being attributed in some way to the high cost of public liability insurance in this <Col N="1427" /> country as well, not just the bad claims experience and other problems. That is another factor we have to contend with.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £3,500 premium I mentioned, on top of that you have to put Government levies which amount to £100. That 1 per cent and the other 2 per cent as a result of the collapse of PMPA is also contributing to increased premiums right across the board. You have the ordinary fire premium paid by the person in receipt of a pension who has a small fire policy, who has his house insured but who is paying extra money for something he had no say in. The PMPA meant nothing to him yet he has to pay through the nose for that situation. That is very unfair.</P>
    <P>The committee decided to investigate a number of areas. It was topical for them to deal with the problem of small industries. They deal specifically with the public liability, employers' liability, professional negligence and with burglary and the fire side of it. There are other areas we could talk about like cash in transit but they are the ones we feel are causing real problems for small industries.</P>
    <P>The failure to renew premiums because of high costs has been mentioned. The report refers to the reduced cover which is happening on a very regular basis. This is a pity because obviously the less cover you have in a claim the less you can recover. Page 8 refers to motor insurance, I do not want to comment very much on motor insurance except to say that for the first time in a long period insurance companies are out canvassing for motor insurance. They see it as a paying proposition in regard to the private car. Fortunately they are not as helpful in regard to the commercial side of it, the vans and the big lorries. I know of one case where a person engaged in some quarrying and working for people like Roadstone found it extremely difficult to get cover. While the motor insurance companies are out looking for business compared to a few years ago when they did not want to know about it, it is significant to mention that there is at least <Col N="1428" /> an improvement there. We should also, on the other hand, make the point that commercial vehicles seem to be still an area they do not want for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>The report refers on page 31 to the inner city problems. The Garda Commissioner's report on crime clearly illustrates what is happening. In 1978 there were 18,923 burglaries and in 1984, six years later, that had increased to nearly double that figure, to 35,228. In regard to arson and malicious damage, the figure in 1978 was 1,009, in 1984 it was 2,655. An increase of that size in the level of crime against property has clear insurance implications. This is something the companies have recognised. In fact, over the years in the householders' insurance, the rates increased dramatically from what would have been £2.50 per £1,000 to as high as £8.50 per £1,000 in the contents area. While I believe there has been a levelling off in the last year or two, it continues to be a problem. Indeed, the inner city in particular and some of the large areas are described in the report as no-go areas.</P>
    <P>The problem of malicious damage insurance and the elimination of that since July of last year will have implications for the insurance industry because as we all know there are certain rights under an insurance policy, subrogation rights, whereby if they can claim from a local authority under malicious injuries claims, they will do so. That is no longer there now except in the case of riot or perhaps some form of political activity. That, too, will increase the cost of insurance in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>The state of non-life insurance industry in this country is not at all strong. The underwriting losses have increased from £9 million in 1979 to £97 million in 1983. Indeed, the investments of the non-life companies exceed, £1,000 million. That is the reserves and the cashflow, the only area where companies can invest and hope that if they have an underwriting loss the investment situation will allow a levelling off or a general overall trading profit. That has happened in many cases but we know from the reports that in <Col N="1429" /> some companies it did not happen all of the time. We have the combination for some companies of increased premiums and huge losses. That has not helped them and has not helped the solvency margin of some non-life insurers.</P>
    <P>I support many of the findings of the committee. Section 2.2.4 which refers to the links with the occupational injuries benefit scheme was referred to by Senator Daly. In a way what he was saying was correct. Employees should be insured under the Occupational Injuries Act and they should also be insured at common law liability. Even though a claim ought to be an occupational injuries claim because it has set benefits the claim is usually not dealt with in that way. The solicitors tend to make every claim a common law claim. The result is that they go through the courts and settlements are made before the court or in the court itself. Even though they ought to be occupational claims dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare, the opposite in fact is what happens.</P>
    <P>Section 2.6.4 talks about the whole area of High Court judges and the raising of Circuit and District Court limits. I welcome that. Legislation ought to be introduced to raise the limits for awards in the lower courts &mdash; from £2,500 to £5,000 in the District Court, and from £15,000 to £30,000 in the Circuit Court. If that were done it would expedite the hearings and would reduce the delays associated with High Court hearings.</P>
    <P>Section 2.7 shows concern at complaints suggesting that property owners could be sued successfully for negligence arising out of accidental damage and injuries to trespassers. I welcome a review of the law of tort with a view to imposing strict liability on the trespasser. I can recall a claim some years ago where young lads broke into the abattoir of Athlone Urban District Council. They took away the humane killer and some bullets, and in play-acting subsequently a young lad lost an eye. He made a claim against the Urban District council and was successful for a figure of £3,500. A very common type of claim is where you have a well run pub. From time to time <Col N="1430" /> people might drink too much. There might be a row and glass is broken and people are injured. Claims of that kind are brought against the owners of the pub and on the ground that there was not sufficient care taken in management and control generally of the pub. Unfortunately claims of that kind succeed. I would welcome a review of that problem.</P>
    <P>The report refers to educational qualifications of insurance brokers. They make the point that, while acknowledging the contention of the insurance brokers that insurance is becoming an increasingly complex and specialised area, they were struck by the lack of formal minimal education requirements for insurance broking. I have to make the point that, in general, insurance brokers in Ireland are members of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Ireland, many of them have ACII and FCII degrees and generally have a very good knowledge, practical as well as educational, of the insurance industry. If there is to be any further education it should be through the Chartered Insurance Institute who are the educational wing of the industry. I am sure they would be only too happy to help in arranging courses throughout the country if requested.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the proposed insurance brokers council. That is something I would welcome but, unfortunately, it appears that it will not happen. We now have an insurance Bill which sets down clear guidelines for insurance brokers and agents and a definition of both. It will cost an insurance broker a lot of money to retain his status as an insurance broker because he will have to have a consumer bond of £100,000. He will have to be a member of either NEVA or of the Corporation of Insurance Brokers which will cost him a fee of £x and he will need a professional indemnity bond. Before he writes one bit of business the insurance broker will have to spend £12,000, £14,000 or £15,000 and for bigger brokers the figures are much in excess of that amount. This will present problems in the future for insurance brokers.</P>
    <P>We could talk at length about what <Col N="1431" /> we can do about the insurance industry. Obviously the idea of the elimination of trial by jury whether it is a jury with advice from the judge, or what is proposed in the Bill, should help to stabilise premiums. At the moment if a case goes to the High Court, the jury decide on the amount of the award, which in itself is OK, but I have seen many cases where they have ignored the liability aspect. The idea now is to run to the High Court, get to the jury and get an award whether you are at fault or not. Any improvement in that situation is welcome and should reduce premiums with benefits for small industries and for all of us.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to work towards getting realistic premiums on the liability side, the fire side and on all aspects of our insurance. Failure to get cover at realistic premiums will clearly add to the unemployment queues in the future. We could talk about the report for a long time. In general it gives food for thought. I should like to congratulate the chairman of that committee, Deputy Yates, Senator Lynch and all who acted on it on the good work they did in producing this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make a brief contribution on this motion. The report is very comprehensive, I should like to pay tribute to the chairman and all the members of the Joint committee. As Senator Fallon said, it gives at least food for thought. We hope something positive will come from it. It seemed to me on a few occasions that perhaps the members of the committee were not in close touch with reality. I recall that in a previous report some suggestions were made on how small firms might get State business. Indeed it looks on the surface as if this is something any firm could hope to achieve. I know about six cases where people were doing work for the State and gave it up because it was impossible to get paid on time. When the account was due there was always some delay. When they wrote in again they might be asked to send in a copy invoice or they might <Col N="1432" /> not be able to speak to whoever was in charge of the section. I know people who could get work from the State but who decided not to take it as it was costing them money.</P>
      <P>This report is unrealistic in some respects. It is a difficult area. I am not minimising the work of the committee on that account. Senator Eoin Ryan brought us down to earth with his contribution. He made the case of the 36 insurance firms, 30 of them foreign-based, only six are native. It is a very competitive market; the firms are anxious to get all the insurance possible and the rates are as competitive as they can be.</P>
      <P>In the Construction of Irish Industry newsletter, Vol. 45, No. 9 of 1 July 1986 there is an article on product liability in the United States. The first paragraph is very relevant and states:</P>
      <P>In the United States, if a person suffers personal injury outside his place of employment and seeks to be compensated, his lawyer will advise him to establish what product or products were involved. These products will then be examined for any shortcomings that could be considered a defect. A defect could be the failure to warn of the likelihood of that particular accident arising, the possible consequences, or means of dealing with the problem should it arise. If such a defect is discovered, the injured party can then take action against virtually anybody in the chain of supply of that product or these products to him. Should the matter go to law the attitude of the court will be that if the product did not exist that accident might not have occurred. Damages for injury, pain and suffering, loss of earnings and future medical expenses can be awarded to the claimant in such amounts as to fully compensate the claimant for the damage suffered or to be suffered as a result of the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same situation applies here. I knew of a situation in the United Kingdom about ten years ago where a small farmer got a contractor to lay a yard for him. He <Col N="1433" /> was supposed to lay a thickness of six inches of concrete, but the contractor only laid two or three inches and there was a subsequent action. The contractor had disappeared and the farmer took the action against the man who supplied the concrete and won the case. That situation applies here.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon instanced a number of cases with regard to the public liability and trespass. This is an area where something should be done. The report states:</P>
    <P>We were concerned about complaints suggesting that property owners could be successfully sued for negligence arising out of accidental injuries to trespassers. We recommend that the Department of Justice review the law of tort with a view to imposing strict liability on the trespasser.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a farmer was sued because a trespasser had broken a leg on ground which was uneven. It would seem to any normal individual that the farmer should not be liable for someone who trespassed on his land. Nevertheless, the trespasser won the case and got compensation. This was not a situation where, for example, there was some right to enter the land. I could visualise that if there was an ancient monument but this farmer owned the land, the trespasser was injured and he got compensation. Clearly that is wrong and if something positive comes out of the report in that regard it would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>With regard to city and county development plans, there is a recommendation that all local authorities amend their development plans to take account of the specialised security needs of firms in high risks areas and that firms be exempted from planning fees when seeking planning permission for security measures. I endorse that so far as is practicable and in so far as it is possible to help but I am not sure what can be done or what kind of planning permission is envisaged. Perhaps it would be a case of erecting suitable shutters, which is frowned on from the aesthetic point of view. Perhaps the committee should have been more specific. The idea behind the <Col N="1434" /> suggestion is a good one and should be followed up.</P>
    <P>Some percentages are given with regard to the increases in employment. The Federated Union of Employers stated that increases in their area with regard to employers' liability premiums were an average of 280 per cent and in some instances it was between 300 and 400 per cent of an increase. Irish Caravans Council Limited, an important industry with regard to tourism, experienced increases as high as 400 per cent in the past two or three years. The Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland state that there was an increase of 50 per cent for professional indemnity insurance and many firms will have experienced an increase of twice that amount of 100 per cent. RGDATA stated that the current premium increases were from 200 to 1,000 per cent for property insurance. This is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>The committee were hampered by the lack of statistical data. The report states:</P>
    <P>The scale of the premium rate increases notified to the committee by individual firms and trade associations is not reflected in the official figures for insurance companies provided by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the information given in the blue book which sets out this information is not comprehensive and up-to-date. How could the committee come up with a worthwhile report on the basis of that information? The report goes on to state that one of the problems encountered by the committee in compiling the report was the lack of a statistical data base.</P>

      <P>Page 5 of the report. They had no proper statistical base with regard to the problems of insurance for small businesses. Much of the information <Col N="1435" /> received by the committee from trade associations is in the form of research based on complaints by members. It would be almost impossible to provide a proper report on that basis. They said the nature and range of the complaints to the committee were so emphatic and so widespread that the adequacy of the monitoring arrangements of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the insurance industry and trade associations must be called into question. That is a serious complaint. Something should be done about this situation.</P>
      <P>In compiling a report of this kind on such an important matter, so essential for the industrial life of Ireland, the committee had to rely on secondhand information. This problem with regard to the availability of insurance is a serious drawback to people starting up their own business, particularly people under 25 years. The IDA state that the inability to obtain insurance at reasonable rates increases the risks inherent in start-ups. In the case of employers' liability, it can prove to be a disincentive to expansion of employment. When they talk about reasonable rates I am sure they mean low rates. Anything that can be done to lower the rates should be done. I do not have time to deal with that area. When we talk about reasonable rates, we are talking in terms of firms making a reasonable profit and of the commitment of firms. We are talking about a very wide area.</P>
      <P>Urban decline is considered in the report. This is a very important area, particularly with regard to the Bills which have gone through this House recently. We are told that an inability to obtain property insurance has forced some firms to accept the protection of criminal elements. I would like to have seen this developed in some detail. It is something we are all aware of through the media, television in particular. I am not sure how widespread or how great a problem it is but it is a very unfortunate problem and one which I would have liked to hear spelled out in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> The inability to obtain insurance at an affordable rate must militate against the success of the urban renewal programmes announced by the Government. A 74-page booklet which is very good is available with regard to urban renewal. It would be unfortunate if the whole question of urban renewal was interfered with because of that element. Perhaps the Minister would look in detail at this problem.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is dealt with in the report. This is an area in which I have some knowledge. It has a bad image with regard to accidents. The report tells us that it is quite normal for a small contractor to pay out £6,000 or £7,000 for liability insurance before ever going on to a site. This is true. It is an area which is prone to accidents. I do not know why this is because it is an area that is covered by the Factories Acts and there is very close supervision by the Department. An inspector visits sites throughout the country. Co-operating with the requirements costs the contractors a considerable amount of money and pushes up costs. By and large the situation is far different from what it was many years ago when some firms were carrying on on shoestring. It is difficult to understand why accidents still occur and why costs are so heavy. Local authorities insist, as the report says, on a high level of cover and very rightly so. This makes it extremely difficult for small contractors to get work with them. I know of one contractor who went out of business because of accidents and his insurance premium was so high he could not pay it. The same applies with regard to local authorities getting contractors. Perhaps the best firms are not able to get employment precisely because they are not able to pay the high premiums.</P>
    <P>With regard to insurance brokers, Senator Fallon dealt with this very adequately. I agree that they perform a very important role. Most insurance is placed through brokers. I remember many years ago it was possible to pay a broker in instalments. I do think this is possible now. When I first drove a car that is the way my insurance was paid &mdash;<Col N="1437" /> in dribs and drabs. The broker is a very important person. He can place the insurance with the proper firm. I welcome the Bill that has been introduced with regard to brokers. I am sure it will result in tightening up the regulations. Senator Fallon said that brokers at present have to pass an examination. Most of them belong to a professional body and there can be no complaints with most of them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extra cost through having a number of lawyers involved, I will make a brief reference. The legal representation system is covered in great detail. With regard to the High Court action, apparently generally there are two senior counsels, one junior counsel and one solicitor. Therefore, eight lawyers participate in each action. There is so much money at stake that it pays to have all these people involved. It has been estimated that legal costs in Ireland represent between 15 and 20 per cent of claims paid or roughly twice the British level. Leaving aside the British level 15 to 20 per cent would not seem too high having regard to the fact that that also includes 25 per cent VAT and also that not all cases are won.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to the fees of expert witnesses. In my experience most of the costs for legal witnesses arise because of the long time involved. Anybody who has ever been a witness at a court will realise that time means nothing &mdash; one must be there for many days, perhaps to give evidence for ten minutes. I am sure something could be done to get evidence in some other way to curtail that time because the law is expensive. It would be interesting to know how many cases go that far and indeed how many cases start because of the input from the lawyers suggesting that there may be some compensation available. I am not saying that is wrong. I would like to see the joint committee addressing the situation we have at present where lawyers are in what you might call two grades. I know there are reasons for this, for example, under this present system it is easier to specialise but it would be reasonable <Col N="1438" /> that lawyers might not be divided into two classes. I am surprised to some extent that the committee did not allude to that in some way. This should be looked at as a means of bringing down the costs.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to deal with but most of them have been covered. Finally, I would like to refer to one aspect which relates to an excess claims scheme. The committee state that the insurance industry should actively examine the scope for introducing an excess claims scheme such as already exists in other types of insurance cover, for example, comprehensive motor policy, that the principle here is that all insurance claims under a single policy and up to a certain predetermined level for year of cover be settled by the policyholder and not the insurance company and cover and that this predetermined level should be set at £1,000. This should be looked at.</P>
    <P>In spite of my few criticisms &mdash; as a member of a joint committee I know that time and hard work are involved &mdash; I congratulate the chairman and the members on their report and hope it will have some effect and fairly immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to join with Senator Fitzsimons in congratulating the committee on their work generally on the problems of small business and, in particular, on this report on the insurance problems of small businesses. It is a very wide ranging report. They have done a useful job both in assembling the various problems people are meeting and in putting forward positive suggestions as to how we might set about tackling the cost and other problems in the insurance market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the background to discussing employers' and public liability it is important to bear in mind the claims experience of insurance companies dealing with this sort of liability in recent years. There is very substantial underwriting loss at present in writing this sort of business. In 1980 the underwriting loss as a percentage <Col N="1439" /> of premium income was moderate enough at 27 per cent, but it rose dramatically to about 62 per cent of premium income in 1983. That was a peak and we have gradually seen the underwriting loss experience improve in the following years. It is back down to well under 50 per cent in 1986.</P>
    <P>However, there is still a very significant underwriting loss on this business. In absolute figures the underwriting loss in 1985, excluding the ICI, was £34 million. What lies behind these figures is obviously, as many Members said, the period 1982-83 when there was a very competitive scene in the insurance industry and very few increases in premium. That has changed dramatically since 1983 and the improvement in the loss experience is due in large measure to hectic increases in premium.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise fully the problem this is causing for small business. Many people in the course of their contribution, including Senator Fitzsimons, commented on the lack of precise statistical information available to us on the whole issue of employer and public liability. I have to acknowledge this is a problem we face. It stems understandably enough from the fact that the Department saw themselves mainly as a supervisory body and their concern was with solvency and not so much with the other issues in the past. We are now having to confront much more seriously the whole issue of cost and availability. I sought to get much more detailed statistical information from the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another difficulty in quoting any average figure or figures about cost of employers' liability in that it varies immensely from one trade to another. The figure quoted in the report by the CAII was 2½ per cent as an average figure and Senator Daly quoted a lower figure of 1½ per cent from an article. These figures are subject to a wide margin of error because they depend on what sample is taken. Many Senators referred to the construction industry where you are talking about much more hefty levels of employers' liability. There is not a <Col N="1440" /> book rate of employers' liability applied. Each individual case is treated on its own merits. It is more difficult in that way to get a feel for the average costs and other statistics we need.</P>
    <P>Similarly on availability, we do not have great information on how many people are being turned away or having difficulty in getting employer liability cover. We have a system in the Department for receiving complaints on that topic. In 1985 the figure of complaints was about 200 up on previous years. That figure does not sound very large but as I said it is not compulsory to have liability insurance and many people finding problems with the availability do not complain to the Department. The Government recognise the problems of cost and availability. I welcome the constructive recommendation put forward in this report.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the topics raised in the report. The first issue recommendations were made on was the whole issue of customer relations. I fully accept the main thrust of the committee's recommendation in this area that insurance companies should improve customer relations and publish suitable information booklets. I will undertake further discussions with the insurance industry to try to improve matters in this area. All too often people do not know precisely the implication of the insurance contracts they have written and that often causes immense difficulty. The more people are aware of precisely what cover they have, and in what circumstances they are covered, the better.</P>
    <P>The question of the Government instituting a code of conduct if the insurance industry do not implement the committee's recommendations has some merit particularly if it resulted in the insurance industry dealing fairly and equitably with consumer complaints. The position at present is that by default on the part of the insurance industry, my Department find themselves in the position of protagonists on the part of the aggrieved consumer. The suggested code of conduct could provide the mechanism for dealing with declined cases or cases <Col N="1441" /> involving excessive loadings or premia. The insurance industry recognise that they have a poor overall image. One of the important objectives of the Irish Insurance Industry Federation is to improve the industry's standing with the public. The implementation of measures to attain this objective is now a top priority with the Insurance Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>The committee's major second recommendation is on the question of an incentive scheme. The committee recommended that an incentive scheme should be introduced whereby insurance premia for small industry should reflect both their safety and claim record and their efforts in the risk management area. I am very taken with this proposal. I intend to take this up with the insurance industry to see what could be achieved in the way of rewards in the form of premia reductions for satisfactory improvements in risk management. The insurance industry take account of safety and claims records in their formation of premia. That aspect of the recommendation is not entirely new. I will pursue the other issue of giving people who are undertaking safety improvements some bonus. It is more difficult in the case of employers' liability than, say, in something like motor insurance because of the specific tailor-made type of contracts of insurance drawn up between the insured and the insurers.</P>
    <P>The other interesting recommendation made is on the question of excess claims scheme. This was referred to by Senator Fitzsimons in his closing remarks. In recent years there has been increasing pressure for the introduction of excesses under liability policies and this is reflected in the joint committee's recommendation. I understand the insurance industry have been prepared to meet the needs of individual clients in suitable cases in this regard. It must be recognised, however, that excesses are only practical if the policyholder has the resources to handle claims under the agreed excess. It has obvious implications for innocent victims if the firm cannot pay or does not pay claims lodged below <Col N="1442" /> the agreed excess. The Senator has taken a realistic view in setting the figure at £1,000. The question of excess is worthy of looking at. It must be said that, where the insurer and the policyholder are already able to negotiate on this issue, it may not be desirable that we look for a blanket requirement that exessses be used. We will have to use our judgment as to whether the existing system where people can negotiate such an excess is adequate or whether we need to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The compulsory data base was another major recommendation. The committee called for a mandatory requirement that insurance companies should keep proper statistical information on the number and cost of claims in each category of operation and for each trade and that the data base should extend to applications refused and existing customers delisted, together with reasons.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier I recognise deficiencies in the data available and I have taken steps to improve this. As you know the Motor Insurance Advisory Board are doing some very detailed work for the Department to improve the statistical base in relation to the motor insurance industry. Depending on what information we receive from that we hope to extend it to other areas of liability if it is appropriate. However, I have some doubts about a mandatory data base of consumer related information. Unless it could be shown that the benefits from it would be worth while it would be quite a considerable burden to keep such data. Perhaps the way out of this problem of consumer information is if we could get a proper complaints mechanism rather than compiling sheafs and sheafs of data on what is going on. I would question the wisdom of that.</P>
    <P>In relation to speculative claims I fully agree with the committee's recommendation that the absence of jury in personal injuries actions will make it easier for insurers to resist speculative claims. The insurance industry should now seize the opportunity presented by the proposed reforms to the legal process to resist speculative claims, thereby <Col N="1443" /> making speculators more reluctant to take claims to court where they will face the prospect of a more dispassionate and impartial assessment of award before a judge.</P>
    <P>In relation to customer education the committee recommend that the insurance companies play a greater role in developing positive attitudes to risk management. I support this view. The industry should devote more resources to encourage better risk management in industry. The long term benefits of such an approach would greatly outweigh the short term increases in underwriting expenses. If linked to the earlier issue we discussed of reward in premia for safety measures this combination could be a very worth while advance. In addition, the establishment of the national authority for occupational safety and health should go some way to improve the safety and health conditions in industry. The necessary legislation is currently being prepared by the Minister for Labour and it deals very comprehensively with the whole issue of safety in the workplace drawing in both the employer and the employee into this task.</P>
    <P>On product liability it is requested that the insurance industry bring the implications to the attention of the manufacturing industry. The insurance industry certainly do have a role but my Department also are preparing a discussion document on this directive which will give an opportunity to all concerned to fully acquaint themselves of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to educational qualifications of brokers it is recommended that a third level part time release course with appropriate VECs leading to qualifications would be worth-while. That is a worth-while suggestion. Part IV of the Insurance Bill, 1986, recently published and currently before the Dáil, sets out important new requirements in relation to insurance brokers and insurance agents. The Bill provides for the recognition of bodies of insurance brokers or individuals who have qualifications or meet requirements equivalent to those <Col N="1444" /> of a recognised insurance body. Broking bodies who wish to be recognised by the Minister must submit a scheme to him setting out in full the rules and requirements of membership of the bodies.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule of that Bill specifies that a scheme submitted by a body seeking recognition must, among other things, contain provisions in regard to the professional competence of members, including experience and academic qualifications. That is in the Bill and we are working on criteria for those who would not be members of insurance broking bodies so we hope to take on board the thrust of the recommendation. In setting educational qualifications for brokers I will, of course, have regard to the provisions of the European Council Directive of 1976 which deals with the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services by insurance agents and brokers.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the second series of recommendations made by the committee &mdash; recommendations which require implementation by the State. The first recommendation was that a policy group should be established to co-ordinate the approach to the insurance industry. I am glad to say the Government have already taken action to implement this recommendation. An inter-departmental committee is being established on foot of a recommendation of the interministerial task force on employment. The committee have a remit to put forward specific recommendations to bring about a real reduction in the cost of employers' and public liability over a five year period. The mandate given to the committee requires them to report back to Government shortly. This determined action by the Government reflects their concern to bring about a competitive and equitable system of employers' and public liability insurance in the country.</P>
    <P>Another major recommendation in this area is a new format for the blue book. The recommendation is that from 1987 onwards the blue book should be published in two parts, one part dealing with financial information and the other with customer-related information. As I said before I have some doubts about <Col N="1445" /> getting into very detailed information about customer information. The blue book is primarily a summary statement of assurance business transacted in any one year. The book is essentially a statistical manual for the supervisory authority, the practitioners and the insurance industry. The information contained therein arises from various statutory requirements in insurance legislation and regulations in regard to business transacted. It is essentially very much a supervision and solvency related book. While I am conscious of the need for better statistics it would be a separate exercise for the blue book to undertake this type of information.</P>
    <P>The next issue I would like to touch on is the major recommendation on compulsory employers' liability insurance. What is recommended is a compulsory system based on no fault with the right to sue for negligence surrendered in return for compulsory cover. This is a very major proposal. It opens up a huge number of issues. First, it raised the issue of compulsion. While I recognise the principle that each employee has a right to cover the difficulty of compulsion is that we must first be satisfied that the premia will be at an affordable cost and that we have a system that will deliver this even in declined cases. The present evidence suggests that there is far from universal cover &mdash; a very high proportion of employers do not take out employers' liability. It is probably true to say that those who are insuring themselves are in the lower risk category. To extend full compulsory cover would appear to be introducing new costs for many companies and also probably raising the average cost. Until we have in place some system that guaranteed premia at an affordable cost and succeeded in containing the growing level of awards, compulsion raises many problems.</P>
    <P>The second issue raised by the proposal is the surrender of the right to sue. Asking people to do this may cause some legal problems as to the constitutionality of the issue, whether it is constitutional to require people to surrender this right. <Col N="1446" /> That might not be in agreement with Article 34 of the Constitution. It would certainly appear that this process, if applied, would have to apply to all insurance and we could not single out employers' liability and public liability. If you do not have that element, namely, the surrender of the right to sue, then a no-fault system that did not involve that would seem to offer little hope of cost reductions. In other words, if the injured party could first claim the scheduled benefits under the compulsory scheme and then have an unrestricted right to sue, the end result would be that you would have a different structure of premium with employers having to pay additional private insurance to top up compensation under the compulsory system. So there is another real headache in that element of the proposal.</P>
    <P>The third element of the proposal is the no-fault issue itself. Obviously to be cost reducing not only must there be gains in lower legal costs and in lower compensation payments, but these gains must outweigh the clear cost increased element in the system. Cost increasing elements in a no-faults system include such things as no reduction for contributory negligence. It is reasonable to expect a growth of claims once no faults need to be proven in the case of a claim. It is also likely that the moral pressure to reduce risks which is possible under a no claims type bonus procedure would be lost. Implicitly of course you are shifting the cost onto the safer industries and safer employers under a no-faults system. The can has to be carried by those who are safe. Again that principle causes some problems.</P>
    <P>While I am not throwing cold water on this proposal I am concerned about the serious implications of it. It is a very radical proposal and I have seen a quotation where other countries have discussed this and where they cited it as equivalent to a new social service for employees. I am continuing to look at it and I am aware of the international system cited, but as yet my Department have no hard evidence that any of these systems has produced cheaper insurance <Col N="1447" /> which is the bottom line that we are after. I hope I have not gone on too long on that issue but I think it is a major recommendation of the report and I wanted to deal with it at some length.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended also that the Insurance Bill, 1986, should contain a number of specific proposals in relation to the regulation of financial intermediaries. Senators will be aware that the Insurance Bill, 1986 is currently circulated. Section 37 of the Bill provides that a person may not carry on a broking business unless he is a member of the body of brokers recognised by the Minister and so on. I mentioned that earlier.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule to the Bill specifies that the scheme of operations submitted by a body seeking recognition in respect of its members shall contain provisions in relation to professional indemnity insurance in respect of members, certification of solvency in respect of members, the requirement for a £100,000 bond to protect clients and the operation of separate accounts. I am satisfied that the provisions in that Bill more than adequately meet the recommendations of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>Finally I will turn to some other measures which the committee raised in relation to insurance cost, for example, the termination of the 1 per cent levy on the turnover of insurance companies, the introduction of a standard scale of charges for brokers commission, and a more active rule for the Department of Industry and Commerce in controlling premium rates of insurance companies. In relation to the 1 per cent levy, the problem there is obviously that it is providing yields and it could hardly be stated that, given the current pressure on public finances, such a reduction would have to be made good by additional taxation or cutbacks in Government spending. Regarding the proposed standard scale of charges for brokers commission, the Insurance Bill, 1986, confers on the Minister power to reduce the rate of commission paid to insurance intermediaries where he is of the opinion that they are excessive. These powers can be brought <Col N="1448" /> into effect at any time, should the interests of policyholders so warrant. The suggestion for a flat rate of fees instead of the present system of brokers commission has merit and is one which my Department will pursue with the insurance industry through liaison meetings with the Insurance Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recommendation for a more active role by the Department in controlling premium rates and commissions, Senators will be aware of the Government's decision to abolish statutory price control. In general, the large increases in insurance premia in recent years have occurred in those classes of insurance where the greatest losses have been incurred. Influencing the factors which give rise to the high costs of insurance is much more likely to be effective than controlling the price of insurance, as price control can have the effect of reducing the availability of cover, often for those who most need it. Our experience of price control has proved that it has been a major benefit where it was operated. The joint committee made several recommendations in relation to legal reforms and these are ones which I support fully. These recommendations fall into the area of the responsibility of the Minister for Justice. I would, however, be sympathetic to the recommendations in general and strongly support the recommendation for the abolition of the three counsel rule in personal injury cases.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that legal costs, including expert witness costs, represent 20 per cent of the total costs in claims paid by insurance companies. Senator Ryan suggested figures that seem to be much lower than that, but this is the information we have from one insurance company. In cases set down for court hearing, legal costs may be as high as 40 per cent. While Senator Fitzsimons expressed the opinion that it was not unreasonable to have costs at 20 per cent, when you get into 40 per cent legal costs on court cases you are really running very high. Considerable savings could result from the abolition of the three counsel rule. This <Col N="1449" /> practice is difficult to defend given that, as far back as 1977, the UK Bar Counsel of its own accord abolished its two counsel rule. I understand that in the UK it is quite usual for junior counsel to appear on their own in the majority of High Court cases. I believe that one counsel on each side is adequate in the majority of cases arising in Ireland and I intend to pursue this matter both with the Minister for Justice and with the Irish Insurance Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>The committee made recommendations in relation to business security, rates remissions for properties and funds for malicious damages. These matters are essentially outside my area of responsibility and I would not enter into a discussion on them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to thank the committee for a very worthwhile report. The committee put forward very sensible suggestions which will inform the thinking of my Department as we attempt to tackle the very difficult problem of the cost of insurance.</P>
