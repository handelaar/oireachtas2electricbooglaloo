      <P>I have notice from Senator Thomas Hussey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take steps in relation to the condition of certain minor roads which have seriously deteriorated since they were last repaired under the local improvement scheme.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to rule that this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>
      <P>Before we take the Order of Business I wish to inform the House that a progress report has been received from the Office of Public Works about the repairs to the Chamber.  The report will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this evening at 5.30 p.m. Subsequently, the committee will inspect the Chamber.  Any Member of this House may join the members of the committee for the inspection.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item No. 1 is merely the formal ordering of the Second Stage of a Bill introduced in the Seanad. No. 2 is the continuation of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill, 1986, on Committee Stage, which spilled over from the last day.  No. 3 is the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, to be taken on Committee Stage. No. 4 is a Private Members' Bill in regard to social welfare appeals, the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill, 1986, Second Stage, which will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  In view of the large amount of business which we have on hand at the moment, it is not proposed to rise from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.  The Minister has indicated her willingness to continue the debate beyond 8 o'clock on the Committee Stage of the Air Pollution Bill, until 11 p.m., if necessary, in order to complete the Committee Stage today.  It is a matter for the House to decide whether it wishes to do this or not.</P>

      <P>I agree that we should continue on as long as is necessary in order to bring as many of these difficult Bills as possible to a conclusion.  The problems which we have now, coming up to Christmas, are beginning to show themselves.  Irrespective of what happens on these particular Bills today, we must have the Report Stages debated.  The Control of Clinical Trials Bill could take quite some time on Report Stage.  We have the Single European Act coming before the House.  We have the Extradition Bill coming before us.  Between now and Christmas there seems to be a lot of legislation that it would appear will have to be rushed through unless sitting days are long and extra sitting days are agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not wish Bills before us to be concluded in a hurry, or in a slapdash manner.  This House should have adequate time to discuss the two very important Bills that are coming in.  Of course, before Christmas we have to have the Appropriation Bill discussed.  The time element is of major importance at this stage.  I would like the Leader of the <Col N="227" /> House to give his opinion on what he feels will be the situation over the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>Arising on the Adjournment matter I wished to raise tonight, I respect your ruling but I cannot understand why the Minister for the Environment has not this responsibility since he sets out the regulations governing local improvement schemes and also provides the money for the schemes.  I fail to see why he should not be held responsible for the administration of those schemes.  I had in mind a particular one in my own constituency.  I will not discuss it now.  I respect the Chair's ruling, but I must say I am disappointed that the Minister is not responsible for answering a question about what I see as an inadequacy in the scheme as it operates at present.</P>

      <P>A number of us are concerned about what business will be transacted by the Seanad between now and the Christmas recess.  Normally, the Leader of the House indicates what is proposed to take tomorrow.  I would be greatful if he would so indicate in his reply.  I would like some indication from him of the Bills that will be dealt with by this House.  I share the concern of Senator Lanigan that we should have enough time to actually examine these Bills, particularly on Committee Stage, and, if necessary, on Report Stage.  This can only happen if we know sufficiently in advance what the programme is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would assume, for example, that some priority will be given to the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill which will be given its first reading today.  That Bill will require early debate.  I would like to know what programme the Leader of the House envisages, and what kind of time we will have for discussion of Bills.  If <Col N="228" /> possible, it would be helpful to Members if we could have an actual programme distributed to us for the remainder of this session.</P>

      <P>I realise that the business before the House is very urgent.  Motion No. 34 in the name of mixed party people.  I ask the Leader of the House to jog the memory of the Minister for the Environment that such a motion exists. Resulting from that he might give us some indication as to when it will be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of Senator Lanigan about the difficulty of getting our business completed.  I also share his appreciation of how the Seanad has worked in recent weeks and months. I have absolutely no desire to curtail discussion on any of the important measures before us.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of how I envisage our programme between now and the date of adjournment, all I can give to the House is the position as I know it at the moment.  I have been working on this for the past few days.  The average lifetime of a programme for the House is about three hours, because some other consideration comes up.  As of now, I envisage that our programme would be somewhat as follows: I propose, under No. 1, to ask the House to take the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill, which is agreed in principle, tomorrow morning. It would be a matter for the House then to decide whether or not they should take all Stages of that Bill, or whether to leave Committee Stage over untill the following Tuesday.  I might issue a warning that, no matter which course is followed, it will be necessary for us to suspend the Standing Order we have made.  It will be necessary to vote on the Second Stage tomorrow, whether or not Committee Stage is to follow immediately or on the following Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will take up the Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) <Col N="229" /> Bill tomorrow.  I would like to see that carried as far forward as possible.  I will be asking the House to sit until 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. tomorrow to make as much advance as we can on that.  On the other hand, if the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill finishes early, we could round off the debate on developments in Southern Africa.</P>
    <P>In regard to next week, it is proposed that the House would sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  The position on Tuesday is that, if the Committee Stage of the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill had not been taken, it would be taken first thing on Tuesday in order to get it into the Dáil as soon as possible, because it is a Seanad Bill and has to be processed by the Dáil.  We have already received the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill from the Dáil.  I think it would be appropriate to go on then to discuss the Second Stage of the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill.  I will know before the end of today whether or not the training Bill in regard to AnCO and CERT and similar bodies will pass all stages in the Dáil.  That matter is not yet certain.  If it does pass all stages we might perhaps take that at the end of Tuesday. As the programme stands at present, Wednesday would be largely devoted to the Report Stage of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill and any remaining part of the Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>On Thursday 11 December it is proposed to take the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill in Committee and the training Bill in Committee.  There will be a Bill introduced into this House &mdash; and I would like to thank the Government for it &mdash; in regard to the question of workers' participation.  If there is any time left on Thursday the Second Stage of that might be commenced.</P>
    <P>In the following week I think it will be necessary for us to sit on four days, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. It is anticipated that Tuesday and Wednesday would be devoted to discussion on the Single European Act.  If we go without interruption on Tuesday, this will give us 7½ hours of debate and on <Col N="230" /> Wednesday, if we go from 10.30 a.m. to 10 p.m., it will give us 11½ hours of debate.  Two days may sound somewhat small but 19 hours is a considerable period of debating time.</P>
    <P>It is proposed on the Thursday to take the Report Stage of the Status of Children Bill.  I have pressing the Minister in regard to this to the extent of putting in writing my views that the amendments to this should be circulated as early as possible.  Senators will need to determine their own positions having seen the Government amendments.  My request was that the Government amendments should be circulated early this week in order to allow that Bill to be taken next week.  My understanding is that the departmental decisions have been made in regard to this, but the final drafting of the amendments by the Parlimentary Draftsman have not been made.</P>
    <P>One of my disappointments in planning has been that that Bill cannot be brought in next week.  I have spoken not only to the Minister of State but to the Minister himself and, apart from confirming the attitude towards the Bill which the Minister of State took in this House, and which we all appreciated, he has indicated that he gives a very high priority to this Bill. The position is, unfortunately, despite my protestations, that the Dáil will discuss the Appropriation Bill with the Adjournment debate.  This means that the Appropriation Bill will not pass Dáil Eireann until some time between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Friday, 19 December.</P>
    <P>This House then has the alternative of meeting on the Saturday morning, or meeting the following Monday, or meeting on the following Tuesday.  I have had some consultations with members of the various groups.  The general view seems to be that we should take our legislation that we have in hand, things like the Report Stage of the Air Pollution Bill and the Report Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill on that day, sitting through until 6 p.m. until we receive the Appropriation Bill, which must be enacted before the end of the year.  We would then pass that Bill on the usual understanding that we would return in <Col N="231" /> mid-January to debate it, either on 14 or 21 January.  This is the programme as it appears to me at the moment.  It will probably firm up slightly within the next 24 hours or so.  If it does, I will circulate it to the representatives of the groups, but on the understanding that there may be further changes.  I would be very glad to entertain any comments from any group or any individual Senator in regard to this programme.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask is there any significance in the fact that the Leader of the House omitted the Extradition Bill from this programme?  Is is not envisaged that the Seanad would consider that Bill?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House does not envisage that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the question of the Extradition Bill.  It appears to me that, irrespective of what happens in this House over the next seven working days, there is no way in which there will be an adequate amount of time to debate all the major issues before us.  Do we have to finish this business before Christmas?  I cannot see that we have to finish all this business before Christmas.  Why not go along, as we have done before, and give adequate time to every piece of legislation. Is the Leader of the House suggesting that we may not come back after the Recess for further consideration of any of these issues?  If the issue of extradition does come in, obviously it will throw this whole programme out of kilter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is obviously not enough time for the Committee Stages and Report Stages on these major Bills, which are technical Bills, as well as giving adequate time, <Col N="232" /> particularly for the Single European Act, which has major implications for everybody and which is of major concern to more people in this country than perhaps is realised.  There are groups speaking on this issue and sending in documentation on various issues that are involved.  There are apparently 300 changes that can be made in our own legislation because of the implementation of this Single European Act.  I am not saying whether we will be supporting it, proposing it or whatever, but irrespective of our attitude it is a major piece of legislation.  Irrespective of the fact that the Leader has suggested that there would be 18 hours' debate I do not think for that legislation that is adequate time particularly in view of the fact that we may have the Extradition Bill coming in as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say, in supplement, that I confirm what I said before that I have no wish to curtail discussion. On the other hand, this House should realise that there have been a number of Bills introduced into this House.  The Air Pollution Bill was introduced into this House last February.  I think this House would not be doing itself credit as a House of the Oireachtas if it went into Adjournment this Christmas without completing that Bill.  I have already indicated in regard to it that the Minister in charge is willing to take the Committee Stage of this Bill up to 11 p.m. tonight.  I think we can get this business through.  It may require late sittings but I think it is better that a late sitting should take place and that we should progress this legislation as much as we can.  I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, irrespective of what happens in another place, there is nothing to prevent us in the month of January from discussing legislation that is on our Order Paper.</P>

I have come here today to apologise for any inconvenience I caused to the Cathaoirleach, all the Members of the House, the staff of the <Col N="233" /> House and the Minister.  I went to another function outside the precincts of the House, to which I had a prior commitment. I felt the House would have continued to do its work up to a certain time but when I arrived back the House was closed.  I wish to apologise to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 10, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>We have a problem generally in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; in this Bill.  I have had consultations with interested persons outside this House in relation to this matter.  In amendment No. 46, which arises also, instead of the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; I have suggested the insertion of the words &ldquo;or malpractice indemnity&rdquo; because it is not sufficiently appreciated that doctors do not have themselves covered for insurance.  The British Medical Defence Union looks after a considerable number of practising doctors at general practice or consultant level in this country.  As I understand it, what is, in fact, in place is a malpractice indemnity.  This matter has been tested in the courts in the United Kingdom wherein they ruled that the cover given to doctors is not an insurance cover in the strictest meaning of the word.  To that extent there is a problem in the way in which this is described in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is more complex than that. The matter of insurance generally, as drafted in the Bill, is a little more complex than what I have just said.  Doctors <Col N="234" /> are not covered by way of insurance. They are covered by malpractice indemnity. This matter has been clarified by the courts in the United Kingdom which must have a bearing on us here.  May I ask the Minister, in relation to this whole matter of insurance whether this has been sufficiently thought through?  How does the Minister expect, even if there was insurance available &mdash; let us not bother for a moment whether it is called insurance or malpractice indemnity &mdash; somebody who intends to conduct a trial to get cover, of whatever kind it may be, for the person who will be presenting himself or herself for the trial by way of procedure in a hospital?  How can the Minister expect insurance to be &ldquo;up front&rdquo; before the insurance company know the conditions under which the National Drugs Advisory Board would advise the Minister in relation to the particular trial to take place? There is a genuine difficulty there.  No matter what form of cover is available for the doctor he is in difficulty and will not know the conditions which may or may not be insisted on, on the advise of the National Drugs Advisory Board and by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the World Health Organisation in my Second Stage speech.  I understand a study of some importance has been transfered from institutions in this country to Belgium because of the necessity of obtaining insurance.  That is something which the Minister will clarify in his own way.  I understand that to be the case.  It also seems to involve an insistence on insurance for all forms of clinical trials.  This, of course, could conceivably include trials involving patients with terminal illness and studies involving hospital management in practical terms.  We covered the point earlier in some detail in relation to the question of the terminally ill patient.  That has been expanded on in some detail.  The matter of insurance also arises here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of insurance is a matter a number of contributors to this debate raised on Second Stage.  It continues to be a problem.  It came as something of a surprise to me &mdash; perhaps I should have known &mdash; that doctors do not in general carry insurance.  As Senator FitzGerald said the medical profession would have malpractice indemnity but not insurance.  When he is contributing to this debate on Committee Stage, it would be interesting to know whether the Minister is, in fact, insistent upon introducing quite a radical new development in this area, given that it does not apply in general to medical practitioners.  They would not normally have insurance in relation to their work.  They would have malpractice indemnity.  I am extremely concerned about safeguards and about protection for those participating in clinical trials.  I am not in any sense a spokes-person for the medical profession on this. That is not my concern.  There would be a danger that we might be loading this in a way which would make it extremely difficult for clinical trials to be held.  I do not think that would be good for the country or the overall objectives of this Bill.  There is a very serious public interest in ensuring that clinical trials can and do take place because they are absolutely essential to the furthering of the important aims of advancing our knowledge, advancing the safety of drugs and appliances and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address this issue of whether the Department, for whatever reason, are insisting on those conducting clinical trials &mdash; they need not necessarily be doctors, of course &mdash; taking out insurance even though it is accepted that, in the normal course, up to now, they would not have been taking out insurance cover in this respect.  If the Minister is insisting on that, there must be a certain onus on him to explain to the <Col N="236" /> House how this will be compatible with furthering the public interest in ensuring that clinical trials are held, in other words to ensure that it does not become an impediment to the carrying out of clinical trials in the way that it has certainly been put to me very seriously by members of the medical profession, by people in Trinity College, members of the academic staff in the medical school in whose judgment and assessment of these matters I have a lot of faith.  They would have a broader view and not be simply trying to protect the medical profession from possible costs involved in an insurance policy.</P>
    <P>As Senator FitzGerald has emphasised, what has been put to me &mdash; and I would like to hear the Minister's views on this &mdash; would be the very great difficulty of getting insurance cover, particularly in relation to terminally ill patients who would be involved in a clinical trial.  There would be the difficulty of getting insurance cover &mdash; as Senator FitzGerald mentioned &mdash; prior to the permission to conduct a clinical trial because until the permission was forthcoming it would not be possible to assess the nature and scope of the risk.  In some cases, particularly in the case of terminally ill patients, that would be extremely difficult and likely to be something for which an insurance company would require an extremely high premium.  These seem to me to be reasonable questions.  The concerns are worrying not so much because of the medical profession as such but in a broader sense because of the public interest in ensuring that we do not &mdash; while intending to provide protection &mdash; make it either extremely difficult or, in some cases quite impossible to carry out clinical trials.  I would like the Minister when replying to indicate what the problems would be of resting on a requirement that a malpractice indemnity certificate be available.  In what way is that considered to be inadequate as a protection? There are important issues here that we will have to examine in some detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who is at present being sued by a person in Crumlin Road jail for the removal of a tattoo and <Col N="237" /> an unsatisfactory skin grafting, I speak with some feeling in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Senator Robb have insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Senator Robinson raised a very important point.  I am now speaking from the practical side because I had not thought through the implication of this until I heard her speak.  As a profession we are protected either by the Medical Defence Union or the Medical Protection Society.  On the whole they cover all doctors in the United Kingdom and, I believe, in the Republic of Ireland. When people are the subject of malpractice, negligent practice or whatever and they decide to take an action, we report this to the society which protects us.  They then decide whether they will defend the case or settle it.  But they are more or less obliged to give advice for the defence. They may fight it in court or they may not.  They try, as far as possible, not to fight it out in court because invariably the publicity given to these things does not help the reputation of the person who has been involved.  The difficulty I had in listening to Senator Robinson was that, up to this moment, I always thought that, were I involved in research of some sort, my medical defence union would protect me if an action were taken against me, or would attempt to defend me.</P>
      <P>The other side of the coin is a different matter altogether.  Increasingly, in recent years, one has found that more and more people are suing for damages in respect of accidents, very often very trivial accidents, in the expectation of receiving a fairly high rate of damages.  I am sure the insurance companies, like many other people, have a vested interest in this whole business.  Some people say other people get to the casualties in our hospitals before the doctors these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to be careful to weight up all these factors.  We must realise that insurance cover comes into the picture &mdash; and I gather Senator Robinson's feeling is that we should look into this very seriously &mdash; there are a lot of vested interests in the whole insurance world.  There is <Col N="238" /> also good reason for trying to tap that interest on the grounds of malpractice.  I have even heard of people &mdash; I will not cite particular instances &mdash; who are almost glad that something has happened to them because they know the person they can sue is insured.  Therefore we must take all these matters into account. I agree with Senator Robinson that it is a very important area.  It is not one to open up too lightly without thinking through the full implications of what we are at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has two amendments, one of which proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;issued by an authorised insurer&rdquo; and the other the deletion of the words &ldquo;and a copy of the policy of insurance has been supplied to the Minister&rdquo;, perhaps he would give us his thoughts on these amendments, Nos. 47 and 48?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first point made that was on section 9 (1) (a), I do not have a problem if it provides greater clarity on the provisions of the Bill.  If as Senator FitzGerald suggested, we delete subsection (1) (a), section 9 (1) would then read: <Col N="239" />&ldquo;A person shall not conduct a clinical trial or administer any substance or preparation for the purpose of a clinical trial&rdquo;. The reason I would be prepared to amend that section is that of course permission to conduct a trial would have been given already.  Therefore, the next step is the conduct of the clinical trial.  It might read more effectively if we were to have the section read:</P>
      <P>A person shall not</P>
      <P>(a) conduct a clinical trial, or</P>
      <P>(b) administer any substance or preparation for the purpose of a clinical trial.</P>
      <P>To that extent I would be prepared to delete paragraph (a) for the sake of clarity and precision.</P>
      <P>The second point raised was the question of indemnity.  I am afraid I will prove to be very obdurate on that.  We are not only concerned with malpractice, as such. We are, above all else, concerned with the effect on the participant of the possible intrinsic danger of the drug itself. That can have catastrophic effects on the participant.  It may be entirely outside the clinical or trial competence of the doctor. He may be entirely blameless, but the impact of the drug can be quite dreadful. Therefore, one must insist that the paramount interest, which is that of the participant, should be given exceptional protection in this area.  That is why I am concerned about that aspect.  I do not think it is a central point but I am concerned about the conduct of trials on terminally ill patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A terminally ill patient is a terminally ill patient and, as such, using the doctor's clinical judgment in an effort to try to bring about a reversal, a doctor can competently maintain that the drug which is not entirely proven is available and, using his clinical judgment, he is prepared to take that risk.  The patient's illness is deemed to be of a terminal character, is recorded as such and, therefore, he will take that risk.  If the patient recovers, the patient is unlikely to sue him for malpractice, to say the least.  On that basis the issue can be covered.  I am prepared to <Col N="240" /> concede the merit of the point made by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>I will go on to deal with amendments Nos, 47, 48 and 50.  Amendments Nos. 47 and 50 are necessary because the original provision required an insurer to hold an authorisation under the regulations of the Department of Industry and Commerce. These have been represented to me as being entirely too restrictive and would pose enormous difficulty.  Accordingly, we have put down amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 50.  Amendment No. 48 is being introduced because it is considered that it would be inadvisable for the Minister to have implied responsibility for confirming, in advance, that an insurance policy was adequate.  He would find himself taking on the particular indemnity himself which, on reflection, would be somewhat unwise and he could find himself effectively facing the consequences.</P>
    <P>These are the main reasons for putting down these three amendments.  I think they will meet the general wishes of Senators while not in any way diluting the provisions of the Bill.  We do not want to dilute the Bill but, at the same time, we do not want to make its provisions so restrictive that clinical trials, as such, could not be conducted under any circumstances. I will leave it at that.  Perhaps Senators may have some further thoughts on the issues I have raised.</P>

One would expect that it would not be moved because it does not have any purpose. If the Minister is accepting Senator FitzGerald's amendment No. 45 to delete subsection (a), he does not have to define what is meant by arranging for the conducting of a clinical trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we are all agreed on amendment No. 45, we do not have to address that amendment any more.  It is appreciated that the Minister has accepted the basis for that amendment. But the more substantial issue remains which is the question of whether there is still a concern that the way in which this section is framed requires that a person conducting a clinical trial, a medical person, a dentist, persons authorised to conduct a clinical trial, must have insurance.  Senator Fallon asked the Minister &mdash; and I join with him in asking the Minister &mdash; to clarify what precisely is meant by the type of insurance the section now requires.  The Minister's own amendments, as he has explained, affect that.  It is no longer a policy of insurance <Col N="242" /> issued by an authorised insurer.  It is no longer necessary that a copy of the policy of insurance be supplied to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister, in effect, using the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; in a non-technical way? Is it possible that a malpractice indemnity could be construed as being insurance for the purposes of the section at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a fund of some kind.  I share the Minister's concern that there can be consequences of a clinical trial which are not the result of malpractice, where a malpractice indemnity may not cover those consequences.  That is a very real concern.  I think I am correct in understanding that in Britain, for example, there is a policy of making <i>ex gratia</i> payments in circumstances where that happens, that the Department of Health make payments to participants in a clinical trial where they have suffered some sort of damage which is not the result of any possible allegations of malpractice on the part of those conducting the clinical trial.  I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that that is the position in Britain; also if that would be a possible way of ensuring that there is that full protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to achieve a number of objectives. We want to ensure that clinical trials can be carried out.  That is important for the advancement of our knowledge, for medical reasons.  We want to ensure that those conducting them &mdash; doctors, dentists, those in the academic medical world &mdash; can in fact conduct clinical trials because they can cover themselves to do it.  At the moment they have malpractice indemnity.  It is absolutely vital that we specify what more we are requiring, whether it is fair to load the medical profession with what I might call the innocent consequences, unforeseen and possibly very harmful consequences for some individuals, but not as the result of any malpractice by the medical profession. Is there another way in which we could ensure that is covered either by the establishment of a fund for that purpose or by a commitment by the Department <Col N="243" /> that <i>ex gratia</i> payments would be made in that instance?</P>
    <P>The real question which must be addressed is: are we, in fact, putting a requirement in this section which will make it extremely difficult for those who would normally conduct clinical trials to provide one of the necessary prerequisites to do so, in other words, a policy of insurance and what is meant by that policy of insurance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Robinson on this section.  To me it is a question that can present real problems for future progress of clinical trials.  From the very start I am aware that the Irish Insurance Association were asked by the Department of Industry and Commerce to comment on the availability of cover. They made it quite clear that probably it was not available in this country.  This is the real problem &mdash; the availability of the type of cover required by the Minister under this section.  I am not disputing it. There should be adequate insurance or funds available in the event of something going wrong in a trial for the person who suffers as a result of that trial.  Obviously adequate insurance cover in one case might be totally different in another.  In one case it might be a single person; in another case it might be a married man with a family.  Therefore adequate insurance cover will vary.  It could be £100,000 in one case, £20,000 in another case, and so on.  Nonetheless, the principle of having adequate insurance cover is not something with which I would disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is the availability of the cover.  Where can you get such insurance cover?  I am not talking now about the Elans or the ICPs.  I reckon they are large enough to be able to get sufficient cover for themselves.  I am talking about university people.  A few medical people might come together to conduct a trial in a medical school or places like that.  I am not even talking about terminally ill people.  Where will such people be able to get such cover?  To begin with when will they get a policy or where will they get a fund if it is to be a fund?  I believe the whole <Col N="244" /> section has not been sufficiently thought out with its long term consequences for trials.  The idea of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is fine.  I would welcome anything that would not hinder the future progress of trials.  Despite obvious improvements to the section by the Minister, in my opinion it will still present real problems for many people who want to engage in the business of trials in this country.  Hence it might interfere with future trials being conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown, in the way in which he has introduced his own amendments and the way in which he has dealt with this debate from the start, that he does not want to be any more overbearing in this area on either participants, the medical profession or the drug companies than is necessary to protect primarily those who are undergoing tests in one way or another. However, we shall have to go further down the road on this because the position is not sufficiently satisfactory to me as explained by the Minister to date.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that the courts in Britain had already indicated that, by and large, doctors are not insured as we know or understand the term &ldquo;insurance&rdquo;.  We are talking here of the British Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society Senator Robb mentioned. The vast majority of doctors in this country are covered by one or other of them. Indeed, I am sure every doctor is covered under these schemes.</P>
      <P>We have got to know the implications of whether or not, as Senator Fallon mentioned, we can get insurance cover from the insurance companies established here most of which emanated from elsewhere anyway.  Can we get insurance cover? Second, what will the cost of this cover be to doctors, to those involved in setting up these trials?  It is very important that we protect the advance of medicine, the advance of research of new drugs.  We must ensure that we do not make life so difficult for everybody that we end up in a log-jam of difficulties one after another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads me on to the point Senator Robinson was making.  I must say there is <Col N="245" /> a very appealing ring to it as possibly the way in which this matter could be resolved. The State did go into the business &mdash; I do not know how long ago, but a long time ago anyway &mdash; of setting up a body, which protects the uninsured.  I am not sure what the body is called.  I do not mean those who do not bother to insure but those who find themselves in a public street, knocked down by a car in a hit-and-run accident.  They have nowhere to go, no redress.  They do not even know who drove the car and the car cannot be identified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that might be a case for the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was that but I was not going to say so.  Does the Senator know: are insurance companies not involved in subsidising them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought they were. Then it is the insurance companies that provide that.  I thought the State was involved in providing money into that fund or scheme.  It is there to assist those who are victims of hit-and-run accidents and that sort of thing.  In any case, the incidence of insurance being called on in situations of drug trials would seem to be very much more the exception than the rule.  The numbers involved in any claim on insurance would strike me as being very small and not a big factor in the enormous health cake the Minister has to cut each year.  I wonder whether he could not do what Senator Robinson has suggested and use some part of that allocation to fund those who may require insurance cover of this kind where a major claim arises bearing in mind that the malpractice area is already covered for the medical people taking part in these trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a critical issue for a number of reasons.  We can all accept it, and accepting this premise, we can go on to look at the problem.  One should not &mdash; nobody should &mdash; conduct a <Col N="246" /> clinical trial if one is unable to obtain an adequate insurance policy.  One accepts that it is a matter of high risk in one way or another.  In effect we are saying very clearly in the Bill, &ldquo;unless there is in force a policy&rdquo;.  We have used the best possible phraseology we could devise in this regard.  After considerable talk and consultation we came up with the phrase that a policy of insurance should be sufficient to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of a trial.</P>
      <P>People may question the definition of that.  Certainly the ethics committee will have to be satisfied as will the Minister of the day that the insurance policy is adequate to meet the rigours of that statutory requirement.  I do not think we can do anything other than that.  There may be great difficulty facing individual companies obtaining insurance cover, particularly where there are no commercial sponsors involved.  If there are major multinational pharmaceutical companies involved in this area &mdash; as indeed very many of them are &mdash; they must accept the rights of the individual participant and they must obtain insurance.  I would not give way on that obligation on them.</P>
      <P>Equally I would not accept under any circumstances &mdash; and Senators may allude to this view &mdash; that the State should accept the obligation of compensation in the event of a trial going wrong.  Even if we were in a position to do it, that would dilute the obligation on the sponsoring companies, on the participating doctors and on the clinical trial personnel because of the prospect of a State take-up in the event of a catastrophe occuring.  Therefore, there could not be a blank cheque, or even half a blank cheque on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision is quite vigorous.  So far as I know in Ireland we do not have elaborate insurance provisions available on a ready made basis.  Most of the multinational companies who have clinical trials in operation, the sponsoring commercial organisations, endeavour to give themselves some indemnity.  Now they will have to prove to us that they are doing that.  I do not think it will prevent <Col N="247" /> trials being held or unduly inhibit the prospect of trials taking place.  I have no doubt that they will, but they will be taking place under the pretty stringent obligations in the Bill.  It will be a matter of judgement one way or the other.  The Minister will have to be satisfied that the insurance policy is in force.  He will have to be satisfied that it is of sufficient amount by way of cover.  I do not see any way out of this.  Otherwise the Bill would be diluted in such a way that it would be impossible to go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that, as Minister, he will have to be satisfied that the policy is in force, and there is cover, that it must be enforced, that it must be with a reputable insurance company and as to the size of the policy. By that he must mean the limit of indemnity or, in the case of a personal accident policy, the capital benefits.  If that is what the Minister means, would he elaborate on his thoughts in that area.  If he is talking about the liability side, what is the level of indemnity?  If he is talking about a personal accident policy, which I think it would have to be, he is talking effectively about a no fault insurance. The only way you will get no fault insurance in Ireland is from a Lloyds personal accident group policy covering these clinical trial participants.  Is he now saying that he will want to know the capital death benefit on a personal accident policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand fully the point Senator Robinson made about the malpractice as against the no fault risk. There is a down side to this which can be pretty horrific in terms of this open cover which it has been suggested the State should take over.  We only have to look at the whole thalidomide situation to see how widespread this can be.  I do not believe that drug companies identify the disease they desperately want to cure for altruistic reasons but absolutely and strictly for profit.  It does not matter whether the trials are carried out here, or in the Third World.  I equate the attitude <Col N="248" /> of most of the drug companies with the attitude of tobacco companies &mdash; if it does not run here it will run in the Third World perhaps.</P>
      <P>I would be very hesistant in giving what I would consider to be a chancer's charter by way of an open fund.  It is also true that there are people in the field of research who are in it as much for personal glory as for anything else.  If there were such blanket cover the frontiers of science would be pushed back at the rate of a mile a minute, because they would not have the responsibility.  One of the essential brakes on drug testing and development in that whole area is the financial brake. These companies recognise nothing essentially except the financial dimensions of their problems.  If the State takes it over they will be quite happy to test anybody and anything for any length of time provided that, in the final analysis, they do not pick up the bill.</P>
      <P>Having made those comments, I have no answer to the point Senator Robinson made about where the innocent are hit. In so far as insurance cover is being provided by the testing organisation, there must be a very strong onus on the Minister, acting on behalf of a Government, to ensure that cover is <i>in situ</i>.  There can be no stepping aside from that.  As the Minister said, for him to have advance notice of the actual insurance cover puts him on hazard.  The Government, in the person of the Minister, should be on hazard where the citizen is at risk.  He has a responsibility there.  I have very grave reservations about giving taxpayer's money as an open cheque to any group of drug testing companies or organisations. It would be a charter for disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the discussion unduly on this section, although I agree with the Minister that it is very important because of the public interest aspects of it in relation to whether clinical trials will be able to be carried on in a satisfactory way which will advance our knowledge and have beneficial medical effects.  There is a clear difference &mdash; and I think most of us have drawn that distinction &mdash; between large <Col N="249" /> drug companies who are in a position to get insurance, or should be in a position to get insurance, in relation to any clinical trials they wish to have conducted for their products.  I agree with the comments that have been made on that.</P>
      <P>Of more concern is the position of the individual doctor, the individual dentist, the person in the academic community, who has been up to now carrying on clinical trials.  We are bringing in legislation, rightly, to ensure that there is greater protection for the public.  These people do not carry insurance as Senator Robb has confirmed here today.  They do not as a matter of course carry insurance.  We are not asking them to carry insurance in relation to malpractice.  They are already covered for that.  They have malpractice indemnity.  We are asking them to address the very difficult issue of strict liability insurance for a very hard to predict possible consequence of a clinical trial.  I am not an expert on insurance but I feel that in certain cases that could be extremely difficult to get and extremely expensive.</P>
      <P>I referred to the practice in Britain where I understand the Ministry of Health assumes a certain role in relation to this no fault consequence that was unforeseen and that causes harm to some or several participants in a clinical trial. They, of course, are the people who must be protected.  We are all agreed that they must be in a position where they can be properly compensated and protected by the legislation.  I do not quite see why the Minister feels there is no role for the State in this.  The State has a very clear interest in promoting clinical trials and in ensuring that, if there is any malpractice, the person engaged in the malpractice bears the burden of that and, therefore, individual doctors and dentists cover themselves for that.  That is the normal position and they look to their medical union to cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may even make an exception and say companies engaged in promotion and sale of drugs can look after themselves even for no fault risk in relation to clinical trials.  We are still left with that position.  It certainly is something <Col N="250" /> that has a broad public interest concern to it.  I do not see why it is so logically necessary that in seeking, as we do, to cover that no fault risk it must be the doctor who will seek to do it, have to cover himself for insurance to do it, and cannot conduct a clinical trial unless that has been achieved.  Has the Minister considered, for example, an option of creating within the terms of this Bill a fund in relation to that no fault risk?  We will be dealing later with, for example, fees for applications to the National Drugs Advisory Board and presumably there will be a fair turnover of money in applications now to conduct clinical trials.  I do not know whether that would be the kind of sum that would be in any way adequate to establish such a fund.</P>
    <P>There is a very rough analogy in the travel agency business.  There is a fund to cover a case where travel agencies go bust and people suffer consequences.  Here we are talking about that no fault but nonetheless quite discernible risk attached to conducting clinical trials.  We are trying to consider how to do it.  I would like the Minister to indicate that he might between now and Report Stage very seriously consider the concerns that have been expressed by various Senators and possibly distinguish between drug companies under whose auspices a clinical trial is being conducted and individual members of the medical profession, dental profession, or the academic schools who have up to now, on the basis of their malpractice certificates, carried out clinical trials and who are saying &mdash; certainly saying to me and other Senators: &ldquo;We simply cannot get that kind of cover.  You will throw out the baby with the bath water.  You will stop the whole business&rdquo;. That is very serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the debate, I am appalled at the situation I find myself in 30 years after graduating. In the one bit of research I did which had danger attached to it, and to which I referred earlier on in this debate, research on children's duodenal ulcers, had any of those children aspirated something from their stomach and been left in <Col N="251" /> the stage of haeomplegia or diminished cerebral activity, provided I could have shown I was not negligent, which I certainly would be endeavouring not to be, then it would have been looked upon as an act of God and the child or the family would not have been eligible to receive any financial compensation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I have now become convinced, as I listened to the Minister and, in particular, to Senator Robinson, that we must cover this eventuality if for no other reason than that the person carrying out the research can live with himself afterwards.  You certainly take a great burden on yourself when you are in the course of practice, as I happen to be, penetrating into human beings one way or another.  When something goes wrong that is something you carry with yourself. If it goes wrong and you find that the person is crippled as a result, you have to live with that extra burden.</P>
      <P>Primarily we are concerned with the person on whom the research is being done but we also have to consider the effect on many other people too.  The question then arises, as Senator Robinson has so clearly indicated, as to who will foot the bill for the insurance.  I do not think anybody is left in any doubt that the drug company should be left to foot the bill for insurance for research being sponsored by them.  There are two other categories of people in the medical world doing research: those who are doing research as employees of a board of health; and those who are doing research as employees of a university.  This is something the universities will have to look at very seriously.  There may be some way in which the universities could all come together to have a sort of pool of resources to obtain cover for this type of insurance.  If we come back to the health boards or the health authorities then, of course, we are back in the lap of the State.  I do not think anyone should be doing research on his own which involves danger to the client and this Bill sets out to try to protect the client while at the same time not restricting the opportunity for justifiable research to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> At the end of the day, it has been suggested that the insurance premiums that would be required would be fairly vast for no risk type of insurance.  I do not feel it is right that that should be left on the shoulders of an individual.  This may often be a young man who, rightly or wrongly, may be carrying out this research to meet the needs demanded by a department for his advancement, as has been pointed out by my fellow Senator, as much as to push forward the frontiers of science, although that may be a bonus as a result of this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">

      <P>I would like to press the Minister to reconsider his position in relation to this area on Report Stage and to at least give some indication that he will bear very much in mind what a number of us have been saying here today, that is, to distinguish between drug tests being done by the major drug companies or by drug companies generally and the very different circumstances where drugs are being tested in a university or hospital setting.  Very often the amount expended on doing those tests is quite limited but the additional cost of being insured to do those tests will probably make it impossible for those tests to continue in the hospital or university where much valuable work is done in this area.  The risk for the clinician working with his students in a university or hospital will be an upsetting factor for many people in medical practice.  I wonder whether this has been framed with drug companies in mind and whether the Minister could keep the door open to allow for a continuing level of medical research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State is not over indulgent in supporting medical research and we do not want to cause unnecessary blockages and difficulties for those who are doing very valuable work.  Much of this work &mdash; and this is seldom said &mdash; has an international reputation.  That should be borne in mind.  I hope the Minister will not close the door but will come back to us with some formula that will deal with the very different circumstances that arise daily in hospitals and universities.  This will have <Col N="253" /> the effect of virtually closing them down. That is the seriousness of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been uncharacteristically quiet for the past few hours because I was listening to a very interesting discussion.  Clinical trials are still going on and the fact that this Bill is being introduced has not prevented people from holding clinical trials.  They are going on with the same frequency and in the same range as they were at the time this Bill obviously became necessary.  The provision in this Bill about insurance does not apply to people who are currently conducting clinical trials.  It seems to have emerged that, in all of these trials, if something happens to participants which is not attributable to malpractice, they are currently eligible for no compensation at all.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the position is in the area of State hospitals where some clinical trials are being carried out.  All doctors as a condition of their work have a requirement to have cover.  What is the position of doctors in State and health board hospitals who are doing clinical trials if something goes wrong and a participant dies or is seriously injured?  Who can that participant sue or are they precluded from suing?  My suspicion is that they would not be precluded from suing but that either the individual doctor would be liable to substantial damages which he would be personally liable for and which the medical defence union or the other body would not cover, or alternatively the State, through the health board, would become liable for those damages.  If it were the case that either the health board or the individual are to be liable for substantial damages and there is currently no cover available for people under that, until such time as this section or a similar section comes into force, the Minister should request or indeed direct that all clinical trials should cease.  There is something highly irresponsible &mdash;</P>

If the position is as the discussion on the amendments has suggested, it is highly irresponsible to be conducting clinical trials anywhere because of the risk that a participant will get no compensation if she or he is injured and the possible risk that the State could be liable for quite substantial damages in the case of a State hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be able to put it in a more acceptable perspective by pointing out that at the moment the National Drugs Advisory Board's voluntary scheme which is currently in existence ensures the availability of cover in the event of an accident, sheer stupidity, or totally unforeseen circumstances arising. That is one of the aspects taken into account under the NDAB scheme.  The NDAB are very conscious of this and are acutely aware of the prospect of damages being sought against that body and, as such, have had intensive discussion with us.  That is an entirely different matter. That is a question of State giving cover to a State body.  That would not arise under this framework.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in effect, firms up the voluntary arrangement and puts it into a statutory framework.  This is a framework in which people will have to exercise, in future, considerably greater caution.  It will be more restrictive.  Any doctor or dentist who is involved in a trial will perforce have to ask the sponsor to produce his insurance policy.  There is a degree of State cover in so far as we have a particular relationship with the NDAB.  This is not State cover for people participating in trials but it is a matter of ongoing discussion between ourselves and the NDAB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally we give cover, for example, to consultants under the common contract. We pay the insurance cover for consultants <Col N="255" /> in health boards under the common contract and I often wonder why.  My predecessor, a certain parliamentary colleague of mine, was quite capable of signing anything.  That was one of the things he signed when he signed the common contract in 1979.  We are still paying for it. I have paid much money in the past four years on malpractice.  If the public only knew they would have a different view of those kind of developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary common contract cover does not give cover for this situation.  Therefore, in future there will have to be greater strictures.  I have removed myself from that section to the extent that, in future, the ethics committee will have to be satisfied.  After all, the ethics committee will be composed of persons with great professional experience and competence in this area.  They will, so to speak, take each trial as it comes.  It is quite an exceptional trial. They may exercise great caution and decide to have exceptional cover insurance for that insurance policy.  I have no doubt that responsibility, as it is devolved on them, will be effectively discharged.</P>
      <P>I must say to doctors and dentists that, if they have been conducting trials without adequate protective insurance for the participants, when this enactment comes into force they will have to change their practice.  I could not possibly see the State taking on any further indemnity.  I have had difficulty enough with successive Ministers for Finance and will have sufficient difficulty with them over the years. There is no way any Minister for Finance would accept an open-ended indemnity for clinical trials which, in effect, would be perforce brought on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very often appreciated that in Ireland we have a flourishing international pharmaceutical community with major R and D working here with tremendous added value.  The best part of 20,000 people are employed in the industry. Approximately 10 to 15 per cent are in new Irish innovative industry.  I do not <Col N="256" /> think that that industry would oppose an imposition on them which will prove to be so onerous that they will transfer their business, so to speak, to Bangladesh or to those parts of the world where there may be less cover provided.  In view of the growing international and public concern in relation to this situation, companies who come here will see the package and if they wish to conduct trials they will know what the outside parameters on their liability are going to be.  They will know fully that there is a rigour in force and that therefore there is a degree of stability in the area.  To that extent they will accept the provision.</P>
    <P>I would like to sharply separate all this from ordinary medical malpractice or ordinary medical accidents.  Clinical trials are very different.  In any event the result will probably be that the ethics committees will come to the conclusion that the current conventional cover for quite a number of trials will be adequate.  As we well know the risk parameters of many substances on trial are fairly well defined before they are subjected to human trial capacity.  They will have gone through the battery in many cases of major trials.  I could see a situation developing, for example, where billions of dollars are being spent in a desperate attempt to see if we can get a vaccine relating to AIDS. It will probably be at least &mdash; I am assured by medical staff &mdash; seven to ten years before anything worthwhile is seen in that area despite the amount of money being spent.  In that period it may well be that there will be clinical trials conducted on different substances, some of which could have horrific consequences for participants. In those cases one would boggle at the amount of insurance involved.  But such is the capacity of people to wish to be involved in trials that; for one reason or another, one would have to seek cover.  I can certainly see that kind of situation developing.  These are my views on it.  I doubt very much that I could accommodate the amendments because if I did the fundamental purpose of this Bill could be in jeopardy and on that basis I would be classified as an enemy of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have understood the Minister on this point, he takes a pragmatic approach and says that the State, meaning the Department, are definitely not going to be involved because they are already involved in malpractice indemnity cover for consultants and that is bad enough, goodness knows.  Surely it is much more appropriate that they should be involved here.  Let consultants look after their own malpractice indemnity. Surely the Department have a much clearer role in relation to promoting clinical trials for the benefit of the public good.  I am separating the case.  I think we are all agreed that pharmaceutical companies generally can cover themselves.  If they are the sponsors of clinical trials they can cover all risks involved.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has dealt with the position of the hospital consultant or doctor, or the academic, or the person who has been conducting trials in pursuit of desired objectives of testing the effects of a particular drug or appliance and who could not continue to do so, or could not do so, without having insurance cover.  I do not think the Minister has answered some of the concerns that have been expressed.  He has not referred, for example, to the practice in Britain where the State does assume responsibility in that area.</P>
      <P>Finally &mdash; and this is the reason I came back on this &mdash; I would like the Minister to spell out for those of us who do not automatically know it, what the National Drugs Advisory Board voluntary scheme is in relation to insurance cover in this area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the necessity the Minister sees for having doctors, dentists and others covered by insurance when conducting clinical trials. The Minister makes it clear in the section how the treatment of patients is obviously excluded from what we are discussing <Col N="258" /> here.  We said a few minutes ago that a drug test is quite distinguishable from the treatment of a patient in a hospital.  They are two different situations.  There are a considerable number of routine tests going on regularly in hospitals and in universities and I wonder to what extent they will be covered by the necessity for insurance? I can understand the distinction the Minister is trying to make between a new drug being tested on a person who is prepared to make himself or herself available for the purpose of that drug test, and the routine testing of different applications and different uses of not just one drug but a series of drugs which occurs on a regular basis in a hospital or university. I wonder whether insurance is there for what I have just described, or is it there for the big drug tests?  Would the Minister clarify when it is necessary for insurance to be taken out?  Is it happening in every drug test?  It might not be done purely in the interests of the patient's welfare.  It might be looking at the use of a drug or a combination of drugs.  As I have been advised this is done by people in the field. I do not understand whether the question posed is being addressed and it needs to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one brief thing in response to what the Minister said and I want to support him completely since he did raise it.  The common contract for consultants is the most outrageous public service contract I have ever had the misfortune to read.  The Minister knows the circumstances under which I had reason to read it and, therefore, I will not go into it because they are personal reasons.  It is an outrageous document and, as one who is a signatory to a contract in another area of the public service which is quite a reasonable contract, I consider what went into that contract is a disgrace, and it is a disgrace to whoever was responsible for introducing it.  The small matter of the medical defence fees is only a small part of a quite outrageous contract.  I agree with the Minister that it should never have been allowed in the first place.  That is 100 votes among my constituents gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the point raised by Senator FitzGerald first.  There is no doubt that where the hospital consultant decides on a clinical basis to have a routine series of tests which may border on a trial basis, he has cover under his ordinary insurance and under the common contract.  Equally quite a number of hospital boards are now beginning to carry separate insurance to cover actions being taken against the board as distinct from the consultant.  The consultant may be a junior hospital doctor and he may be in Iraq at the time the action is taken in Ireland.  He may have emigrated and be gone from the jurisdiction.  I am not suggesting that happens often, but I have know cases where it has happened. On that basis the ordinary hospital cover and the ordinary medical defence union cover are paid by the State in both instances and in practice would give cover for the doctor concerned.  That clarification is fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>As regards the voluntary cover scheme, it has been the practice that the NDAB have to be satisfied.  Senator Robinson raised that point.  But there are no internal criteria laid down by the department with the NDAB as to the precise parameters of that insurance cover. Therefore, I am not in a position to elaborate on it.  The insurance phrasing used in the Bill is wide enough to cover a whole range of trials from new preparations to well-known ones.  The ethics committee &mdash; who are the key to this issue &mdash; must be satisfied.  They will have considerable independence to make up their own mind as to the sufficiency of the policy and the adequacy of the funds which could be available.  On that basis the Bill is reasonable. It gives cover and, above all else, the whole thrust of this Bill is to give cover to the participant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other people involved &mdash; the Minister, the ethics committee, the doctor, the insurance company, but the thrust of the Bill has been to place the rights and well-being of the participant to the forefront.  Again in that section we come to the fundamental purpose of the Bill.  I would have great difficulty in construing it in any other way or endeavouring <Col N="260" /> to be more even-handed in any other way.  I do not think it will impose on the medical profession who are very experienced particularly at senior consultant level.  The consultants are very experienced on the question of new drugs, the question of experimentation and the question of trials and I would be very surprised to find any undue imposition on those consultants directly involved.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 46 not moved.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In the granting of compensation referred to in subsection (1), due consideration shall be given to any contributory negligence on the part of the participant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am repeating what other speakers have been saying.  During the conduct of a trial, if it is clearly proven that there is an element of misrepresentation, or whatever, on the part of the participant to the trial, despite all the best efforts of the screening and the monitoring process at the start and right through until people are satisfied that the drug has left the system, the ordinary common law, the ordinary legal <Col N="261" /> process of contributory negligence, should apply and this factor should come into play in the settlement of any subsequent claim that might arise.  The Minister has referred to a no fault situation but would he agree to this one amendment to ensure that, if blame attaches to the other side, that is appropriately considered in any claim settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express the fears I expressed on Second Stage and to support this amendment.  Senator Fallon is seeking more accurately to draw out from the Minister exactly what the position will be concerning the method by which people who have suffered some injury or loss as a result of a trial can get compensation. If I take Senator Fallon's point what he means is as follows.  You could imagine a situation where a person would mislead those who were conducting the clinical trial, would have himself included in the test panel, if you like, for the clinical trial, and as a result of the non-disclosure of certain vital information would be damaged by the clinical trial itself and then would seek compensation.</P>
      <P>That is very close to what I said on Second Stage.  I thought what we were seeking in terms of a policy of insurance was a no fault insurance and I wonder whether that is indeed possible.  The Minister speculated earlier in this debate on the enormous premiums that would be looked for in the case where somebody was, for example, conducting clinical trials into the question of AIDS, because injury or loss as a result of the trial would be very likely at least in the initial stage of such a dramatic clinical situation.  I wonder whether the Minister could cast more light on this whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's understanding of this amendment in so far as it relates to the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in section 9, where it talks not just about the necessity to provide compensation but &ldquo;to provide appropriate compensation&rdquo;.  Does that mean it will only be necessary to provide insurance for compensation which is as a result of the negligence of the person conducting the trial and is that the meaning of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;?  Would the <Col N="262" /> word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; as it is now cover the situation envisaged by Senator Fallon?</P>
    <P>In other words, would it be open to those who are defending an action for a claim by a person who misled those conducting the trial and got himself included as a result of so misleading to say that person is not entitled to any appropriate compensation, or the appropriate compensation for that person is nil because of the way in which he has conducted himself? This whole question is the type of liability that will attach to those conducting the trials.  That has to be more fully spelled out within the legislation and, in so far as Senator Fallon's amendment seeks to do that, I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fallon's amendment, well intentioned as it is, is unnecessary.  It is a very well established principle, as we know, that in assessing compensation due regard is given to contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and, on that basis, the inevitable inclusion of that principle arises.  That is the first point I make in relation to the amendment.  It may be that it is a matter for decision by the courts and it would not be appropriate to include the provision in the legislation as such.</P>
      <P>As regards the second point raised by Senator O'Leary quite understandably, the recommendation I have had from the Attorney General's office and from the parliamentary draftsman has been that the phrase &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; is the correct phrase to include in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have looked at it.  We have considered whether it was too vague or too generalised, but we have been assured, and I broadly accept the argument, that there are so many exigencies relating to a particular compensation claim, as we well know, which have to be taken into account, that it would be quite impossible to elaborate any further in the section. There would inevitably arise the whole gamut of the circumstances of the individual concerned who participated in the trial in an endeavour by the court to arrive at appropriate compensation.  But the court would have to define that, not <Col N="263" /> the Minister, nor for that matter the person seeking compensation.  The ethics committee would have to be satisfied that, such were the risks inherent in this particular development, this new trial, that they could give an assurance to themselves and, indeed, to any inquirer that there were adequate compensation provisions in existence in the event of anything going quite wrong.  That is, in effect, the basis of the section and I doubt very much that we could improve upon it any further this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am seeking to get from the Minister is extremely relevant to the amendment which Senator Fallon has put down.  Is the Minister saying in regard to these trials that the normal rule of law will apply, that a person will only be responsible in law where they have been negligent, if they have not been negligent they will not be responsible?  Is that what the Minister understands and is that what his advisers understand the words `appropriate compensation' to mean?  In other words, is there going to be as a result of this a strict liability or are the normal rules of law going to apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can envisage and as far as I have been assured, and the whole thrust of my argument in relation to this Bill is that the normal laws of compensation would arise in terms of assessment.  If, for example, an applicant supplied wrong information either as a participant or to another person, that would be reckoned as part of the argument within the trial proceedings.  Inevitably that would come up and in section 11 we have incorrect and misleading information covered where:</P>
      <P>(1) No person shall provide or cause to be provided to another person any information, evidence, documents, samples or other materials &mdash; .... which are incorrect or misleading.</P>
      <P>That encompasses that aspect of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>When you talk in terms of sections 11 and 12 you are talking of offences where you are being <Col N="264" /> prosecuted.  There is an absolute difference between offences and being prosecuted. It appears that in section 12 the Minister is making a halfway house between a strict liability offence and an ordinary defence.  You do not have to prove <i>mens rea</i> but you are given a reasonable defence under subsection (2). That is rather different from an appropriate compensation which is the civil action basically where the person who was injured by the clinical trial would be taking an action for negligence.  What Senator O'Leary is asking is if it would be like an ordinary action for negligence which would allow for contributory negligence in the normal way and is that what &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; means, or has it any other meaning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little bit confused now because I understood the precise reason why section 9 was inserted in this Bill was to make provision for a situation where negligence did not exist because of the possibility of a risk existing which could not be foreseen in which case, therefore, no negligence on the part of the person conducting the trial could exist and none could be alleged, but that there was the reality of the possibility of people suffering serious damage and possibly death because of an unforeseen consequence of a trial.  That is, after all, why we have trials.  If there were not the possibility of unforeseen circumstances and unforseen injuries, we would not need trials.  It is because these things can happen that we need trials.</P>
      <P>I understood that the function of section 9 was to provide that people had to have insurance not just to cover injuries resulting from negligence on the part of the people conducting clinical trial but injuries resulting from entirely unforeseeable happenings.  If that is the case I do not understand how the ordinary rules that apply to assessing compensation where negligence is involved can apply in a situation where negligence does not arise in the first case.  Not for the first time I find what Senator O'Leary has to say interesting and worthy of further elaboration.</P>

      <P>I think circumstances can arise where a particular company in asking a prospective participant to complete a questionnaire does not disclose to the individual concerned the full details of the dangers inherent in the trial.  That would be a very grave matter of omission and would feature in very large measure in a civil action for compensation within the ordinary compensation claims. Equally in reverse, where a participant completed a questionnaire and quite deliberately left out of the questionnaire &mdash; for the sake of argument &mdash; that he had failed to record the fact that he had been on a trial for another drug perhaps five or six days before with a different company, that would feature.  This section is so framed that it is rather open, and deliberately kept somewhat open, because if we imposed rigid definitions in this section we could frustrate the prospect of compensation. If, on the other hand, we left it totally open-ended, everybody who participated in the trial could claim that he saw a young nurse and he suffered whip lash in his neck and this was the inherent part of his trial and he required &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo;.  One has to be very careful in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not enlightening us any more than we were enlightened previously.  I suspect the reality is that nobody in the Minister's Department knows the answer to the question and if that is the case the Minister should go away and think about it again.  Unfortunately it is necessary to go slightly beyond the amendment itself but because of the contributory negligence aspect it is likely to go along.  What we are proposing to amend deals with &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; for each participant who may suffer a loss or injury as a result of a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than explain my problem to the Minister I should explain to him that there are two stages in assessing compensation for any individual who alleges he suffered loss or damage.  One of the things to be established is whether the person was liable.  If the person was liable, what was the monetary value of <Col N="266" /> the injury suffered?  It is possible for a person to be liable for an action but for the court to decide there was no real injury &mdash; you are not entitled to compensation as a result of the liability but only as a result of the injury.  Similarly, it is possible and, indeed, very likely that you could have an injury without any liability.</P>
    <P>I have a bad injury to my back but it did not arise from any wrong that anyone did to me.  In other words, there are two elements of the case which are necessary.  If you superimpose those general principles on section 9, either in its original form or as it is proposed to be amended by Senator Fallon, you say that under section 9 there should be &ldquo;appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss...&rdquo; In other words, every participant who suffers injury or loss appears to be eligible.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;each&rdquo; seems to suggest that it is open to everybody and that there is strict liability.  That is somewhat changed and restricted by the use of the words &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo;. What is the meaning of the words &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo;?  In other words, would it be open to a defendant in an action to say: &ldquo;Yes, he or she, the plaintiff, did suffer loss or injury which is worth £50,000.&rdquo;  The appropriate compensation in this case is nil because there was no negligence on the defendant's part.</P>
    <P>Do the words &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; reintroduce or reinforce the concept of liability being at issue in these things?  It is my belief it should be there. At present I am not really concerned with whether it should be there or whether it should not be there; I am just trying to find out if it is there so that I will know whether to agree with the Minister. There is no point in the Minister saying there are cases where people give wrong information and that in his view a deduction for contributory negligence in those cases is possible.</P>
    <P>The question I have is actually much simpler than that.  Is there strict liability in respect of any injury done to a participant? Is that the intention of the section?  If it is not, what is the Minister's advice as to <Col N="267" /> the effect of the words &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo;? Is the use of the words &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; in the view of the Minister sufficient to reintroduce into the concept the full normal common law negligence arrangements?  Is that the meaning of `appropriate compensation'? There are two questions.  Does the Minister think there is strict liability?  If there is not strict liability, does the Minister think that the words `appropriate compensation' are sufficient to apply the normal rules of negligence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister answers perhaps I might put a supplementary question to what Senator O'Leary is saying.  Senator O'Leary spoke about strict liability and Senator Ryan said that regardless of whether there was negligence where a person is injured in a clinical trial they should receive compensation.  That is probably the intention because obviously it is one of the risks of these trials that there may be damage to a person even though there is no negligence.  In that case, does &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; mean that one does, as is suggested in Senator Fallon's amendment, take in the fact that the person may, for instance, have omitted to say that he was a diabetic or something of that sort which would have an enormous effect on the way the drug affected him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if one says that &ldquo;appropriate compensation&rdquo; just brings you back into the ordinary negligence field, then the section is saying that people who conduct clinical trials must carry insurance against negligence.  A person such as a solicitor, barrister and so on may feel that he must carry insurance against negligence but he is not necessarily statutorily forced to do so.  Motorists are forced by statute to carry insurance against negligence.  Is this merely saying that one has to have insurance in case there is a negligence action taken against one?  Or is it saying that wherever an injury arises from a clinical trial, regardless of whether there was negligence, compensation will be paid to the person but the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; may mean the only compensation that will be <Col N="268" /> paid will take into account the fact that the person has done something stupid?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We found it difficult to strike a balance in framing this section and I would not deny that in any way.  It is not an absolute &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; provision.  If that were there, as Senators are aware, a participant who deliberately misled the conductors of the trial would receive compensation.  If, on the other hand, the criteria laid down before a person undergoes a trial have been neglectfully conducted by the participants of the trials, such as, for example, the medical examination that persons undergo before participating in the trial which is stated quite clearly here, if they fail to monitor the health of the participant during and after the trial and if they fail to provide an independent medical examination for the participants, if all or any one of these provisions are neglected, the court's assessment of the degree of negligence would arise.</P>
      <P>We are in a unique situation here in terms of our own drafting of a provision of this nature.  As the title of the Bill states, we are dealing with a situation where compensation can arise in relation to the administration which may have a harmful effect.  It is rather an unusual effort to bring under law a prospect of compensation on that basis.  We have kept it as flexible as possible but the records of the ethics committee and all of the data would have to go before a court and reach a unanimous judgment as to whether there was an inherent danger to which the individual has subjected himself and whether there was adequate compensation provision if it went wrong. I would like to find out what provisions the BBC had in relation to the individual who offered to undergo a particularly dangerous trial.  It would be interesting to see how they covered that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two stages outlined by Senator O'Leary are encompassed in the section itself.  It is not unlimited and, at the same time, we have to have sufficient monetary prospects for the individual who is injured as a result of the trial.  It will be very difficult.  If a trial goes wrong in that <Col N="269" /> framework it can badly go wrong.  God help the individual who is claiming because it is he who in many respects must prove it and will be the subject of the claim.  I am in the hands of the House but I do not see how the House can devise a framework which would be more appropriate for a compensation prospect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be confusing two things: in fact, we may be confusing them ourselves.  Perhaps if I could give a hypothetical example to explain exactly what I mean.  Let us take the case of a drug company testing a drug for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.  The person to whom the drug is given, and who is ultimately injured, appears healthy.  He passes all the normal tests, has no blood pressure and so on.  However, he does not know and the tester does not know nor is the tester expected to know, that the person is suffering from something which is not obvious, such as glaucoma, an illness which is not easily detected in a normal medical examination &mdash; a person can have perfect eyesight and suffer from glaucoma.  If he takes this drug one of the side effects could be disastrous for his eyesight but if it goes through the courts in the normal way there would be no negligence against the medical practitioner because he could not reasonably have been expected to know that the person had glaucoma or that glaucoma was one of the conditions to which there would be an adverse comment.  The person therefore is stopped from being adequately compensated in the courts. The Minister says we will have a policy of insurance in operation.  That policy is not a substitution for the right of the person to go to court but an additional safeguard.  Is it the Minister's intention that the policy of insurance should cover that?  Here is a situation where there is absolutely no negligence.  Is it the Minister's intention that the policy of insurance should cover a person who is injured where there is no negligence on his own part and no negligence on the part of the person who conducted the trial, but it is just a side effect which happens and nobody knows about it until it does happen. <Col N="270" /> Does the Minister envisage that that kind of situation would be covered by that policy of insurance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer is in the affirmative.  The individual concerned can be entirely blameless.  The company concerned can be entirely blameless.  It can arise in the case of the example I have given.  We still want to have a situation where compensation is provided in the inherent thrust of the Bill because there are risks involved.</P>

      <P>That is a contingency compensation provision effectively.  Unquestionably in the years ahead there will be companies who will dispute the amount of compensation and they may infer that there was massive neglect.  On the other hand, the applicant may infer that he was misled in the inducement offered to him to undergo the trial and that had he known the prospective harmful effects, which could have been brought about, or had he been forewarned of them, he would not have undergone the trial.  That is my interpretation of it.  The example given has helped us to clarify this issue.</P>

      <P>I understand that.  I am very happy to have the situation brought about that, where there is no fault on the side of the person participating, he or she should be compensated.  I am in 100 per cent agreement with that.  What I do not agree with, in this or in any other case, is that where there is positive fault on that person's part that he should be compensated automatically.  They may be compensated for other reasons, perhaps because of an overwhelming fault on the other side.  If one takes the simple situation where there is absolutely no fault on the person who is administering the drug and 100 per cent fault on the person who is taking it, I do not think that person should be compensated.  I am very happy that a person should be compensated where there is fault on the part of the person who is giving the drug or, alternatively, where there is no fault on either side.</P>

      <P>We have, for instance, legislation about animal trials where there are inspectors who are authorised to visit premises where such trials are conducted to ensure that the regulations and the laws drawn up to protect animals are being enforced.  It appears that there <Col N="272" /> is no provision in this Bill dealing with clinical trials on human beings for any equivalent inspectorate who could do a similar job in the case of clinical trials.  It seems rather peculiar that we have an inspectorate dealing with trials on animals and yet we have not necessarily similar but comparable trials being conducted on people and no system of routine or on-the-spot inspections to ensure that all that has been said here about how things are to be done, how people are to be looked after and so on, is actually being done on a day to day basis.  Is there a particular reason the Minister has not made some provision for inspectors, whether officers of his Department or officers of the health boards, to visit clinics on a day to day basis and have the right to see records and the right to talk to people without any forewarning in order to ensure that what we all want to have done is actually done?</P>

We might, for example, ask a director of community care in a health board area or somebody with clinical experience to act on our behalf.  The company would have to agree as a precondition that full access would be given.  This can readily be encompassed in the seeking of information not just simply exchanging correspondence.</P>

I take it that the Minister would decide when the Bill would be operative in different areas and for different purposes.  I would like the Minister to be more specific on section 2.</P>

      <P>This section is a very standard section in any legislation such as this.  It makes standard provision for the bringing into operation of the Act or various parts of the Act by order of the Minister.  It allows the Act or various sections of it to be brought into operation in relation to a particular area or areas.  It will allow for phased introduction of the Act taking account of policy priorities and staffing and, indeed, other resources.  It is, as I said at the outset, fairly typical of this type of legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not too happy with that reply.  When the Minister talks about different areas, can she define any particular area she has in mind?  Does she consider that Dublin city would be the first area affected by the implementation of this Bill, or parts of Dublin, or certain areas in the Dublin metropolitan area, rather than the rural areas of Ireland? Under that definition, has the Minister power to implement it in different areas? Do I take it that Dublin may be a priority area, because it might be more polluted than other parts of the country?  Is Dublin the main area we are talking about under the Bill, or the less densely populated areas throughout the country?</P>

There is provision &mdash; and, indeed, it could be that circumstances would warrant it &mdash; that certain areas of the country would come under specific parts of the Act, rather than nationally at one time.  It may be Dublin.  It could be somewhere else where we would have a particular problem that is so far unseen.  The provision is there.

Both of these matters are, as suggested, regulated under other legislative codes: the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, and the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, respectively.

      <P>The amendment is to delete &ldquo;to be liable&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;to be considered liable&rdquo;, in line 24.  To accept this amendment would make the Act more workable. Primarily, it would give room for discretion.  We must remember that this is not always a black and white area; it is a grey area.

The amendment would beg the question of who is to do the considering &mdash; the person responsible for the pollutant, the person aggrieved by it, the local authority or the courts?  As the section stands, the word &ldquo;liable&rdquo; carries its ordinary meaning in the context of being &ldquo;apt to&rdquo;.

      <P>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv) cause a nuisance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This clause to &ldquo;cause a nuisance&rdquo;, would certainly improve the Bill. As far as I remember, there is no reference to a nuisance in the Bill with the exception of section 24, page 15.  It says that: &ldquo;The occupier of any premises shall not cause or permit an emission from such premises in such a quantity, or in such a manner, as to be a nuisance to any person.&rdquo;  This is the only place in the Act that I have come across the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; is not defined, which I feel it should be.  I recall that the Minister, on Second Stage, dealing with certain proposals of mine then with regard to, for example, smell and noise, stated, in particular with regard to smell, that this would be covered as a nuisance, but, in fact, I do not think it is. While the sub-clause (iii) to &ldquo;impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment&rdquo; might very well be taken in the same context, I do not think it would be as forceful.</P>
      <P>Might I also say that, with regard to another amendment which Senator O'Toole and I have in regard to noise, I think it would be important that there would be a reference in this Bill to nuisance, because it would be more aptly considered relevant to the Bill if we included this amendment.  As far as I know, in dealing with nuisance in the courts I think a prosecution is normally under the 1798 Act, which is a very old one, and the definition of &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; in that Act is totally out of date.  I would like to see a reference to nuisance in this section. I do not feel that sub-clause (iii) is a suitable substitute or is, in fact, sufficient to deal with the problem of nuisance.  I feel this should be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that this amendment is necessary.  Impairment of or interference with amenities or the environment seems to include adequately the concept of nuisance.  In any event, we are only dealing here in section 4 with the definition of the term &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo;.  Nuisance is explicitly dealt with later on in the Bill at section 24(2).  This places an absolute prohibition on any emission from any premises, domestic or non-domestic, which might cause nuisance.

For example, on page 8, we have no definition of nuisance. As I have already said, I accept that to a certain degree sub-clause (iii) of this section has the same effect as the amendment which Senator O'Toole and I have suggested; but, to widen the scope and to include a later amendment which Senator O'Toole and I have dealing with noise, it would be very important that this amendment would be accepted.  To a certain extent it would seem to be that if this amendment is not accepted there would be no possibility of the amendment relating to noise being accepted.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could respond to the particular amendment before us here?  Failing any definition of nuisance <i>per se</i>, even though I accept, as I think the Senator does, that section 4 (iii) effectively defines nuisance &mdash; and in fact subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) effectively define nuisance &mdash; and there is a very well established common law history interpreting the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; in our courts generally.  Also, if it is not defined specifically in a Bill, or if anything like this is not defined in a Bill, it reverts to the ordinary dictionary definition of the word.  A &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; is quite clear and specific in <Col N="283" /> the dictionary definition in this case. There is no ambiguity as to what we mean by nuisance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one further point I would like to make in relation to that.  The big problem about the 1798 Act is that, while it does deal to some extent with nuisance, the fines are too small to be effective.  If it were included in this Bill, where the fines for the penalties are quite substantial, even from that point of view a case could be made for including this.  I have already submitted to the Minister that to some extent paragraph (iii) covers what we have in mind.</P>
      <P>The final point I should like to make is that in relation to that antiquated law the penalties are too small to be effective.  If it were included in the Bill, the penalties are so big that we would have a different situation completely.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (3), a reference in this Act to the use of the best practicable means to prevent or limit an emission shall be construed as meaning the provision and proper maintenance, use, operation and supervision of facilities which, having regard to all the circumstances, are the most suitable for such prevention or limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read in the media that, for example, <i>An Taisce</i> feel that &ldquo;available&rdquo; would be a better word to use than &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;, in other words, &ldquo;of the best available means&rdquo;.  This would involve the use of the most up to date technology.  I should <Col N="286" /> like the Minister to comment on this point.  In regard to taking into consideration all the circumstances, for instance, would such an aspect as threatening redundancies be taken into account by the Minister?  Also in this connection, when the nature and effect of the emission, the age of the plant and the cost involved are taken into account.  I am sure the benefits which would accrue from whatever expense would be involved would be reasonable.  I should like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I had just made reference to this, and I will repeat it.  These directions on best practical means will be of an administrative character and will not have the force of regulations.  There will be no question of submitting them to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the best practical means and the best available means can best be understood if we look at it in the context that this law will have to apply to existing plant as well as to new plant.  It would be reasonable enough to insist on the best available means for new plant, but often it would be excessive to insist on that for existing plant or to superimpose the best available technology on the existing plant might not be effectively reasonable by any stretch of the imagination. &ldquo;Best practical means&rdquo; is a flexible concept and, in relation to new plant, can involve technology approximating or equal to best available means.  But in practice it would made no sense to stipulate &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo; as an absolute legal requirement.  This would be highly inflexible.  If it could be shown that advanced technology in relation to a particular process existed anywhere in the world, at whatever cost, that is the technology which would have to be required of plants setting up in Ireland. The EC are alive to this point.  Their directive specifies a requirement of: &ldquo;Best available technology not involving excessive cost&rdquo;.  In practice this will be the meaning of best practical means in relation to new plant.  &ldquo;Best available technology not involving excessive cost&rdquo;<Col N="287" /> is the EC wording which effectively translates to &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that if &ldquo;best available means&rdquo; in effect means use of the most up-to-date technology, it is, for a start, more scientific.  Therefore, it would appear to me that possibly it would be better to use that term.  I understood the Minister agreed with this, having regard to the question of costs.  It appears to me that whether one uses the phraseology &ldquo;the best available means&rdquo; or &ldquo;the best practical means&rdquo;, there is a kind of vagueness about it.  To some extent it extends the objective, except that it is submitted to precise scientific examination.  I understand that the Minister is satisfied that this wording serves best the situation.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also deal with the circumstances and what is taken into consideration. For example, would the threat of redundancies be taken into consideration when determining the circumstances? Would the threat of redundancies, for example, be of greater importance than some scientific research which would suggest that emissions should be curtailed, reduced or perhaps abolished altogether?  In those circumstances what would be the weight of a situation of threatening redundancies? In other words, would that, of itself, in special circumstances lead us to a situation in which nothing would be done about emissions which would be polluting the atmosphere?</P>

    <P>(iii)  the costs which would be incurred in providing, maintaining, using, operating and supervising the facilities concerned,..</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that redundancies would be one of the factors that could be considered among the costs.  They would not be absolute and there is a price level beyond which we are not prepared to go for environmental pollution.  But we are really talking about common sense and applying the best practical solution to a problem that may or may not arise.  I hope the Senator would agree that under subparagraph (iii) his concern about redundancies and whether they would be considered could be allayed.  They are a factor in relation to the costs.</P>

      <P>The new wording and subsection being inserted by these amendments are necessary, first, to ensure that the status of &ldquo;existing plant&rdquo;, and hence exemption from licensing under Part III, is not conferred on any unauthorised development.  While it is for the Planning Acts to control unauthorised development nevertheless it would be invidious for the provisions of this Bill to appear to condone the existence of plants illegally developed without <Col N="289" /> planning permission and to give these plants, if they exist, the benefit of exemption from air pollution licensing.  The amendments will ensure that such unauthorised plant will be immediately subject to the licensing requirements of this Bill. I am sure that no Senator would disagree with that.  We are proposing to delete the words relating to plant licensed under the 1962 Act regulations because of the greater simplicity of administration which would result.  Regulations made in 1985 under the 1962 Act require the licensing of works involved in the extraction or recovery of certain metals from scrap metal, waste material and waste cable.  As originally provided for, these industrial plants would have been immediately licensable under Part III without transitional arrangements, whereas alkali works registered under the 1906 Act would not.  The amendments place both types of works on the same footing.  They will have to observe any previous obligations on them under the Sanitary Services Act, 1962, or the Alkali, etc.  Works Act, 1906, until such time as they are brought within the licensing system of this Bill.</P>

Therefore the matter would again come before this House and the Dáil for affirmation, when Senators would have an opportunity of expressing their opinions if they were not happy with any proposals in relation to the variance at that stage.</P>

      <P>We are proposing amendment No. 40 to put it beyond doubt that mining operations in waste disposal are industrial processes to which the licensing provisions of Part III apply. This is necessary to ensure proper control of mine tailings and should enable local authorities to deal with problems such as arose at Silvermines where, in dry conditions, dust arising from waste was blown around surrounding areas.  Amendment No. 8 is a consequential provision to ensure consistency of wording under section 7 and the Third Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo; on page 7, in section 7, seems to be very comprehensive.  It includes any furnace, incinerator, grate or stove whether open or closed or any other place of combustion. Then in page 8 there is given a definition of &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; to mean and I quote:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;any building or structure or any part of any building or structure (including any ancillary building or structure) which is used, or intended to be used, solely for human habitation but does not include &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a curtilage or garden, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a building which contains more than one dwelling and which has a fireplace with a maximum heating capacity exceeding 45 kW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister: what would be the position of a building which included two or three flats?  would each of them be considered a private dwelling?  With <Col N="292" /> regard to the output from the fireplace, of 45 kW, that seems a very arbitrary output. In an ordinary domestic situation the output from a fireplace would be something in the region of three to seven kilowatts.  Clearly 45 kilowatts is way above what one would expect to find in any domestic situation.  I would like the Minister to tell us how the figure of 45 kilowatts was arrived at with regard to a private dwelling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs A. Doyle Mrs A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The definitions of the words &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo; and &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; are the two that concern the Senator. &ldquo;Fireplace&rdquo; is defined to include any furnace, incinerator, grate or stove whether open or closed or any other place of combustion. This definition extends the meaning of &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo; beyond its usual connotation and, is, in effect, a technical definition for the purposes of Part IV of the Bill dealing with special control areas. It is also linked to the definition of &ldquo;authorised fireplace&rdquo; which means a fireplace specifically authorised for the purpose of a special control area order.  It is used in order to exclude from the definition of &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;&mdash; which I will come to in a minute &mdash; any premises, for example, multi-flats and condominiums with a boiler or furnace giving an output of more than 45 kilowatts.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; is quite restrictive.  The definition is required because private dwellings are excluded from obligations under section 24 (1) for the occupier of a premises to use the best practical means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission from the premises.  It would be unreasonable in the normal way to require such equipment, appliances and so on to be used in private dwellings of which there are now close to a million in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of protecting air quality therefore, it is essential that the exclusion relates only to bona fide private dwellings and that it does not extend to any type of operation being carried out in a back garden or shed which could give rise to air pollution, for example, the recovery of metal from scrap.  Therefore, the curtilage or <Col N="293" /> garden of a private dwelling is excluded from the definition as is a multi-dwelling building, for example, an apartment block.  The Senator referred to those with a furnace, a multi-dwelling building with a furnance with a heating capacity greater than 45 kilowatts.  However, a boiler house containing a central heating boiler for the dwelling is included in the definition of a dwellinghouse; &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; means any building including any ancillary building or structure etc.  I hope that satisfies the Senator?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the Minister of State an opportunity to comment again on certain fears I expressed on Second Stage.  I am concerned with a number of points.  First, I am concerned with this authorised person.  I have visions of a character going around the countryside spreading desolation and terror among houseowners and families. I am concerned that this character can emerge from two different sources.  It is bad enough that he or she should emerge from the one source.  I would expect there to be some measure of control by the local authority over the appointment and the activities of this officer.  I can accept that.  But I am concerned that this authorised officer can also be appointed by a person specified for that purpose. Therefore there are two methods of appointing these people, one, by the local authority and, two, by somebody else.  I want to know who the somebody else is before I comment further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow the point Senator Howard is making but perhaps from a different point of view. My concern relates to the authorised person and in relation to the definitions of the terms &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;. &ldquo;Premises&rdquo; are defined as that place to which an authorised person may go in the exercise of his powers under section 14 (1) of this Bill.  In considering the definition perhaps it is no harm to read into the record section 14 (1) because it is very relevant to the definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo;:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), an authorised person shall, for any purpose <Col N="294" /> connected with this Act, be entitled, at all reasonable times, to enter into any premises and to bring therein such other persons or equipment as he may consider necessary for the purpose.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are giving to this authorised person power to bring anybody he may wish with any equipment he may deem necessary into somebody's premises. What is a &ldquo;premises&rdquo;?  This is what concerns me.  I raised this in relation to the Control of Dogs Bill and I received very little succour from the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, in relation to the powers conferred by that Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Bill we will have the air pollution officer being entitled, as of right, without giving notice, to enter into one's premises.  That includes any outbuilding and curtilage thereof.  That means we are giving to the air pollution officer power to come in our front gate, come up our driveway, come into our sheds and outoffices, come into our garden to peer in our kitchen window.  That is the power we are conferring on authorised persons under this Bill.  We are not merely conferring that power on an authorised person.  We are conferring it on such other persons as he may deem necessary, not on such other persons we, as legislators, designate but on such other persons as the authorised person shall designate.  We are giving him that power to come right in, around our houses, into our sheds, barns, outoffices and gardens. I regard that as an invasion of privacy.</P>
    <P>It as a trend in legislation I do not like. I regard it as giving powers to a new form of policeman.  It is something I find very difficult to support.  It is interesting, if you go a little further to the definition of &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;, that is the place where we sleep and eat, although the definition is rather more difficult to follow than that. If we come back to section 14 (2) there are there defined the powers of the authorised person in relation to the private dwelling where we see that, to exercise those powers other than in cases of urgency, he must give 48 hours notice.  I believe the same provisions should apply in relation to outbuildings and curtilages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The concept of &ldquo;private dwelling,&rdquo; which is a place an authorised person may only enter having given 48 hours notice, should be expanded to include outoffices and curtilages, the area immediately around your dwelling house.  I might draw an analogy &mdash; I do not have the statute before me &mdash; there is a good analogy in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959.  From memory I think section 247 deals with the powers of water bailiffs in relation to an individual's property. Again a water baliff has certain difficulties in entering a private dwellinghouse, a garden or the curtilage thereof.  I cannot see why we are moving away from that principle in this Bill.  We moved away from it in the Control of Dogs Bill.  We will now be faced not merely with dog wardens marauding around one's garden, peering in one's kitchen window, but with the tremendous sight of dog wardens colliding with air pollution officers, these new policemen we are creating.  I would ask the Minister to think hard between now and Report Stage and to assure us that on Report Stage we will have an amendment that at least will ensure for our people the sancity of their homes.</P>

      <P>On a point of order &mdash; I hope it is a point of order &mdash; could I suggest to Senator Durcan that he would read section 14 (2) again?  I understood him to say that this authorised person who concerns him and me at this stage can enter a private dwelling having given 48 hours' notice.  I contend that he can enter at any time if he feels it is urgent.</P>

      <P>Yes, if he feels it is urgent. We hear a lot about the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment Bill, which a Member of the other House was speaking about yesterday.  If we are to have this type of power we will have to establish on a legislative basis a curriculum and examinations board for the air pollution officers.  I should like assurance that they will be people who have proper training to enable them to determine in an informed way what is a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but they are the powers in relation to specific types of properties that are defined in this section.  Therefore, it is relevant to raise them at this stage.  I would hope that the Minister would change the definitions contained in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I might reiterate a point I have just made.  In the interests of protecting air quality it is essential that the exclusion relates only to <i>bona fide</i> private dwellings and that it does not extend to any type of operation &mdash; this is the definition of &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; to which many Senators have referred &mdash; being carried out in a back garden or shed which could give rise to air pollution.  There are many of what I will call home industries, for want of a proper definition, small cottage industries that, thankfully, start in back gardens and garden sheds and that, hopefully, will go on to being something better and move into premises in their own right.  If there is any question of these causing air pollution or difficulty &mdash; and there have been examples of such small industries hidden away from view &mdash; if there is any question of these causing air pollution, we must have access to them to remedy the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example I give is the recovery of metal from scrap.  We have encountered this difficulty in greater Dublin in recent months.  This is a real problem.  It does not happen too often that people use their back garden or a garage, but it does occur.  Most of them go on to better things to benefit us all.  But there can be pollution caused &mdash; often by the unitiated &mdash; because generally it is uncontrolled.  That is why, if you like, the scenario painted by the Senator could be considered in this instance.  I do not envisage our setting <Col N="297" /> loose a whole army of peeping Toms. There would want to be very good reason or cause &mdash; as will become apparent as we go through the sections &mdash; for the lack of 48 hours' notice.  It can be done without such notice, as the Senator rightly pointed out, in the event of an emergency or any urgent consideration.  But it would want to be something grave.  We can all take it that that is very unlikely to happen with any regularity.  Ultimately, we should have the power, if necessary and if we are not getting any co-operation, to take action for the sake of the environment and for the sake of elimination of air pollution.  It is only in that perspective that it is deemed necessary to leave it in the definitions and ultimately follow through on section 14 in relation to the powers given these people.</P>
    <P>There were a couple of other points raised.  I am being reminded of the definition of &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.  An &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; will be a person appointed in writing by a local authority for the purpose of this Act, or appointed in writing by a person specified in regulations made under this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Local authorities will have to appoint people to carry out various tasks &mdash; for example, to carry out surveys of the types of fuels burned and types of fireplaces in an area prior to making a special control area order.  The Bill also allows for the transfer by regulations which are dealt with under section 21 &mdash; and I might refer the Senator to it now &mdash; of functions from local authorities to other persons or bodies.  They too will need to appoint people to carry out various duties.  That is the point that might be causing some problems &mdash; if there could be any indiscriminate transfer of these functions by a local authority to any other body.  It is really as defined in section 21, as is outlined there, that this provision is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the powers of &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; in relation to any purpose connected with this Bill.  For <Col N="298" /> clarity I might quote section 21 &mdash; Transfer of functions &mdash; as I understand this etc... this is causing some concern:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, by regulations, provide that any function conferred on a local authority under this Act shall, in addition to or in lieu of, being performed by a local authority, be performed by such other person (including the Minister or another local authority) or body of persons as may be specified.</P>
    <P>(2)  In particular and without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may provide for the performance of any function conferred on a local authority by this Act by a body established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, for that purpose.</P>
    <P>That is particularly what we might have in mind if there were a specific body at some time in the future, or if it was deemed necessary that we needed a specific body other than the local authority, to handle this at some time in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously an overlapping, and an overlapping of fears as well.  I might revert to section 7 and the methods by which an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; might be appointed.  I can accept lines 24 and 25 which say: &ldquo;(a) appointed in writing by a local authority to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Act...&rdquo; If we are serious about local democracy, at least within the local authority framework, there are the means whether through one's local representatives or whoever, of maintaining some sort of protection against the activities of an unreasonable individual, as I said the last day when speaking on this.  I accept that in 99 per cent of cases authorised persons will be reasonable. But in legislating we must always provide for the possibility of the crank or madman emerging.  The powers we are giving such <Col N="299" /> people, particularly if they were mad, would cause devastation in many areas. I would be satisfied enough with that method of appointment of an authorised person.  I do not want to dwell too much on section 21 at this stage, but there is a reference to other bodies.  There could be a proliferation of these authorised persons going around causing devastation. I would suggest to the Minister that she would seriously consider dropping that second channel of appointment and leave control of the appointment of an authorised person to local authorities.  In that way some of us will be satisfied that some measure of control can be exercised over the activities of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to agree with the Minister that to some extent it is confusing to be dealing with three sections simultaneously, sections 7, 14 and 21.  Here we are simply dealing with the definition of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.  The limits of his authority are really covered in section 14.  Senator M. O'Toole and I have an amendment to that section in relation to confining the power of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; with regard to private dwellings.  From that point of view it is important to be clear on exactly what is meant by &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;.  The Minister has mentioned people who set up small factories or other manufacturing plants in their back gardens.  We should be very reluctant, as the Minister has said, to interfere with them in any way in the present circumstances.  They have to contend with the Planning Acts and this will be an added problem.  Some of these people move on to greater things.  We should be very reluctant to use this legislation to interfere with anybody who would set up in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to private dwellings, it is important to know exactly what is meant. I followed the Minister in her explanation earlier on.  A private dwelling as is explained in section 7, is a building which contains not more than one dwelling and which has a fireplace with a maximum heating capacity exceeding 45 kW.  I take <Col N="300" /> it from that that a building in which there is a number of flats and where a communal type of central heating exists would not be considered a private dwelling. In a situation where there is a number of separate flats,in effect private dwellings which do not have communal systems of central heating but which have their own fireplaces, would each of those be considered a private dwelling or would that building not be considered as a number of private dwellings?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was in a position to accede to Senator Howard's request for removing section 7 (1) (b) which deals with the definition of &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;, I would effectively be making section 21 inoperable and that would not be in our best interest.  A corporate body of a kind other than a local authority could quite possibly be empowered to look after matters contained in this Bill.  We also have the situation whereby the IIRS or perhaps An Foras Forbartha may need to be called in to advise in technically difficult cases.  The local authority would want to be able to call in advice from a specialist body and transfer the authority on them to advise or help resolve a particular problem.  While I understand the Senator's fears I hope they are unfounded.  I feel they are needless in relation to this.  I hope I can put Senator Howard's mind at rest in relation to that. There are some very positive reasons why section 7 (1) (b) should remain.  It would be in the best interest of us all, particularly local authorities, in the whole area of preventing environmental pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzsimons.  No unnecessary interference with small time operators who hopefully will grow into big time operators is intended.  The only interference envisaged is if they cause pollution and if they are causing a nuisance to their neighbours or to the environment generally.  It would be too high a price to pay to let them continue regardless of the entrepreneurial benefits of what they may be at.  There is a balance here.  It is not on interference out of contrariness, it is purely with the protection of the environment in mind that we want <Col N="301" /> to hold the right if necessary &mdash; I hope it will not be necessary &mdash; to curtail operations that are causing environmental nuisance and air pollution.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons referred to apartment blocks, multi-dwelling buildings and condominiums and asked whether the individual units would be considered private dwellings rather than the whole lot taken as a block?  Basically it would depend on the heating system.  We are interested in exception only if there is a furnace with a heating capacity greater than 45 kW which heats the whole building or the whole block.  If each is individually heated and individually operated from, for example, a single fireplace I imagine they would be taken as individual buildings and private dwellings separately.  Where one of these great blocks is heated from a central furnace or a central heating system of some kind we need to be able to look into the matter. I hope I have covered the two aspects of the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that balance will be applied in those situations and I hope in practice that it will.  In a situation where one building would have ten flats I understand from what the Minister has said that if those flats do not have a communal system of central heating they are then private dwellings and if they have a communal system of central heating for all the buildings they are not considered as private dwellings at all.</P>

      <P>It is intended that Moneypoint will be fitted with a flue gas desulphurisation system and equipment capable of achieving at least 95 per cent sulphur removal as well as no control technology as a matter of urgency?  Will ESB power stations be fitted with emission controls?  Is it envisaged that that will be done in the immediate future?  When does the Minister think it would be necessary to fit Moneypoint with this type of equipment?  That is a new generating station and in the advent of this Air Pollution Bill which was introduced here many months ago one would have thought that at the outset consideration would have been given to having installed in Moneypoint proper facilities for the curtailment of emissions into the atmosphere that might cause air pollution in the future.  Indeed one would expect that a newly designed structure like Moneypoint would have all the modern controlled equipment to ensure that there would not be any pollution at all from the plant.  Perhaps it was felt that the fitting of equipment in the older ESB generating stations was not necessary, but it may be necessary in the future. There should be the most modern up-to-date equipment in Moneypoint for the control of any pollution that might be leaking from such a generating station. Has the Minister any views on that?  It is very relevant to this section.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that all the premises in the State are included under the scope of this Bill.  I take the Minister to imply that all State and local authorities buildings are included also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great defect in the Planning Act, 1963, and in subsequent Planning.  Acts that the State and the local authorities do <Col N="303" /> not have to submit plans for proposals. We all know the result of this in different situations and different places.  We can see it in Dublin Castle yard where there is a very insensitive scheme right up against one of our most beautiful buildings.  We can see it all over the country.  Local authorities can erect housing schemes and people living in the locality know nothing until the scheme has actually started.  This is wrong.  People should be given the opportunity to object.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that no premises will be exempt from the Bill.  I would also like to join with Senator O'Toole in what he said about Moneypoint.  I do not want to bring this up in the context of political point scoring but it undermines the credibility of the Government in bringing in this important Bill to the Seanad and at the same time being reponsible for the building at Moneypoint where there is no facility for the refinement to which Senator O'Toole referred.  We have had representations from An Taisce, Earth Watch and various other bodies concerned about this problem.</P>
    <P>While certain Members of the Government are very reassuring about the situation I am afraid I cannot accept that there is no danger of transboundary pollution. It has been very clearly brought home to us that that danger is inherent in the building without the refinement of a desulphurisation device.  It is an important scheme and has been designed and completed by Irish engineers and Irish personnel.  It is a scheme of which we are all proud.  It is unfortunate and wrong that this refinement was not included. I do not thing it would have been that prohibitive in terms of the whole investment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in years to come there will be a problem, perhaps not in the immediate vicinity but further afield, with regard to acid rain.  We have spoken about acid rain in this House and there is no doubt that this will cause a further problem of acid rain from now on.  Under sections 26, 27 and 28, where a local authority, either the authority in control of the immediate area or another local authority will have an opportunity to <Col N="304" /> object to a situation like that, is there a possibility that, while this work for all practical purposes has been completed, when this Bill comes into operation some body or group who feel strongly about it may object and perhaps cause an actual shut down in Moneypoint until these devices in the flue are located?</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Fitzsimons and Senator O'Toole that this Bill should apply to local authorities.  I do not share the view expressed by the Minister that section 8 can be construed as giving applicability to local authorities.  Section 8 is simply a statement of fact that the Bill, when enacted, will apply to premises belonging to or in the occupation of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the Bill it appears to be quite clear that the Bill does not apply to local authorities.  When I read the interpretation section I was buoyed in that regard feeling that the second type of appointee, the one Senator Howard objected to, not being a local authority appointed air pollution officer, could police the local authorities.  That was satisfactory.  Unfortunately on reading further through the Bill when one comes to section 13, dealing with prosecution of offences, one sees that an offence under this Act may be prosecuted by a local authority.  It appears that there is no power under this Bill for a local authority to be prosecuted.  It may be a little like the Building Control Bill 1984. The provisions of that measure apply to local authorities but cannot be enforced against local authorities.  I would like the Minister to assure this House that this Bill applies to local authorities and more importantly it can be enforced against local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevance of that must not be forgotten in the light of the whole question of water pollution.  As we know, water pollution is policed by regional fisheries boards.  We had a debate last year when the suggestion was made that that power <Col N="305" /> should be taken over by the Department of the Environment.  The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh, indicated that such would be the case. That idea was subsequently dropped. One reason it was dropped was that the local authorities, who themselves infrequently pollute, could not police themselves.  The same difficulty arises here; there is no policing power and no enforcement agency as against local authorities.</P>
    <P>That brings me to an argument against the whole basis of this Bill as to whether the local authorities should have the job of controlling pollution of any kind, whether it be air pollution or otherwise. I would like the Minister to confirm, first, that the Bill applies to local authorities and secondly, that it is enforcable in our courts against local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the last point first.  We have covered so many sections and subsections at this stage that it is getting a little bit untidy.  Many of the questions on Moneypoint would be better dealt with under Part III.  I am quite prepared to deal with them now if it helps Senators to get the full story.  Section 8 states: &ldquo;This Act shall apply to premises belonging to or in the occupation of the State&rdquo;.  As that definition stands as the Senator correctly points out it does not include local authority buildings.  I want to refer immediately to section 24 where a local authority presence could be included and would be intended to be included if there was difficulty.  Section 24 (1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, shall use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission from such premises.</P>
      <P>Effectively under that section it can apply to any local authority building.  Senators may say quite correctly that the local authority are hardly likely to enter and prosecute themselves as it is structured now.  Section 13 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulation under this section, prescribe that such <Col N="306" /> offence as may be specified in the regulations may be prosecuted summarily by such person (including the Minister) as may be so specified in addition to, or lieu of, the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>If we have a contrary local authority who are not playing ball both in terms of their actual premises and prosecuting, there is a mechanism for prosecuting the local authority.  Effectively local authorities and all State premises are included in this Bill, perhaps not in section 8 specifically, but they bear the full rigours of this Bill. Unlike the specific exemptions under the development controls which local authorities now enjoy, they are not being let off in relation to this Bill.</P>

      <P>This section specifically refers to premises belonging to or in the occupation of the State.  It is to get over the position that these premises of central Government now enjoy by being exempt <Col N="307" /> from any special controls in environmental planning They will no longer be exempt so far as this Bill is concerned. Section 24 will bring in any premises other than a private dwelling which is specifically dealt with.  Any of the other areas you have particular concern about are included in section 24 and other sections. Section 8 refers to property belonging to or in the occupation of the State. This is to make the point that they no longer enjoy the special exemptions they have had heretofore under planning regulations.</P>

      <P>It seems that there is a situation here where we could have double penalty.  Section 11 (2) states:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate or by a person acting on behalf of a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent, connivance or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other official of such body, such person shall also be guilty of an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of our courts has been, in cases where more than one person is prosecuted in respect of one offence, merely to convict one person. That is why this provision exists.  If one examines section 8, which says &ldquo;The Act shall apply to premises belonging to or in the occupation of the State&rdquo;, it is conceivable that, where one person would own a premises and somebody else would occupy it, both may be prosecuted and the court would determine which one to penalise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one question on section 12 in relation to the level of fine imposed in respect of continuing offences, which is fixed at £100 per day. By virtue of the nature of this Bill and by virtue of the matters which it deals with, does the Minister not feel that a greater level of fine should be imposed in respect of a continuing offence, perhaps a fine of £500 per day in respect of continuing offences?  I do not think that the level of <Col N="309" /> fine of that nature would bring our courts, which deal with matters in a summary way, into the area of constitutional difficulty.  The level of fine should be increased to £500 per day in respect of continuing offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's advice to us on this is that this is about the maximum for a District Court.  There is a provision for more serious offences to go to the higher courts and then we are talking about £1,000 a day or more.  At this point you are talking about the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very heavy fines &mdash; £10,000 for conviction or indictment is a penal sum.  In section 12 (1) (a) there is a limit of £1,000.  In section 12 (1) (b) there is an initial penalty of £10,000 and then there is a penalty not exceeding £1,000 for every day on which the offence is continued.  But apparently there is no limit as in section 12 (1) (a) with regard to this penalty.  Therefore, if the case goes on for one year it is multiplied by 365 as well as the initial £10,000.  This is unlikely to go on for a year, but there should be some limit.  It seems to be snowballing along.  This would be unacceptable in a situation where for example, some people would be trying to comply with regulations and enactments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need for some consistency here.  We expressed fears earlier of transboundary pollution.  It cannot have escaped anyone's notice that we could easily be dealing with multinationals and perhaps in some cases reluctance to retrofit desulphurisation plants, for example, something that were deemed so necessary.  Part of the deterrent is the fact that the penalties are quite severe, particularly when you go above the District Court level.  I subscribe to that.  There is a way out if they do not want to pay it &mdash; they sort out the problem fast.  That option is there and that is the option I hope they choose.  The money is of very little interest to us; it is the environment we are trying to protect, and this is a deterrent.  All my convictions are to stand <Col N="310" /> strictly by it and hope it is adopted as it stands.  There are also provisions for imprisonment for continuing offences where no effort is being made to put things right.</P>

      <P>I have to go along with Senator Fitzsimons in regard to the penalties.  I know there must be penalties for failure to take some corrective measure for control.  Take the case at present where several protests have been made about emissions from Sellafield into the Irish Sea and where there is a continual protest from this Government and various other bodies calling for closure of the plant.  Notwithstanding all that, there is a continuance of emissions of air pollution from a plant, where an individual may not be able to control that air pollution, £1,000 a day for every day, or £100 as the case may be, is a very heavy fine.  While the applicant or the defendant may be trying to get his house in order, he is fined £1,000 and then for every day after that on which that pollution occurs he is going to be fined £100 under section 12 (1) or £1,000 under 12 (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resist the temptation to repeat all the things I said last week because the Minister, Deputy G. Hussey, is with us tonight.  I should like to welcome her and say how glad I am that she has come to the House for the Second Stage of this Private Members' Bill.  It gives us confidence in promoting a Private Members' Bill that the Minister has come for this part of the debate.  I have very little more to add to what I said in the debate last week.  It is important to allow other Senators room to expand on this matter because, as came out from the discussion last week, very many Senators have personal experience of dealing with people living in their own areas who have had the experience of going before social welfare tribunals and had somewhat worrying experiences.  Last week I was talking about the necessity to provide for legal representation where necessary and to bring the tribunal system into the civil legal aid schemes.  At the moment they are specifically excluded from the work of the Legal Aid Board solicitors in the law centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously people who are going before <Col N="312" /> social welfare tribunals are very unlikely to have the money to employ private solicitors to represent them.  Certainly the Coolock Community Law Centre have found that there is a great need for free representation and I would suggest that, while it is not obviously within the powers of this Minister to extend the Legal Aid Board scheme, it is something that both Senator Robinson and I mentioned at the time of our Private Members' Motion on this.  It would be a very good idea, particularly when one looks at research which shows that where people are represented before these tribunals, the likelihood of an over-turning of the original decisions rises enormously.  It came out in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare that, if you have proper representation before a social welfare tribunal, you are much more likely to succeed in your appeal than if you have not got representation.  This needs to be looked at and there are also the people who are appealing.  It should be absolutely ensured that they should have full information at the time of the original decision about their right of appeal and how to go about appealing and, if necessary, how to get representation and how they may be represented.  Particularly in terms of what has happened under the legal aid scheme in criminal cases, where courts have held that the fullest possible information about the right to appeal, the right to be represented, the right to get free legal aid and so on must be given to the accused person; that this is basically a legal and constitutional right.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is easy to say an accused person in a criminal trial is in danger of being put in jail and this is a very important danger to be affected by, but, after all, the person who is refused social welfare benefit may well be in danger of very real financial hardship and very real practical difficulties.  It does seem to me that they should be treated, from the point of view of information, at least as well as the person who is accused of a criminal offence.  We need to have very full information about how you appeal, what rights you have under appeal, and the possibility of representation on your <Col N="313" /> appeal.  Without making any criticism of the officials of the Department of Social Welfare who are running the appeals system &mdash; I have no evidence whatsoever that they are running the thing in a wrong or a corrupt way; I am not making any suggestion of that kind &mdash; at the same time I do feel that from the point of view of justice being done and being seen to be done, and from the point of view of the ordinary citizen who is using this system, it would be preferable to have an independent tribunal system as proposed in this Bill, rather than having the whole thing run within the Department.  However good the officials may be, and with whatever new minds they look at the situation, from the point of view of the person who is making the appeal, it looks as though the Department of Social Welfare are, in a sense, judge and jury of their own case.</P>
    <P>If we are to have public confidence in the appeals system it is better to have an independent scheme.  The cost of this need not be so great as might be imagined if one considers the saving in terms of the time of the people in the Department who are now full time or part time occupied in dealing with the appeals system and offset it against the possible cost of a new tribunal.  That is more or less all I have to say on the Second Stage of this Bill.  If we get it to the Committee Stage we will have more detailed things to say on the various sections.  I am very glad the Minister is here to deal with this debate and I hope other Senators will contribute to it also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to join with Senator McGuinness in welcoming the Minister to the House.  We are extremely fortunate to have such a good Minister for Social Welfare.  She has shown in that position all the characteristics which she showed previously as Minister for Education and as a very eminent Member of this House.  Indeed, if I were to pick out members of the Cabinet who had more than justified their selection by the Taoiseach, I would certainly include the present Minister for Social Welfare as very close to the top of that list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> It is very easy, of course, to be a Minister for Social Welfare who promises everything and who seeks only to accentuate the positive aspects of that very important job.  In a Department of this magnitude there are inevitably some policing roles to be done and there is a question of ensuring that the budget which is available and which is made available by the people of the State to people who are on social welfare is used in a constructive fashion, that the interests of the various interest groups are balanced properly and that an undue weight is not given to one section of the community over another section of the community.</P>
    <P>In the recent controversies over social welfare I think insufficient attention was focused on the fact that the very difficult position which had been brought about in the Department of Social Welfare, as a result of circumstances outside the control of the Department, were very skillfully handled by the Minister to such extent that the political controversy was focused on a very small area indeed of the potential problem.  It is an indication of the Minister's skill in that regard that in point of fact the political controversy was so narrowly based.  I hope that the Minister will bring the same political skill to bear on this very difficult problem, which is presented to us in a very stark and a very effective way by the Private Members' Bill presented by Senator Ryan and supported by Senators Robb, Ross and McGuinness.</P>
    <P>The attempt by Senator B. Ryan and the other Senators to bring this important matter to the forefront of public debate is to be welcomed.  It represents a challenge to the Minister to respond positively to what is perceived to be an important and growing area of contention.  The Minister now must realise that, as a result of this Bill and also as a result of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, the question of appeals in social welfare matters has gone from the backburner to the top of the priority list in the question of social welfare reform.  The Minister will be tempted to subscribe to a lot of the angry reaction from taxpayers about <Col N="315" /> social welfare dodgers.  It is important that in doing that &mdash; and I support the Minister in that regard &mdash; she should balance that argument and that policy thrust with a recognition of the fact that social welfare represents a very important instrument of social equality and she, as the Minister charged with defending that system, has an important duty to vindicate the rights of those people who are entitled to benefit from that social welfare system.</P>
    <P>It is easy in the present economic climate to emphasise too strongly the savings which should be made on social welfare and the changes which should be made to avoid abuses.  I think that these things obviously need to be done, but they need to be balanced by the application of the social welfare system to those people who are entitled to benefit thereunder in a way which is consistent and understandable to the lay person.  There is a heavy responsibility on the Minister to respond to that need.  I hope that the Minister, having heard the debate on this Private Members' Bill, will be in a position positively to respond at the end of the Second Stage to the needs which are highlighted by this Second Stage and to respond either by accepting the principle by accepting Second Stage or, alternatively, by indicating what alternative proposals she has to put before the House.</P>
    <P>In considering a Bill like this there is a fairly substantial problem as far as I am concerned.  I am 100 per cent in support of the Senators who are proposing this Bill in regard to the need for a change in the appeals system.  However, I think the tribunal system which they are proposing to institute is very very deficient.  I have some doubt as to whether it would stop me supporting the Bill on Second Stage. However, all my instincts are to support the Bill on Second Stage, and I may well decide to do that.  I look forward to what the Minister has to say.  I look forward to hearing what Senator B. Ryan, who proposed the Bill, has to say in reply to the various problems which I and other Senators have and will identify with <Col N="316" /> regard to the operation of the system.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a number of comments with regard to the present system. I have during the course of my career as a public representative &mdash; now fast coming to a close &mdash; the privilege of representing quite a number of people at appeal hearings dealing with social welfare matters. Therefore, my experience is to that extent first hand.  My experience is aided and assisted by the reports which I had got from other people on the way they have been treated in appeal cases.  I must say to the Minister in as straightforward a fashion as possible that I perceive a different response to those who go and represent themselves as compared with those who are represented by other people.  I do not think that should be the case.  Inevitably, if a person goes to the trouble of getting somebody else to represent them, whether that is a professional person or just an ex-friend, I suppose that there is a way in which it raises what would be otherwise a routine hearing for an appeals officer to a different level.  The very fact that there is some class of organisation to the presentation of the appellant's case itself separates that particular appeal from the dozens of other appeals that are being processed at the same time.  To a certain extent that explains why there are differences.  However, it is a bit more fundamental than that.</P>
    <P>The way in which I perceive the present appeal procedure to be deficient is as follows. I do not know what happens in other parts of the country; I can only speak about the part that I live in, and that is Cork.  Overwhelmingly, the appeals that are held in the Cork area are held in the offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  That is, in my opinion, a mistake.  I have attended many appeal hearings in the building which is known as the labour exchange in Cork.  There is nothing wrong with the labour exchange as a building; it is quite a reasonable building and it has a lot of people passing through it.  But many of the people who are the subject of these appeal proceedings would have used this building in another context.  They would associate it <Col N="317" /> with a relationship between themselves and somebody behind the counter, which is, to say the very least of it, an unequal relationship.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the person who walks into a labour exchange and the person behind the counter is unequal.  It is unequal because the person who is actually behind the grill, the person who is on the other side of the counter, is vested with an authority out of all proportion to what rational analysis would accept as being reasonable.  This phenomenon has been the subject of sociological study, that a person in a position of authority behind a grill or behind a counter in some way assumes an atmosphere or a status of dominance over a person who is seeking from that person a service which is damaging to their relationship.  This applied even more so in the case of people who go to sign on at the labour exchange or to make other inquiries of that kind.  Therefore, I think that this whole system, as I know it in my part of the country, is founded upon a relationship between the person receiving the service and the person giving the service, a relationship which is unequal.  There is, of necessity, a sense of arbitrary justice in a way in which the person at a labour exchange deals with the people who come to him or her.  I am not blaming them; that is reality.  They are dealing with a large number of people, they must make quick decisions and they cannot afford the time for social intercourse while they are making their decisions or while getting people to sign the documents on a routine basis.  But I think it is important to establish what actually happens inside there.</P>
    <P>When a person falls foul of the system and that person is disqualified from receiving benefit, the same person who may be using this building for signing on on a weekly basis is actually called to an appeal hearing in the same building.  I think it is very hard in the mind of that person to separate the unequal relationship which they have with those who work in the building from the new type of relationship which should exist between an appeals officer and a person who is <Col N="318" /> making an appeal before him.</P>
    <P>This sense in which the appellant feels that the appeals officer is in fact just another deciding officer is reinforced by the fact that very often &mdash; I think it is commented on in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; the deciding officers are not present.  In other words, the judge also appears to be the prosecutor, and I do not think that is a good system.  I know there are very good reasons sometimes why deciding officers cannot be present, but I think some system should be devised whereby it would not be just the appellant and what he perceives to be another officer of the social welfare, a mere higher level administrative review of the administrative decision which has already been taken.  What is necessary is that the person should perceive the review to be completely independent, and this is why I agree with so much of the thrust of the proposed legislation. It is very important that the person would be satisfied in their own mind that the decision is being taken by a person who is truly independent.  That is not to offer any criticism whatsoever of the people who at present are operating the system, because this is an area in which fine judgments have to be made.  It is an area of considerable importance to those who are the subject matter of the appeals, but it is also an area in which they must feel that justice is being done.  It is very important that they would be satisfied that justice is being done to their case.</P>
    <P>The other reason I feel that these appeals procedures are deficient is because very often when the original decision is taken by the deciding officer he is under no obligation to adequately explain to the person why he is taking a particular decision.  In some cases that might not be very important, but there was last year a wide-ranging controversy in the rural parts of this country concerning the decisions of deciding officers.  The Minister will be aware of the changes that were brought about as a result of the Finance Act, 1984, whereby smallholders were to be reassessed on some kind of a notional basis in respect of their holdings to determine whether they were <Col N="319" /> going to continue to be eligible for unemployment assistance or for what is generally known as the farmer's dole.  In order that that was done, what happened was that, having given due notice, officers attended at the premises of the smallholder and assessed to the best of their ability what the income of the smallholder should have been from the holding &mdash; I am not quite sure whether it is what it should have been or what it actually was, I think it is what it was.  As a result of that they applied this scale and said that if it was over £45, £46 or £50 a week, depending on whether the person was single or not &mdash; that figure is not to be taken as accurate &mdash; but if it was over a certain amount the person was not entitled to any social welfare.  They lost the unemployment asistance which they had been previously entitled to.  It must be said that in most of these cases they got the decision right.  Officers were sensible people and assessed the holdings sensibly. But, of course, in every case, whether they got the decision right or wrong, where it meant a reduction in the amount of unemployment assistance which a person was receiving, that person felt aggrieved.</P>
    <P>There was a normal appeals procedure. The big controversy preceded the present Minister for Social Welfare, but she will be aware that the type of information which was given to the smallholders was: &ldquo;Your income for the past year is estimated to be £5,257 and you are, therefore, ineligible.&rdquo;  The reality of the situation was that, in order to arrive at an assessment, there was a certain procedure to be gone through.  A person's gross income had to be taken.  He was given allowances for running a motor car, if it was necessary for his business, and all the various other things which were necessary expenses in the running of his business or her business.  At the end of the day a figure was arrived at.  Very many Members of this House and the Dáil, on being consulted by these people and being asked to represent them at the appeal proceedings or at least to prepare a document which would support their case, <Col N="320" /> asked the question: &ldquo;How was this figure of £5,000 calculated?&rdquo;  The important thing is that the figure of £5,000, or whatever the amount he decided the income was, had to be calculated according to a particular formula and it was necessary for the social welfare officer, in deciding what the person's income was, to actually go through a step by step procedure and to write it down on a sheet of paper which he then kept secret.  As a result of that the person was disqualified or reduced in their entitlement.  As a result of the officer deciding, for example, that the person had sold five cattle during the year or sold four cattle or that his veterinary expenses were £100 instead of £150 or £150 instead of £100 and the various other decisions that they make, the person was disqualified or reduced in his or her entitlement. The simple request of the public representatives was that, when a decision like that was being taken you should be told what the basis of the £5,000 net income was.</P>
    <P>This applies not only to the rural area; it applies to other means-tested benefits as well.  I think that it should be the entitlement of every person who is the subject of a means-tested decision to be given a copy of all the information and back-up which forms part of that decision.  The mere fact of indicating to the person that he has exceeded the income is quite inadequate for allowing them the opportunity to actually appeal in a meaningful fashion as distinct from appealing in a kind of &mdash; I could not describe it as anything more &mdash; gombeen-cap touching sort of way.  That is the other reason I think that many of the appeals represent a kind of unequal struggle.  Very often the appellant is not given sufficient information on which to make a rational appeal. It is a very important part of the process that there would be built up a system whereby an automatic quantity of information would be made available to the appellant which would form the basis of the appeal.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of what was said in the report of the Commission on Taxation about the small number of appeals and so <Col N="321" /> on, but I am also conscious of the fact that, of the 17,000 appeals which were considered in the report in 1985, a substantial number of them were reversed on appeal.  This says something for the independence of the appeals officers.  It also says something for either the deficiency of the information on which the original decision was made or, alternatively, on the inaccuracy of the decision which was arrived at if the full information was available.  I suspect &mdash; and this is borne out by a number of comments, including the comments from the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; that many of the successful appellants are those who overcome the system and supply additional information.  It is not a different decision is made on the same facts, but that a different decision is made on facts that are more favourable to the appellant.</P>
    <P>Any appeal system which replaces the present one must take into account that very often inadequate information is available at an early stage.  If there is to be an appeal <i>ab initio</i>, if there is to be a rehearing, as is the intention of everybody, it is important that, the preliminary administrative type decisions having been taken, the maximum amount of information be made available to the appellant in order to see what case he is meeting.</P>
    <P>What should we aim at as being an appropriate system?  What we should not aim for is a mini-court.  This is not right. The idea of going into what is almost like a court room situation, while it might be fair, it is off-putting as far as the appellants are concerned.  They are going to run a mile from it.  The swearing, opening statements and cross-examination and formalities of that sort are doing precisely the reverse of what we are being told is so important in another area of our developing legal system, which is the area of family law.  In the area of family law, where personal matters are involved, we are being told that informality rather than formality is to be the kernel of what we should be aiming for.  The same applies in this respect.  Section 8 (2) states:</P>
    <P>(2)  Without prejudice to any provisions of this Act, at the hearing of an <Col N="322" /> appeal before the Appeals Tribunal an appellant or, with the exception of paragraph (c), his representative may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  make an opening statement,</P>
    <P>(b)  cross-examine any witness called on behalf of any other party,</P>
    <P>(c)  give evidence on his own behalf,</P>
    <P>(d)  address the Appeals Tribunal at the close of evidence</P>
    <P>To lay that down in statute is to invite the creation of a kind of an employment appeals tribunal situation.  I practice before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which is an important body.  There is a case to be made that the Employment Appeals Tribunal has become too structured, that it is not in touch with the ordinary people who are appealing before it and that it has become the preserve of lawyers and professional trade union representatives who are indistinguishable from lawyers once they get some practice &mdash; you could walk in and listen to one and wonder what firm he represents, you may think that it was Arthur Cox and Company. Therefore, that is a defect in the Bill.  However, it is not the most serious defect.</P>
    <P>The most serious defect in the Bill is the elaborative, administrative procedure which it proposes to set up &mdash; the establishment of what it calls a social welfare appeals tribunal.  What it appears to do is to set up a system whereby mini-courts will be spread throughout the country and will function on a fairly structured basis.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister might consider, during the course of her examination of this problem, the successful system which has operated <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Revenue Commissioners and the appeal commissioners, whereby the latter are an independent body, which is important and I support that concept in the Bill 100 per cent.  The appeal commissioners are slightly different from what is in the Bill. I must explain that appeal commissioners are completely independent of the Revenue Commissions; they operate and <Col N="323" /> control their own workload except in one significant area, and I think that is changing as well.  They decide and arbitrate on a vast number of cases.  This is the crucial element wherein the proposals of Senator B. Ryan will come up a cropper.  There are 17,000 cases to be dealt with each year.  You cannot do this in a Perry Mason courtroom situation; it is not possible. Therefore, you have to try to create a situation which will have the potential for formality in cases where it is necessary and will retain the simplicity which is an essential part of processing claims fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Minister look at the appeal commissioners' system whereby they go around the country and appear on their own but where there is a provision whereby they can appear in twos or in threes in important cases.  They normally sit in such cases where there is an important point of principle to be decided as a result of a preliminary hearing. However, with regard to the ordinary routine appeal matters which come before them, they sit on their own with a minimum of formality.  They permit legal representatives and other representatives to attend; but, as a matter of practice, it does not take place except where there is a particular reason for it.  This system works.  They process a lot of appeals.  This kind of system works well rather than a three-man or three-woman system, which is a recipe for disaster, because the length of time which it will take three people to hear an appeal will be a lot more than three times the length of time it will take a person on his own to hear it.</P>
    <P>While recognising the necessity for leaving the possibility of more than one appeals officer hearing a case, the Minister should seriously consider an appeals system operated under an independent body.  I do not care whether it is directly responsible to the Minister or to another Minister, or to the Minister for Finance.  I do not care whom it is responsible to, but it should be sufficiently independent of the other decision-making process.  It is important that they should hold their hearings in places which are not <Col N="324" /> associated with the administrative functions of the Department of Social Welfare. They are very important criteria. Separate buildings, separate people but only one of them with the possibility of doubling or trebling up in particular cases where there is an important point of principle to be decided.  The other crucial fact is that people should be given as much information as possible about the reasons decisions are being taken refusing them or limiting them in some way in the benefits for which they have applied.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say.  I am also anxious to hear what Senator Brendan Ryan has to say in reply.  The issue is very important.  The Bill is very timely and it is very important that the Minister should respond to it in a positive manner either by adopting this Bill with modifications &mdash; it could not possibly be adopted without modifications &mdash; or, alternatively introducing at an early stage her own legislation to grapple with this important administrative problem which has such a far reaching effect on the relationship between the most vulnerable member of the community and the State.  I can think of no Minister in the Government, with the possible exception of the Taoiseach, who is more suitable for tackling this problem than the Minister herself and I wish her well in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the debate on this Bill which was ordered to be printed last April.  It represents a very well devised and, in the sense in which Senator Ryan described it in his Second Reading Speech, a conservative approach to this problem in that it builds on the existing system.  It identifies the problems with the existing system and it proposes a very significant improvement on that system which many people on the ground have felt for a long time is necessary as a right and necessary in order to secure the proper consideration of rights of citizens.  It is a matter of urgency that we provide a proper structure of appeals in social welfare.  This Bill represents a step forward in a debate which has been gathering momentum for a number of <Col N="325" /> years.  Increasingly those who were involved with people and claimants themselves have been frustrated and have been completely turned off the kind of system which they have had to endure.</P>
      <P>This was very well identified and tabulated in the report of the Coolock Community Law Centre, which Senator Ryan referred to in his speech, the report of social welfare appeals in 1980.  That report examined the legal basis of appeals, examined the existing practices, and then came forward with a number of conclusions and recommendations.  It provides a useful starting point for any of us in considering the background and the issues raised by this Bill.  A number of these issues have already been referred to by Senators who have contributed.</P>
      <P>I intend, therefore, to summarise my views rather than speak at length on the Bill.  Like Senator O'Leary, and others, I am basically keen to hear the response by the Minister and I hope that she, too, has taken on board the extent of the frustration, the extent of the criticism, the inadequacy of the present system and the insult to people in relation to basic rights that they are not in fact, dealt with in a framework which would be thought to be normal in other areas.  In the employment appeals tribunal, in the equality legislation, in the income tax provisions, in occupational injuries and in many other areas, we do have at least the sense of the kind of structure which would be appropriate to safeguarding, vindicating and protecting people's rights, to providing a forum for assessing the validity of claims particularly on appeal where there has been a refusal of the initial claim, and that the broader public interest would also be served in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the kinds of criticisms of the system which were identified by the report of the Coolock Community Law centre because this was not a report simply written off the top of the head by the people involved.  It was based on empirical research.  Therefore, it carries a greater authority.  It was based on a survey or sample and consideration of statistics in that area.  It might be said it was a fairly local analysis but we have so <Col N="326" /> little empirical research in Ireland, we so rarely look at the situation on the ground, that it is very valuable when we have reports of this kind.</P>
    <P>The criticisms which were set down in this report focused on six areas, first, the composition of the appeal hearings.  This is the matter which is substantially addressed in the Private Members' Bill before us today.  There were a number of different kinds of criticisms made in the report and they have also been made by others including Robert Clark in his article in <i>The Irish Jurist</i> and by individuals from time to time.  On the whole, it is the single appeals officer who hears the appeal.  He may, and does in certain instances, sit with assessors.  He is a civil servant.  He has the departmental file of the case.  He is perceived simply to be somebody else in the structure, indeed, to be the superior of the deciding officer. That is how it is perceived.  That is how it cannot but appear to be to the person who has lodged the appeal.</P>
    <P>We also know that the person who lodged the appeal has no right to an appeal in the sense of an oral hearing.  It is the appeals officer who has the role of deciding whether an appeal is warranted in the particular circumstances of the case.  That, too, undermines the whole structure.  It prevents the proper balance of an independent assessment on appeal from being possible.  It is not possible under the present structure.  We deny to people an independent assessment on appeal of the decision made by the deciding officer, in whatever way, to refuse the claim or to make some decision adverse to the claimant.</P>
    <P>The composition of the appeal hearing is completely inadequate at the moment. That has to be addressed by the Minister in her contribution to this debate. Whether she takes on board precisely the framework which is put forward in this Bill which I support, she cannot deny that the present system lacks independence, lacks a perceived appeal structure for people who have rights and entitlements under our social welfare legislation and who have the right, therefore, to independent and fair procedures in the pursuit <Col N="327" /> of those rights.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second of the points identified in the Coolock Community Law Centre report, the procedure adopted.  Much has been said about that in this debate and I do not intend to say very much more.  We all come across so many cases where the person does not know, first of all, on what basis the appeal may or may not be pursued.  They simply lodge an appeal and do not know what happens.  They do not know when the appeal will be dealt with.  If they have an oral hearing, particularly if they are represented by a social worker or by a solicitor, that is a great deal more likely to be successful.  A significant number of cases do not benefit from that.</P>
    <P>I was glad Senator Ryan identified the even worse treatment of supplementary welfare applications and appeals.  The situation there is even worse because the Minister, not this Minister in her person, but Ministers for Social Welfare over the years have never brought in regulations under the 1975 Act or under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, providing for a structure of appeals in supplementary welfare.  Indeed, I remember raising this matter on the Adjournment in the late seventies when the then Minister for Health and Social Welfare a certain Deputy Haughey defended the position that it was not necessary.  He was quite satisfied with the system and he refused to concede that it would be desirable even to implement his power under the 1975 Act which is also there under the 1981 Act and bring in regulations governing the appeal.</P>
    <P>That was a much more modest endeavour than this Bill which actually devises a structure for independent three person tribunals.  It was simply saying there are no regulations and no rules governing this.  It is all an informal in-house system and that is not right.  Even that primitive value was not acceptable at the time.  I hope we have moved on from there.  I hope we have moved on from there for one reason, that is, that the courts are increasingly accessible in the <Col N="328" /> area of social welfare because it is becoming evident that principles of natural and constitutional justice, principles of fair procedures, may not be adequately represented by the existing system.  Apart from political and policy considerations I think there are also legal considerations which I hope will weigh with the Minister in relation to the structure and procedure adopted in these appeals.</P>
    <P>The third area of criticism by the Coolock Community Law Centre was on the consistency of decisions, pointing out the lack of standardisation, the lack of knowledge.  There is no reporting system; there is no accessibility.  It is only when we have a review by a body like the Coolock Community Law Centre that we can have this information.</P>
    <P>The fourth point relates to representation and advice available to claimants.  A number of Senators have made points on this.  I believe there is a completely unwarranted exclusion of social welfare appeals from the civil legal aid system. Why?  Could somebody explain to me why these are excluded?  What is the logic in excluding such basic rights and entitlement where you have, by and large, people who are more likely to be in need of civil legal aid if they need legal representation. By denying them civil legal aid we are denying them legal representation. We are denying them legal advice and help where they have a complex case and where they need it.  It is very crude when you get down to it.</P>
    <P>The fifth point which has been fully discussed is the absence of information.  I was pleased to see in this Bill that there would be provisions requiring, within specified days, the kind of information to be provided to the claimant, the kind of opportunity to the claimant in turn to put forward the basis of an appeal and then the procedure for having that appeal heard.</P>
    <P>The last point is the point about location which I think ties into the whole structure of having a civil servant of the Minister, appointed by the Minister, responsive to the Minister, hearing these appeals in the first place.  They are <Col N="329" /> broadly the areas of criticism of the present system.  We have this well thought out relevant Bill because it builds on what is there at present.  It is technically a Bill which has been devised to be implemented as opposed to a Bill which is so radical that it would require a whole new system from the beginning.  This does not require a whole new system.  It could be implemented if we want to put the time and effort into so doing and a certain amount &mdash; but only a certain amount &mdash; of human and other resources.</P>
    <P>I should like now to address some of the issues raised by Senator O'Leary.  He criticised the Bill, as I understood him, for proposing too elaborate and too formalised a procedure.  He pointed to the fact that, for example, people were looking for a form of family law or expressedly looking for more informality.  But there is no inconsistency.  Nobody is suggesting they want wigs and gowns and formal court structure in social welfare appeals. What is proposed here, I would have thought, is completely compatible with an informal non-court structure but with the values of independence, adequacy of knowledge, adequacy of safeguards in the procedure and the necessary components of what I would regard as being a fair procedure.  I fail to see the reason for Senator O'Leary's criticism on the basis that it would be too formalised.</P>
    <P>His other criticism, which is much the same thing with a different adjective, is that it is too elaborate in administrative procedure.  That is interesting.  Why is it elaborate because we are dealing with social welfare rights?  Why suddenly when we are dealing with rights and entitlements in the area of social welfare must we do it with the minimum of any kind of structure and let decisions be taken, bang bang bang, in a hurry?  After all, these are only social welfare beneficiaries and they are not people who are likely to even know their rights, never mind try to assert their rights.  I do not think Senator O'Leary was making that point as openly or as crudely as that, but there was a certain element of it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it stems from the problem that social welfare law has never been <Col N="330" /> lawyers' law.  Comparatively few lawyers know anything about social welfare, or have an interest in social welfare, or ever had.  It is not paying law so practitioners have not interested themselves until comparatively recently.  Indeed, one of the very good influences in the area of social welfare has been the contribution made from the academic world, by people like Robert Clark of UCD and Gerry White of Trinity College who, by lecturing on social welfare law, started to bring home to us the importance of standards, the legal significance of the legislation and the importance of having proper structures. I do not consider three persons sitting to hear appeals a particularly elaborate structure.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that when the deciding officer has decided to refuse a person a benefit, assistance or allowance, he must forward to the person within two days of the decision a comprehensive statement in writing.  What is wrong with that?  I am sure that on Committee Stage Senator Ryan would accept that four days would be reasonable if two days are thought not to be reasonable.  None of it is that elaborate.  None of it is particularly abnormal.  Many other countries have three person tribunals in comparable social welfare systems.  Many other countries have much more elaborate systems of administrative courts, financial courts, small claims courts.  We have a lot to learn from the systems which other countries have devised in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the criticism Senator O'Leary has made that this is somehow either too formalised or too elaborate a system.  It addresses and provides a legislative response to the criticisms that have been made.  I find those criticisms very convincing.  I hope the Minister will take on board the criticisms and then I will be very interested to listen to her response to the Bill.  I hope it will be one of those Bills that can make progress in this House and when it has passed all stages that it can go to the other House for consideration as an improved amended Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like, very briefly, to make some comments on this Bill.  Despite the fact that Senator B. Ryan does not seem to be over-enamoured at the fact that I sought to speak on this item on the agenda, I should like to compliment him on bringing forward this Bill.  This Senator is objecting to my offering to speak.  I am a Senator for 25 years this very week and this is the first time that has happened.  I am entitled to make a contribution to this or any other item on the agenda.  It is improper for anyone to endeavour to decide who is to speak next.  That is the prerogative of the Chair.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Senator B. Ryan is not interested in what I have to say, I should like to welcome the fact that he has tabled this Private Members' Bill.  I am one of Members of this House who feel we do not have sufficient input into our Private Members' Business by way of Private Members Bills.  It is good development. I appreciate the huge amount of work that goes into preparing and bringing forward a Private Members' Bill. Many years ago in the Seanad, in cooperation with a colleague, I sponsored two Private Members' Bills.  I think the first one was on the apprenticeship scheme, but I can recall the great volume of work that it takes to bring a Bill to the stage when it can be presented and laid on the Table of the House.  From that point of view I want to compliment Senator Brendan Ryan on his Bill reaching Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important Bill, not only in what it contains itself.  While I may not agree with every last line, nevertheless it gives us an opportunity to focus attention <Col N="333" /> on many problems in this whole area of social welfare.  When we look at the magnitude of the budget for social welfare here &mdash; almost 20 per cent of the total national budget &mdash; it is very important that every member of the Oireachtas should be interested and should devote a considerable amount of time to looking at the way those moneys are spent.  Many of the sections that Senator B. Ryan has devised could make a significant contribution to the present situation.  I would have thought that over the past few years the introduction of the computerisation of the social welfare system &mdash; and I make the presumption that it has been computerised &mdash; would greatly decrease the time lag between people applying for benefit, assistance or whatever, and the actual payment being made or decision being taken.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with appeals.  This is an area that certainly needs the attention of the Minister of Social Welfare.  I hope that the Department will be able to devise an improvement to this section of the Social Welfare Acts.  Perhaps one of the problems affecting the social welfare legislation is the piecemeal way in which the entire system has developed.  It is added to by the Social Welfare Bill each year.  There seems to be a maze of amendments and additions.  It is not very easy for the ordinary person to know exactly what he is entitled to from one day to the next.  That is quite all right for a considerable number of people who are in the position to and make a habit of studying their entitlements and who are able to extract the very last copper from them.  It does not get away from the fact that there are thousands of people who are not able to do that.</P>
    <P>My experience, as a public representative, is that the social welfare officers, or inspectors or the social workers, all too often do not pick up these people who are not able to identify benefits or schemes that may very well be of assistance to them.  I think that is a great pity.  I know that welfare officers are scarce on the ground especially in the rural areas.  We would need greater co-ordination between the district nurses and the social <Col N="334" /> welfare officers attached to the health boards and, indeed, to the Department.  I noticed recently there was some talk of amalgamating activities, or at least of asking the health boards to administer some of the social welfare schemes.  That seems to be coming unstuck.</P>
    <P>Another aspect we should really have in the social welfare schemes is greater decentralisation, down to county level.  I do not know what that would take by way of additional personnel but, hopefully, it would mean there would be faster decisions on many of the applications.  There is a six week time lag between the death of an old age pensioner and the provision of a widow's pension.  The pension should continue for six weeks so that there could be an easy transfer to the widow's pension. Occasionally one finds that the widow's pension is not payable in what would appear to be an adequate time lag of six weeks.  Some person in the Department should be responsible for that.  It is most frustrating to have those widows, who are in a very difficult period in their lives, having to look for social assistance from the health board, or whatever. That, in itself, necessitates going to a dispensary or other place each week and line up there to look for assistance.  That should not happen in an organisation with the resources I expect an organisation that is dispensing something like £2,500 million per year should have. I hope the Minister as a matter of urgency, will oil the wheels to such an extent that small problems like that, problems that may be small for the Department, could be eliminated altogether.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that the Minister would redouble efforts to bring about greater security and sharper control to prevent fraud.  I do not think that fraud itself is the huge problem that it is cracked up to be. We must accept that people on social welfare are entitled by law to be paid and receive benefit.  They are entitled by the contributions they have already paid to receive the unemployment benefit, or assistance, or pensions.  If we look at the entire problem from that base, we are entitled to ensure that the people in that <Col N="335" /> category are not being looked upon, as they very often are, as spongers on the State.</P>
    <P>One way of scotching that idea and of bringing back respectability to the service is to ensure that the general public, whether they are taxpayers or not, should not have a begrudging attitude to or a begrudging instinct about people who are on benefit or social welfare.  It is very important that the whole idea of people on social welfare making fraudulent applications should be scotched.  The only way the Minister can do that is to have a control system of such proportions that people just do not get through the net.  That is important.  It is important also that the general public be made to realise that these people who are on benefit have made contributions that entitle them to this benefit and that they are merely getting back what they have already put in.  They are entitled to those benefits; otherwise they would not have them.  The attitude of the general public to the plight of people who find themselves either unemployed, disabled, ill, or whatever, must be made to change. That is the great problem that exists at present.</P>
    <P>The entire social welfare code comes in for more adverse criticism and comment than any other category of expenditure in any other Department of State.  It is difficult to know why that should be.  We profess to be a truly Christian society.  If that is so why do we not go out of our way to provide for people who may be less fortunate than ourselves?  That is important. The State has a great obligation to ensure that such provision is made.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the sponsor of this Bill, not only for bringing in this Bill but for his work in the Simon Community. It shows that there is a caring attitude. He is somebody who is prepared not just to talk about the problems of deprived sections of the community but to actively and physically pursue a line of activity that brings relief and succour and makes the lives of people, who for various reasons find themselves in these difficult <Col N="336" /> categories, that little bit more manageable. It is easy to give lip service to the problems of the poor, deprived or the people who cannot, for whatever reason, look after themselves.  We have homeless people who cannot keep a roof over their own heads.  We must be able to bend over backwards to help these people.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the problems raised on the morning radio programmes, it would appear that there are not sufficient welfare depots, especially in the city of Dublin, for people to go and collect assistance, or whatever they need.  Obviously, we need an educational input here. There is no great use having a huge social welfare facility working alongside an excellent health board facility, such as in the Eastern Health Board which must be of fairly huge magnitude, if we have numbers of people who seem to escape the caring net of both organisations.  I can well imagine and appreciate the frustration of civil servants and of people who are working in these welfare centres when some fellow rolls in at 5.10 p.m. or 5.20 p.m. on a Friday evening looking for assistance.  Some people may fall into the trap of saying that these people drew assistance and are trying something on.</P>
    <P>We should strive to devise a proper system. We have achieved much in this country.  We have gone ahead of most countries in the free world in respect of the services we provide and the contributions we make.  I am not saying it is enough, and I am certainly not saying it is too much.  However, if you compare the efforts being made here, having regard to the modest resources of the State, you will see that we are obviously ahead of most other countries.  For example, the old age contributory pension here is somewhere over £53, whereas I read recently that the same pension in the North and the UK is only £39.  An old age contributory pensioner and his spouse receive something over £87, whereas a similar pension in the North is in the region of £64 or £65.  People forget that.  I know people will say that the cost of living is less in the other jurisdiction, but that is not the problem.  We cannot do too much for the people who have worked for <Col N="337" /> 65 or 70 years in this country.  What Senator B. Ryan is trying to do in his Private Members' Bill is to identify the problem areas and to quantify the cost of dealing with them.  It should be possible to simplify the system to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>There has been a furore over the last few days about the question of equality. Again, this is something to which it is easy to pay lip service.  I want to take this opportunity of complimenting the Minister for Social Welfare on having the guts to grapple with the problem of equality. Equality does not mean qualified equality; it must be equality between men and women, full stop.  Obviously, that has meant that some categories of person have less take home pay in the short term than before equality was introduced. There is no point in talking about having equality of treatment between men and women as far as social welfare is concerned if it is going to be qualified.  While the community legislation was signed by the present Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare some years ago, if I recall the headlines at that time, he basked in the sunshine of bringing that equality.  I want to compliment him on doing that.</P>

I was just complimenting the Minister on being prepared to take the bad with the good and bringing in something we all subscribe to.  We feel there should be equality in the way everybody coming to the Department of Social Welfare is treated.  It is very easy to pay lip service to it, but to tackle the problem head on is something of which the Minister should feel justly proud.  I regret there has been a lot of flak flying from that. Nevertheless, it is important.  Once we get over that and settle down, we will have a better system for everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Senator is not too supportive of the idea of equality in the social welfare system I again ask the Minister to look with special interest at the entire area of the appeals tribunals. The biggest difficulty I find in this area &mdash; and perhaps it should be possible to effect some improvements in the next Social Welfare Bill or even in this Bill before the House &mdash; is the difficulty so many people have in representing themselves fully when they appeal decisions of the social welfare deciding officer.  I know the Department do their best.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer travels down the country and sits in various counties, but not in every county.  It would be an advantage if the appeals officer attended in each of the larger urban areas to facilitate them.  It is also important that people with appeals, and who feel that they should appeal, should have greater assistance in making their oral submissions to the deciding officer.  While I think it is quite an informal procedure at present, nevertheless people who go before the appeals tribunal do so with fear and trepidation. I do not think this should be so.  If the interview with the appeals officer was made less formal, or in the form of just a chat or an exchange, the appeals officer would be able to understand the argument.</P>
      <P>That is very important because people who go before an appeals officer are entitled to be helped rather than adjudicated on.  Many people in this category do themselves an injustice when it comes to making a case for themselves.  I suppose it would be possible for these people to engage a solicitor, or an attorney, but that in itself would be a quite costly procedure which would clearly be beyond the means of the category of person we are dealing with.  It should be possible for the Department to expedite the decisions of the deciding officer and also to change the format of the appeal to see if it could be improved to a great degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> The time lag for appeals is something of a worry.  If the Department of Social Welfare were computerised that would shorten the period and bring it more up to date.  I notice from visiting the employment exchanges in my own county that practically all of the work and records are written out by hand.  I do not know what the cost would be of modernising this system, but that must be a very laborious and time consuming way of dealing with this problem.  Perhaps the Minister would select a few areas, install modern office equipment and ascertain whether the system could be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Dooge had to say, I quite agree that the penalty should be substantial. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that the penalty in itself will not solve the problem. If it did for example, with regard to the Litter Act, we could have solved the litter problem.  With regard to parking, if it was simply a matter of having a heavy penalty, that would solve the problem also.  I agree that the punishment should fit the crime.  This is a very substantial amount.  Under subsection (1) (a) the <Col N="342" /> cumulative amount could be very substantial indeed, even where a firm might have the best intentions in the world and endeavour to co-operate with the authorities with regard to the provisions of this Bill.  I agree that the limitation in subsection (1) (a) of £100 per day to £1,000 maximum appears reasonable. However, with regard to subsection (1) (b), I feel the same mechanism should be there to ensure that we would not have a snowballing effect, resulting in a very heavy penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively, the only reason it appears is that there is a limiting clause in subsection (1) (a) involving the District Court offence. To my knowledge that is constitutional, and that is the limit in relation to summary convictions in the District Courts. There is no such equivalent in relation to Circuit Court offences or fines.</P>
      <P>I must reiterate what Senator Dooge said before we adjourned, which is that all this will depend on the judge on the day.  It is left to his discretion to handle the offender, who will be presenting his case, as he thinks fit and to ensure that the penalty will fit the crime.  We must have extremely serious penalties both in relation to imprisonment and to the actual monetary fines.  It is quite conceivable that at some stage we could be dealing with international bodies and companies who will not be deterred by small fines of £100 per day, or even £1,000 per day.  As the Senator said, we have to be sure that the punishment fits the crime. We are talking about enormous amounts of money in some of these cases.  Also it can be very expensive to retrofit some existing plant if that should be demanded by the State.  Unless the fines were of such an order as to make them seriously consider doing what is necessary to get into line environmentally, perhaps they would opt for the £100 per day or the £1,000 per day.  It could be the lesser of two evils unless it was recurring to the extent we have it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concern Senators O'Toole and Fitzsimons are voicing in <Col N="343" /> that they feel the small man might be unjustifiably penalised and that there could be a question of the punishment not fitting the crime.  In that case the small man would be dealt with by the District Court.  That situation is controlled by the constitutional provisions in relation thereto.  However, we will have to be in a position whereby we will not be dictated to by the large international combines or by anyone who is in a position to cause environmental pollution to any major extent.  Perhaps because of the profitability of the operation they are involved in they ignore the laws and the licensing provisions of the State in relation to pollution. We must be sure that those people will not be encouraged in any way by any lax attitude towards penalties to infringe regulations continually.</P>
    <P>I must stand by section 12, as it stands, and I hope Senators will understand why.</P>

      <P>May I make the point that I envisage them being in court at this stage facing these large fines, particularly if they are in the Circuit Court, when all carrot mechanisms would have been exhausted.  There is no question of leaping into court on the first evidence of some pollution.  We are talking about persistent offenders who refuse to get their houses in order.  We must have a <Col N="344" /> mechanism which will be a deterrent if the penalty is sufficiently high.  There will always be a few mavericks who will never be deterred by monetary considerations, but the vast majority of us will be, particularly by fines of this amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister fully in this matter.  The penalty must fit the crime, but it must also fit the criminal. The Minister has got the balance right in ensuring, on the one hand, that the small man can be dealt with in a summary way in the District Courts, where the maximum fine is £1,000.  There are many statutory offences where maximum fines of £1,000 apply; indeed, the normal fine may be £50.  On the other hand, we have to envisage a situation in which we will encounter the major offender, the multinational, the big industrialist, the person who pollutes without regard to anybody, and who has the economic back-up to do so.  That can be dealt with in a firm and realistic way by the courts.  That type of criminal is dealt with in section 12 (1) (b) where a £10,000 fine can be imposed and a £1,000 daily continuing fine.  Certainly I would not support any suggestion seeking a diminution of the level of penalties.  In all of this, of course, penalties are discretionary; it is a matter for a court to decide.</P>

      <P>We want to place on record that we are not satisfied with the £100 penalty continuing daily on a small man, or a £1,000 in the case of large companies. We have no objection to the £1,000 fine, for an initial offence.  But what we do object to is, in the case of any particular defendant trying to put his house in order, until such time as he has pollution controlled he will have to pay a continuing fine of £100 per day, in the case of a small man, and £1,000 per day in the case of larger companies.  It is not the £1,000 or the £10,000 we are questioning. It is the continuance of the penalty in the case of a person trying to put his house in order.  That might well be a local authority. I should like the Minister to tell me who would be in a position to prosecute a local authority for pollution.</P>

It is at the judge's discretion to assess the man and the crime that would be presented before him and to fit the punishment accordingly. Likewise, the £1,000 continuing fine for the Circuit Court is a maximum. It can be anything below £1,000.  It is up to the discretion of the judge.</P>

      <P>One final point on subsection (2) which says that section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 shall apply in relation to an offence to which subsection (1) relates.  This subsection is made of parts (a) and (b).  As I understand it, the procedure here is that the fines in section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 will be increased in line with those being proposed here.  Am I correct in understanding, therefore, that in relation to subsection (1), (a) and (b), where the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 are invoked it will be the penalties of subsection (1) (a) that will apply and that those proposed in subsection (b) will not?</P>

      <P>For the purpose of this section, a certificate signed by or on behalf of the person initiating the proceedings as to the date on which evidence relating to the offence came to his knowledge shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof and in any legal proceedings a document purporting to be a certificate issued for the purpose of this subsection and to be signed shall be deemed to be signed and shall be admitted as evidence without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate, unless the contrary is shown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself having a certain sympathy with this amendment and with the points of view expressed by Senators M. O'Toole and Fitzsimons.  The purpose of this subsection does not go to the basis of the provision.  It deals rather with an administrative matter, that is the change which this section proposes to introduce in relation to the time within which summary proceedings can be <Col N="347" /> initiated.  The 1981 Act provided that summary proceedings must be instituted within six months from the date of the commission of an offence.  Section (3) provides that that period be extended to 12 months.  Indeed it is extended &mdash; under subsection (b) &mdash; in a more devious and unpleasant way where it is said: &ldquo;at any time within 3 months from the date on which evidence sufficient in the opinion of the person by whom the proceedings are initiated, to justify the proceedings comes to such person's knowledge&rdquo;.  We are in a position here in which proceedings for justice may be delayed considerably, where the delivery of justice may be delayed for 12 months, for two years or for three years.  The reason for the delay of delivering of justice in those circumstances does not have to be justified to our courts.  In other words, the person who reaches that delayed decision can justify the delaying of the delivery of justice by simply executing a certificate on the lines specified in subsection (4).  This is a provision which should be looked at very carefully, because it represents a basic departure from the law, as administered in this country, both in the lifetime of this State and previously.  It is something I do not welcome.  It is something which I believe should be deleted.</P>
      <P>Indeed Senator Fitzsimons drew an analogy with the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1978 which drew up the basis for the breathalyser procedures.  Certifi cation in that case has to deal only with the proving of certain matters of fact which have been dealt with by a registered medical practitioner and have been subsequently certified, on analysis, by the medical bureau.  Here we have something that penetrates the whole basis of the court's jurisdiction which now can be verified in a certification form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something which should be looked at between now and Report Stage.  I welcome the amendment.  I will not support the amendment, if it is pushed in this House today, because I believe the Minister will have the wisdom <Col N="348" /> to reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I regret to tell the Senators that I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  A provision identical to subsection (4) has already been enacted in section 30 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976, and as far as I know, has caused absolutely no problems.  It merely gives a presumption in favour of the <i>bona fides</i> of the person initiating the proceedings. <i>Prima facie</i> evidence is not conclusive proof and a challenge is still allowed as to the matters certified, or the signature of the person certifying.  It simply places the burden of proof onto the person wishing to make such a challenge.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (4), line 35, after &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;except in the case of private dwelling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something about which Senator Durcan spoke earlier under a different heading.  We object that there is a right of entry to a private dwelling even though 48 hours notice is required.  We are concerned at the extensive powers given in subsection (4) (a), (b), (c) and (d) which in my view are excessive.  One could also make the case that if a notice of entry was posted on a Friday and the &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; entered the premises on a Monday, the statutory 48 hours had been given.  But the applicant would not have received the notice.  Therefore the applicant would be in a position not to allow entry onto the premises.  There must be protection of privacy here.  Even though there is provision for 48 hours the section should be amended to exclude private dwellings.  We object to the right of entry <Col N="351" /> to a private dwelling.  We would like the section amended to read: except in the case of a &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try and keep within the bounds of the latitude you give me.  I agree with what Senator O'Toole says &mdash; and I fully support him &mdash; one's dwellinghouse should be invincible.  I agree with that sentiment.  It is very wrong that we should now have these new officials who would have the right to come in, unannounced, uninvited and in many instances, unwelcome, into one's yard, one's outoffices, one's garden and that, while there, may make plans and carry out inspections.  They may take tests and samples, they may require the owner for such information or for such records and documents as they consider necessary. That is all done without forewarning, without advice, without indication that this will happen.  I regard this to be a complete invasion of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we in this House are to respect the privacy of a dwellinghouse and the privacy of sheds, barns, gardens and yards then the definitions contained in section 7 and this one deserve to be reworded or repressed. I have no objection if an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; has powers without notice, to go to such places which do not include a private dwellinghouse, yard, garden, curtilage and the area immediately surrounding, but I do object very much that he or she may enter upon an area that is so close to the sanctity of oneself, the area that you will go to in your pyjamas without worry, that is one's yard, outoffices <Col N="352" /> and garden.  That is the area one regards as private and to oneself.  Yet at any time of the day or night one could meet one of these &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; from the county council or the Department of the Environment who were there to take tests and samples, to carry out plans and make inspections, all without invitation or notice.</P>
    <P>I fully support what Senator O'Toole has said.  This wants examination between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add anything to what has already been said.  As Senators Durcan and O'Toole have said I do feel that the person's dwellinghouse should be inviolable: we should consider a double or a treble yellow line around all of the property.  Under no circumstances should any &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; have the right of encroachment on a person's private property, that is the area attached to a dwellinghouse.</P>
      <P>Under the Hearths Act I recall a provision for entry to and at reasonable times. But it did state from 8 o'clock in the forenoon until some period in the afternoon. There is no such restriction here.  In any event we were dealing then with a foreign power.  It is despicable that our own Government should grant power to somebody to enter one's home practically at any time.  In certain circumstances it might be possible to think up a motive that might not be acceptable in law but nevertheless harm could be done.  Like Senators O'Toole and Durcan I feel very strongly that this provision is not acceptable under any circumstances and should be deleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already been put on notice by the contributions of many Senators to the Second Stage debate that entry into domestic premises would be a sensitive issue in dealing with the detail of this Bill.  I entirely sympathise with Senators' feelings on this matter.  Indeed, I <Col N="353" /> share them.  However, I must ask Senators to be consistent.  Part IV of this Bill clearly contemplates the possibility of controls on the use of specified fuels in domestic premises.  The principle of this was not fundamentally challenged on Second Stage, and, as far as I can see &mdash; is not being seriously opposed by any amendments to Part IV of the Bill on Committee Stage.  Roughly 80 per cent of smoke emissions in Dublin come from the domestic sector.  If there is broad agreement that it should be possible at least to apply pollution control measures to this sector then I would invite Senators to suggest to me how this can be done without substantive powers of inspecting houses.</P>
      <P>Smokeless zoning has been established all over Europe and has invariably been accompanied by powers of this kind in other countries.  I would be very concerned that the powers involved should be used sensitively and with respect for the normal privacy of the home.  They have been drafted as far as possible to facilitate this.  We have to remind ourselves that the ultimate purpose of this Bill before us this evening is to protect human health and our environment.  I do not see how we can do that without these powers and I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister says: that the powers are substantial and that they must be used in a sensitive way.  We cannot do a dental extraction job on this Bill to make it totally ineffective.  In other words, the Bill must continue to have teeth.  I would ask the Minister to ensure, that before somebody has an unexpected visitation from an authorised officer under this Bill to their dwellinghouse, yard, garden or outoffices that at least 48 hours' notice in writing of the intended entry should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I made the point on section <Col N="354" /> 7 that the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is not sufficiently wide.  The points made by other speakers and myself earlier might very well be met if the Minister would agree to expand the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; or expand the circumstances within which 48 hours' notice must be given.  As I said earlier, there is the area in terms of land within which many people feel they can wander in their pyjamas at will.  That area is their dwellinghouse, yard, garden or outoffices.  That is the area that should be protected and the area in respect of which notice should be given of an inspection. As I see it, the trend of legislation coming through this House in recent weeks is going to ensure that people will have to erect signposts and, as Senator Fitzsimons said, double yellow lines in their yards and gardens to prevent collisions between the dog warden and the authorised officer under this Act.  We are giving far too extensive powers to these people into the private area of our lives.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would provide between now and Report Stage that that private area I mentioned which goes beyond the immediate dwellinghouse cannot be visited in an unexpected way unless a 48 hour notice is given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that the Minister's intentions are genuine.  There is no question about that, but I am worried about the interpretation of this Bill. As I understand it, we are talking about dwellinghouses and smoke and fires within dwellinghouses.  You cannot hide smoke.  If there is pollution through smoke, surely it is visible without going into a house.  It does not matter what appliance is in the house, if there is a problem with regard to pollution it is apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am objecting to is the potential for abuse in this section.  I honestly do not understand why an authorised person in dealing with any premises has to go into the premises.  Surely he or she would only <Col N="355" /> have to go into the premises if there was a problem and if there was a smoke emission, because smoke emission is all we are dealing with in regard to a private dwelling. I cannot understand why there is a necessity to go in and actually go through the house and carry out plans which an authorised person could say are necessary while the people who live in the house might feel they are unnecessary. With regard to ensuring that private dwelling would comply with the Act, I do not think it is necessary to go into a house.</P>
    <P>I referred before to the Hearths Act and the hearths' tax.  Then, of course, it was necessary to go into a house and count the number of hearths because the fires might not be lit or lit only at frequent intervals.  If there is a problem, it is visible; and, if it is not visible, even if there is fuel being consumed, there is no contravention of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On that latter point, if there was a prohibition on coal, for example, and a special control area order, for the matter to stand up in court, if there was blatant abuse of the law on this, I am advised that it is likely that the inspecting officer would have to see coal burning; to see smoke from the roof would not be sufficient in itself if it was a matter that would subsequently end up in court.  Let me say again that I entirely sympathise with Senators' feelings on this and I share them.  It is a difficult part of the Bill.  I am not pretending otherwise, but it is effectively the teeth of the Bill, to borrow a phrase from Senator Durcan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smokeless zoning has been established all over Europe.  In the vast majority of circumstances we will be giving 48 hours' notice.  The way the notice is to be served will be dealt with under section 15.  In the North of Ireland, for example, they give only 24 hours' notice of their intention to come in and inspect.  I honestly cannot see us changing the definition, as has <Col N="356" /> been requested here, of a private dwelling to include curtilages, back yards and so on if only because some of the most difficult areas we have are concerned with unauthorised development and planning and flagrant abuse of these planning controls in relation to small back yard industries. Most of those will never cause an air pollution incident of any kind and, if so, they are not of our concern.  At present these industries are going on unnoticed to most people in the community.  Hopefully, as I said earlier, they will grow from small apples to big apples and will provide a very useful service and create employment for all concerned.  But we will have to be in a position to be able to get in and control a situation if pollution is being caused.  There are examples at present of what I would call back yard industries.  There is the recycling of scrap metal in part of south County Dublin and north Wicklow at present.  The local authorities and the Department of the Environment have no access effectively to nail down this activity.  It is causing serious pollution and is not just an isolated problem; we have had several of these instances brought to our notice over the years.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to be effective, if we are to be serious about human health and dealing with the pollution of our environment, in our preventive measures we have to ensure that we are left with a Bill that has some teeth in it.  However, measures such as this will have to be applied with the utmost sensitivity.  We will be asking for assurances in regard to what constitutes a case of urgency.  It is only in a case of urgency that the 48 hours' notice will not apply.  We might talk about cases of temperature invasion and other serious issues or emergencies that suddenly happen, a crisis of some kind or other, but they are an exception to the rule and will be very few and far between.  Normally what we are talking about is 48 hours' notice of the arrival of the inspector. Most times that should proceed without any problem at all.  It would be in the interests of all of us, our health and the health of our environment, that we have a <Col N="357" /> provision that this is done, but done sensitively.</P>
    <P>We must keep reminding ourselves what the ultimate purpose of this Bill is. We are not trying to cause trouble for law abiding citizens.  We want to be in a position to eradicate trouble from the few in our community who are not complying with the laws and deal with the situation in the interest of the common good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister says, but it is a little bit like speaking about the administration of the ordinary laws of the land by the Garda who in 99.999 per cent of cases operate in a sensitive and proper manner but we hear of the .001 case where people do not operate sensitively.</P>

      <P>Of course.  The authorised officers under this Act will be humans also.  They will not be robots; they will be humans.  They will have a nature of their own also.  I am not won over by the Minister's arguments at all. Her first argument was that we are dealing with small back yard industries.  Back yard industries will not go away in 48 hours.  If there is an industry suspected in a particular back yard, then a notice should be served giving the owner and occupier of the property 48 hours notice that an inspection will take place.</P>
      <P>If it happens that we have a mobile van industry that goes away overnight, then we can serve recurring notices to ensure than an infringement of the type mentioned does not occur in the back yard in question.  Again I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage.  There are also situations where there may not be a back yard industry, where the suspicion may not be well grounded &mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash; and where nothing is happening, but where somebody has a hypersensitive neighbour or an unfriendly neighbour.  A rural situation <Col N="358" /> can develop in rural Ireland where neighbours have not spoken for several generations. Our neighbour may decide to irritate another neighbour by setting the dog warden or the authorised pollution officer against him.  That neighbour may be viewing the stars in the middle of the night or the early morning and may have the arrival of the authorised officer uninvited but legally entitled to be there.  That authorised officer may then decide to make plans and carry out inspections, make tests and take samples and inspect records and documents.  It is not the type of thing somebody should be legally entitled to do uninvited in somebody's back yard.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter in relation to what I would call the domestic area of one's property between now and Report Stage.</P>

After all, the problem in a domestic situation is black smoke, in other words, fuel that is not fully burned.  If the problem is not visible there is no contravention of this Bill with regard to private dwellings.  Therefore, it is not necessary to go into the dwelling.</P>

      <P>&mdash; of this very important Bill is to prevent pollution.  When dealing with this Bill we must have the social consequences in mind in general.  It is easy to see that we would not have pollution of any kind if we abolish industry totally.  There must be a balance.  If there <Col N="359" /> is a back yard industry and somebody gets 48 hours notice, if there is a fire or a furnace they have ample time to let it die down.  By the time the authorised officer calls, there is no contravention of the Bill. If there is a problem in this area, it is solely black smoke.  It is probably not obvious to an authorised person who goes into the building.  All he sees is what kind of fireplace is being used.</P>
      <P>Therefore, like Senator Durcan &mdash; but not as eloquently &mdash; I would appeal to the Minister to consider this.  This is the one section of the Bill where society in general are involved.  We should be loath to let anything go through which would impinge on the rights of people with regard to their own property.  As Senator Durcan has rightly said, it should be inviolable.  In order to ensure that people comply with this section of the Bill it is not necessary to encroach on a person's private property.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the arguments being put for and against this section.  If the section were weakened or taken out of the Bill, it would not do anything to alleviate the problem in my area.  I have had experience over the years of representing and living in an area where quite a good deal of pollution has taken place.</P>
      <P>I will explain to the House, briefly, how these people operate.  They buy material in the city from Telecom Eireann and other firms and they extract a certain commodity from the material they buy. They can be prevented from doing this under existing legislation, but the problem is to catch them.  Very often they start this operation on a Friday night when the authority officials have gone away for the week-end.  They start at 6 o'clock at night and they are gone the following morning from premises where they are either permitted to go in and carry out the operation or premises on which they may have a lease or, in some instances, on commonage in the mountain area.  I get a shower of phone calls the next morning but by the time I get them the culprit has flown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> I would not like to see this section abused.  It is important to have it because these people who have caused the greatest pollution and annoyance in my area will only laugh at us if this section is not included in the Bill.  The Bill would not be effective in so far as their operation is concerned.  They are used to dodging and they know the times and the week-ends to do it.  Very often it may be a holiday week-end when they can operate right through Saturday, Sunday and Monday. By the time I get the complaint to the local authority and get a health inspector out, the culprit cannot be found.  If the operation is carried out on a premises either owned or leased by these people, they can bury the traces of it.  All they need is a machine to run over the ground where they have burnt material.  There is no evidence and they can continue to operate.</P>
    <P>They may be a very small minority but their pollution affects a great number of people.  We even had complaints from as far away as Terenure about an operation taking place in Brittas on the Dublin-Wicklow border.  That has been constant over the past ten years.  As a representative of that area, I urge the Minister to ensure that a section of this Bill will prevent or control this kind of operation.  I do not want to stop these people from extracting the material because they are giving a service to somebody, but they cannot give that service at the expense of polluting the air.</P>

      <P>In putting down these amendments we are trying to improve the legislation before the House.  The definition of a private dwelling, in my view, is where people live.  Senator McMahon spoke about other locations where this type of pollution is taking place but we are talking about the privacy of the individual, and people entering into his private dwelling.  That is why we put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think the Minister would have any problem with it.  It is not the intention of humans to pollute their own premises or the atmosphere outside.  Solid fuel fires have burned in Ireland from the <Col N="361" /> beginning of time and it is only now that we are about to contravene some sections and zones at European level that this Bill is necessary.  It may be necessary in certain sections but the draftsman should have provided some protection for the private dwelling.</P>
    <P>Under section 39 there will be special control areas.  I do not know whether the people Senator McMahon spoke about could be controlled under that section, or if a Bill could be drafted to cover the type of person he mentioned.  They are not the type of persons Senator Fitzsimons, Senator Durcan and I are concerned about. We are concerned about the ordinary private families living in their own dwellinghouses. An official from the local authority may arrive and have access to that dwelling and this 48 hour notice might not have arrived in the post before he would arrive.  I see nothing in the Bill saying a notice should be posted on a particular day.  If you post it in most places on Friday, it will not arrive until Monday.  That is only reasonable, because there is no mail delivery on Saturday.  The most sensitive part of this Bill deals with the private dwelling and we have just arrived at it.  The Minister should consider accepting this amendment and inserting the words &ldquo;except in the case of a private dwelling&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with people who are living in any area which has the problem referred to by Senator McMahon but he has admitted that not many people are involved.  He rightly asks why society as a whole should suffer because of the indiscretions of a few.  I accept that but, on the other hand, why should there be this potential for abuse with regard to entry into the private dwellings of society in general because of the few?  There is a problem in a particular area &mdash; and, of course, it is a greater problem in an urban area than in a rural area &mdash; it should be possible to see it from the outside.  In effect, we are talking about black smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McMahon says it may be done at night.  He has a point there, but not all of it would be done at night.  If an individual <Col N="362" /> is suspected of breaking the law it is very easy to watch him from the outside without encroaching on his premises. Senator McMahon also referred to the burning of cables, or whatever they are, on a commonage.  That is totally outside the scope of this section.  We are concerned solely with the private dwelling in this amendment.  If people want to break the law we are not condoning that or making it easier for them to do so, but if they do want to break the law and move to other locations if may be difficult to catch them.  That is no reason why there should be power in this section for an authorised person to walk into a person's dwelling and make plans and do whatever he feels necessary at 48 hours notice.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the circumstances in relation to the legislation and the carrot and the stick, we dealt with the stick and with very heavy penalties.  We are trying to educate people.  It was the same with the Litter Act but it was not done with heavy penalties; it is done by encouraging people.  If we want to give that encouragement to people, we must not ruffle their feathers by giving power under this Bill to walk into a premises virtually whenever an authorised person feels like doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be straightforward about this because I appreciate the sensitivity and difficulty that Senators are having with it.  I can share an awful lot of the feelings they expressed.  Much of what we are discussing goes against the Irish psyche in a certain way.  I do not want to give the impression that I might be prepared to take on board on Report Stage what I am not prepared to take on board here just to buy a bit of time or a bit of peace in the interim. I do not feel able to accede to what has been put to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I would like to make quite clear to Senators, lest any Senators may have forgotten, is that we already have a very common and well used piece of legislation that does not have to give any notice under the Planning Act.  Local Authority officers can walk into your bedroom, not alone to your back yard or <Col N="363" /> your curtilage, if they suspect or have reason to believe that you have contravened the Planning Acts.  There is no need for any notice at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If you would like to subtract the 48 hours notice altogether it would make it very easy.  We are, at least, except in urgent cases, giving 48 hours notice of our intention to call.  This is more reasonable than the existing situation under the Planning Act.  Under the Water Pollution Act, not normally dealing with private dwellings, back yards or curtilages, the officers concerned from the local authority can walk into your farmyard if they think your silage pit is polluting with no notice and see what the problem is.  You would probably get a notice telling you to comply and step in line.  There are far more difficult provisions in both these pieces of legislation than what we plan here.</P>

      <P>We do, at the other end of the spectrum.  We have accepted the Planning Act.  It has been in practice and we understand the reason for it.  Planning is part of our environment.  The Air Pollution Bill is to protect our environment. We are having 48 hours notice here.  You have no notice under the Planning Act, if you are considered to have an unauthorised dwelling of any description.  Our purpose is to protect the Irish environment and thereby protect human health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly when it comes to natural resources we do not have oil or minerals as yet discovered in any quantity, but we have an environment that is of the utmost importance not alone for Irish people to live and to rear their children in &mdash; we have it in trust for future generations &mdash; but to conduct business in, attract businesses from abroad to a pure environment and to attract our tourists.  It is everything we have going for us and unless we are seen to be serious about <Col N="364" /> protecting it and leave the teeth in this Bill we will not be doing the job we are supposed to be doing.  I respect very much the advice, suggestions and help offered by Senators but I would like to be honest and not say I will think about it for Report Stage and come in here and say no to it at that stage.  I do not feel I would be in a position to change my view as of this evening.  I do not think I would be doing right in terms of protecting human health and the Irish environment which this Air Pollution Bill is trying to do if I conceded on this issue.  I respect Senators' views nonetheless.</P>

Having regard to all the circumstances, I will not say that the Minister is being obstinate but on this section, which means so much to so many people, there should be some little give.  The Minister should be prepared to have another look at it and see if some concession might be made which would not undermine the section in any way but would act as the carrot to encourage people.  By and large everybody, even those in the business of selling fuel, is in favour of this Bill.  They want a clean environment as much as we do.  Everybody does.  I will be disappointed if the Minister does not undertake to have a look at it before Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand the point being made by the Senators and I realise that they are trying to exclude private dwellings from this section.  I do not see the difference between an inspector coming in for this purpose and an inspector coming in for another purpose under the Planning Acts.  Senator Fitzsimons knows that a planning inspector can arrive on the doorstep and say he wants to inspect x, y or z, the back yard or whatever it is.  He inspects it.  So does a health inspector who arrives on the premises completely unannounced.  That happened in my place when I was in business. I was serving a customer and the health inspector was standing there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be different, but it is much the same thing.  A health inspector can arrive on the doorstep of your house if a complaint has been made about something you are doing in your house, or a sewerage blockage in your back yard, or whatever.  He will not telephone to tell you he is coming.  He arrives on your doorstep.  As a public representative, I have often had complaints about <Col N="366" /> this.  I am sure many Senators receive complaints, usually from a neighbour, not from the person concerned.  The only way you can handle that is to report it to the health authority.  The health inspector generally arrives the next morning without any notice whatsoever.  I cannot see any difference in what the Minister is proposing here.  As a matter of fact, I would see this Bill as being somewhat easier because in the vast majority if not all cases notification will be given.  If I complain that my next door neighbour's sewerate system is blocked and is causing a health hazard, the health inspector is duty bound to come out and inspect it.  If I complain that a constituent has some health hazard on his premises or in his back yard, the health inspector arrives without notifying that person.  I cannot see that happening here.  It is intended only to catch the fly-by-night, the person of whom I spoke earlier, who is doing something when he thinks he can best get away with it.  It is not to be used all the time.  My colleagues are making pretty heavy weather of a matter for which there are precedents in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that under the Health Acts there are special powers. Senator Durcan would know more about this than I do, but I think the Health Acts relating to the last century have very definite powers in special circumstances and because of health problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It very well could be a health problem.  Inspecting a premises to see if there is a blocked drain needs an actual physical presence on that site.  This is different.  I am sorry if it appears to Senator McMahon that we are making very heavy weather of it.  I feel that in a sense I am protesting too much, but it is no harm to make the point.  I am sorry the Minister does not accept that there is no comparison with the Health Act when it is necessary to actually go to a premises and inspect a problem.  In this case here if there were black smoke, it would be visible from outside the premises.  If there <Col N="367" /> were a problem it would be different.  It would be necessary to go in and see what was causing the black smoke.  The problem could be inspected from the outside to see the extent of it.</P>
      <P>This discretionary power is available to any authorised person to go into any premises for inspection.  I do not think any Senator is objecting to that, where there is a problem which is visible from the outside.  That is different.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this section before Report Stage.</P>

This could be resolved if some attention was paid to a further wording between now and Report Stage.  We do not want to produce a society in which people become more and more resentful of the overweening powers of central Government or, for that matter, local government.</P>
      <P>I accept what Senator McMahon says. We should have some way of catching people who are determined not to be good citizens and are determined to break the law.  It would be necessary at least to give the benefit of the doubt to the people of Ireland that they are on the side of being responsible citizens.  Therefore, I suggest that in some way this should be rewarded to allow for a softer approach, in the first instance, and to allow for the point which Senator McMahon raised.  There will always be people who are determined to break the law.  That is a different matter and it may have to be pursued more vigorously. The thrust of that paragraph should be softened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to suggest a soft middle ground.  I hope I can persuade the Minister to ruminate on it between now and Report Stage.  I accept section 14 (2), that is, that an authorised officer, on giving at least 48 hours notice may enter a private dwellinghouse.  All I <Col N="368" /> am asking the Minister to do is to extend the concept of a dwellinghouse to what I would call man's domestic area, his yard, his garden, his barns and out offices to the curtilage.  If that were done it would save the citizen from the prospect of having to face the authorised officer unannounced peering in his kitchen window.  That is what I am trying to prevent.  That is the invasion of privacy.  I want to prevent.  I accept that we must balance that right with the common good.  We can do so by providing for the giving of adequate notice before that very private domestic area is entered.  That is why I raised this matter initially on section 7.  It is the definition section and it does not provide for a sufficiently broad definition of a dwellinghouse in this context.</P>

      <P>I will try to be genuinely helpful when I make this point.  This section appears to provide for five ways for the service of documents or notices which are required under this Bill.  My worry is that it could be held by a court that, unless a notice is served in one or other of these five ways, it is not properly served. There may be circumstances where it is not possible to serve a notice in one of the ways specified.  For that reason I feel the <Col N="370" /> word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be changed to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  There may be circumstances where it may be necessary for the prosecuting authority to make application to the District Court for leaflets or notice by ordinary post, or leave to serve it by publishing it in a local newapaper, or for leave to serve it in any other way.  It is too restrictive and could make it very difficult for a prosecuting authority under certain circumstances.  I believe, therefore, that the option should be left open to apply to the court for service in a different way should circumstances warrant it.</P>

It is very important that we do not leave too much doubt about the fact that notice will definitely arrive in the hands of those we intend it to.  I take the Senator's point and I will get advice and address that matter and see if we can accommodate it on Report Stage.  I am not in a position to give a definitive reply at present.</P>

      <P>These amendments are both concerned with protecting confidential or secret manufacturing processes for fuel from having to disclose information about themselves to the local authority. While the problems underlying these amendments may sometimes be genuine, there is no precedent in Irish environmental legislation for exempting confidential or secret processes from requirements or licensing or information established to protect human health from the <Col N="372" /> environment.  To accept such an exemption under this Bill would create an invidious exception.  In addition, it would create an invidious distinction within the commercial world between undertakings which were able to claim that they were confidential and undertakings which could not do this.  The prospect of reduced surveillance from our environmental authorities would also encourage claims of confidentiality beyond what might now be thought to be reasonable.  I am not disposed, therefore, to accept either of these amendments.</P>
      <P>Section 16 does take account of the confidentiality of the commercial processes. I would like to draw that to the attention of Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzsimons in particular.  It forbids the local authority to give information obtained by them under the section to any person other than a person prescribed by the Minister in regulations.  The Minister would not, of course, prescribe private individuals in regulations of this kind.  I would like to give an assurance on that. They could, however, cover corporate entities such as An Foras Forbartha, which at present manages the National Air Pollution Data Base.  What is important is that information under Section 16 must be treated confidentially.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

      <P>I accept that under Section 16 (4) information furnished to a local authority pursuant to a notice under this section shall not be given by the local authority to any person other than a person prescribed.  Information, once it goes outside the bounds of an office or a firm, may not necessarily be given, but it can be obtained in many ways without being given.  There are ways of getting information without actually handing it across.  I put it to the Minister that it is rather naive to believe that, once information about a firm which had important secret information regarding any process, not necessarily fuels, but any important secret information, goes outside the walls of an office or a firm, it is no longer secret.  Even though there is an attempt in the Bill to ensure that this information is not given to any competitor, nonetheless the reality <Col N="373" /> of life is that there is nothing sacred about local authorities or public life, as events abroad are proving at present.</P>
      <P>This subsection which the Minister is adamant will be included could spell misfortune for many firms.  In many instances it would not be necessary to be aware of secret processes.  Where after due consideration further information is deemed to be necessary, it would be reasonable to make some provision.  To have this section included as part of the Bill does nothing for the Bill.  As Senator Robb mentioned, it could be softened in some way so that it would not be to the disadvantage of firms.</P>

      <P>When I first read the proposed amendment about the secret manufacturing processes for any fuel I thought that was something one consumed.  With common sense and a sense of propriety it may not be necessary to have this sort of information divulged, provided the firm or manufacturing factory concerned is prepared to take as part of their warning that, if the situation does not improve, it will become necessary to find out more about the manufacturing process.  In effect, one of the penalty clauses or one of the encouragements might be to place an obligation on them and if they do not comply, matters will have to be taken further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Robb's contribution, the experience in dealing with local authorities under the Planning Acts has worked in practice as he suggested.  Common sense and reasonableness are the order of the day.  There is no mad rush to litigation for the sake of it, in nine out of ten cases where there would be evidence of pollution.  Section 16 (1) states that a local authority may for any purpose relating to their functions under this Act proceed only in this way.  Where there is evidence of pollution that warning or drawing it to the attention of the proprietor, or those concerned, is usually sufficient to eradicate the problem without even going into the details of how the process is being carried out or what secret process is involved in the pollution.  In <Col N="374" /> most cases it will not get to the stage where there will be a need to divulge what is going on in the factory.  The very fact that a problem is drawn to the attention of the proprietors or of the operators should resolve it, as is now the practice under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and also the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and the Fire Services Act, 1981, the Health Acts and so on which in a sense are far more Draconian than what we are proposing.  They do not require notice to enter and to inspect.</P>
      <P>We are saying that notice in writing in this case will have to be given so they will be warned that we are coming.  It was only in cases where there was a known lack of goodwill or consistent disregard for the law that we would have to pursue it in any depth to know what exactly is going on that is causing the pollution.  If any firm are very concerned about their particular process, or the confidentiality of it, they have only to resolve the pollution problem to ensure that nobody wants to know what they are about.  It is within their power to ensure that there is no unnecessary pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Planning Acts are far more Draconian, but they have worked very reasonably. Litigation has been the last resort and not the first resort in terms of resolving problems and so on.  Any prospect of reduced surveillance from environmental authorities or any get out effectively, even though meant with the best will in the world &mdash; and there is very good reason in some cases to look for protecting commercial confidentiality &mdash; beyond what would be thought to be reasonable. Senators would be amazed at what would be claimed to be confidential if people thought that was sufficient cause to be exempt from the environmental legislation we are now proposing.  The local authority may act accordingly and only for any purpose relating to the functions of this Act and the provision is there for confidentiality for commercial purposes. It has worked that way in practice even though it is not written into the planning laws in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  Even when confidential <Col N="375" /> information must be divulged to planning authorities it has never gone on public record.  It is not an area we need worry about.  The local authorities are practised in handling it.  I would have confidence that nobody in the commercial area need have any fear that their commercial secrets would be used in a way that would be disadvantageous to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>While I respect the points she is making, I know that that is the spirit in which the Minister will deliver this section. Nevertheless we cannot be sure all Ministers in future will be so benignly disposed. I wonder whether the spirit of what she is saying does not need to be reflected in the written word.  I would think there is good reason for considering an insertion of some clause such as &ldquo;in the very first instance&rdquo;.  To try to cover this point I would think that there is good reason for considering an insertion of some clause such as &ldquo;in the very first instance confidential processes and procedures need not be divulged&rdquo;.  If that is the intention, as the Minister says it is, then is it not important that it should be reflected in the way in which the legislation is drawn up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Robb, cannot accept the Minister's advice in this case.  In my experience of local authorities I find that quite detailed information regarding an operation will come before a local authority if members press for the file and inspection of the premises. The Minister has outlined how she would like to see the Bill operated, but when it is enacted it is completely out of her control.  It is then over to the local authorities and the inspectors to operate it; and the Minister will have absolutely no control, other than what is in the Bill, over those inspectors or the local authorities.  I have the same fears as my colleagues that an offender could be asked for, and would be required to give, information which would be advantageous to competitors, information which, for one reason or another, they would not want to have made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> I would like to see the Minister make some concession whereby, if the offence was not corrected, then the information could be sought.  I fully accept the Minister's good will and what she intends, but I would not accept that the information would not be available to the general public or to elected members of local authorities.  Many of them will be pressing their cases.  Let us face it, most local authorities in the Dublin area will be using this Bill and are waiting for it.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago there were cases in my own area where we were investigating, under the Planning Acts, the operation of two factories.  We had to get a detailed report of the operations of these factories.  I would have a fear that an offending party would be required, under the Bill as it now stands, to give information which might eventually put them out of business.  I would like to see that avoided, and strongly urge the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to say that the Minister's goodwill is not in question here but rather the Act and its interpretation, and the result it will have in certain circumstances.  It is unrealistic to compare the situation to the planning laws.  In the planning regulations and planning legislation it is a different situation. We are talking here about confidential information with regard to any process. This is important for very many firms.  I ask the Minister if she cannot envisage firms that would be very reluctant to disclose this information.  There is provision under subsection (4) that this information would not be given by the local authority to any person other than the person prescribed.  I presume this also means that it could not be given to any firm.  Nevertheless, even though that is in the Bill, there are ways of obtaining information apart from giving it.  I am sure the Minister can envisage that on many occasions important confidential information would be very reluctantly given.  Information, when given, could result eventually in a competitor getting that information, not through any deliberate fault of the local authority, but by reason of the fact <Col N="377" /> that once this information leaves that particular firm there are ways of obtaining it. The more worthwhile it is, the more likely it is to be got by competitors.  In fairness to people who are in business, this legislation should be looked at to ensure that, while ensuring there will be no pollution of the environment, we do not interfere with business in any way. The Minister should look again at this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat and expand a little.  This information may be sought by the local authority for any purpose relating to their functions under this Act.  That does not solely refer to instances of pollution with a view to prosecution or anything else like that.  It could also be necessary, as a prelude to considering special control area orders, for example and it might be in the interest of the few manufacturers to know that what they are manufacturing would be exempt from any prohibition under such a control area order.  It might be in the interests of the few manufacturers not to have this amendment inserted here this evening.  I want to make that quite clear. I would like, also, to point out that what we would be looking for, if it comes to questioning the fuel processors about what they are about, is information on the treatment, importation, placing on the market, distribution or sale of any fuel and to furnish in writing to the Authority such particulars as to the type and quantity of fuel produced, treated, imported, placed on the market, distributed or sold by such person.  We are not specifically interested in the secret formula that goes into making up a certain type of compound fuel of some kind, for example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It could arise.  That is why, if it does arise and if there is a need for us to know, particularly with questions of environmental safety or special control area orders in mind, we are not in a position to accept the Senators' amendment. As the situation now stands, it might be in the interest of the fuel manufacturers <Col N="378" /> for us to be able to ask questions and for them to respond, particularly if there was a consideration of a special control area order.  I am not in a position to take on board the amendments as presented here.  I would like to reiterate and to draw attention to Senator McMahon's point which he very legitimately made.  I, like he, spent many years in a local authority.  It is amazing what local councillors can inveigle out of well-meaning officials across the council chamber.  May I say specifically, at the risk of raising your hackles, if you are a supporter of local democracy, that you look at Section 16 (4):</P>
      <P>Information furnished to a local authority pursuant to a notice under this section shall not be given by the local authority to any person other than a person prescribed.</P>
      <P>We include, quite specifically, a clause to prevent in the future what you know and I know has happened under the Planning Acts.  It is there to prevent that quite deliberately without developing and raising hackles.  We understand the difficulties and the risks involved if it was to be for public consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we are making is that the fact it is built into a Bill like this does not necessarily mean it will not happen.  It may not be given, but there are ways of leaving files around, picking them up and returning them.  I am not <Col N="379" /> referring specifically to how it can be done.  It can be done and, once this information becomes the property, so to speak, of the local authority, it is no longer confidential.  Does the Minister seriously believe that if she were to ask a number of concerns whether they agreed that the section was in their own interests they would say it was?  I do not think so. In some instances where enough information was not available or was not submitted at an early stage there must be a case for getting further information.  In some instances, not all, it might be necessary to get some confidential information which might be suspected of being the problem with regard to pollution, but only in that sense should it be regarded in this Bill. Heavy fines will not make this Bill workable, but rather getting all the business concerns involved and interested.  At present it is so difficult in business to make ends meet and in the present climate it is suicidal to introduce a Bill with a provision of this nature.  I cannot press the Minister any more.  I will not speak any more on it.  It is unnecessary and it could be softened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the difficulty. While I spoke against what the Minister has in the Bill, I do not entirely agree with the amendment and I thought some middle ground could be found.  I agree with the Minister that there is a section that prevents the information from being freely given, or being given at all, except to an authorised person.  As Senator Fitzsimons has said, there are ways and means and, indeed, while I would never accuse an inspector or a local authority official of being interested in or divulging something which he should not divulge, people are only human and they can have a special interest, a vested interest, or a family interest in the business.  There are ways in which it can be leaked if there is confidential information.  I would like the Minister to agree to insert a section on Report Stage which would not require this information to be given in the first instance, but only for recurring offences.</P>

      <P>Where an inspection is required, the Minister said earlier, it is only in extreme cases that the extreme provisions in the Bill will be used.  I use the same argument here.  Why not use the extreme provisions in extreme cases only?  As the Bill stands, an inspector can seek this information on his first visit. There is a middle ground.  If the Minister were to accept the amendment as proposed there would be a way out for many people who were polluting.  They could use that section if it were enshrined in the Bill.  I am speaking about the amendment in the names of Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzsimons.  That amendment would be giving an easy way out to people who wanted to avoid being brought to heel for something they were doing.  I would like to see the Minister accepting something between what she is proposing and what the amendment proposes.</P>

      <P>We are looking for middle ground and I think we are striving to find it.  I would concede the absolute right of the Minister to have access to all information if necessary in the interest of freedom of information but, if necessary, the timing and the need for it are all important. We must seek that information if possible without compromising the activities of the manufacturing firm or of the people concerned.  I support what Senator McMahon has said that, in the very first instance, confidential processes and practices need not be divulged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think inadvertently Senators may be under the impression that section 16 involves the physical entry and inspection of these premises, but it does not.  A local authority may, by notice in writing require occupiers of premises and so on to furnish in writing to the authority such particulars as indicated here.  In this section, we are not talking about physical inspection.  It is for strategic planning, consideration, for example, of special control area orders, or any other issue directly relating on the <Col N="381" /> functions of this Bill and this information may be necessary.</P>
      <P>That is quite reasonable &mdash; an exchange of letters &mdash; and if there is any question or worry about information being concealed they can go back and ask is it true and question it further.  It would be an offence to deliberately mislead.  I think it is reasonable enough for the sake of the local authority, for the sake of strategic planning, particularly our bigger fuel manufacturers, for us to have some idea of exactly what they are capable of and what their process is, not the detailed manufacturing process but just to know how they are operating in overall strategic planning, particularly with consideration to a special control area order.  It is purely an exchange of letters we are talking about at this stage under section 16.  I hope Senators were not inadvertently misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>An exchange of letters, but it is information in the letters that we are discussing.  It is confidential information.  Certainly we are talking about an exchange in written form.  We understand that.  It is the secret process, the confidential information, which is the problem and following the enactment of this Bill, if a local authority look for this confidential information, it will be a serious offence for any firm or individual not to provide the information and they will be liable to the heavy penalties which are included in the Bill.  There is no point in trying to influence the Minister any further, but to take the view that it is a simple exchange of letters is to misrepresent, or at least misunderstand, the power in this section of the Bill.  It means that, if a local authority decide that they want full information, including confidential information, including information about a secret process which any firm would have, the firm must provide that information in written form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once that is done, although the local authority are precluded from divulging that information, there is the possibility that it will come to the notice of competitors or others who want that information. <Col N="382" /> The more important the information is the more likely it is that an attempt will be made to get that information.  I agree with what Senator McMahon said about information with regard to a secret process or confidential information about a firm.  In that context we ask the Minister to have another look at the section.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could draw to the attention of Senators the fact that this information could be needed for any purpose relating to functions under this Act, not just in cases of pollution.  For example, in the drawing up of air quality management plans and standards of maintenance there is a special control area order so, whatever else, environmental planning may be necessary.  If the first instance suggests there is something wrong, we warn them and, if they do not put it right, we can act accordingly.  It is a broader provision.  We are not primarily considering pollution instances.  It is purely to gather information if it should be necessary for strategic planning.  Just a few points as a final contribution on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  The Minister for Energy already gets returns from fuel manufacturers with most of this information we are talking <Col N="383" /> about.  The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, already empowers them to get any and all of this information if they deem it necessary under their regulations. The factory inspectorate laws allow, with notice, people to walk into any industrial premises and inspect in detail the manufacturing process of any kind and get information thereof in far greater detail than we envisage here. None of these other areas of legislation includes any confidentiality as we do.</P>
      <P>Section 16 takes account of the confidentiality of commercial processes.  I must reiterate that in case we lose it.  It forbids a local authority to give the information obtained under the section to any person other than a person prescribed by the regulations and that can include councillors too.  The Minister would not, of course, prescribe individuals in regulations of this kind.  We are dealing with human nature, but there is nothing we will talk about in this House or in the other House that will not fall down on the fallibility of human nature.  We have to make the law as tight as possible to prevent abuse by any or all sections.  At the end of the day there are very few laws that nobody has found a way around.  It is not our intention to threaten in any way commercial processes or the process of fuel manufacturers.  This legislation protects confidentiality, whereas other areas of legislation make no attempt to do so &mdash; for example the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and the Services Act.</P>

      <P>On the Minister's own admission information can be extracted from correspondence.  Any correspondence coming from an individual to a local authority will be filed.  Those files will be available to the people working in the local authority.  In the other Acts mentioned by the Minister confidential information we do not want disclosed, and that on a firm's manufacturing process, can be extracted perhaps on a visit by a particular officer.  On the Minister's own admission this information <Col N="384" /> can be elicited through the post and can be recorded in documentary evidence. Surely if a firm disclose their manufacturing process on a document, when that document is sent to a local authority everybody working in the local authority has access to it.  The amendment seeks to protect the confidentiality of the firm's manufacturing process.  If the Minister is now saying that can be got through the post or through documentation &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have led the Minister astray in my previous contribution because I dealt with a visit of an inspector to a premises.  As she has rightly pointed out the information is required to be given in writing.  I accept the section which requires that this information should be confidential.  We have gone over the ground as to how seriously manufacturerss will treat that section on confidentiality.  A person may be manufacturing a product, for example the advertisements for Brennan's Bread with which we are bombarded every day on the secrets in the manufacture of the bread.  Firms manufacturing fuel would not want to disclose the components of the product.  If they are required to put that information in writing and eventually it is found that they may be polluting and there may be a prosecution, that will come out in a court hearing.  They will be very reluctant to put it in writing.  By leaving the Bill as it is, the Minister is putting the firm in the position of having to get a notification from a local authority to supply information on how far they must go. <Col N="385" /> Under the Bill they must go the whole way whereas the amendment gives a wide scope to many people to withhold information.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with either the Bill or the amendment.  There must be a middle ground.  Why do we need this information?  Why do we so desperately need this information if there is not an offence?  I do not think it is required if there is no offence.  It is only in the case of an offence or with a recurring offence that the detailed information should be sought.  It will affect very few people.  I do not see that to have it changed will affect the Bill to the great extent the Minister obviously feels it will.  I appeal to her to find somewhere in that middle ground to cover the points being made by all the Senators here except my two colleagues in front of me.  We all seem to be at one on it.  While there has been no give from Senators Fitzsimons or O'Toole, nevertheless I think they would be happy if there was something found in the middle ground between their amendment and the Bill as it is.</P>

I would like to reassure Senator McMahon on that point.  Senator McMahon does not agree with the Bill and he does not agree with the amendment.  I can understand his reasoning.  I have no objection to that.  I want to make it clear that we will agree to any amendment which takes into consideration the problem in this area.  I agree with Senator McMahon that very few firms would be involved, but that is not the issue.  The fact that a number of firms might be involved is important to remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestions made by Senator McMahon, we would agree to an amendment which would seek to procure this information as a last resort.  I think that, even where confidential information is involved and even where a secret process would be involved, in many of <Col N="386" /> those cases it would be possible to get sufficient information without looking for that confidential or secret information. All we are asking is that, in framing this particular section, that would be taken into consideration in such a way that if the initial information supplied was not sufficient then it could be possible for a local authority to go back to those firms and get the further information required, even where this involved a secret or a confidential process.  To give a local authority this power simply by writing a letter and criminalising firms who would not supply total information with regard to their processes is wrong.  If the Minister would look at it again &mdash; and I am not altogether optimistic that there would be any great change &mdash; but if the Minister would look at it sympathetically to see if some amendment could be included to frame it in a way that would look for this information only as a last resort, Senator O'Toole and I would be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of criminalising any firm or company who will not disclose total information in relation to this.  I refer you to section 16 (1) (c) which includes very generic requirements in terms of the information to be supplied.  It mentions the type and the quantity of fuel produced, treated, imported, placed on the market &mdash; mainly how it is handled once it is distributed or sold by such a person.  That is generic information that we are looking for from the fuel manufacturers.  We do not look for the detailed secret processes of manufacturing, if they should exist. There is no question of that.  We feel that section 16 takes account of confidentiality. No matter what impression some people here this evening might have given of local authorities staff and access to files, even if they are confidential or not, all I can say is that the provisions of this law will be legally binding on the local authorities to ensure confidentiality.  It is up to those who enforce the law to ensure that it works.  We cannot assume that there will be laxity among the local authorities staff before we start off in relation to that.  I accept and understand <Col N="387" /> some of the fears that have been expressed. I feel they will be groundless in practice. It is generic information for proper planning and procedures that we want for consideration of special control area orders.  I think it is reasonable.  Every effort is being made to protect confidentiality. We are not interested in the detailed manufacturing process under subparagraph (c).  It is generic information that we are looking for under this.</P>

      <P>In all my dealings with local authority officials certainly I have no complaint with regard to confidentiality. As regards civility, in any way you might like to mention I have always admired and taken off my cap to every local authority official that I have had to deal with.  We are dealing here with a human situation.  I realise that the Minister is not going to yield to this and I am not going to press it any further.  The point of view that we are expressing and that we tried to implement through our amendment here could be incorporated easily in the Bill if the Minister were disposed to do it.  I do not think the Bill would suffer.  In my view, what the local authority is looking for in section 16 (1) (a) is details of any activity or process being carried out on the premises, any fireplace in the premises, and any fuels or other materials being burned on the <Col N="388" /> premises.  That is one part of it.  In that area I feel that to accommodate in some way the point of view we were making would not take from the Bill and would, in fact, improve it.  Everybody is agreed that we are only concerned here with a small number of firms and a small number of instances.  Therefore, it is something that would not have very serious implications with regard to the implementation of the Bill.  From that point of view I am disappointed that the Minister would not agree to have another look at it before Report Stage to see if in those cases we have instanced accommodation could not be made for them in this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 14 subsection (1), line 11, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We feel this is a very important section in the Bill because it deals with research into air pollution.  It should be mandatory on a local authority to carry out research. There is the discretion in the Bill, as it is drafted, that a local authority may decide not to do so.  We would further feel that perhaps to tighten it up further with regard to our amendment it should read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A local authority shall, where it appears necessary after detailed analysis and research, organise and conduct research surveys and investigations into the nature and extent, the cause and effect and the prevention or limitation of air pollution and may <Col N="389" /> establish and maintain educational programmes relating to such matters and shall publish or cause to be published any information derived from any such research surveys and or educational programmes.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that it should be mandatory on every local authority, not necessarily alone but perhaps in some instances with other local authorities. Where a number of local authorities boundaries might coincide and their areas would be contiguous they could, because of the cost involved, organise research in that way.  We feel it is necessary to carry out this research and it should be mandatory on regard to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the motive behind these amendments is to see this section being fully operated and research on air pollution established comprehensively.  However, I ask Senators to consider whether they would wish the section to place an obligation on all 33 local authorities under the Bill immediately to begin research on air pollution without any reference to local need or to overall national priorities in the area.  Similar provisions enabling local authorities to undertake or financially assist research are contained in sections 6 and 15 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and section 29 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  These are all stated in permissive rather than mandatory terms &mdash;&ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On a point of drafting, the amendment, if accepted, would place a mandatory requirement on local authorities under subsection (1) to carry out research themselves and leave them with the discretionary power under subsection (2) to support or resist this kind of research by other parties.  The Bill, as it stands, allows the flexibility of these powers being used as alternatives.  If the amendment were accepted, subsection (2) could not be used as an alternative to action under subsection (1).</P>

      <P>What is in mind is scientific research rather than handing over research, as is meant by the Bill, to a group of people who may not be authentic and, indeed, in the final analysis to finance a group of people.  What we are saying is that, before you take a decision or go into controlled areas or something like that, it should be mandatory on the local authority to have a scientific research carried out.  What is in section 18 is a very loose application of research into air pollution: &ldquo;A local authority may organise and conduct research, surveys or investigations into the nature and extent, the cause and effect, and the prevention or limitation, of air pollution and may establish and maintain educational programmes.&rdquo;  Local authorities could carry out educational programmes in social centres and in schools and places like that.  A local authority may contribute to any person or persons engaged or proposing to engage in any research, survey or investigation into the nature and extent, the cause and effect, and so on.  If the Minister could tell us the particular persons or body of persons she has in mind to carry out this investigation and educational programme relating to such matters, then we may be able to accept the section.  However, it is a loose application of research on air pollution and before we can implement or compel or bring about fines or convictions that we must make it mandatory on the local authority.  Under this section you are letting this type of work be carried out by persons or bodies of persons without defining either the type of person or the type of body that is going to carry out the research.  That is a very loose application of research into pollution.  Indeed, a company or a body could set themselves up as people in a position to carry out air pollution research, but they may not have any knowledge in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the only real survey one can carry out is a scientific survey rather than this survey under section 18.  This is too loose an application.  We must define the persons we intend to give this research to.  I believe that, in order to get the proper results and to have authentic <Col N="391" /> returns, competent people must be engaged in carrying out this research. The only way to do that is make it mandatory on the local authorities to carry out scientific research rather than the research that is mentioned here in section 18.  If we go back to the controlled areas, which we will be dealing with later on in the Bill, we see that, under section 39, you cannot have a special controlled area unless scientific and mandatory research is carried out by people who are qualified to do so.  That is why we feel that this is a very loose application under section 18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the amendment I certainly would ask Senator O'Toole not to tighten up the wording too much, because I think that the important thing in the area of pollution, just as it once was in the area of litter, is to raise the level of awareness in the local community about the problem.  If you have the expert committee or the expert scientists doing the job, because the local authority are told that they shall do so, at the end of the day, no matter how good the report, it will make not one whit of difference.  In fact, it may even create a certain degree of resistance among the local people, who in the final analysis, will be responsible for ensuring that we have an unpolluted environment.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very subtle question.  I like the idea where you have that phrase &ldquo;maintain educational programmes&rdquo;.  I am quite certain that we are processing children rather than putting them through a period of development, and in many cases for all the wrong things.  They come out unaware of what is happening in their community and so on.  I would just like to say that, in supporting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, I would certainly not like to see the wording here constrain the local authority into the realm of experts.  I say that with feeling, because I well remember what I said when the Litter Bill was being discussed here.  I can assure you there is as much litter in Ireland now as there was four years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I know what Senator O'Toole is talking about.  He wants the section tightened up.  If we look at the separate administrative bodies throughout the country, some of them will never have a pollution problem.  If we legislate for all of them, then they will all have to comply with this section in spite of the fact that there may never be a need in a particular county to initiate research into this area. As a member of a local authority I would say that once the legislation is there to empower the local authority if they so wish to do it, members will insist that, if there is a problem, research should take place and should be carried out.  They would insist that the manager, if he was in default, would ensure that it was carried out.  A local authority could never take anybody into a court without carrying out these tests.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (2), my local authority have on numerous occasions brought in experts in fields that we felt we were not competent to deal with, experts from such organisations as An Foras Forbartha, the IIRS and, indeed, people from abroad, where there has been major industrial development in an area which can create problems.  There are times when local authorities must resort to outside expertise.  There should be a certain flexibility shown to the manager, to the members and to the engineers to decide which way they should turn for assistance.  We have the power in this Bill to do that.</P>
      <P>Under the section as it stands, if there is a necessity, then naturally the members will ensure that the procedures shall be carried out.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in regard to these local authorities means that they will not have a problem of being bound legislatively to do something that it would be unnecessary to do.  I realise that the concern is to make sure that local authorities do function where there is a problem.  Members will ensure that they will function and the section will allow them to do that.  The other provision would make it obligatory on all county councils and corporations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Ferris' point of view, but the question is: how does a local authority know whether or not there is a problem if they do not carry out a proper scientific survey?  How do they come to a conclusion that there is a problem?  The local authority has very great powers under this Bill, or will have great powers, in relation to terms and provisions relating to air pollution, prohibition of certain emissions, licensing of industrial plant and special control areas. Local authorities have very great powers. We should ensure that those powers should be used properly.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the number of local authorities.  I am not in any position to know how costly an exercise it would be to carry out the necessary research.  I do not think it is all that costly.  As I said at the start, a few local authorities could get together.  It does not mean that every local authority would have to have its own officer in this regard.  I presume that urban authorities would fall under the aegis of the different county councils throughout the country.  In regard to cost, I do not see any problem.  It is necessary &mdash; and any reasonable person would agree &mdash; that a local authority could not exercise the very great powers they have in this Bill without carrying out a proper scientific survey that could stand up to questioning and examination.  There are set standards.</P>
      <P>While I agree with what Senator Robb has said, nevertheless this is an area where experts should be involved.  We have the experts in the IIRS and An Foras Forbartha.  In other areas it is not that costly an exercise, but it is very important.  It is fundamental that this research should be carried out at the start to see if there is air pollution and to see to what extent air pollution exists.  There is no way that I know of that we can arrive at this conclusion without carrying out proper scientific surveys.  The cost will be minimal.  It is a secondary consideration. The Minister mentioned the Water Pollution Act which was passed in 1977.  The Water Pollution Act has done nothing for this country.  We might as well not have it on the statute books.</P>

      <P>Experience of the operation of the Bill may show that certain functions could more appropriately be carried out by a body other than a local authority.  For example, certain monitoring could require a high degree of expertise and access to specialised facilities which it might not be economic for an individual local authority to provide.  In such a suituation it may be conventient to arrange that certain specialised functions be carried out on behalf of local authorities by a body operating at national level &mdash; for example, An Foras Forbartha.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this takes quite a substantial amount of the <Col N="396" /> power from local authorities.  It has the potential to do so.  Quite frankly, I would be happier if this were deleted from the Bill.  It seems that it is left to the discretion of a Minister to decide, by regulations, what functions he would confer on local authorities and what functions he would not confer on a local authority.  I am not sure I would be happy that a Minister might decide, from the point of view of cost, that an operation would be too costly for a local authority.  Surely in these circumstances a local authority might make application to a Minister rather than a Minister initially coming to that conclusion?  I am unhappy with this provision.  Have the provisions of the 1971 Act been implemented on many occasions?  Depending on the answer to that we could come to a conclusion as to whether they would be implemented with regard to this Bill in the future. Perhaps the Minister has that information available.</P>

I understand it would be only in the event of a local authority failing to carry out their functions that it would revert to the Minister to ensure that there was a proper level of control in force in a particular area.  If for some reason a local authority did not carry out their functions naturally the Government would have overall responsibility.  I take it that in all cases of which we are aware, the local authority would be the appropriate body to carry out the function and as in a previous section would seek the assistance of some other people in carrying out that function. I should like it written into the Bill that, at any given time, at the discretion of the Minister, he would have power to decide to transfer all the functions under this section to a body other than what we would consider to be the responsible body in an area in which members would have an input.  I hope this would obtain in specialised cases only as a result of the neglect of the local authority to perform their functions.</P>

This is an enabling provision, should it be deemed more expedient by this Minister, or any future Minister, to have any function or functions related to this Bill carried out centrally, for example, perhaps by An Foras Forbartha for a group of local authorities.  Or it could be done regionally, or by the IIRS or even, as happened in Dublin recently, where the Warren Spring Laboratories were called in to do monitoring and surveys in relation to air quality and standards.  There are precedents in relation to the handling of the computer services for local authorities, or for road safety.  Generally it applies to specialist areas where the economics and practicalities would dictate that it would be done under central direction rather than by each individual local authority. We are not talking about any particular function or any particular corporate body or individual.  It is enabling legislation to allow it to be done as exists in other legislation, if in the future the Minister should deem it worthy.</P>

      <P>Therefore, this Bill, when it becomes law, will confer great power on local authorities.  The 1971 Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act is a short Act.  But is gives a Minister power to confer power on persons, power that should be exercised by a local authority.  Under this section the Minister may, by regulations, provide that any of the functions conferred on a local authority, shall be carried out by private individuals.  That does not answer the question posed by Senator Ferris.  For example, would it apply only where a local authority did not fulfil their obligations under this Bill?  The Minister did not reply to my question.  Perhaps the information is not available at such short notice.  Would she say whether and on how many occasions in the past a Minister has implemented the provisions of the 1971 Act in relation to some function of a local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ferris said, the elected representatives are the people who should come to a decision bearing in mind in particular section 18 and the other two sections relating to the reserved functions of local authorities.  It is very important that the elected representatives be enabled to exercise their functions and power in regard to this Bill.  But as it stands the subsection says that the Minister may, by regulations, take these functions away from the elected representatives.  I would be happier if this section were excluded from the Bill.  The Minister might reassure the House by informing us of the <Col N="399" /> number of times in the past &mdash; and I hope they were minimal &mdash; the provisions of the 1971 Act were invoked.</P>

      <P>I will take the last point first: the number of times the provisions of Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act has been invoked. There were several occasions &mdash; the Fire Services Prevention Council is one that was formed under this Act; the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board is another, all very <i>bona fide</i> corporate bodies, set up specifically with something particular in mind.</P>
      <P>Another reason this section is necessary in relation to a Minister transferring any function or functions from a local authority in relation to this Bill is that there are certain national requirements demanded of us now by EC law in relation to environmental standards and pollution prevention measures.  In some instances it might be more prudent for the Government to carry out an overall national survey, or a regional survey, monitored and controlled centrally, or by a specialist authority, rather than leave it to the devices and resources, or lack of same, of individual local authorities to compile necessary data for the EC.  That is another reason the Minister may need certain co-ordination and some central direction, or indeed a specialist body to assume some of the authority or some of these functions on different occasions.</P>

      <P>No.  Perhaps I did not make myself especially clear.  I reiterate that the provision and the reference here to the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, is purely that the Minister may refer to a body set up under the Act any of the functions of this Bill, as they relate to a particular local authority, for the reasons I have already given: that it may be better or more prudent to direct a specific function centrally. It might be necessary to comply with certain EC directives that we had a national survey rather than depend on the resources and abilities of individual local authorities.</P>

We have no particular body in mind, I hasten to add.  We are not trying to be clever here in any way.

In circumstances in which a local authority would be attempting to perform these functions properly I do not think it proper that a Minister could take a unilateral decision that he would take those functions from a local authority and hand them over to a body.

      <P>I might refer to the Minister's functions in this regard specifically concerning regulations.  My understanding is that the power given to the Minister here is for the purposes of uniformity.  I agree that uniformity is necessary rather than have different local authorities acting in a higgledy-piggledy fashion.  What I would like to know is: where a Minister would make regulations in this regard would a local authority have any power to vary those regulations in given instances?</P>

      <P>Section 22 provides for power to make charges for emissions in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.  I might ask: what regulations? The charges are not specified in the Bill.  Will they have to be paid by the Minister?  I wonder would the Minister elaborate on that.  The regulations are not outlined in the Bill and the charges are not specified.  Would the Minister elaborate on that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Senator Fitzsimons' query as to what discretion would be left to the local authorities to impose different charges, for example, if the Minister made certain regulations, I would draw his attention to subsection (2) (d), where it says:</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) regulations under this section may make provisions for all or any of the following matters...</P>
      <P>(d) enable a local authority to make different charges under this section in respect of different emissions and in different circumstances;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section generally empowers local authorities, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, to make charges in relation to emissions.  Comparable provision is contained in the Water Pollution Act, 1977, for making charges in relation to the discharge of effluent for which there is a well-tried and practised precedent.  Economists have argued that pollution arises from market failure in that producers tend to ignore the external <Col N="403" /> cost caused by their activities and that this can be corrected by the use of emission charges.  As yet, there has been only limited use in other countries &mdash; for example, France &mdash; of charges in the air pollution area.  The concept has not been espoused by the EC.  However, it is considered prudent to allow for the possibility of such charges as they may yet have an important role to play in environmental control.  I reiterate that there is a well-tried precedent under the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  Local authorities already have many specific powers of charging for services and, in general, powers provided in the Local Government (Financial Provisions No. 2) Act, 1983.  This section is not about charging for a local authority service.  Its charges are rather intended as a deliberate penalisation of emissions in accordance with &ldquo;the pollution pays&rdquo; principle, so as to discourage and reduce the more environmentally harmful emissions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that a local authority have power to make different charges under this section in respect of different emissions and in different circumstances.  It seemed to me that that would be set out in the regulations made by a Minister.  In other words, my understanding is that a Minister would make regulations with regard to emissions in different circumstances. The question I asked, and which I hoped the Minister would answer &mdash; perhaps it is not all that relevant &mdash; is this: have a local authority power to vary an emission under a regulation made by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <P>This is the only section under which I have been able to discover a reference to a nuisance.  In reply to an earlier question of mine the Minister did say that, in this instance, &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; would be taken in its ordinary meaning. With regard to problems which may be encountered by way of nuisance &mdash; which are dealt with under the Health Act, 1898, is there not a case for a re-definition of the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; as it is to be understood in relation to the provisions of the Bill?  The main problem with regard to the 1898 Health Act is that the penalties are too small.  In many cases, the problems arising cannot be dealt with properly because of inadequate penalties. Here the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; might very well be defined, so it could in some way be incorporated into the grounds for penalty.  The penalties in this Bill are very substantial.  In one instance before &mdash; while I contended that perhaps they were somewhat on the high side &mdash; here a case could be made for a legal definition of the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; as it will be construed in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the section we tried to amend, the Minister has omitted the &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; from this one.  This section requires the occupiers of all premises except private dwellings, as defined in section 7, to procure the best practical means to limit and, if possible, prevent emissions from the premises.  This is something I cannot understand.  There is nothing wrong with emissions from a &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; under this section.  But the Minister was very concerned with getting her agent into the privacy of &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; under an earlier section.  Here there appears to be nothing wrong with emissions from a &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;.  I cannot see any sense in the Minister omitting private dwellings here when she was concerned in an earlier section with gaining access to those <Col N="405" /> premises.  That is something I cannot understand.  That is why we have been very vocal in trying to push our amendment. It appears that under this section it is all right for private dwellers to pollute by way of emissions from private dwellings. I cannot follow the logic of that.  I go along with my colleague Senator Fitzsimons when the mentions a &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to tell us why, in this section, she is not concerned with the private dweller while in in earlier one she wanted her agent to encroach on the privacy of the &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

      <P>This section imposes a general obligation on the occupiers of all premises, other than &ldquo;private dwellings&rdquo;, to use the best practical means to limit and, if possible, to prevent air pollution. I might say to Senator O'Toole that emissions arising from any premises, including &ldquo;private dwellings&rdquo;, should not be made in such a manner or in such quantity as to be a &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; to any person. &ldquo;Private dwellings&rdquo; are included where &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; is involved.  The section also sets out a number of good defences to a charge of contravening the section.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) imposes the obligation on the occupier of any premises, other than a &ldquo;private dwelling&rdquo; to use the best practical means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission from the premises. The term &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo; is defined in detail in section 5 &mdash; we spent some time with that this afternoon &mdash; and embodies the concept of reasonableness, account being taken of environmental as well as financial and technical considerations. &ldquo;Private dwellings&rdquo; are excluded from the general obligation under this subsection because emissions from them are individually small and most significantly relate to smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special regulations on smoke covering all premises may be made under section 25.  It would also be excessively complex to enforce the use of the best practical means in relation to the one million or so premises which count as &ldquo;private dwellings&rdquo; under the Bill in this instance.  As a matter of interest, considerations of this kind exclude single dwellinghouses from <Col N="406" /> the general duty of property holders of fire prevention, under section 19 of the Fire Services Act, 1981.  The powers of Part IV of the Bill, dealing with Special Control Areas, will, of course, be available to deal with emissions from houses and any other premises within defined problem areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons expressed concern about the lack of definition of the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo;.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; is a very well-tried concept in our courts, very well understood by the Judiciary.  In fact, it is taken as its dictionary definition when it is not specifically defined in this Bill.  It has a very broad definition which applies to far wider concepts than just air pollution, which is one of the difficulties of including it.  We covered this ground earlier.  I might refer the Senator to my response to that point earlier in the afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a definition of the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo;.  I know that &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; is defined in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, section 107 (subsections 1 to 7).</P>

      <P>I do not have to recount them here.  Its usage in this Bill is not sufficient in present-day terms.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say it hardly could over 100 years later. There is a necessity for a definition.  Specifically, in relation to one of our later amendments &mdash; a definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; would be helpful. We have an amendment down in relation to the problem of smell.  At present there is practically no way of dealing with this problem.  I know that first-hand because my local authority in Kells have encountered that problem.  In an important Bill of this kind &mdash; as far as I have been able to discover &mdash; we have a reference to &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; only in subsection (2).  From that point of view the Minister is missing an opportunity.  Indeed my local authority are not the only one who have encountered this problem.  The problem of smell is almost impossible to deal with, that <Col N="407" /> of, say, a container which passes through the town.</P>

      <P>The Oxford Dictionary definition of the word &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; is:</P>
      <P>1.  Injury, hurt, harm, annoyance.</P>
      <P>2.  Anything injurious or obnoxious to the community, or to the individual as a member of it (especially as an owner or occupier of property), for which some legal remedy may be found.</P>
      <P>(b) In more general use: Anything obnoxious or annoying to the community or individual by offensiveness of smell or appearance, by causing obstruction or damage etc.</P>
      <P>(c)  Applied to persons.</P>
      <P>(d)  A highly obnoxious or troublesome practice, institution, state of things etc.</P>
      <P>(e)  A source of annoyance; something personally unpleasant or disagreeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more definitions but that is the important part of the explanation of the meaning of &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo;.  With regard to the later amendments relating to the problem of smell and noise, for example, the meaning &ldquo;a source of annoyance&rdquo; would cater for that amendment.  It would not be stretching credulity too far to deal with airborne sound in that area. One of the reasons Senator O'Toole and <Col N="408" /> I included that amendment earlier was that we could deal at the later stage with noise.
