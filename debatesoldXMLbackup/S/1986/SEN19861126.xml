      <P>I have notice from Senator Mark Killilea that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House to-day, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to indicate if the decision to close the Drainage Maintenance Section in Headford, Co. Galway, can be reversed.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Sentor John Connor of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his views on the future of surgical services at Roscommon County Hospital in view of the recent report from Comhairle na nOspidéal &mdash; Review of Surgical Services in the <Col N="2" /> Western Health Board area, June 1986.</P>
    <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Killilea's motion for today's Adjournment.  It will be taken when the business is concluded; the time does not seem to be definite yet.  Senator Connor may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 4 on today's Order Paper.  Item No. 1 is the resumption of Committee Stage of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill, 1986.  It has already been debated to some extent but there are still a large number of amendments.  It is a <Col N="3" /> question for the House &mdash; I know there will be difficulties in view of the Dáil division &mdash; but I do think that if this is not completed by 6.30 p.m. the House should seriously consider continuing the debate after 8 p.m. with the hope of fininshing by 10 p.m.  Item No. 2 is the Committee Stage of the Air Pollution Bill and it is being ordered merely in case there was a very quick conclusion to the Control of Clinical Trials Bill.  There would be no suggestion of debating it after 8 p.m.  Item No. 4 which is a Private Members' Bill should be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> 6.&mdash;(1)  A person shall not conduct a clinical trial unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is a registered medical practitioner or a registered dentist,</P>
    <P>(b)  there is a subsisting permission granted by the Minister under section 4* in respect of the trial, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of section 4 (2) (a)* or 5 (2) (a)*, as the case may be, have been complied with.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;conduct a clinical trial&rdquo; means the conducting of a systematic investigation or series of investigations for the purpose of ascertaining the effects (including kinetic effects) of the administration of one or more substances or preparations on persons where such administration may have a pharmacological or harmful effect, but does not include the conducting of such a systematic investigation or series of investigations as aforesaid&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where</P>
    <P>(i)  the administration of one or more substances or preparations, as the case may be, is on a patient in the ordinary course of a medical practice (in the case of a registered medical practitioner) or of a dental practice (in the case of a registered dentist) and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the principal purpose of that administration is the welfare of the patient,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)  where the substance or preparation concerned is to be administered to persons undergoing a course of training leading to a qualification which will entitle such a person to be registered as a registered medical practitioner or as a registered dentist or as a registered pharmaceutical chemist and where it is to be administered as part of such a course of training, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> (c)  for the purpose of examining the nutritional effect of the substance or preparation concerned where that substance or preparation is a normal dietary constituent;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;registered pharmaceutical chemist&rdquo; means a person registered in the Register of Pharmaceutical Chemists for Ireland maintained under the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (b), after &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or as a registered physiotherapist&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is that the new section will replace section 5 of the Bill as published.  It introduces four changes in the old section 5.  First, it provides that a permission or an amendment of a permission may not be availed of unless the ethics committee have given approval.  I refer Senators, at this stage, to section 6 (1) (c).  Secondly, the term &ldquo;medical&rdquo; has been objected to as being too vague.  &ldquo;Pharmacological has emerged as a more appropriate word but as it is not generally accepted as including the kinetics or metabolism of a substance in the living body, it is advised that &ldquo;including kinetic effects&rdquo; should also be included in the definition of &ldquo;conduct a clinical trial.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment makes it clear that the Bill, except where specific exemptions are provided, covers all clinical trials involving the administration of substances or preparations for the purpose of ascertaining the pharmacological effects, the pharmacokinetics, the bioavailability, toxic or harmful effects, tolerance, therapeutic effects, comparative effects and also preventive effects.  The new wording of subsection (2) also includes the description &ldquo;systematic&rdquo; and this is considered to clarify that ordinary medical or dental practice is not caught within the ambit of the Bill.  It has also been argued that it is not possible to say that any investigation or practice is <Col N="6" />&ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; for the welfare of the patient in question, so this has now been changed to read &ldquo;the principal purpose&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I would like to refer to.  The section provides for an exemption from the provisions of the Bill of practical demonstrations of the effects of known drugs in medical, dental and pharmacological classrooms.  Finally, it also provides for an exemption from the provisions of the Bill of nutritional studies involving normal dietary constituents. This is the replacement of section 5 of the Bill.  In many ways it arises from representations made to me in the course of the debate following publication of the Bill and also from the observations of Senators on Second Stage on the Bill itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by supporting Senator FitzGerald's amendment to the Minister's proposed new section because I know there is, for example, a serious concern among a number of physiotherapists in Trinity College that they would now be excluded from conducting clinical trials with simple substances, substances for example, such as proprietary gels or powders or electrode pastes and that these, in fact, are not covered by the section as it stands and these would in effect amount to clinical trials and require what it is necessity to apply under the Bill.  I ask the Minister when he is considering this amendment and considering the position of physiotherapists to also address the question of whether practical classes involving physiotherapy students which are required by them in order to obtain their existing qualifications will be allowed to be exempt also from the Bill.  These are part of the training of a physiotherapist. Are they excluded from being within the scope of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I feel that there is merit in the amendment put forward by Senator FitzGerald.  This is a concern shared widely by physiotherapists and they too would wish to be specifically referred to in order to exclude them from the application of the Bill in a manner which I do not think was in any way <Col N="7" /> intended as part of the overall purpose of having protection for those participating in clinical trials.</P>
    <P>There is another matter; it is simply a matter of seeking clarification.  Like a number of other Senators I am puzzled by the bracketed clause &ldquo;(including kinetic effects)&rdquo; which is now expressly part of the Minister's proposed new section 5. As I understand the meaning of kinetics, basically it relates to movement of drugs in the body &mdash; in effect, a movement in time &mdash; and that kinetics relates to the information necessary to show how the body has handled a particular drug or drugs and, for example, how long a drug stays in the body.  Therefore, it does not seem to me that it would be appropriate to refer to &ldquo;(including kinetic effects)&rdquo;. It could be including the &ldquo;kinetics of the substance.&rdquo;  That is my limited understanding of the term.  Perhaps the Minister would explain it more fully when he replies on the section.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that the section does represent a very considerable response by the Minister to representations to him and to issues raised on Second Stage.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has been prepared to make a very substantial amendment as represented in the new section.  I hope he will accede to a further amendment of it either in precisely the form put forward by Senator FitzGerald or ensure that the very real concern and worry of physiotherapists are allayed in the manner which I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the dilemma when this amendment was called that I had just arrived in the Chamber.  I observed Senator Mary Robinson as I came in and, knowing her particular interest on behalf of her Trinity constituents, I felt it appropriate that she would take up the matter, as she did, a moment or two later.  It is worth making the point in relation to this amendment that we are talking here, as Senator Robinson has mentioned, of the concern of physiotherapists about the simple use of substances which are actually gels, <Col N="8" /> powders and electrode pastes.  In effect, what we are talking about is heat treatment physiotherapists apply in one form or another by way of clinical trials.  Clinical trials have an important therapeutic effect on patients and even on those who are there for the purposes of the trial.  It is a matter of concern to them that such a number of different areas are being categorised by the Minister in the section &mdash; which is very much welcomed &mdash; when he talks of the registered medical practitioner or the registered pharmaceutical chemist.  It is apropriate in this area, with the considerable role the physiotherapist has now developed within the medical world and the hospital system, that they should be treated with the very same inclusions and recognitions this amendment seeks.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment or, if not, that he will come up with something suitable to deal with the point I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I wish to support Senator FitzGerald's amendment in regard to the concern and worry that physiotherapists have.  We can all agree that they have a role to play in trials &mdash; maybe not in the way that we imagine trials.  Certainly the work physiotherapists are doing in health generally is extremely important particularly with the disabled and in the area of arthritis which we know is a painful and crippling disease. The work they can do in regard to treatment, wax treatment, or whatever work they think is necessary to further advance their concept of what might bring about a greater healing and soothing effect is important.  For that reason I, too, support that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the physiotherapy proposal, the effect of Senator FitzGerald's amendment would be to provide an exemption from all of the provisions of the Bill for physiotherapy classroom demonstrations.  That would be a particular exemption for what the Senator described as registered physiotherapists. I want to give the assurance that, after careful examination, physiotherapy training as such is not affected. <Col N="9" /> Therefore, undergraduate training for physiotherapy is not affected by the Bill.</P>
      <P>A situation can arise where in the physiotherapy training classroom a substance, for example, creams, could be administered.  These would be used for demonstration purposes, not for trial purposes or for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of them in a trial situation. Therefore, the position where physiotherapy training demonstrations or medical training demonstrations are concerned is not necessarily of the kind to which reference is made in the Bill.  In any event, if the physotherapists were using an unknown substance it should be done under medical supervision and would come into a trial situation.</P>
      <P>Although I am sympathetic to the idea of registered physiotherapists, I will not go down that road.  I am sorely tempted to talk about physiotherapy and the need for registration.  We do not have a system of registration of physiotherapists here as yet.  Therefore, I can assure the Senator that the fears the physiotherpists have do not arise under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson referred to the kinetic effects.  It has been difficult to reach a definition.  We have had extensive consultation and protracted discussion with our legal and medical advisers and they are satisfied it covers all of the aspects involved in trials.  As I indicated to Senators, it is a fairly broad definition. The industry and the professional staffs involved in trials accept it as a reasonable definition because it encompasses not only the pharmacological effects but also the pharmacokinetic effects and the bioavailability issue, the major issues of toxic effect, tolerance, therapeutic effects, comparative effects and finally, the one we are most concerned with, the preventive effects.  These are covered in the Bill.  Senator Robinson's points are somewhat different from those of Senator FitzGerald.  He was concerned with teaching classes and I can assure him that ordinary physiotherapy work and practice is not affected by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it &mdash; I may not have made this point as clear <Col N="10" /> as I should have when making my first contribution to this amendment &mdash; the concern of physiotherapists at the moment is that they would, by the new section, be excluded from conducting clinical trials with some of these simple substances, gels, pastes or heat substances. That concerns them because they do it at the moment.  They are being excluded from being in a position to do it as I understand it.  What is the Minister's reason for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We did have correspondence &mdash; Senator FitzGerald alluded to the fact that the Senator may have had some consultations with her Trinity colleagues &mdash; with the head of the Trinity training school.  My Department wrote to the head of the school some time ago confirming that the Bill did not affect physiotherapy practice, and did not affect demonstrations or trials provided &mdash; this was to be the caveat purpose of the Bill &mdash; the substance used was not an unknown one.  In that framework it would come into the context of a trial.  I think the head of the training school is satisfied with the explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance in relation to the practical classes involving physiotherapy students, but it is not clear to me how physiotherapists can be included in the present provisions of the new section 5.  They are, in fact, excluded by the way in which section 5 is couched.  Therefore, they cannot carry out clinical trials with these simple substances, maybe I am misreading it: that seems to me to be the thrust of the section as it stands.  I have not heard the Minister give a rationale for it.  He has, by the effect of section 6 (c) as it stands, excluded the nutritional matters from the Bill.  I do not think he has covered the point raised on this section and I would like to understand what the reason is for not including physiotherapists as being in a position to carry out these clinical trials unless there is some particular worry on his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to go <Col N="11" /> along the same road as Senator Robinson. I do not understand how the profession of physiotherapy will find itself situated in the immediate future in dealing with new substances that need to be tested, that need to have a clinical trial to establish their value from a therapeutic point of view.  I wonder with the increasing significance of physiotherapy in the medical world, with the increased extensive longevity in the community and the recognition that physiotherapy is now getting, if we are finding a difficulty with the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; simply because physiotherapists are not registered.  I can see the Minister's point in that area.  Is that the sole reason for not being prepared to accept the amendment in this area?  I do not know if the Minister wants to comment at length on the registration of physiotherapists, it seemed he did not want to go down that road.  It may be that by introducing the words &ldquo;registered physiotherapists&rdquo; in this Bill we might have more chance of dealing with the registration of physiotherapists in the foreseeable future than by leaving them out.</P>
      <P>I am not clear on the position of the physiotherapists who want to deal with a new substance.  The Minister said they were quite entitled to use a clinical trial for substances already established.  If there is a new substance on the market which a drug company has developed and which might have an important therapeutic application, what is the position of a physiotherapist who is in touch with the drug company which is prepared to fund the trial for the substance, cream or whatever it may be, and which may be very useful to medical science or rather in the treatment of patients?  Will we find a problem in allowing for a new substance to be introduced for the purposes of dentistry and medicine but not physiotherapy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that physiotherapists as such cannot be covered under the Bill because, first of <Col N="12" /> all, anybody in this country can call himself or herself a physiotherapist.  There is no registered profession.  Even if there was a registered profession, a trial can only be conducted under medical supervision. Therefore, to draw the analogy, if I decided to call myself a physiotherapist and decided to lessen the pain of the loss of a ministerial seat by using an unknown substance, I certainly would not be authorised to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this for self-application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the main concern of the schools of physiotherapy &mdash; those who have a recognised professional status but not a formal, statutorily registered status &mdash; is that a good deal of their work would be diminished. That would not be so.  If they are going to become involved in trials relating to particular substances of a new formulation, they would have to accept medical supervision and medical authority. Medical responsibility would come into play in relation to the trials.  We could not have a situation under the Bill where physiotherapists conduct a trial.  It is not a blockage in the Bill.  The Bill does not cover that eventuality.  Where does one stop if one provides an exemption? We are not writing exemptions into the Bill; we are devolving responsibility on particular people for the conduct of trials. It would be a very considerable step to allow the conduct of clinical trials involving substances which may have a pharmacological or harmful effect to be used other than under medical supervision.  I know quite a number of nurses who are quite expert as physiotherapists but they would not have authority to conduct a clinical trial.</P>

      <Col N="15" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P>In page 5, before section 5, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>6.&mdash;(1)  A person shall not conduct a clinical trial unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is a registered medical practitioner or a registered dentist,</P>
    <P>(b)  there is a subsisting permission granted by the Minister under section 4* in respect of the trial, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of section 4 (2) (a)* or 5 (2) (a)*, as the case may be, have been complied with.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`conduct a clinical trial' means the conducting of a systematic investigation or series of investigations for the purpose of ascertaining the effects (including kinetic effects) of the administration of one or more substances or preparations on persons where such administration may have a pharmacological or harmful effect, but does not include the conducting of such a systematic investigation or series of investigations as aforesaid&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where</P>
    <P>(i)  the administration of one or more substances or preparations, as the case may be, is on a patient in the ordinary course of a medical practice (in the case of a registered medical practitioner) or of a dental practice (in the case of a registered dentist) and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the principal purpose of that administration is the welfare of the patient,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> (b)  where the substance or preparation concerned is to be administered to persons undergoing a course of training leading to a qualification which will entitle such a person to be registered as a registered medical practitioner or as a registered dentist or as a registered pharmaceutical chemist and where it is to be administered as part of such a course of training, or</P>
    <P>(c)  for the purpose of examining the nutritional effect of the substance or preparation concerned where that substance or preparation is a normal dietary constituent;</P>
    <P>`registered pharmaceutical chemist' means a person registered in the Register of Pharmaceutical Chemists for Ireland maintained under the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) (b), after &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or as a registered physiotherapist&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister which he might consider for Report Stage.  I accept his problem in relation to the fact that there is no registration process for physiotherapists. Section 5 (1) (a) states that a person shall not conduct a clinical trial unless he is a registered medical practitioner or a registered dentist.  Could the Minister insert in the section: &ldquo;or a physiotherapist working with a registered medical practitioner or a registered dentist&rdquo;? It would probably not apply in the area of dentistry.  Is there any way in which the Minister could manoeuvre the wording so that the profession of physiotherapy would be at least mentioned in the Bill as some sort of recognition, whatever about registration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be another battle being fought under the framework of this Bill, that is, the very strong desire, and one with <Col N="17" /> which I have considerable sympathy, that the profession of physiotherapists should be a formally registered profession.  To give statutory status to the profession, the question of definition of physiotherapist would inevitably arise.  I will be meeting an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of various professions who are seeking professional status as a registered profession.  Only then will that question come up.  At the moment anybody can claim to be a physiotherapist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of registration of physiotherapists, if that were to occur in the near future, would the Minister have power to include by regulation registered physiotherapists in the section?  The question arises as to whether the Minister should have a residual power to do so.  It is not something that I have examined.  It would be desireable if that were to occur, that the Minister would be able by regulation to extend the scope of this new section to a registered physiotherapist.  I welcome the clear assurance the Minister has given that the section would not affect the practical classes involving physiotherapy students which are required for their qualifications.</P>
      <P>I have one other question arising out of the Minister's response to Senator FitzGerald when he referred to the pharmacological effect of the preparation. That arises out of the wording of the section here.  It is part of the definition of conducting a clinical trial which refers to the administration of one or more substances or preparations on persons where such administration may have a pharmacological or harmful effect.  Would the Minister clarify whether placebos are considered to have a pharmacological effect?  They were discussed in some detail on Second Stage and they are an essential part of the conduct of certain clinical trials, so it would be important to know whether they were included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the suggestion made by Senator Robinson.  Perhaps the idea of having a clause which covers the possibility of registration would be <Col N="18" /> a good idea.  Without that, the dangers which the Minister has identified are considerable. I wonder, if we are to have a clause which includes the registration of physiotherapists, whether we are not now into a whole new arena of the registration of paramedics in general.  That would need to be looked at very carefully because, after all, we are dealing with drugs and other matters of research which could have potentially dangerous side effects and which can on occasion be lethal.  While I have never advocated a very special position for my profession in these affairs, I still feel they are probably the best qualified to supervise any research which is being done.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister made the distinction between clinical trials which are trying to push forward the frontiers of science and clinical demonstrations?  We have, in fact, made that very clear but we must be careful that people are not being used for teaching purposes in what is seen as a relatively safe manner.  This applies particularly to medical students, physiotherapy students, or any other students who are vulnerable to their overseers and teachers and who may be under some obligation to participate in trials as demonstrations, or at least they may feel they are under some obligation.  All of these matters need to be taken into account. I certainly feel that, if we extend it to registration, we are talking not just of physiotherapists but of registration of paramedics in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As we know, demonstrations as such are not encompassed, although I can readily see that if one is to conduct a class properly one may want to involve certain aspects of the demonstrtion by way of training.  A trial is a clearly defined entity within the framework of the Bill.  We could not agree to the physiotherapists being brought in under the Bill.  I share the view that there would be uproar.  If they were conducting a trial, accompanied by a registered medical practitioner or under his auspices, there would be no necessity to have it because there are a whole range of people who could work with a registered <Col N="19" /> GP.  In the end the question boils down to, &ldquo;what is a physiotherapist?&rdquo; by way of statutory definition.  There is none at the moment and I do not think we could contrive one in the framework of the Bill.  It would require a separate piece of legislation such as registration of medical practitioners, registration of dentists and registration of the other professions.</P>
      <P>As we know, placebos do not have a pharmacological affect.  They are not prohibited by the Bill and the problem does not arise.</P>
      <P>By and large the physiotherapists, who understandably may feel aggrieved at some of the comments I have made, do understand the situation.  As Minister for Health I do not employ nor do I encourage the employment of physiotherapists by either the public or voluntary agencies unless they have undergone what we would call a recognised training and achieved a certain competence, but that is not a statutory recognition as such.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 37, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) for any other reason, the trial should not continue.</P>
      <P>and he shall communicate the reason for his revocation of the permission to the person who had been granted the permission.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is to provide for an explanation by the Minister of the reasons for revoking a permission. There has been some criticism about the absence of such a provision <Col N="20" /> from the Bill as published and I have included there a quite specific statement that the Minister shall communicate the reason for his revocation of the permission to the person who had been granted the permission.  I think that meets the criticism which has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has been prepared to come forward with an amendment requiring that where a permission to hold a clinical trial has been revoked he would have to communicate the reason for this revocation of the permission to the person who had been granted the permission. This was raised on Second Stage and it was a genuine concern.</P>
      <P>I still have a further concern about the breadth of the second ground which allows the Minister to revoke a permission granted.  Section 6 (b) reads:</P>
      <P>for any other reason, the trial should not continue</P>
      <P>As the Bill has been amended, the Minister has accepted that before granting a permission he would consult with the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This was accepted in an amendment to section 3.  It seems that the Minister is being given very unfettered discretion in relation to revocation.  It would be easier to accept that there would be a power and, indeed, responsibility on the Minister's part to revoke a permission where the trial or any part of it was not being conducted in a manner in accordance with the permission. That is a necessary power and there should not be any requirement of consultation there.  Under paragraph (b) all the Minister has to do is to communicate the reason, which is an important safeguard.  It may be that the reason would not warrant revocation and if the Minister had an obligation to consult with the National Drugs Advisory Board the opinion they would give would be that, notwithstanding the circumstances that had come to the attention of the Minister, it did not warrant revocation of the permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not be desirable, since the <Col N="21" /> Minister accepts the requirement of consulting the National Drugs Advisory Board prior to giving the permission, that he should be prepared to consult them where he was potentially exercising a very open-ended power to revoke and where now he accepts it would be necessary to give the reason for revocation? I say this because if the permission is revoked there is no body to whom a person can appeal against that revocation. Therefore, it is important that revocation would not occur unless it was fully warranted and justified.  I would have thought that the National Drugs Advisory Board would have a very crucial role to play in relation to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking clarification of a few points on section 6 and on the amendment.  We are not told in the section or in the amendment what the procedure will be for communicating the revocation of the permission.  If the Minister decides to revoke a permission, will the notification of the revocation be conveyed in writing to the person conducting the clinical trial?  Must the clinical trial be discontinued immediately on receipt of the notification of the revocation, or how soon afterwards must the clinical trial be discontinued?</P>
      <P>There are two elements in a clinical trial, first, the administration of the substances or preparations to the persons undergoing the clinical trial and, secondly, the monitoring of the effects of those substances and the investigations which would take place after the substances had been administered.  If the notification from the Minister revoking permission for the clinical trial arrives after the substances have been administered but before the effects of these substances or preparations have been monitored, it would be wrong to discontinue the conduct of the monitoring at that stage.  It would be most important that the monitoring of the effects of the substances which might have been administered should continue.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator Robinson said in relation to the fact that there is no right <Col N="22" /> of appeal contained in the section.  Under this section the person conducting the clinical trial should have recourse to some appeal procedure or should have an appeal process of some sort available to him or her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  This item brought the greatest criticism when the original Bill was published.  The Minister says in his amendment that he &ldquo;shall communicate&rdquo;. Does he have in mind a particular timescale within which he will communicate with the people involved in the trial, or is he obliged under the provisions of the Bill to communicate within a certain period of time regarding his intention to revoke?  Section 6 (b) allows the Minister great room for manoeuvre and there has been previous criticism of that clause.  Therefore, I would like the Minister to specify the other reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other Senators in welcoming this amendment.  I spoke at length on this matter on Second Stage.  It is reasonable that if a trial should not continue the reason for the revocation of the permission should be given to the person involved.  The very strong criticism that was voiced when the initial Bill was introduced has been cleared to some extent by this amendment and for that reason I totally support it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be any help to suggest that section 6(b) might be reworded as follows:</P>
      <P>That following consideration with the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to the permission already given he believes there is a reason why the trial should not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to considering a formulation of consultation on Report Stage in relation to this section.  If, for example, the Minister of the day got information under section 10, which deals with the reporting of adverse reactions, it would be quite exceptional <Col N="23" /> if he did not deal with the matter immediately. That is why we do not wish to have a time limit on it because he would perhaps ask for an immediate cessation of the trial.  I would have no objection to providing something like the following: &ldquo;If for any other reason following consultation with the National Drugs Advisory Board the Minister indicates the trial should not continue&rdquo;.  I do not think we could provide for a further appeal &mdash; that would be like chasing one's own tail.  I will come back to that on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>These amendments are to meet the objection that individual members of ethics committees could not be expert in all aspects of a proposal for a trial.  Accordingly, I met the objections there and Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 <Col N="24" /> are drafting amendments consequential on amendments in the previous paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with members of ethics committees who are worried about their expertise but the evidence, and particularly the evidence given at the inquest on Niall Rush, would not give one any great confidence in the collective wisdom of ethics committees or their collective conscientiousness in doing what they are supposed to do.  Some of the evidence at that inquest was quite horrifying about the laxness of the procedures involved.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept that what we have now is a committee which becomes a single body, an &ldquo;it&rdquo; rather than a group of individuals with individual responsibilities. There is nothing I can see in the Bill which would suggest what would be a quorum of the committee, which members of the committee would require to be present, or whether a committee could carry on in the absence of certain members.  It is quite conceivable that a committee could operate consisting of one or two members without the lay members being present if the time did not suit them.  This seems to me to be singularly unsatisfactory.  If people are not prepared to accept the individual responsibility of doing the things which an ethics committee are supposed to do, they should not go on ethics committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ethics committees are not rewards for people to show that they are eminent people in society who can be relied upon to do important jobs very well.  They are extremely important jobs which should be done by people who take the job seriously and whose terms of reference, as defined by law, require them to take the job seriously.  The people on one ethics committee of whose membership I am aware, which is the one quoted by the ICP in June 1986, all sound like eminently reasonable, concerned and interested people.  As the Bill now stands, none of those people will have any obligation to be in attendance at meetings to discuss the proposed clinical trial and will not have any obligation to inform themselves <Col N="25" /> about what is going on in a proposed clinical trial because all that will be required is that the committee as an &ldquo;it&rdquo; says something, does something, or carries out certain responsibilities and that could be done by one or two and no more. I would like the Minister to elaborate somewhat more on that.  The representations I got by and large on this issue were not about the sensitivities of the ethics committee.  They had far more to do with the manifest failures of ethics committees in the past to deal with things like frequent use of the same volunteers, the very doubtful procedures for recruitment, the question of the relative role of payment to people being induced to carry on.  In those sort of basically very important areas the ethics committee not only did not meet the high level of responsibility listed in this Bill but failed at the most obvious ones.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing, for instance, that as late as two months ago the ICP were not in a position to give me any information about the socio-economic background of the people they were having as volunteers. They could not say what proportion of the volunteers were unemployed; they could not say anything like that.  If the existing ethics committees did not consider it worth their while to insist that that sort of obviously important information should be available, if they had not clarified the question of the procedures for recruitment, I do not think we should give a collective title to a committee and say that &ldquo;it&rdquo; may do this, that and the other thing.  The least we can expect is that the individual members take their responsibility seriously.  It may well be true that there are certain specific technical questions, but the vast majority of the things that are listed as responsibilities under this Bill for ethics committees are things on which a competent lay person should be able to make a reasonably satisfactory judgment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to put in a provision about a reasonable effort on the part of the members of the committee to make these judgments I will be quite happy, but to give a blanket exemption which means that all you have to do is <Col N="26" /> put your name at the end of a page and the committee says it is satisfied and no individual has an individual responsibility to anything, seems likely to turn these committees into something like prison visitation committees which do a good job of giving the Department of Justice an easier ride than they otherwise would get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As you recognise yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, you need your wits about you at the moment to understand where you are with these amendments. As I understand it, although we have amended part of subsection (1) of section 7 it still contains the initial proviso that &ldquo;where the Minister is satisfied that a proposed ethics committee for a clinical trial is competent to consider the justification for conducting...&rdquo; and so on, the Minister is still satisfying himself as to the competence of the ethics committee and then that will become the ethics committee for the particular clinical trial.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I put strongly to the Minister &mdash; I still want to come back to this, perhaps on the section &mdash; the reality of the present situation where ethics committees are ongoing committees; where people serve for a number of years and have a range of different experience and expertise.  They are by no means all members of the medical profession, as the Minister knows, but they acquire a particular sensitivity to the issues and they would be the kind of people who would be responsible and able to examine the various matters under the headings set out in subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy for the objection raised by Senator Ryan.  At present, we have a section which requires the Minister to be satisfied with the competence of the members of the ethics committee to do the job.  As the section stands the members of the committee must be satisfied under the various headings, but the Minister is now proposing to change that and to have the ethics committee in some way as a collective body but not necessarily with all of the members of it satisfied with the various <Col N="27" /> criteria.  There is no provision in the Bill for a quorum or for how majority decisions will be taken or any other matters and this seems to be contrary to the Minister's insistence, apparently, on having <i>ad hoc</i> ethics committees about whose competence he must be satisfied before they can be an ethics committee for the conduct of a clinical trial.  The Minister owes the House an explanation as to why he is bringing in these amendments at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I have had in relation to this section is that it is being represented to me very forcibly that there would be great reluctance on the part of individual persons, particularly lay persons, to serve on such committees if they had individual personal responsibility imposed on them and that was the position, as Senators are aware under the Bill as originally provided.  I have consulted a number of bodies and I have taken into account the guidelines in the report on The use of Drugs in Biomedical Research by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland of January 1986 and their particular approach.  I have only taken it into account, I am not bound by it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the manner in which the committee will subsequently conduct their business, I propose to issue guidelines in detail about the informal operations of the committees.  To put all of that into the Bill would have made it a very, very big cumbersome Statute.  The committee should act on a collective basis and have collective responsibility for their decisions.  That is the only way in which one can get a broad cross-section of people to sit on those committees. Otherwise lay persons who have no expertise in the area may be entirely reluctant to go forward and participate on a community basis on such committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's concept of collective responsibility but I would qualify some of the matters which will be under trial.  They could be so complex that there might, in fact, be no <Col N="28" /> one on the ethics committee who would understand fully the implications.  To put it another way, as has already been suggested many people on the ethics committee might not understand.  If there is no one on the committee who can explain to the lay people the precise implications of what is involved in a clinical trial we must consider the possibility of co-opting someone for the purposes of explaining in layman's terms what is involved.  After all it is very important that the people who are using their instinctive judgment about what is right and what is wrong, what is appropriate and what is not, should be fully informed.  I agree with the issue raised by Senator Ryan about the number of people sitting on ethics committee. There should be some obligation to ensure that a minimum number are present while important decisions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view of Senator Robb.  Collective responsibility has to be the attitude and aim of an ethics committee.  I have seen some of these medical protocols and certainly I support the view of Senator Robb that they are very technical and very medically worded.  It requires a real medical presence on an ethics committee to fully understand them.  All ethics committees should be loaded in that area; indeed, most of them I know have three or four medical and nursing people, people who have been involved in the medical profession over many years.  It is also important from moral and other aspects that we should have a lay presence as well and again there is evidence that this is the case.  These people are giving their time to help medical research and we should not do anything that would frighten them away from ethics committees.  They are very responsible people.  In the past ethics committees looked for more information from the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The point made by Senator Robb, I understand it, is that at all of the ethics committee meetings the medical adviser for the company must be present &mdash; the medical investigator.  He obviously explains the trial and the protocol to the <Col N="29" /> whole committee.  This raises the question of a national ethics committee.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider having a national supervisory committee who would advise and give guidelines to the various ethics committees throughout the country.  Obviously we are talking about people connected with the National Drugs Advisory Board who are clearly expert and are well qualified to issue regular guidelines to ethics committees.  This is something the Minister might look at. Certainly his amendment is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are not going to be intimidated by experts.  The reality is that the person who is to give the approval to go ahead with a trial will be the Minister.  He will consult all sorts of important people but he will be the person who gives the permission and he will most definitely, on most occasions, not be an expert.  He will have the best expert advice at his disposal.  I will explain what I believe to be the real quality of an expert in a moment.  It is offensive to the average lay person in the community to suggest that what the Minister can understand sufficiently well to be able to give his permission cannot be understood by the lay members who freely choose, and are under no coercion to do so, to go on an ethics committee.</P>
      <P>The late Lieutenant-General Costello had a very definite view about experts. The real expert was the person who could explain things to an average citizen in a way that was comprehensible; the real inexpert was the person who could not, and pretended that because it was too complicated the lay person could not understand.  There is nothing that cannot be explained by a true expert to an intelligent lay person in a way that enables the intelligent lay person to grasp it.  That incidentally, in my view is the very essence of democracy &mdash; the idea that people are competent and qualified to understand everything to the extent of being able to make intelligent decisions about it.  If they are not, we do not believe in the essential value of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The remarkable thing about democracy is that it has demonstrated consistently the capacity, by and large, of people over the last 100 or 200 years to do just that.  People who are faced with difficult choices, hard and complex issues come to remarkably wise decisions.  It is beyond me why lay people on an ethics committee who freely choose to be on it but who half the time, apparently, will not understand what is going on will still append their names to a report and say it is all right.  There is quite legitimately a reasonable argument that perhaps there should not be a burden of proof on an individual member of a committee to show that they made a detailed study of each issue.  It is reasonable to expect that there should be a requirement to take reasonable steps to understand what is going on, on each individual member of the committee.  That would be a long way from this but, as it stands, we are going to have an ethics committee which could meet with one third, a half, or a quarter of the members, depending on the urgency of the situation, which could be made up of perhaps two medical people or, in the more extreme opposite case, two lay people.  The Minister's assurance on guidelines is inadequate.</P>
    <P>If we were going to talk about regulations which would prescribe the method under which the committee should meet, what should constitute a quorum, that a committee such as this should not be empowered to take decisions without the presence of at least one lay member of the committee, we are really leaving this thing wide open, not to abuse but to shortcuts when circumstances dictate. Inevitably, if we do not make it in some way a condition of membership of this committee that each individual member takes the job sufficiently seriously to understand what is going on, we will end up with active members who will have a long list of letters after their names, and honorary members who will be the lay people who will be there to give the committee a good impression in the public eye.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am still far from happy <Col N="31" /> that this totally sweeping shift from individual responsibility to group collective responsibility is the proper way to ensure that an ethics committee take their job seriously.  As I have said the evidence that came out at the inquest on Niall Rush suggested that the present ethics committee, for whatever reason, were not in a position to understand and did not take sufficient steps.  The other evidence available is that they do not know the sort of socio-economic background or the methods of recruitment.  Apparently they never got round to asking these things because the information was never compiled.  All of these things suggest to me that we must define the responsibilities of an ethics committee and of the individual members far more closely than the amendment suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am talking at cross purposes with Senator Brendan Ryan; in fact, I would go a long way with everything he has said.  I should like to tease out one or two aspects of the problem. If we have collective decision making certain numbers will be affirming, certain members may not know and certain members may be against.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether the collective decision will be a majority decision, or a consensus decision, or will the committee go on discussing the matter until there is general agreement that they are for or against the proposed trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of the whole problem is the point raised by Senator Ryan, and he could not have done better than to quote Lieutenant-General Costello because that is the right definition of an expert. Whatever way the committee is constituted and no matter how it does its work, it is vital that the people who are in it, and particularly those who would not claim to be expert, fully understand what they are doing and feel free to participate in the discussion even if they are not experts.  As I have heard said at many meetings in the North in recent years, spare us from the experts.  The experts are the products of a refining process, a <Col N="32" /> reduction process.  The layman, as he is called, the person who is the non-expert, is relating to the thing by instinct and by feeling and he knows instinctively what is right and what is wrong, but he does need information.  <i>A propos</i> of what Senator Ryan was saying, Eric From, the philosopher, once said that the price of freedom is choice and in that sense it is the choice of the individual and not the choice of the group &mdash; but we will not get too philosophical.</P>
    <P>I return now to a point made by Senator Fallon.  He emphasised the need to consider this collectively.  I was a little concerned, however, about the suggestion that the drug company expert or doctor went to no end of trouble to explain what was involved.  I am quite certain there is a high level of ethics and a high standard among the vast majority of drug company doctors but, nevertheless, they are representing a commercial enterprise and the drug companies are there to make profits.  If one is subjected to many different people coming with very much the same sort of drug &mdash; as the Minister will know, under many different colours, covers and names; one using a minor parameter which is different from the others &mdash; one will know the sort of pressures which these people are under, not unlike the pressures which prison doctors suffer when they are employed by the State and, according to their ethics, there should be nothing between them and the prisoner. There is a problem there, so I would be wary of taking all my advice and information from even the most highly prized expert or even the most highly paid non-expert of the medical profession representing a drug company if he is to be the sole presenter of the information which is being sought.  It comes back then to a point Senator Mullooly made the last time we discussed this &mdash; the need for independence, the feeling of independence, the right to an independent attitude and the encouragement of an independent point of view and voice, so that we can blend together in this ethics committee, for the benefit of the individual be he a non-expert or expert, the <Col N="33" /> right ratio and insist that there are enough members of that committee present so that, when the decision is made, we can have as much confidence as it is possible to have that it is the right decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of critical and important points have arisen in contributions by Senators.  We reviewed the responsibility of individual members of committees.  We reviewed it very thoroughly with the Attorney General's office and the legal advisers of the Department.  It was a very difficult decision to take but our view was that we had drawn up the original section too tightly in terms of imposing individual responsibility and we felt it would be more appropriate to have a collective devolution of authority and responsibility on the committees as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon inquired whether the NDAB would be consulted and if they would be in a position to advise and bring forward formal proposals regarding the composition of committees.  The answer, I can assure the Senator, is in the affirmative. They intend to do just that.  The NDAB have a particular view, which they have conveyed, and they would regard the composition of an ethics committee as follows.  A minimum composition might be as follows: that there would be two medical practitioners, neither of whom would be personally involved in the study to be conducted; one practitioner at least should be independent of the institution in which the study is being conducted or is to be conducted; one at least should be personally familiar with the conduct of clinical trials generally; and then on the paramedical side, one would have to have a nurse actively involved in patient care, involved in the composition of the committee. Certainly, the view of the NDAB is that because of monetary considerations and financial issues which inevitably arise, the cost of the trials, assessment and so on, and whether inducements are being offered, there should be a professional, non medical-person with experience in public administration or industry who would be in a position to evaluate that <Col N="34" /> question.  The other two people involved would be members of the lay public whose competence and general integrity would be held in regard.  That is essential for such a committee.  Of course, inevitably, legal questions would arise.  There is a view that a person with legal competence or background, not medical legal competence, should be on the committee since litigation problems could arise. That would be a committee of about six people and would be the general minimum structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be happy with that type of broad concept of composition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. That would be the broad concept.  In consultation with the NDAB there are a number of documents available.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland have ethics committees, and they have publications relating to the composition and procedures of ethics committees, membership and the whole question and mode of working of the committees.  These documents are available as are the Journals of the Royal College of Physicians of London.  Together with the NDAB, we would propose to issue pretty comprehensive guidelines for the operation of those committees under the Act.  We have that advantage. They do not have the advantage of having an Act and to that extent, I am slightly jaundiced about some of what is written down and what is practised in reality but, nevertheless, we will have a stronger overview.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult question, because the Minister of the day has to be the repository of all knowledge in this area, but he will have to be satisfied one way or the other about the qualifications and the bona fides of those he will allow to take on the responsibility of technical evaluation on his behalf.  He will have that confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the main points I wish to make.  The original wording was that bit too tight and could result in a substantial number of persons refusing to serve <Col N="35" /> either professionally or in a lay framework, because they would have personal responsibility as members of the committee devolved on them.  I cannot really say a whole lot more.  While I have said to Senator Ryan that I would broadly accept ethics committees of the kind the NDAB have listed, I want to assure him that I will not be giving blanket approval for clinical trials because I am very unhappy about general blanket approval or sloppy administration in this area.  It is a very dangerous, difficult area and, therefore, each ethics committee will have to be approved by the Minister of the day.  I can see him doing a great deal of midnight work on files, but he will have to accept that responsibility if we want to have that kind of work done in a publicly responsible way.</P>
    <P>I have been talking to some companies and a number of professional medical representatives.  They feel that once this Bill is enacted and the Act is there at least they will know the position with regard to litigation.  There is nothing worse for a major pharmaceutical company than to come to a country and not know where they stand if problems arise.  We have a very large number of such companies in Ireland.  They are major companies and quite a number of them would be prepared to accept a regime because, while there are cowboys in every industry, it can be very difficult to deal with them. There are quite a large number of companies in the industry who wish to act in an ethical manner and they are very proud of the product authorisation which they get from Ireland.  I know how difficult it is in some countries to get a product authorisation.  I will mention France, for example, where frequently consumer authorisation is denied more for commercial reasons than for any other reason to preserve the monopoly situation of French companies.  With Irish statutory backing, particularly in the European Community, it should be possible to break into such markets more effectively.  While I digress to that framework, I broadly accept what Senator B. <Col N="36" /> Ryan and Senator Robb have said.  I share their views in that regard.  I can see the NDAB having a lot of midnight work to do as well to satisfy the Minister of the day on a mutual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up a couple of things.  What is the difference between the legal accountability of the members of the committee under the Bill as it is at present and under the proposed amendment?  In other words, if there were a court case and there were an investigation as to whether the committee as a group fulfilled all obligations required to be fulfilled, what would be the effect on an individual member of the committee of what is proposed in the amendment and what is contained in the Bill? That is the first question.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to guidelines in the form of regulations or is he simply talking about guidelines by way of a departmental circular?  Departmental circulars may have awesome capacities behind them but they have no legal standing and, therefore, the ethics committee would be perfectly free to ignore them or to say that the exigencies of the situation by way of time or some other issue prevented them from following all the guidelines. One useful solution would be to issue guidelines by way of regulations for the operation of ethics committees, in particular on what constitutes a quorum and also how they come to decisions.  Is it majority decisions, two-third decisions, or consensus?  I would like to have these two specific questions answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations may be made under the Act.  Certainly should I have the opportunity initially it would be my intention to lay down informal guidelines and have them instituted, operated, reviewed and if necessary bring in statutory regulations relating to the guidelines themselves.  It can be done. Senators know my personal impatience about such matters.  I prefer to do everything today but we have to get the informal guidelines moving first and moving well.  If they prove to be impossible or if they are circumvented in any way, we can <Col N="37" /> bring in statutory guidelines under the Act and they would have the full rigour of the law.</P>
      <P>The same applies in relation to the legal responsibilities of ethics committees.  The Minister of the day will have to be very careful to ensure that he has established an ethics committee prepared to accept the legal responsibility because as the Senator knows, they can be co-joined in any action against the Department of Health, the Attorney General, the People of Ireland, against the company concerned and the NDAB.  It is no secret that the NDAB are very concerned about that kind of litigation.  In fact, without disclosing too much before this House we have had considerable discussions with the NDAB on the question of their liability and their indemnity in relation to the work they do.  This is one of the main reasons the Minister for Health rather than a board of the NDAB must take up the public indemnity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion that is not clear from the Bill.  Whatever problems would have arisen about the individual's responsibility will arise again if it is made clear to the members of an ethics committee that they are personally, <i>via</i> the committee, going to be actionable for improperly carrying out their duties, that <Col N="38" /> it is not something that would be carried by the people conducting the trial.  If, as the Minister said, the committee are still capable of being co-joined as a party in a court case I am not sure the amendment makes as much difference as I thought it did.  It was suggested that people may be unwilling to serve on committees if it is possible to seek damages from an ethics committee because they failed to carry out their duties &mdash; that the entire committee would be sued.  It is all the more reason to ensure that the procedures by which the committee operate are clearly written down and are available and are seen to be followed.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult for a member of a committee to do other than resign if the committee failed to follow the departmental guidelines, whereas if the departmental guidelines have statutory force at least by way of regulation, the members of the committee could insist, if necessary through the courts, that the statutory procedures for the operation of the committee should function.  I can see why the Minister would be very enthusiastic about having an informal set of guidelines to see how they would work.  Although he probably cannot say it as bluntly as I can, I think the Minister agrees with me. Committees in the past seem not to have overly exerted themselves in seeking information in a number of areas, at least judging from the absence of that information on the part of people conducting the trials.  I wish he would say he would do this by regulation and tell the committee how they must at least conduct the outline of their affairs rather than wait and see how it works.  His successors may not feel they want to get involved in what is a difficult area as the Minister I am sure knows only too well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4) (f), line 27, after &ldquo;trial&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and in particular the need to ensure that each participant's medical condition is monitored in the long-term so that any long-term effects of such trials are identified&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an attempt to elaborate on one aspect of the statutory duties of the ethics <Col N="40" /> committee, which are listed in subsection (4), paragraphs (a) to (1).  It refers to paragraph (f):</P>
    <P>the extent to which the health of participants is proposed to be monitored during and after the clinical trial;</P>
    <P>I propose to insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and in particular the need to ensure that each participant's medical condition is monitored in the long-term so that any long-term effects of such trials are identified&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This representation was made to me by a number of people.  There is a matter of clinical judgement being left here, which might be fine if these people were undergoing medication.  The longer term effects are both a risk and a possibility. If people are authorised to conduct trials on human beings, they ought to be obliged, at reasonable intervals, to check that there is no long term effect on people's health as a result of such trials.  It was alleged at the inquest on Niall Rush that one person did 12 different trials in six months &mdash; I think it was Niall Rush himself.  Therefore, if you are going to have some participants in a number of trials &mdash; both of the groups who communicated with me conceded that some people did more than one trial, that they did a number of them &mdash; there is a particular obligation to ensure that not just the immediate effects of one trial are monitored but that the long term and perhaps cumulative effects of a number of trials are also monitored.</P>
    <P>It is important for lay people to realise there are no absolutes in science.  There is only the best reliable information at the time, which may or may not be reliable, which may or may not have a degree of inherent unreliability built into it.  Science cannot give absolute answers &mdash; unless you want to go back to very basic things &mdash; and medicine even less so.  It can only state the balance of probability and it can assess the degree of probability.  It cannot state absolute certainty.  It cannot even say somebody with a particular ailment will definitely die, any more than it can <Col N="41" /> say that somebody with a particular ailment who gets a particular treatment will definitely live.  There are no absolutes in science and less so in medicine.  Therefore, there ought to be, in some form or other, a responsibility on those who systematically conduct clinical trials to look to the long term effects, if any, on a participant's medical condition.</P>
    <P>I will not argue about the wording of my amendment but I am interested in the Minister's views &mdash; and I hope his agreement &mdash; on the need for longer term monitoring of subjects' health and also a statutory obligation of some form on those conducting the trials to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with the sentiment Senator Brendan Ryan has just outlined, I can see enormous difficulties arising.  He is quite right.  You can have long term effects.  Nobody knew what the long term effects of Hiroshima would be. The question is whether you will monitor people for a year, for five years, for ten years, or for life.  It was fashionable in academic institutions in recent times to literally possess patients, to put a label around their neck with whatever the disease was, and to follow them up for the rest of their lives.  Very often they are seen by a junior member of staff who did not relate to the consultant who had originally seen them.  &ldquo;ISQ NAD see in six months&rdquo; was written on the chart &mdash; NAD being nothing abnormal discovered. It was routine.  If a university or a hospital is doing research, very often it is done by a young person who is not in that institution for very long.  How is he to follow up the object of this study?  If it is an industrial pharmaceutical firm we all know that firms come and go.  Capital flows in the direction best suited to it. Therefore, the people who might have carried out the research might not be in the country to carry out the follow-up. You also have the subject of the research and in a very mobile world he or she will not always reside where the research took place initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Senator Ryan's point and I feel there is a need to clarify the obligations of the people undertaking the research in <Col N="42" /> relation to follow-up, but I think it would be unrealistic to see this in the very long term.  You might overcome this difficulty, in part at least, if after the initial follow-up had been done over the specified period a report was sent, in the usual fashion when a person is discharged from hospital, to the family doctor of the person concerned.  The family doctor should, by the nature of things, be the person who knows the medical record best.  Family medicine is changing rapidly, more so perhaps in the North than in the Republic.  There is a new generation of family doctors who are much more health orientated than disease orientated.  The whole practice of family medicine has been redefined.  It has become much more community based. There is a realisation that for a number of decades the professionals had moved away and become alienated from the clients.  That relationship is being looked at and a better one is bound to come through in the next ten years or so.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the point Senator Brendan Ryan is making &mdash; and in an ideal world I would pursue it &mdash; I think it is impractical and I have, therefore, suggested a way around it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the consequences of the amendment? Are we actually taking on board something which we might regret?  On whom is the onus to follow up the long term medical condition of the participant? A commercial company carry out a trial.  The product authorisation is granted.  If there were recurring symptoms, necessitating hospitalisation and further medical attention, the responsibility of the commercial company would have ceased and the State would have to pick up the tab for monitoring, hospitalisation or medical care after the trial had ceased officially.  In the instance of long term monitoring, it could lead to very expensive and cumbersome treatment being paid for by the State who would have to pick up the tab for a commercial enterprise which had started the trial.  For that reason I am reluctant to <Col N="43" /> support the amendment.  Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask Senators to refer to section 7 (f) of the Bill?  It is as good a formulation as we could come up with on the question raised by Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Robb and his colleagues.  The section refers to: &ldquo;the extent to which the health of participants is proposed to be monitored during and after the clinical trial;&rdquo; in effect the committee would have to be satisfied about the extent to which it is proposed.  In that framework, it can if it wishes and it would have the professional competence to so state its inquiry.  It could deal in particular with the long term effects on the health of a volunteer or a participant &mdash; whichever we might call him &mdash; and it would be quite open to it to insist that there would be long term monitoring because the purpose of some particular trials might be to induce a long term change or effect.  One can readily think of medical conditions where the long term effects of a particular trial are the all-important aspects.  Therefore in that framework by putting in the phrase &ldquo;during and after the clinical trial&rdquo; the Attorney General would hold that the understandable concern of Senator Ryan and his colleagues would be met.  I want to thank Senator Robb for his observations on the matter.  I would point out that not every participant will of course have a GP to whom a report may be sent.  Senator Ryan has been quite scathing about the absence of a GP relationship which many participants would have.  That poses a problem, but in short we do not consider the amendment as formulated to be absolutely necessary, because it is covered by 7 (f).</P>

      <P>I am quite certain that if the present Minister was to remain in office for long enough the situation prevailing in the Republic &mdash; whereby people can exist without GPs would be rectified. I think that is a disgrace, that there can be, as the Minister has perhaps suggested, quite a number of people who would not know to whom they should go <Col N="44" /> for medical care if and when they need it.  I have actually written in here my suggestion for overcoming the difficulties just by adding the words &ldquo;and that a discharge report be sent in the usual way to the subject's family doctor advocating appropriate follow-up when this is deemed or where this is deemed necessary&rdquo;. The fact that the issue of the family medical service has been highlighted has been worthwhile in itself regardless of or as well as drawing attention to the need for follow-up and trying to keep follow-up in its perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has underlined one of the fundamental problems of this whole business, that the type of people who do not have GPs should not be involved in these tests in the first place. The reality is that if we did not have somewhere between 50,000 and 250,000 people unemployed the two major clinics in this country would be desperately short of volunteers.  It is very difficult for them to persuade people who are not stuck. Let us not pretend that it is all to do with unemployed people having free time or leisure time which they are happy to put at the disposal of the future of humanity. It is nothing like that at all.  The reason why unemployed people in large numbers are prepared to undergo these trials, the reason why unemployed people are prepared, &mdash; in the case of Niall Rush, to do six trials during the nine months before his death &mdash; is that money is on the table for doing them.  One simple solution would be to specify and require that a person's GP be contacted and if a GP was not available to say &ldquo;right you do not have a regular GP&rdquo;.  The excuse would be that these are healthy people who have never been to a GP.  I think that by the time somebody is a full adult they will have been to a general practitioner.  If they have not been, the risk of taking on a person who does not have a GP is so much greater than the inconvenience to a group conducting a trial of having to find somebody else.  The evidence at the inquest on Niall Rush was that all sorts of short cuts were taken.  Half a dozen recent volunteers testified and gave very <Col N="45" /> similar evidence, which is a long way from the high flown phrases of the people who run those clinics.  Consequently, I accept and I am happy to accept that the implication of paragraph 7 (f) as stated by the Minister does contain at least the possibility of long term monitoring.  I am not happy that we could have a position that people could be tested who did not have a full medical history to be presented to the potential conductor of the trial from a GP.  It gets us back to things we will discuss again about where do volunteers come from and how do we deal with them.  I am not prepared at this stage to push the amendment to a vote because I do not think it is necessarily the most fundamental amendment and I would like to sit back and think about it and perhaps introduce a somewhat similar one at a later stage.  However, I do not want to terminate the discussion before Senator Robb has spoken.</P>

      <P>I think one of the matters that might be taken up by the Minister in his guidelines is that before a person embarks on a trial it should be known who their family doctor is (a) for the very simple matter that you have easy access to medical records if such exist, and (b) so that after a clinical trial a family doctor can be informed that it has taken place and as I have suggested that any further appropriate follow-up beyond the length of the trial and the natural follow-up which should take place after the trial, could be looked after by him or her.</P>

      <P>I would briefly say that I think the suggestion made by Senator Robb and indeed by implication by Senator Ryan's colleagues that such a provision should be incorporated into the informal guidelines, I can certainly assure Senators that I would be quite prepared to incorporate it, I do not think it would be constitutional or possible to have as a pre-condition that anybody going on a clinical trial would have a named general practitioner.</P>

      <P>Certainly what Senator Ryan is suggesting is laudable indeed. <Col N="46" /> Again the practical reality, and indeed I know many of the young men and young people who take part in these trials is that they would not have a GP.  Remember this before you go on a trial the two most important criteria &mdash; this is what the Bill is all about &mdash; are to ensure that you have health specimens and informed consent. They are the two principal things.  I believe firmly that these requirements should be part and parcel of every trial that, you should have a healthy specimen of a young man over 18 and so on.  Again we must remember that at the start of a trial, at the conclusion of a trial and many times during a trial the participant is medically examined.  I would love to think that every one of these participants had a GP and that reports and so on would be followed up.  Knowing many of the participants as I do I have to say they have not seen a doctor for ten or 12 years. To make that in any way obligatory would seriously impede trials.  I understand Senator Brendan Ryan's real concern in this area but it will not work because it is not practical.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4), lines 31 to 33, to delete paragraph (h) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) details of the method by which participants are to be recruited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment of a very different kind.  I put it in this form because I have a later amendment coming up which refers to payments.  I am suggesting that paragraph (h) which refers to &ldquo;details of any proposed inducements or rewards, whether monetary or otherwise to be made for becoming or being a participant...&rdquo; be deleted and a simple paragraph substituted on the details of the methods by which participants are to be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a disturbing and devastating body of information which suggests that <Col N="47" /> people were paid in Dublin to visit hostels to recruit homeless people to do trials. That is utterly and completely unacceptable to me.  I have a strong suspicion that it would probably be unacceptable to the Minister.  Given that this was one of the areas of concern about this whole business that has been talked about over and over again, it is important that there is a reference to the methods by which participants are recruited as distinct from the criteria under which they are recruited.</P>
    <P>The methods of recruitment ought to be a matter statutorily laid down for the concern of the ethics committee.  It is a matter of fundamental ethics that people should not be paid to travel around hostels and night shelters in Dublin inducing people to undergo clincial tests.  In many cases the people being recruited have very little information about the tests. There was the extraordinary case where a parish priest in Dublin who was on his pastoral duties in a night shelter was approached by an individual and asked would he do a set of trials in which he could make easy money.  He discovered that the individual who had approached him would be paid for each volunteer who turned up having been recruited by himself.  These facts were denied for a long time by the people who run these trials but when the evidence accumulated the position shifted somewhat.</P>
    <P>Therefore I regard it as fundamental that the details of the procedure and the methods by which participants are recruited must be studied by the ethics committee on every occasion on which they propose to do or to supervise a clinical test.  Anything less will leave a gap in an area which has been documented beyond any doubt to be one of the real areas of public concern.  I put down this amendment so that the ethics committee shall have regard to details of the methods by which participants are to be recruited in order to eliminate what has become a most scandalous exploitation.</P>

      <P>As we know, the ethics committee must examine the qualifications and competence of each person conducting the trial.  They must be satisfied as to the nature and extent of the medical examination participants undergo as volunteers in the trial.  They have to examine the details of any proposed inducements, rewards or payments made to persons for conducting the trial. There are many criteria laid down in section 7(4).  I could meet the wishes of the Senators in that regard and try to marry in the amendment proposed by Senator Ryan if it were to read &mdash; I have to talk in a very open way because the parliamentary draftsman will fashion the wording in the appropriate way &mdash; as follows: &ldquo;...the criteria to be used for the selection of participants including the method by which participants are to be recruited&rdquo;.  I would not have any objection to that.  The parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General have already assured me that the criteria to be used for the selection of participants is encompassed by that phrase.  I wish to <Col N="49" /> accommodate the views of Senators as far as possible.  If it would clarify the section even further, I would be prepared to add on that phrase subject to appropriate drafting on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (4), between lines 43 and 44, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(m) the socio-economic background of each participant and the need to ensure that the lower socio-economic group are not over-represented at such trials.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment in many ways follows on from my previous amendment.  It also follows from the astonishing experience I had of discovering that the ICP had no records as to the socio-economic background of the people being tested.  They admitted that a great number of the participants in their trials were at least &ldquo;partially unemployed&rdquo;.  Apart from grounds of social policy I would have thought that on medical grounds alone the socio-economic background, the nutritional background and the housing background of each participant would be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important and this is why I deliberately worded the amendment: &ldquo;the socio-economic background of each participant and the need to ensure that the lower socio-economic group are not over-represented at such trials&rdquo;.  If there is any evidence of an overly high representation of lower socio-economic groups in an area where there is a risk that the majority of society are not prepared to take one has to cry halt and cry exploitation.  It is difficult to envisage any reason other than the attraction of material inducement which could arguably result in a disproportionate representation of lower socio-economic groups at such trials.  I cannot see any reason other than that.  If the reason is that they are being attracted by rates of payment or other kinds of inducements, <Col N="50" /> that is wrong.  It is wrong because it adds yet another level of burden and abuse to an already excessively abused group &mdash; the lower socio-economic groups.  It is extremely important that it should be an obligation to keep this sort of information and to ensure that there is reasonable representation of all sections of society.</P>
    <P>This may sound a bit unrealistic but if it is the affluent and those of conspicuous consumption who demand that various drugs be made available to heal them of the consequences of excessive and conspicuous consumption it seems a bit much that those who will never be able to afford that excessive and conspicuous consumption should have to pay the medical price of discovering the drugs to pay for other people's excesses.  That is putting it in slightly extreme language.  Nevertheless basic fact is that up to now these groups did not even bother to collect this sort of information.  We should make it obligatory and also ensure that there should not be excessive representation of the lower socio-economic groups in these trials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with the general thrust of what Senator Ryan said what needs to be emphasised is not so much that over-representation but the exploitation.  I would have preferred if the amendment had read that the socio-economic background of each participant and the need to ensure that the lower socio-economic group are not exploited as would be indicated by such as their over representation.  The reference to exploitation is important.</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator Ryan that I have tortured myself, tortured the Attorney General and his parliamentary draftsmen with the sentiment <Col N="51" /> expressed in the proposed amendment. It is not simply possible in legal terminology, or indeed in a legal concept, to put the formulation as such into the Bill.  As we well know the structures of socio-economic backgrounds in Ireland are in many ways disintegrated.  They are subject now to an enormous variation of influences, such as money, social attitudes, education and other pressures. Therefore, to lay down a specific criterion of that nature in the Bill is simply not possible.  I will certainly insist in the guidelines on the taking of general epidemiological data relating to all volunteers. That data will be subjected to very subjective assessment and a person who ostensibly comes from the top socio-economic background can be enormously vulnerable in terms of trials.  Therefore, to say that the lower socio-economic groups should not be over-represented frequently begs questions in relation to other groups.</P>
      <P>In terms of the difficulties we have had, I will quote from the informal guidelines of January 1986 of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  I am quoting from these guidelines more for the information of Senators rather than to pass judgment on it at this stage.  The college state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Healthy volunteers are important contributors to medical research. Unfortunately, at present, they are often vulnerable individuals (unemployed, low paid workers and students) who are primarily participating for financial reward.  Drug abusers may present a special problem.  We feel that efforts should be made to widen the volunteer pool.  Ethics Committees should be informed of all proposed payments to volunteers and should be satisfied that they are reasonable and are not so large as to induce subjects to take risks primarily for a reward. Advertisements seeking volunteers should be seen and approved by the Ethics Committee.  If healthy volunteers are to be recruited in another institution, e.g., students, staff, then a responsible officer of that institution <Col N="52" /> should be informed and general approval sought in case participation could adversely affect work performance whether through drugs, action or absence from work.</P>
    <P>They go on to deal with many other aspects.  There is even the problem where a child may be sent forward with agreement of the parent, the parent being in a low socio-economic group and participating in a particular trial.  The college are quite specific in relation to this.  They state:</P>
    <P>Children should not be the subject of research that might equally well be carried out on adults.  Children should in no circumstances be the subjects of research holding no potential benefit for them.</P>
    <P>I would have a problem with this because I would then have to consider the question of, for example, mentally handicapped persons and what proportion of mentally handicapped persons could or could not be included in research.  The current correct guideline is that they should never be the subject of research that might equally well be carried out on adults in full possession of their intellectual faculties, but they are clearly the only subjects available with the particular mental disease or disability, with the agreement of the immediate family.  One then has to go down through the other criteria.  It is a very difficult area.</P>
    <P>In short, the terms used by the Senator are not precise legal terms.  I hope to see the epidemiological background built up and then see the ethics committees on an informal and regulatory basis given definite guidelines.  I do not think it is possible to put it into the Bill as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite, but you will be glad to hear I am moving in that direction. The Minister has made a very good case.  I never felt I was in competition with the parliamentary draftsman when <Col N="53" /> it came to drafting amendments on Committee Stage.  Therefore, I never worry if the drafting of an amendment of mine is inadequate.  If I can persuade the Minister in question to accept the principle involved I am perfectly happy to let the Minister go ahead and persuade the parliamentary draftsman to draft the appropriate amendment.  Having witnessed and having had to understand some of the creations of the parliamentary draftsman I was never too overwhelmingly intimidated either.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I hope the Minister will refer specifically to the issue of excessive representation of unemployed people in the pool of participants in clinical trials in his guidelines.  I am not at all clear from what he said that he shares my view that there is something very suspect in this.  I keep wondering what countries like Switzerland and Sweden which have thriving pharmaceutical industries and very low to minuscule unemployment do in relation to clinical trials.  Switzerland has virtually no unemployment.  Do they actually export their trials to other countries like ours where there are large numbers of unemployed people available, or do they have a different method of recruiting volunteers?  It intrigues me how some of the countries who have the most prominent developing pharmaceutical industries can carry out clinical tests if they have no unemployed people because the argument is that if it were not for unemployed people nobody would volunteer.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that there are other groups who participate in a big way.  I hesitate to mention them because I would only get myself into a row peripheral to the issue.  I would like the Minister to clarify that the guidelines will advert to the need to be particularly careful that unemployed people, hostel dwellers etc. are not seen to be excessively overly represented among participants in trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, in setting out the informal guidelines, to bring many factors to the attention of the ethical committees, for example, many drugs <Col N="54" /> which are entirely related to the conditions of women.  There are many very vulnerable women who are not unemployed and not necessarily in the lower socio-economic group who may wish to participate in such trials for multiple reasons.  These women need protection. Many criteria have to be taken into account in directing ethics committees to have a fair and reasonable sample &mdash; I detest the use of the word &mdash; of volunteer participants.  That will have to be examined in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated, it is not possible to put it in the Bill in a formal ratio basis.  There are 12 specific areas of regard inserted into the Bill and the general view is that one could not refine it down much further by absorbing the point made by the Senator.  I totally share his view that if there is exploitation of persons in the lower socio-economic group to induce them on a financial basis to participate in trials which might in any way injure their health, that is reprehensible and would be totally opposed.  I would not give a cent to any trial going ahead on that basis.  Each trial has to be examined in a particular way.  For example, there are trials specifically for the elderly.  Inevitably one might have 25 pensioners between the ages of 68 and 75 years on a relatively low income.  For such a trial one would only have that cohort of people.  One cannot put that into a Bill. Similarly as frequently happens one may have 40 people who suffer from multiple sclerosis and by virtue of enormous disability their income may be very low. They may be all on DPMA.  After a long analysis in an effort to conduct a trial relative to that condition the persons may agree to undergo the trial.  It is impossible to encompass that within a statutory framework but it is possible to do so in the context of the criteria for ethics committee setting out on that road.  If necessary one can do it by formal regulation. There are hundreds and hundreds of trials in the country, many more than people are aware of and as such the Bill will set a framework.  I certainly share the sentiments of the Senator and wish I <Col N="55" /> could encompass them in the Bill but it is not legally possible at this stage.</P>

    <P>Briefly, this is just another criterion.  I would like to be assured that people bordering on the mentally retarded or who have an extremely low IQ would not and could not be accepted for a trial.  I know every effort is made to explain in great detail in simple English what a trial involves but, nonetheless, in the knowledge that consent is so important in a trial and that it be given freely and <Col N="56" /> openly, there might be some people going through these trials with a very low IQ or bordering on mental retardation.  The Minister may say this is covered in the guidelines but I am simply highlighting the fact that such people should not be included in trials.</P>

      <P>(a) the person so consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent, and</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (3), between lines 11 and 12, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) a reasonable period of time has elapsed between the person being informed of the nature of the trial and his participation in the trial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is in addition to two quite stringent sounding conditions for consent.  It is a suggestion that a period of time should elapse between the person being informed of the nature of the trial and his participation in the trial.  In other words, people should have time to reflect on what they are actually undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Institute of Clinical Pharmacology in their document state &mdash; though evidence <Col N="57" /> would suggest that this is not always followed &mdash; in their paragraph on informed consent:</P>
    <P>A comprehensive verbal explanation of the study is given by the examining physician.  Following this, the volunteer is given a typed study information-consent form to consider at home.</P>
    <P>That is what one of the groups conducting clinical trials at present asserts is done but a fair amount of the evidence supplied to me shows that that is not what they do: that is what they assert is done. Therefore, all I am suggesting in this amendment is that we should make it clear that people who are informed about the nature of a trial ought to feel free to withdraw that consent and, in order to feel free to withdraw that consent, they should be able to take some time.  I did not want to make it too specific and talk about overnight or something like that, but there ought to be a reasonable time period allowed within which people can reflect on the information given to them, can read and think about it and perhaps seek advice from somebody else if they are unhappy about it.  We are not talking about confident, articulate people; we are talking at the very best about a random selection of our society and people ought to be in a position to think about things like that and perhaps discuss it with their spouses or with their families if they are so concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would not be an unreasonable requirement to suggest that a reasonable period of time should elapse between the time people are informed of the nature of the trial and their participation in the trial in order to allow any second thoughts they might have or qualms they might have to surface.  This is not something into which people should be rushed quickly; it is something over which they should have as much control and feel as much control as possible. Therefore, I move the amendment that a reasonable period of time should elapse between the time a person is informed and the time they participate in the trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (5) is quite adequate and perhaps in many ways stronger than the time gap suggested by Senator Ryan.  Section 8 (5) says:</P>
      <P>Any person who has given his consent in accordance with this section may withdraw it at any time and no contractual liability shall be incurred by such person from such withdrawal.</P>
      <P>I would have great difficulty in specifying a reasonable period of time.  I can sense and understand what Senator Ryan is proposing, that from the time of signing a consent there should be a gap of some period before the trial would commence. I can see the point the Senator is making but, on the other hand, one does not want to be too &mdash; I cannot get the correct phrase; I suppose in some ways it could be paternalistic.  If the trial is due to commence the following week the person is entirely free to withdraw his consent an hour or even ten minutes after signing the form.  He can withdraw his consent at any time.  If one says that a trial cannot commence for a period of one week or for a period of 20 days and so on, there could be objections from people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, there is the problem that some trials relate to people with particular conditions.  They may have a terminal cancerous condition and it may be a matter of last resort.  Admittedly, it is not a trial; it is clinical treatment, but the person might agree or, in the case of matters relating to fertility where only at specific times would it be possible in relation to women for trials to be undertaken or in areas of pregnancy at specific times, say, in relation to vitamin supplements and so on, one might be imposing a condition on people which would enable the trial to be frustrated to a degree.  That is a difficulty.  If the Senator would care to suggest a reasonable period, I could consider it on Report Stage but at the moment my inclination would be to consider the amendment not to be entirely necessary in view of section 8 (5).  Perhaps the Senator might want to suggest some period and I will be guided by the House but, as of now, I would have some reluctance in setting out the <Col N="59" /> whole thing in such a rigorous fremework that people might say they are not free. Some people would take the trial, for example, during the period of annual leave and they would have to sign a consent prior to that period.  It is a very difficult one and I would be interested in the Senator's further reaction.</P>

      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with Senator Ryan's amendment in that I made the same suggestion on Second Stage.  I also suggested that each participant should be given at least 24 hours to consider the consent form before giving his consent.  Does the Minister intend to prescribe by regulation the format of the consent form and, if so, will he ensure that printed on the consent form will be the condition that the participant may withdraw his consent at any time and that no contractual liability shall be incurred by such person from such withdrawal?  In the section as it is before us here, we are told that every person shall before giving his consent in accordance with this section be made aware of certain matters.  There are four matters of which the participant would be made aware under that section, but there is no obligation to make him aware of the fact that he may at any time withdraw his consent or the consent he has given in accordance with this section.</P>

It was mentioned earlier in the afternoon that the GP of a participant might not <Col N="60" /> always be aware of a participant's involvement in a trial.  If there was some tie-up and if the participant should have sanction or approval from his GP incorporated in the actual consent form, it might be a help in so far as one could further ensure the safety of the participant in that case.</P>

      <P>It is important to remember that exploitation does not presuppose that the exploiter has sat back and decided that he is going to exploit people. Exploitation can happen by accident; it can happen because of the preoccupation of the exploiter with other areas of his or her work.  It is not a question of sitting back and deciding: &ldquo;I am going to find these vulnerable people because they are handy people to get in&rdquo;.  It can happen just as easily by default as it can by any action.  It is still exploitation whether the person knows or feels he or she is being exploited &mdash; taking short cuts with people's health and safety.</P>
      <P>The Minister invited me to nominate a period.  I was going to say a minimum of six hours should elapse so that people would have time to detach themselves from where they got this information and to reflect about it.  Let me say that subsection (5) does not really bear on this. Subsection (5) deals with the right to withdraw his consent at any time.  I am not talking about a person's right to withdraw his consent; I am talking about providing him with an environment in which he can think about the consent free from the particular atmosphere and free from any sense of being under pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never undergone a clinical trial. Having read what I have about the whole business I suspect I never will, but I know people feel pressurised by the environment; they feel pressurised by an excess of documentation; they feel pressurised by all sorts of things and we should leave it to people to decide about these things.  If the Minister is worried about some very specific circumstances where you cannot really specify a time lapse between the consent and the trial &mdash; it is possible to talk about specific extreme circumstances or something like that in <Col N="61" /> the case of the whole area of fertility and the female cycle &mdash; it seems to me far more a matter of a clinic planning its tests properly than having to deal with them in a hurry once the participants become available.</P>
    <P>I suggest a minimum of six hours should elapse between people being informed and their participating in the trial.  I do not mind &mdash; six hours, 12 hours, 24 hours.  I would probaby prefer 24 hours but the people with whom the Minister has had to deal are probably inclined to take a shorter period.  I do not mind but I do think a person who is prepared to take this sort of risk &mdash; and there is a risk involved at various levels &mdash; should be allowed time to reflect.  As I said, the ICP say &mdash; though the evidence at my disposal is in direct contradiction of that &mdash; that the person takes home the written documentation to study it.  The volunteer &mdash; and they make no exception &mdash; is given a consent form to consider at home.  If the ICP tells us that all their volunteers &mdash; and they make no exception &mdash; take home a written consent form to study, I do not see why we should not hold them to their promise and write it into the legislation that what they claim to be the practice becomes their legal obligation and therefore, I suggest, six, 12, 24 hours. I would take any of the three of them but a minimum of six.  Below that, you get involved in trivialities.</P>

      <P>We have had a concerned and interesting discussion on this issue.  I can assure Senators that I will consider the situation on Report Stage.  I have an open mind on the amount of time.  I do not want to give a formal assurance to the House that I will put in an amendment because in relation to trial arrangements, I do not want to &mdash; so to speak &mdash; legally put my foot in it at this stage, but I can see considerable merit in the arguments.  Senator Ryan has said six hours, maybe 24 hours, and it might well be that on consultation, we may be advised to go further.  I will consult Senators on an informal basis before Report Stage and I will come back with the views I will obtain.  I appreciate the <Col N="62" /> point made.

I would be interested in the Minister's views on amendments Nos. 36, 43 and 44.  Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 relate particularly to the giving of consent by a person other than the person undergoing the trial. If I had looked at them in time or had the ruling in time, perhaps I would have quibbled with it, because they relate to something quite different which is somebody giving permission for a trial to be conducted on a third party.</P>

      <P>I realise that, a Chathaoirligh, and you have been extremely helpful in this whole debate which is extremely important although that does not make it any less complicated. If I can say on No. 36 it is simply an attempt by myself to make it perfectly clear that the final accountability for ensuring that people consent freely rests with the person who conducts the trial. That is all it is about.  It simply says that the person conducting the clinical trial shall satisfy himself that the person consenting to participate in a clinical trial is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent and, where any doubt arises, the person shall not be allowed to participate in a clinical trial.  Simply, I am suggesting that in all cases where there is a doubt about the capacity of the individual to freely consent the benefit of the doubt should be in <Col N="63" /> the negative and the person should not be allowed to participate in the trial.  As regards amendments Nos. 43 and 44, I must beg your indulgence, because it is very difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can see the point made by the Senator regarding amendment No. 36 but I think there is a danger that we may, so to speak, gild the lily so <Col N="64" /> much that the Bill could run into difficulties. As I have already indicated in relation to the sentiment expressed, I do not consider it necessary because, again, section 8, is quite specific and states that the consent shall not be valid unless the person giving it is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent.  I think, by and large, that satisfies the rigours we demand of the Bill itself.  Indeed, I will leave it at that because I think that the Senator is not anxious to discuss amendment No. 43 at this stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 36 not moved.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 37:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Every person shall, before giving his consent under this section, fully disclose all drugs and medication <Col N="65" /> taken by him within the previous six months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many people want to get in on trials for obvious reasons of which we are all aware &mdash; financial gain.  That being so, it is imperative from their own point of view that they disclose at all times that they have been on medication or that they have been on drugs in the preceding six months.  This would be a welcome development if it could be implemented. It would be important for the people carrying out the trial and more important for the people participating in it as it will have obvious effects for them if the full facts are not disclosed.  This awareness should be there and the participants should be asked specific questions regarding medication and drugs which they may have taken over the previous six months.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 40 it is important that participants advise when and where they have had their last trial. Senator Ryan referred to a case of a person having 12 trials in six months.  This is wrong.  Anything we can do in the Bill to alleviate or to amend that should be done.</P>
    <P>I recall coming from Athlone to Dublin one morning 12 months ago.  I gave a lift to a young gentleman I did not know.  He explained to me that he had come off a trial in Elan Chemical Centre and he was on his way to a trial in ICP in Dublin.  I do not know if ICP would be able to pick up the fact that he had just come off a trial in Athlone, whether they would ask this question; I would like to think they would.  This young man was saving hard to buy a car and he wanted as much money as he could get and as a result he was going from one place to another on these trials.  This is wrong and it has to be stopped.  It has happened in cases that I am aware of; I cannot say how widespread it is.  Every effort should be made to ensure that there is a significant period of time before participants go from one trial to another.  I do not know what the appropriate medical period should be. There should be a three to four months interval between one trial and another. Every effort should be made to ensure <Col N="66" /> that those two amendments are implemented.  They are for the benefit of the participants and this is what the Bill is all about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It gives me particular pleasure to introduce this Bill, though there is a slight note of scepticism given the way the Department of Social Welfare chose in their recent press release to ignore a Supreme Court judgment about fuel allowances.  I am not so sure whether they feel entirely bound by the provisions of the law or not.  Nevertheless we will carry on and assume that the law does apply to the Department of Social Welfare the same as it applies everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced this Bill in the Seanad because of the enormous number of representations made to me and a considerable number of letters I received from a large number of very concerned groups and organisations.  The objective of the Bill is to reform, reorganise and fundamentally improve the system of social welfare appeals.  This Bill affects 37 per cent of the population, the one-third of the country that is dependent on <Col N="69" /> social welfare as a source of living.  How that one-third, or over a million people, are treated by that social welfare system is, therefore, a matter of considerable importance.  The Bill focuses on one area: how a claimant is treated if he or she is refused a claim.</P>
    <P>The Bill focuses on the mechanism for the redress of grievances or, as it is properly called, the appeals system.  The existing system of appeals is deficient and in many respects it is seriously inadequate. Therefore I have introduced this Bill in the hope of stimulating a response, stimulating consideration of the issue and perhaps increasing the priority given to this issue within the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The present appeals system was laid down in the 1952 Social Welfare Act, sections 43 and 44 of which state that a person dissatisfied with a decision may appeal to an appeals officer.  The appeals officer will make a final and conclusive decision subject to revision by a chief appeals officer if an earlier decision was erroneous by reason of the law or facts. An appeals officer may require a person to give evidence and award expenses. Subsequent regulations were laid down under the Social Welfare Insurance Appeals Regulations 1952, that is, statutory instrument 376/52 and the Social Welfare Assistance Decisions and Appeals Regulations, 1953.  These regulations provided for a 21-day time limit on appeals and appeal hearings.  An appeals officer is empowered to dismiss the case summarily.  Provision was also made for assessors, one employer, one trade union officer to attend employment assistance or benefit appeals.  The 1952 Act was subsequently integrated into the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Numerous problems have arisen since this scheme was first introduced.  I was extremely disappointed that the previous Minister for Social Welfare asserted early in this session that he was not aware of any serious problems in this area.  The best documented case on the widespread nature of the concerns in this issue was in the report of the Coolock Law Centre produced in December 1980 called quite <Col N="70" /> simply, <i>Social Welfare Appeals, Special Report No. 2</i>.  The type of problems highlighted were as follows.  In the first case, information given for the refusal of a claim was paltry.  Cases were documented of people suddenly getting a disqualification notice.  The form simply states, &ldquo;Benefit is not payable on the grounds that you are not available for work.&rdquo;  A case was documented of a woman refused assistance on this basis. She was not told the facts that had led to this decision; she was not told she could bring someone else to the appeals hearing; she was not told the appeals officer had the power to award costs or expenses, important had she wished to have a solicitor. She was not given the opportunity to question the deciding officer; she was invited to sign away her right to have two assessors present at the appeal, without the role of an assessor being explained to her.</P>
    <P>Secondly, clear evidence emerged of decisions being taken without due regard to the facts being ascertained.  Cases were documented of people refused disability benefit, but of claimants being at a severe disadvantage at their hearings.  One woman faced a fitness for work hearing without knowing the evidence arguing that she was fit for work, without her doctor being directly consulted before the ruling was made.  Decisions were taken by officers without medical expertise and without independent medical opinion being sought.</P>
    <P>These are not exceptional or unusual cases.  These cases fit a pattern, not a pattern of wilful oppression but certainly one of neglect, of lack of care for principles of basic justice.  It is a system loaded against the claimant from start to finish.  It is very hard to argue a case when you are given only cursory information as to why you were refused a claim, no facts for the refusal and only a minimum of information about the nature of the appeals process.  That is the social welfare appeals system.</P>
    <P>The appeals system for supplementary welfare introduced in 1977 is even more basic.  An appellant is simply told he or she has the right to appeal and must hand <Col N="71" /> in his or her reasons to the community welfare officer.  Again he or she is not told the reasons for refusal.  One person whose case was documented was simply told it was not &ldquo;policy&rdquo; to pay towards fuel costs, a legitimate claim under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  How he was expected to formulate a response to this argument mystifies me.  If you are told it is not policy, how are you supposed to produce an argument against that fact?  It is quite a mystery.  His appeal in writing &mdash; for there is no right to a hearing on supplementary welfare &mdash; would then wind its way to the welfare officer's superior, who would then decide.  The duration of SWA appeal is three months.</P>
    <P>The speed of an appeal is an extremely important issue.  Cases have been documented of social welfare incomes being cut off so that a person could be investigated. It is denied that this happens. From time to time one does receive cases where people get a notice stating that because of this or that their allowance is being cut off and the allegation is being investigated.  In one case a person so cut off was told he could appeal if dissatisfied. I refer to the Dáil Official Report of 8 May 1985.  For a person's basic income obviously such a suspension can be catastrophic and it cannot be justified.  The consequential potential long wait for an appeal can be devastating.  It really only involves transferring people from one area of State expenditure to another.  If they have no income under social welfare and they have no other income, they go to supplementary welfare and the State ends up paying the money anyway and it becomes a quite meaningless operation.</P>
    <P>Just as the information made available to claimants before a hearing is inadequate, so too is the information made available afterwards.  Again, according to the Coolock Law Centre report of 1980:</P>
    <P>The appellant received only a memorandum of the appeals officer's decision, and he is not permitted to see the actual decision...</P>
    <P>This memorandum amounts to a bare <Col N="72" /> statement of rejection or allowances of the appeal and nothing more.</P>
    <P>The miniscule information that is supplied to appellants is so tiny as to be offensive.</P>
    <P>Robert W. Clarke, in his major study of the social welfare appeals system in &ldquo;Social Welfare Insurance Appeals&rdquo;, <i>Irish Jurist</i>, vol. XIII, 1978, pages 280-282 points out that the reasons are given on a standard form with what he describes in dry legal language as a &ldquo;rather cryptic list of alternative reasons... those reasons that are inapplicable are deleted&rdquo;.  Clark argues that this procedure is simply not adequate, either legally or on grounds of natural justice.  He pointed to Flick's study of administrative adjudication which argued that reasons had to be provided in detail.  A reasoned opinion, presented in detail, was likely to be better thought out.  The reasons given would also help the appellant to determine if he had grounds for an ultimate court appeal on a point of law.  Reasoning would make appeals more amenable to the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts. Reasoned appeals would encourage public confidence in the appeals process and prevent arbitrary conduct.</P>
    <P>Proposals that the system of social welfare appeals be reformed have, I am perfectly certain at this stage, wide support. On 22 September this year, four voluntary organisations, the Free Legal Aid Centres, the Independent Poverty Action Movement, the Simon Community and the Coolock Law Society all proposed a series of administrative reforms in the appeals system.  The Free Legal Aid Centres in particular drew attention to the fact that the system of State legal aid did not cover social welfare appeals, thus reducing further the claimant's belief in his or her ability to successfully pursue and appeal.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, Government responses to requests to re-examine the appeals system have been slow.  I have already adverted to the view of the previous Minister for Social Welfare in this matter. The issues raised by the <i>Irish Jurist</i> and by the Coolock Law Centre did not lead <Col N="73" /> to a reasoned departmental or ministerial response.  One of the great frustrations the people in the Coolock Law Centre encountered was the fact that not only did they get no action but they found it extremely difficult to get any sort of a reasoned response to their complaint.</P>
    <P>On 24 August, 1981, Walter Walsh, editor of <i>FLAC FILE</i>, in an article entitled &ldquo;Fighting an Invisible Opponent&rdquo;, which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> argued:</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals machinery is presently incapable of meeting the needs of the most powerless members of society.  There is a strong case for the abolition of the present structure and its replacement by a body similar to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Walter Walsh was critical of a number of other aspects of the appeals system.  Its independence, he said, was undermined by close departmental ties.  Hearings took place on departmental premises.  The hearings were run by officers who were, in effect, departmental officials.  I want to emphasise that the integrity of the officials involved is not an issue.  I have never heard a suggestion that there was anything other than an attempt to operate scrupulously within the officer's understanding of the job he or she had to do.  There is no suggestion of any malpractice or misbehaviour by the officers. I am talking about a perception of how the system operates.</P>
    <P>Because of the non-attendance of deciding officers, appeals officers had to take over their departmental files in order to air both sides of the case.  As a result Walsh said &ldquo;a claimant cannot be blamed for confusing the hearing with a higher stage of administrative review rather than a truly fresh and independent look at this case&rdquo;.  That is true, irrespective of the commitment of the officials involved to do their best, to be independent and detached.  This is not intended to be an attack on the officials.  I have been known to be critical of officials but in this case this is not the issue.</P>
    <P>Clark described the social welfare appeals system as little more than an <Col N="74" /> additional level of administrative review &mdash; this because of the process, not because of the individual's activities involved.  In clinical, legal, precise terms Clark is exactly right.  He argued that social assistance schemes, with their historic roots in poor relief and charity &mdash; unlike social benefit schemes from 1911 on which were purchased &mdash; never considered they were conferring any rights on claimants in the first place.  There was no provision for appeals in the 1939 Public Assistance Act.  Hopefully, times have moved on since then.  The 1975 Supplementary Welfare Allowance Act laid down the basic principle of a right to a minimum income.  Now, 11 years later, it is time to lay down the principle of legal rights to appeal if that minimum income is denied.  A right to an income must be balanced by a right to redress of grievance if that income is not provided.</P>
    <P>It has to be emphasised that at present there is no right to an oral hearing under the social welfare appeals system.  This is quite contentious and is something on which there are a number of views.  But there is no right, under present legislation, to an oral hearing.  In 1976 Walsh estimated that 45 per cent of cases were being decided without any oral hearing. Clark reported in 1978 that disability benefit appeals tended to be dismissed summarily. It is worth quoting from the Department's own information leaflet on appeals, SW 56, which states:</P>
    <P>If an appeals officer feels an oral hearing is necessary, a place and date are set as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Imagine if we had a provision that if a judge felt a court hearing was necessary he would have a court hearing, but otherwise he would decide without hearing the evidence of the people involved.</P>
    <P>Subsequently it emerged from the Commission on Social Welfare Report, 1986, that up to 60 per cent of appeals were dismissed summarily &mdash; the information contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare is the most up-to-date information I have at my disposal: I could usefully spend another <Col N="75" /> week discussing the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that some appellants may not have been statutorily entitled to their claims and one would expect therefore that some appeals would be refused. It may well be true, as the Minister's predecessor told the Dáil, that when a person seeks an oral hearing he is never refused &mdash; Dáil Official Report, 7 December, 1983, column 1354.  Nevertheless, I cannot believe that justice is invariably done if 60 per cent of all case are summarily dismissed.  If 20,000 appeals take place each year that means 12,000 summary dismissals.  Not only is the claimant not given the benefit of the doubt but the claimant's doubts are not even given the chance to be presented. That is not in accordance with the system of administrative review in our neighbouring country, upon which our social welfare system is modelled, where the Franks Committee Report, 1957, laid down that administrative reviews should be characterised by openness, fairness and impartiality.  Summary dismissals have none of these characteristics, not because the officials involved behave wrongly but because of the nature of the process.</P>
    <P>The importance of a right to appeal is fundamental if one looks at reversal rates of appeals.  In 1978, according to the Dáil Official Report of 20 February 1979, column 1574, reversal rates were 36 per cent.  It varied from one scheme to another, for example 39 per cent on unemployment benefit, 46 per cent on unemployment assistance and 23 per cent on disability benefit according to the Coolock report, 1981.</P>
    <P>Clark concluded:</P>
    <P>These reversal rates indicate that the quality of first instance decision-making is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Summary dismissal of cases is clearly an unacceptable form of treatment of claimants. It is worth remembering and there is ample evidence of this &mdash; that social welfare claimants, being poor, being <Col N="76" /> those with the least education, articulateness, familiarity with bureaucratic procedures or assertiveness, are those least likely to appeal in the first place. Conversely, when such a person organises an appeal &mdash; many will be sceptical about the value of so doing &mdash; it is a very major statement of doubt as to fair treatment.</P>
    <P>For those in authority to justify dismissing cases summarily on the basis of appeals being frivolous, stupid, vexacious or based on wrong information &mdash; and I have heard all these arguments &mdash; is of doubtful validity in even a small number of cases.  But when it happens in 60 per cent of cases that appeals are dismissed summarily, miscarriage of justice on a truly giant scale may be taking place.  It is extremely important to understand that people who are the dependants of the social welfare system do tend to be less articulate, less assertive, less well-educated and all the other characteristics, and they do not lightly undertake what threatens to be an intimidating process of appeal.  Therefore, it seems to me that to suggest that 60 per cent of appeals can be dismissed summarily is to completely understate the need of the person who makes the appeal.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister does not agree with this contention, or my contention that there is an intrinsic right to a hearing, there is still a need to bring the law into line with the Supreme Court judgment of 16 February 1977.  In the case of Kiely <i>versus</i> the Minister for Social Welfare decision of Henchy, Parke and Griffin, Justices (<i>Irish Reports</i> 267, 275), Mr. Justice Henchy ruled that an oral hearing must be held if there is any conflict of evidence.  The British National Insurance Commissioner, Sir Robert Twaite, in 1976 strongly objected to the idea of selection of some appeals for hearing and others not, on the basis that difficulty and complexity are not always evident and sometimes emerge at the hearing for the very first time.  It is a presumption of insight and a presumption of knowledge and understanding to presume that everything that may emerge in an appeal can <Col N="77" /> be spotted from the documentation in that appeal.</P>
    <P>As far as the procedure of hearings goes, the Department of Social Welfare now provide that appellants may be represented by a doctor of solicitor for whom an appropriate fee may be paid.  Appellants may now make opening and closing statements, call witnesses and cross-examine. Obviously this represents a considerable improvement and development of the original appeals procedure of the early fifties.  Nevertheless it remains the case that many appellants are inadequately informed of these procedures. Very few appellants are, in any event, legally represented.  This is an important issue because the only comparative study available from Britain shows that the reversal rates for unrepresented claimants were 16 per cent, but for represented claimants from 39 per cent to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that when claimants actually had representation they had a two to two-and-a-half times as good chance of having the appeal upheld than if they went unrepresented.  It indicates the whole fragility of the process of appeal that the absence or presence of legal representatives can make such a profound difference to the degree or the possibility of success of the appeal.  Secondly, it is worth adding that several schemes of social assistance either have a different or an even more limited procedure, for example supplementary welfare, or none at all in the case of DPMA.</P>
    <P>It has been argued from time to time that assessors fulfil the role of guardians of independence for the appeals system. This is neither the case in practice nor in law.  Assessors are given little notice of cases.  Having been on a panel of assessors I can enthusiastically elaborate on that if anybody wishes.  It can be often a half day or a day's notice when you are invited to sit on a panel of assessors.  I gather it has improved somewhat but at least in Cork these occasional requests appeared out of the blue without any prior notice.</P>
    <P>To the average assessor, particularly on the trade union side where I was, a day's notice to organise getting away <Col N="78" /> from work was far from adequate.  As well as the shortage of notice, the assessors are not given the social welfare file or the deciding officer's comments and decisions are made in their absence. Secondly, their role is one of being allowed to speak only when spoken to. The Supreme Court, in ruling on the role of medical assessor under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, made it clear that assessors are not to take an active part in proceedings.  The Court ruled they were to be only a &ldquo;medical dictionary available for consultation&rdquo;, in the words of Mr. Justice Henchy.  They were not to cross-examine, prompt questions, or submit opinions on the merits of an appeal.  Having looked at and heard about and wondered about the whole role of assessors, I think the least that can be said is that they serve little purpose in continuing in their present role.  They should either be abolished or made a full and equal partner in the appeals process.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the appeals system appears to remain a largely maleoriented one.  I mention this because of the special interest of the present Minister for Social Welfare on the issue and I am sorry she is not here.  Until 1983 there were no female appeals officers and I do not know if any have been appointed since.  This is a very serious matter.  It is not just a matter of balance of the sexes. It is important first, because of the greater number of female social welfare recipients in recent years and secondly because of the greater number of female social welfare recipients who tend to be involved in the appeals process.  There is evidence of a higher degree of refusal of social welfare, particularly to married women, on the grounds of non-availability for work.</P>
    <P>It is men who are taking the appeals decisions over such matters as women's availability for work and unmarried mothers' and deserted wives' claims.  It is a classic case of men deciding how men's laws should affect women.  I hope the present Minister will at least endeavour at that very limited level to redress that imbalance.</P>
    <P>That fairly comprehensively covers the <Col N="79" /> huge defects in the present appeals system.  It would be wrong, incidentally, to treat the appeals system simply in the context of the number of appeals each year.  This is part of the procedure of justice available to everybody who is dependent on social welfare.  It therefore affects more people in this country than any other area of legislation.  It is part of the values which underlie the social welfare system.  It is not just a problem for those who appeal; it is a way of saying what we think of the whole of our population who depend on social welfare.  I had to introduce this Bill because successive Governments, despite the submissions of voluntary organisations and the overwhelming legal arguments, failed to reform the system of social welfare appeals.  This Bill is necessary because of the need for reform which I have outlined and also the need to recognise what I believe to be compelling legal judgments entered since 1952.</P>
    <P>The Bill remedies the defects in the existing system which I have described. In doing so, it builds on existing law.  In particular, it draws on the experience and structures of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and on the social welfare tribunals established in 1982.  These social welfare tribunals have had limited testing under procedures related to payments to workers locked out in an industrial dispute. When it was introduced in the Seanad the Minister specifically told this House in relation to that particular social welfare tribunal system that it was uppermost in his mind to introduce a method of adjudication that was &ldquo;fair and independent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The system of tribunals introduced under my Bill is similar to that in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1982.  This Act has not produced any major difficulties or problems &mdash; quite the opposite in fact.  To be logical, anybody arguing against my Bill must also explain away the need for the 1982 appeals tribunal legislation which applied the principle that I suggest in my Bill to one limited area.  Otherwise you are saying there are two different kinds of social welfare <Col N="80" /> recipients, those who are entitled to a proper hearing and those who are not.  I do not think in that context that we have many takers for the idea that we should abolish the whole system.</P>
    <P>As I said, my Bill builds on existing legislation and adapts and amends what is there.  To that extent it is a conservative piece of legislation.  There is a minimum amount of repeal of existing law.  My Bill is constructed on well-documented evidence and on detailed legal arguments. It extends the position of welfare claimants from one of limited access to limited administrative review to the rights inherent in citizenship in this country.</P>
    <P>The need for an independent welfare appeals system was discussed in detail by the Commission on Social Welfare.  This Bill provides the Minister with a real opportunity to begin to implement a significant component of the commission's report.  None of the allegedly overwhelming arguments about the cost of some areas of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare applies in the least in this area.  This is not a high cost undertaking.  The cost attached to this element of the commission's report is quite low.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised for postponing decisions in the commission's report that would cost money.  A reform of the system of social welfare appeals would provide real and tangible benefits to all claimants, extend rights, enhance citizenship and lead to a sense of justice in an administrative system.  It would do so at little financial cost to the State and for substantial administrative gain.</P>
    <P>What I detailed earlier in what I had to say, overwhelmingly states the case for reform in terms of the right of the claimant, of the perception of the claimant, of the status of the claimant, the right to know what is going on, the right to an independent hearing, the right to participate properly in that hearing and the right to be informed in detail about the decision taken on something as vital as a person's income.  The only objection is that it will involve some small extra cost. <Col N="81" /> But the small extra cost involved in setting up an independent process of social welfare appeals, covering the whole spectrum of social welfare, has to be balanced against how we deal with the people who are at the margin in social welfare and whose income depends on the decisions of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>How we deal with those people is a measure of our attitude to people on social welfare.  Are they treated as small units conveniently disposed of by an administratively convenient system, or are they dealt with as people with all the need to have their dignity respected that the rest of us take for granted?  None of us would be happy if major decisions about our lives were to be taken with that amount of limited information, with that amount of limited access to the evidence against us and with that amount of limited information why a decision was taken. We would not tolerate it.  We should not tolerate it for people who are far less well off than ourselves and, therefore, I happily ask the House to give the Bill a second reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I compliment Senator Brendan Ryan on introducing this Bill and on the way in which he has presented it.  It is obvious that he has put a lot of thought into examining how the social welfare system operates. He has drawn attention to certain aspects of the system that cause a certain amount of unease and which could be interpreted as being unjust to certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan also drew attention to the fact that some decisions are made in an arbitrary manner and that the people who are ruled out do not understand the reason.  In many cases those people are not given an opportunity to state their case.  No allowance is made for the fact that many people are not articulate enough to be able to present their case in a way that would do justice to themselves. Members of the Oireachtas and the general public should be fully aware of what the social welfare system costs, the number of people it serves and the improvements made in later years.  A high percentage of our people are in <Col N="82" /> receipt of social welfare payments.  The total number receiving social welfare payments each week is about 1.3 million of the population.  The system affects a big section of our population and it should be looked into.  Everything possible should be done to see that it is 100 per cent efficient and is seen to be efficient.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer and people in general will have to be told that this year the Government have to find £2.5 billion to finance the social welfare services, which is £7 million a day.  That is 27½ per cent of total gross current expenditure.  At every opportunity the whole system should be examined.  Members of this House have experience of meeting social welfare recipients in their clinics and realise the difficulties some of these people experience, their inability in some cases to understand why they were turned down, the inability in the case of deserted wives to understand the long delay that must occur before payments can be made.  These points were mentioned in the House before and are of concern to a great many people.</P>
    <P>There has been a phenomenal growth in expenditure under this heading during the past ten to 15 years.  The growth has been so great that there is an element in the country who believe we have gone too far.  This is not a view I share, but people hold the view that we are spending an inordinate amount of money on social welfare.  Those people must be made to understand the needs of the recipients. They must also be reassured that the system is so efficient and so impartial that the taxpayer is getting good value for his money.  They must also understand that payments made by way of taxation are not misplaced.</P>
    <P>The total staff employed in the Department of Social Welfare is in the order of 3,783.  We have to be very sure that people in the Department of Social Welfare are working efficiently.  If we think in terms of adding to the staff in order to give a better service, we are taking more money out of the fund and consequently less will be available for people who are in need.</P>
    <P>Changes have occurred in the social <Col N="83" /> welfare system.  In relation to unemployment assistance up to a few years ago the criterion used by the inspectors was the poor law valuation.  That was ruled out by the Supreme Court some years ago and a new system was introduced which is much more difficult to operate. The new system of calculating whether a person is entitled to unemployment assistance is based on an assessment system which is very difficult for the inspectors.  Standards which apply in one county or in one area of a county need not apply in another county where the land is of a poorer quality and where a greater amount of fertiliser must be used, where more animal feed has to be bought for animals in the winter months.  All of these are facts that change substantially from one county to another and indeed from one area to another in the same county.</P>
    <P>A few years ago when Deputy Donnellan was in that Department a guideline was drawn up to enable people to assess what allowances should be made to calculate their net income.  That was a help to the applicant and to local representatives who were trying to help but still is a big problem.  We have about 20,000 appeals per annum.  In trying to calculate the amount of time that takes up in a Department, if each appeal took only half an hour of an official's time which is a ridiculously short period, that would amount to a total of 10,000 hours in the year.  If we take the travelling time of people going to centres in the provinces to adjudicate in some of these cases and if we take the time of typists and others it would probably work out at far more than half an hour per person.  It might average out at about an hour per case which would be a staggering total of 20,000 hours but that has to be done in order to ensure that as far as possible the Department are impartial and fair within the system.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has drawn attention to specific cases of claims being turned down.  He is not satisfied with the way it is done.  In all honesty I have to say I am not satisfied with it and I am quite certain <Col N="84" /> no Member of the House is satisfied either with the way it is done.  However, it would be fair to say that as a general rule the inspectors are impartial and they do the job as honourably and as well as they can within the limits of their guidelines, but because of the set up and the number of cases involved applicants are not allowed to be represented by a solicitor, a doctor or indeed by a more articulate neighbour or local representative. Very often it happens that the person concerned is not able to put over a convincing case.  Dissatisfaction arises when a neighbour who is more articulate and better able to put his case is awarded a social welfare payment although in the eyes of the person who is refused their circumstances are the same. That leads to dissatisfaction and constant complaints.  It is true to say that no other aspect of a public representative's life takes up as much time as dealing with social welfare claims and explaining to people how they were ruled out.  That does not always satisfy these people.</P>
    <P>A commission which was set up some time ago looked into this question and there are a number of recommendations here.  They tally to a very large degree with the recommendations made by Senator Brendan Ryan.  The commission in their report identified a number of defects in the present appeals system which are briefly as follows: no statutory obligation on the part of the Department to inform a claimant of his or her right to appeal; inadequate information provided to claimants on decisions made on their claims and claimants cannot question deciding officers concerning the basis for the decision; no requirement to give reasons for appeals decisions, and information provided on the appeals system in general and the grounds for decision is inadequate; the appellant is not guaranteed an oral hearing and the right to representation at these hearings is not sufficiently publicised; appeals officers should not only be independent from ministerial control but should perceive themselves to be so and to this end should be subject to a different authority from <Col N="85" /> that to which the deciding officer is subject; the system of appeal under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme is unsatisfactory because of the lack of a defined procedure and there is a considerable degree of divergence between the approaches adopted by different health board officers responsible for appeals.</P>
    <P>The commission drew attention to that list of defects and it goes on to make recommendations that by and large correspond with Senator Ryan's recommendations. They are first, an appeals office should be established as a separate executive office with an independent chairman; secondly, information on the reason for the rejection of an appeal should be given to the applicant; thirdly, the appeals office should publish an annual report and include, where appropriate, policy recommendations; and fourthly, the supplementary welfare appeal should be included in a general appeals system because that is the one that causes a lot of trouble because of different standards adopted by different health boards.</P>
    <P>I favour the main objectives in Senator Ryan's Bill for a more independent and fairer appeals system and, above all, one that is seen to be independent and fair by appellants and by members of the public in general.  It is a fundamental principle that not only should justice be done but it should be seen to be done.  Senator Ryan has complimented the social welfare officers on the way they do their business and I join him in the compliment. If there are some decisions that are hard to understand, it is probably because the guidelines issued to these officers are not embracing enough and because sufficient opportunity is not given to people to have their case presented properly.  If they are not able to do it themselves, they should be afforded the facility of taking somebody along who is able to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we are discussing Senator Brendan Ryan's Bill at this point when we have a lot of drama in the other House regarding <Col N="86" /> social welfare.  Indeed, the whole week has been devoted to social welfare in one form or another.  For that reason it is important that we examine this Bill in as great a detail as possible.  I wish to congratulate Senator Ryan who brought forward this Bill.  Indeed, we have been talking about if for a long time and it is time that action was taken.  The Senator has produced a Bill that can be discussed and, I hope, can be implemented.</P>
      <P>Under the present system the case is at first handed over to a deciding officer. We then have a subsequent right of appeal to an appeals officer or, in the case of a point of law, it can be appealed to the High Court.  We are told that the appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive but that can subsequently be revised by a chief appeals officer.  As mentioned by Senator Ryan, it seems to be a cause of concern that 60 per cent of cases are concluded and considered by the appeals officer without any form of an oral hearing.  That ought to be a reason for concern for most people.  The subsequent appeal is something I believe is kept quite secret, the public are not informed enough about it.  I am not aware of the figures but I would venture to suggest that by far the biggest number of appeals are made without family representation, or without a solicitor being with the appellant.  On many occasions, particularly in the case of unemployment benefit, I have gone into the Department with people who were nervous, anxious and concerned about their case.  I did so to give them moral backing and support and indeed to highlight their case.  Many public representatives are doing likewise and very often with a great deal of success because they may be able to present the case in a better way that the nervous or anxious person who is making the appeal. In the case of unemployment benefit there is usually a trade union official or some representative from the employer side involved and that can be very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been criticism of the present system so it is only right that we discuss it and endeavour to correct it.  There is without question dissatisfaction with the <Col N="87" /> system.  There is a need for a separate independent system where, as Senator O'Brien said, justice would be done and be seen to be done.  Something separate from the Department of Social Welfare would obviously be the correct procedure.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to talk about the right of appeal which is basic in any situation.  Much of the appeals system is not forthcoming enough and is causing concern and worry to many people who are in the process of appeal.  The fact that there is no obligation on the Department of Social Welfare to inform an unsuccessful claimant of his right of appeal indicates an element of mistrust.  That mistrust is apparent and people are aware that that exists and the system tends to be weakened as a result.  The right to have representation should be spelt out loud and clear.  A person going on an appeal should be better informed, their rights should be better publicised in any new legislation and leaflets explaining the correct position as regards appeals now and for the future should be available in every social welfare office.  The whole system should be changed, adopted and moved into a simple speedy operation. There is no reason this could not be done given the will and the importance of this subject.  This unfortunate problem is increasing daily.  More and more people are going on unemployment benefit. They are out seeking jobs to protect their unemployment benefit because they know if they are not seeking employment their benefit can be stopped at any time.</P>
    <P>I am dealing at present with the case of a woman who has been unsuccessful in her appeal and yet I know that the women in question worked with a clothing company and has tried hard to get work.  Obviously she has tried in the rag trade area where there is work for which she is best suited but she has also tried for work in pubs and offices and for cleaning work and has failed.  Genuine efforts to find work should be recognised.  That woman's attitude to me was, &ldquo;I am meeting the people who are knocking me off; they are the people who are employed by <Col N="88" /> the Department of Social Welfare but I think I could make a better case if I were dealing with people who were separate and independent from the Department of Social Welfare&rdquo;.  Senator Brendan Ryan, in the Bill before us, is endeavouring to tackle that problem in a very positive way.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for an independent appeals system.  As we all know, the Social Welfare Tribunal of 1982 which adjudicated on the refusal of benefit in the case of trade disputes has been very successful and there has been no outcry against it.  That in itself must be proof positive that some system, other than what we have, must come.  The appeals system must be distanced from the Department of Social Welfare.  An independent office or Tribunal, separate and away from the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare with an independent chairman, with its own staff, arranging for the various hearings and advising people on their rights and in what manner they should put forward their claims, is necessary and overdue.  If we had more time to deal with the Bill we would have other ideas but I hope the Bill will proceed through the normal Stages of any Bill in this House.  On Committee and Report Stages we will have more opportunity to highlight the importance of this Bill and what it means to people who find themselves in the position which is all too obvious at present. Again I congratulate Senator Brendan Ryan and also anyone who supported him in bringing forward the Bill which is overdue.  I share in the principle behind the Bill.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party Members of the House I commend Senator Ryan for introducing this Private Members' Bill.  Senator Ryan will probably realise that it is easier to do this in a private capacity than in a political situation which is directly associated with a Government.  In this area one realises the difficulties that have arisen already in the whole area of social welfare and even in terms of the equality measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Senator Ryan on the way <Col N="89" /> he has set out this reasonable Bill.  We can discuss it section by section and I hope the House will allocate time, when it has dealt with some of the Government business which needs to be dealt with urgently, to try to get it passed through the House.  I hope it will not be entirely dependent on Private Members' Time.  I do not know what would happen to it in another place.</P>
    <P>All public representatives are aware of the problems in their constituencies which Senator Ryan has identified.  All of us, including the Minister of State present &mdash; the Minister and, indeed, her predecessor &mdash; collectively have been inundated with problems in this area.  It is refreshing to have suddenly in front of us an opportunity to address the problem as we see it on the ground and see in what legislative way we can overcome the problems people perceive when the decision is against them.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Desmond, did a great deal of work in consolidating the Social Welfare Acts. This was a very useful process and addressed in some way the highly complicated areas of social welfare in the contributory stage, the non-contributory stage, the health section, the employment section, health board payments, supplementary welfare, DPMA and so on.  It is so complex and widespread that I am not surprised the figures Senator Andy O'Brien mentioned are being used by the Government to sustain this whole area of assistance to so many people in these difficult times of scarce employment and, for many people, ill health.  They have to contend with legislation which is quite difficult for them to understand on the ground, and they need assistance.  That is why they come to politicians' clinics on a regular basis, or go to social service clinics to ensure that they get their rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan feels, and rightly so, that the appeals decision making process should be removed to what could be considered a neutral non-biased and impartial body and he suggests an appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>When the Minister replies to this debate next week she will outline whether <Col N="90" /> she feels an appeals tribunal is the appropriate format.  Let us accept for a moment &mdash; I cannot see anything wrong with it &mdash; that we have an appeals tribunal system where people could be represented and have their case properly heard.  Let us compare that with the existing system and the pensions committee system which we abolished about two years ago.</P>
    <P>I sat on pensions committees on many an occasion and was one of the people who advocated that they should be abolished because they were a travesty of justice.  People came before the committees and had to bare their souls and identify their total assets, minute though they might be.  There was absolutely no privacy whatsoever.  Once an appeal was lodged it automatically came before a pensions committee which had no statutory function and no statutory input apart from asking questions of the applicant and asking for the pensions officer's decision.  The pensions officer's decision usually stood because we never had any grounds on which we could properly argue a case.  We were not made aware of it by the applicant except in exceptional circumstances and we were just given a brief from the Department on why their decision was made.</P>
    <P>This is a good concept but there are many complications on the ground.  Let us look at the area of social welfare appeals.  Disability benefit is paid to people who are sick and unable to work and who have sufficient contributions to qualify for PRSI for an extended period, According to the Act, I am told, a doctor's opinion is capable of discontinuing the benefit.  Generally speaking, the facilities available to the doctors are unsatisfactory.  In my own constituency they lack privacy and this makes disability benefit appeals a most humiliating procedure for people appealing against decisions.  I contend that there are no facilities, especially medical facilities, available to the medical referees or inspectors to enable them to make a valid decision on an appeal.  I agree that we could have an appeals tribunal, but proper facilities should be available in every constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> In most towns there are hospital facilities, with X-ray facilities and suitable examination rooms, in which a person could be properly examined.  There is no point in basing a decision on somebody who is extremely ill with a lung disease on testing his pulse.  When we try to produce evidence like this the medical inspector says: &ldquo;I am not interested&rdquo;.  They said this to people I sent in for examination. The medical inspector says he does not want to see the evidence.  He checks the patient's blood test, and asks a few questions: &ldquo;What time do you get up in the morning?  Are you married?  What age are you?&rdquo;&mdash;and another decision is made. It is quite difficult to get changes in medical decisions.  We have to prove the most extraordinary things and produce extraordinary documentation, X-rays, medical certificates, medical opinions, orthopaedic surgeons opinions, a whole string of stuff, and it could still get ignored because the medical inspector is still entitled to give his opinion.</P>
    <P>I was forced to go to the Ombudsman who was successful, but he had to bring in an outside opinion which the Department accepted.  The outside opinion confirmed the original decisions and the medical evidence we had but it was a cumbersome procedure.  In one case it went on for about two and a half years.  I do not think it is a good system that people should have to go to that extreme to prove they are medically incapable of working.  If that is the system we want to change in this legislation, it is time we changed it.  In medical disability claims proper facilities should be available to the Department. They should have access to hospitals. There should be a link between the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare in this area to make sure people are properly and thoroughly examined in relation to an appeal.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that nobody on this side of the House, or the other side of the House advocates that people should get benefits to which they are not entitled.  This puts the responsibility on certifying doctors in particular. That is the key area.  If there is a genuine <Col N="92" /> case all the medical evidence from hospitals and so on should be taken into account by the Department.  Having examined all the information a medical referee should not be afraid to give an opinion, contrary to that of his colleague who had already disqualified the person. That is my attitude to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to unemployment benefit if they are in credit, have not walked out of a job and have not been disqualified for some reason.  If they have PRSI contributions they are entitled to unemployment benefit.  They have to prove their availability for work and be genuinely seeking work and have credited contributions.  They are disqualified if they are found to be working and nobody here will disagree with that.  This puts a major responsibility on employers not to employ as cheap labour people who are signing on as being unemployed.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is means-tested and the person's ability to work is investigated, his availability for work, the fact that he is seeking work.  He has to produce all sorts of evidence that he is seeking work.  In addition he is means tested, his relatives are means tested and the house he is living in is taken into consideration.  The son of a doctor, a garda or a professional person applying for unemployment assistance &mdash; who never worked after leaving school because he could not get a job&mdash;is means tested.  The same means test is applied to the son of a recipient of social welfare. Parents of an applicant for assistance who are pensioners were means tested.  We have built into the system the ability to consider some of the income of other people in the household.</P>
    <P>People must have the right to go in and state their case.  It can be presumed that they have incomes but there could be all sorts of outgoings of which the investigating officer might be unaware.  There should be some procedure whereby people could state their case.  The fact that a person is living in his parents' house does not give him any legal right to sustenance particularly if he is over the age of majority and is signing on for unemployment assistance.  We need a system <Col N="93" /> whereby people can appeal against those decisions.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the area of non-contributory pensions.  The Minister for Finance Deputy J. Bruton, made a statement about the major payment made in this regard and the deficits in the amount of money coming in.  People can transfer their property legally to somebody else and then apply and qualify for a non-contributory pension.  In that process there is a period between the time they divest themselves of their property and apply &mdash; I am not sure whether it is 12 months.  People transfer large tracts of land and large amounts of money to other people to qualify.  There are exceptions to this.  There are poor people who have very little at the end of the day having worked hard all their lives.  I would like to see them getting something.</P>
    <P>There is a gap between the Department's income and outgoings.  We have a system of computing which very few people understand.  A percentage of the first figure is written off; then there is a fraction of what is left; then there are two other fractions.  It is difficult to understand it.  When people get decisions stating that their pension was disallowed on the basis that their means exceeded so and so, it is hard to work out how their means were arrived at.  These are some of the anomalies in this area.  A full explanation of how it is done would be of benefit to those of us who represent applicants and to the applicants themselves. In answer to criticism I must state that in some cases which I have seen the reasons were given on the notices.  Their means exceeded the limit or the person was not genuinely seeking employment.  This latter reason is quite difficult to prove because anyone who can be proved not to be seeking employment in this day and age is sailing close to the wind.  As far as I am concerned everybody is seeking employment.  If you can produce documentary evidence from four or five prospective employers it should be sufficient to prove that there is a genuine commitment to a search for employment.</P>
    <P>Means testing is where public representatives have most difficulty in <Col N="94" /> explaining the process.  People have an idea that they can have large amounts of money in bank accounts and in investments which give them an unearned income.  The feel this is not an income because that money is there for the rainy day or the funeral.  In the past people were thrifty and saved.  They do not like to be penalised and it is difficult to explain to them that they are getting an income, as they are not using it.  They feel they have a responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient money available to bury them.  In long term geriatric hospitals money is accruing to some people and they are not aware of this as they are incapable of making decisions.  I should like to address this question another day.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of the Bill.  It is important that when people are given a decision which they want to appeal, it should be decided in another area.  The whole concept of basic justice and common law is that a decision cannot be taken by somebody with a vested interest.  No matter how genuine the decision might be &mdash; and Senator Ryan was careful to say he was not bashing officials &mdash; if it is taken by somebody with a vested interest there is always a worry that it could be misconstrued.</P>
    <P>From my experience on the ground, apart from disability benefit appeals, I have found the Department helpful. People who are on existing schemes and have applied to change have been advised by the Department not to change where it could affect them materially.  For example: if they wanted to change from an invalidity pension to a retirement pension the Department quite rightly point out that they would be likely to lose their entitlements to free electricity, free travel and so on.  The Department explicitly set out the advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to know their rights.  In the area of appeals they are entitled to know their rights also.  It is important that when they are trying to ascertain their rights there should be an impartial procedure.  Nobody in the House would advocate that applicants who are not entitled to these payments should get them.  We want to ensure that <Col N="95" /> the applicants who apply and are entitled to benefits get them.  In 50-50 cases, where the balance is not on one side or the other, I suggest to the Department in common justice that their heart should be on the right side, on the side of the applicant if there is a slight doubt.  It could always be subject to review.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Independent Senator who had the ingenuity to put it together and present it to the House.  I look forward to the Minister's response, which I hope will be the Government's response in this area of social welfare appeals.</P>

      <P>I am particularly anxious to support this Bill introduced by Senator Brendan Ryan.  I indicated my support for it some considerable length of time ago.  I must say I am delighted to hear the reaction on the Government side of the House both from Senator O'Brien and Senator Ferris to this Bill and, of course, also the reaction of Fianna Fáil's Senator Fallon.  It seems that now that the Independent Senators have brought this Bill before the House there is a lot of support for it and many people are well aware of the difficulties in the social welfare appeals procedure.  This is nothing more than what one might expect because very many Senators are dealing with the problem on a day to day basis among people in the areas in which they live, where they are public representatives and where these problems present themselves on their own door steps.  Naturally, they are aware of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>We are glad of the support and of the compliments that have been paid to Senator Brendan Ryan.  We want more than verbal support and compliments. We want Government action to bring this into being.  If the indications of support we are getting are to be brought into action I suggest that all these people should accept the passage of the Second Stage so that we can get on to Committee Stage and be able to raise the nitty gritty aspects on the various sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was introducing the Bill <Col N="96" /> Senator Ryan made a comprehensive speech.  I do not intend to go over that same ground again.  Nor, indeed, do I intend to repeat what Senator O'Brien, Senator Fallon and Senator Ferris said.</P>
    <P>I would like in particular to draw attention to what Senator Ferris has been saying about medical matters.  A particularly sore point is the manner in which medical appeals are dealt with and the fact that it is so difficult to get any contrary medical evidence in.  I should like to make a few comments on various issues that have been raised.  When you come down to it, it is largely a question of basic justice and how we provide basic justice for the people who are, in general, the least well off, the least articulate, probably the least educated and least able to put their own case in society.</P>
    <P>First, I come to the question of being told the reasons a benefit has been refused. In some cases a sort of stock reason is given.  There are forms where you can tick off the reasons you may be refused. There are quite a number of cases where either one is not told the reason at all, so that it is very difficult to make an appeal, or else the reasons are in some sort of generalised form.  A case has been drawn to my attention where a man who worked steadily for 37 years became unemployed last April and was dealing with the unemployment exchange.  In September he was told, after a couple of months of unemployment, that he was not making sufficient effort to seek employment and his benefit was withdrawn.  He will be going through an appeals procedure.  All he was told was that he was not making enough effort to seek work.  A man who has been working steadily for 37 years could hardly be described as a work shy person who was unlikely to look for work.  At least some details should be given in all justice so that they know what they are appealing against.</P>
    <P>We could be told when appealing against the decision of a district justice or a Circuit Court judge that the judge does not necessarily have to give the reasons for his decision.  That is perfectly true.  By and large judges and justices who take their position seriously give <Col N="97" /> reasons for the decision they make.  They make some comment on the evidence even if it is fairly brief and they give you some idea of why they made up their minds in the way they did.  This is of considerable assistance to the person who is making an appeal.  Regularly in this kind of system if a benefit or assistance is refused, there should be at least an effort to set out in reasonable detail why the refusal was made so that the person can know where he is starting from in the appeal.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ryan and others I am not attacking the integrity of the officers of the Department who are dealing with these appeals.  I am not for one moment suggesting that they are corrupt, that they are careless, or that they have no interest in people or anything like that.  What I am suggesting is that your background makes a great deal of difference to the way your mind is formed, the way you look at something.  Without going into the extravagances of &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; you cannot help feeling that if you are formed within a Civil Service Department it is not your fault that you look at things in a certain way, just as those of us who are lawyers look at things in a certain way. Those of us who are public representatives look at things in a certain way.  Doctors look at things in a certain way.  It is difficult in a sense where it gives the appearance that you are being judge and jury in your own case when the appeals are within the Department.</P>
    <P>I think it would give a much better sense of basic judgment if we had an independent appeals system.  No doubt we will be told that would be costly and we cannot afford the cost.  When we are costing it, we should also take care to do something which is not always done in Civil Service assessments, that is, to cost the time of the civil servants who are involved in the present system.  Obviously for every officer of the Department who spends an hour or two hours deciding an appeal, one can quite readily work out how much that is costing in the overheads of the Department and in that officer's salary.  It is not just a question of saying we have to spend a great deal of new <Col N="98" /> money putting up an appeals system.  It is a question of how much additional money do we really have to put up in setting this up if we offset against it the money we are already spending on the present system.  I appeal to people who are thinking about this to think of the concept of costing people's time and it might not cost as much as we think to have a more independent system.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the need for an oral hearing.  A disturbing figure that came out in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare is that 60 per cent of these appeals are summarily dismissed. There are various reasons why one should have an oral hearing.  First of all, many of the people involved are not particularly good at documentation and may not be particularly good at putting down their case in writing, but if they had the chance to put their case orally and particularly if they had representation they would have a better chance.  Secondly where there is a conflict of evidence in a court decision an oral hearing seems to be a very obvious need.  To take a parallel in an ordinary court hearing where you have affidavits on both sides &mdash; in other words where the parties are putting down their case in writing &mdash; if there is a conflict between the affidavits there must be a right for oral cross-examination, for oral hearing.  This is a parallel situation.  If there is a conflict of evidence there should be a chance for questioning and for dealing with the evidence in an oral setting.</P>
    <P>With regard to representation and how people express themselves, I would be very impressed with the sort of evidence put forward by the Coolock Law Centre because the Coolock Law Centre deal with this sort of thing on the ground all the time just as Senator Ferris is dealing with it on the ground all the time.  In the north Dublin area the Coolock Law Centre have enormous experience in dealing with this kind of thing and with people involved in social welfare appeals. We should listen to their real experience. We should also look at the sort of people who are involved.  Are they the sort of people who are really able to run an <Col N="99" /> appeal, whether a written appeal or an oral appeal, on their own.  It is particularly unfortunate that the civil legal aid board scheme of the law centres are precluded from acting on tribunals of this sort.  This is something which Senator Robinson and I mentioned at the time when we had our Private Members' Motion about the legal aid board schemes.  If we were to take only one step we should take the step of allowing people to be represented through giving proper legal aid and giving representation through the legal aid board.  While the Coolock Law Centre may do marvellous work in their own area the Coolock Law Centre are only in one place and they are always severely restricted in their funds. That is very important.</P>

      <P>I want to express support for Senator Fallon's amendments. Like Senator Brendan Ryan, who spoke on it immediately before the House rose when the Minister went to vote, I see that there is a certain degree of difficulty in trying to enforce this.  Senator Fallon says that every person shall &ldquo;fully <Col N="100" /> disclose all drugs and medication taken by him&rdquo;.  How can one ensure that the person is going to tell the truth?  Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to question them about that.  It should be made clear to the people involved that there are dangers in undertaking a clinical trial of this kind if they are already taking other drugs or medicines.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Fallon's second amendment, in this day and age of computers and gathering of information there should not be much difficulty in having some kind of system whereby there should be a record of persons undergoing clinical trials so as to ensure that they do not go from trial to trial without any great gap in between in an effort to earn more money.  There is much peculiar information gathered in various computers under the auspices of the special branch or under the auspices of various departments. If there is computer data&mdash;as has been suggested in a national newspaper recently &mdash; on all members of Irish CND because they are automatically considered to be subversives, it should not be beyond the wit of man to set up a system whereby data can be kept on the people who take part in clinical trials.  I support Senator Fallon in what he is aiming at in these amendments.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, the purpose of the two amendments is a matter which is the responsibility of the ethics committee and the people arranging the trial.  It would be impossible to spell out in detail in the Bill every aspect which should be inquired into.  There is the difficulty that if one were to allude to all of the contingencies one might find oneself in the situation of over-definition.  The general responsibilities of an ethics committee for considering the justification for a trial, which are included in section 7 (2) and (3), together with the provisions of section 7 (4) (c) and (g), are adequate.  I would point out that applications to the Minister must include details of the criteria for the selection of participants. Under the guidelines which we will be <Col N="101" /> bringing into operation for the committees these details would be encompassed by that provision.  Therefore, I consider that details of this kind are more relevant to the guidelines about the operation of these trials.</P>

      <P>My amendment relates to a situation as in section 8 (6) (b) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> where such a person is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of a consent to be given for the purposes of this section, that person may be a participant in a clinical trial only if written and signed consent is given for such a participation by a person or persons...</P>
    <P>The Minister has substituted the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo;.  I suggest that the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; is a little weaker than the committee ensuring that the person is &ldquo;capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent&rdquo;.  I know the Minister is going to say that the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsmen have assured him that all the things I suggest in my amendment are contained in the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo;, and we could spend a long night arguing about whether or not that is true.  I will sit down at this stage because I do not think there is any disagreement in principle between myself and the Minister about the idea that whoever gives the consent should be somebody who is not only legally entitled to do so but is capable of knowing what he or she is doing in giving that consent.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.  Without any great brilliance I can foretell what he is going to say.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (7), lines 7 and 8, after &ldquo;otherwise)&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;unless provided for by the permission to undertake the clinical trial&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other than compensation for expenses actually incurred by the participant in the trial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> This is an amendment which, unless the Minister is extremely forthcoming, is unlikely to be withdrawn because it defines a philosophy on how clinical trials ought to be conducted.  The present provision in the Bill under section 7 (4) (h) is that the ethics committee must make itself aware and consider &ldquo;details of any proposed inducements or rewards, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for becoming or being a participant;...&rdquo;. Section 8 (7) provides that:</P>
    <P>No person shall offer or cause to be offered to a person for becoming or being a participant in a clinical trial any inducement or reward (whether monetary or otherwise) unless provided for by the permission to undertake the clinical trial.</P>
    <P>They are the two references I could identify to payment in this area and I am, therefore, extremely concerned that the principle of what are regarded as acceptable levels of payment has not been dealt with further.  I am aware that there are differing views on this.  I have thought much about this and I have concluded that the only way to ensure that people are properly protected is to provide that no payment should be given &mdash; this is what my amendment suggests &mdash;&ldquo;other than compensation for expenses actually incurred by the participant in the trial&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Clinical Pharmacology have a nice little piece about what they call &ldquo;expenses &mdash; remuneration&rdquo; as if they both mean the same thing when they mean entirely different things.  One implies, at least, compensation for expenses actually incurred; the other is a form of payment.  They say: &ldquo;These are based on the minimum industrial wage and are essentially the same for all studies, on a <i>per diem</i> basis&rdquo;.  They have a nice little piece about how some people in the past said they were paid too much and others said they were paid too little when &ldquo;the total amount paid relates to the duration of the study&rdquo;.  That sounds quite restrictive.</P>
    <P>On the other side of it, in a submission from Elan Corporation in Athlone there <Col N="104" /> is a quite enthusiastic piece about the contribution to the local economy.  They say:</P>
    <P>The approved recompense to subjects volunteering for essential studies in Elan's Clinical Pharmacology Unit stimulates the local economy by increasing the disposable income of these individuals.</P>
    <P>While I got the impression that the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology are trying to play down the significance of remuneration as an inducement to people to participate in trials, Elan seem to be making the point that this payment is actually effectively a form of wages, a contribution to wages and something that actually stimulates the economy.</P>
    <P>That introduces a distinct stench of exploitation into the whole area of clinical trials.  Let me remind the House that the basic rate of unemployment assistance for a single person is in or around £34 or £35 a week.  To specify a level of payment that is not a significant inducement to unemployed people or people on very low incomes to do something they would otherwise not do would make the payment so low as to be derisory. Remember £2 a day to an unemployed person represents roughly a one third increase in their weekly income.  It is £10 a week which is slightly less than one third of weekly income and £2.50 a day is more than one third.  That is a derisory sum of money but it is one third of an increase on the income of an unemployed person.  If you give a rate like that when you are dealing with unemployed people it is still a huge amount of money.  If a larger rate is specified to persuade people who are employed to take unpaid leave to do it, you are increasing the inducement to unemployed people, to people who are down on their luck and people who are short of cash to do this.  It goes back to what has been the experience in parts of the United States in the area of blood donations where, because people are paid as blood donors, the most wretched, most deprived and most depressed people queue up to donate yet another <Col N="105" /> pint of blood for the X number of dollars they get for it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the principle of volunteer clinical trial participants can be dealt with unless the idea of payment other than for expenses incurred is eliminated.  They would include expenses incurred &mdash; I am prepared to be quite broad about this &mdash; by people who have to travel, because arrangements have to be made to look after children, or they have to get alternative people to work for them.  There is a case to be made for encouraging people as volunteers to participate in trials like this, if they are not just being done for what are, effectively, two large major multinationals, and they have the most high profile.  They are not the only trials going on.</P>
    <P>In the general run of clinical trials conducted in hospitals around the country, there is a very good case to be made for encouraging people to volunteer.  It is a risk, perhaps, but it is a risk which contributes substantially to the wellbeing of the community.  There is a major problem when you are talking about two major, wealthy and profitable multinationals like the ICP and Elan.  Apart from ICP and Elan we must encourage people to participate.  Encouraging people to participate as volunteers and ensuring that they do not incur any loss of money because of it is a totally different thing from imagining you can fix a rate which does not become an improper inducement to some people.  Given that we have a huge pool of unemployed people who now see no prospect of any alternative source of income, any level of remuneration will become a quite substantial inducement to participate not just in one or two clinical trials but in as many as the person can get involved in.</P>
    <P>I already quoted the case of one person who talked about doing six trials in nine months.  I quoted from <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 2 December 1984 on Second Stage the case of an individual who, in the course of three years, completed around 12 separate courses at the institute earning fees from £150 to £1,200 per course.  This was back in 1983.  There is apparently a preception that considerable sums of money <Col N="106" /> can be &ldquo;earned&rdquo; by undergoing these trials.  Clearly, what we are going to get is people being induced to do these trials because of the prospect of a substantial increase in what would otherwise be a very miserable income.  You either think that is a good idea or you do not.  I believe there has to be a better way of recruiting volunteers and getting people to volunteer to do these things other than by actually paying people.  Therefore, the only remuneration that ought to be involved is remuneration for expenses actually incurred.</P>
    <P>This raises a very interesting question about unemployment &mdash; given the enthusiasm of certain people in this House and the other House to deal with social welfare abuse &mdash; as to whether people who are unemployed and doing clinical tests are available for work.  If they are not available for work have the Department of Social Welfare ever made the slightest effort to find out why they are not available for work.  People who are locked up doing a clinical trial for two days or a week are clearly not available for work and not actively seeking work. I do not know of any evidence that they actually lose their unemployment assistance or whatever other sort of benefit they are on.  That is a peripheral issue.</P>
    <P>The central issue is the philosophical question of whether people should be paid for doing these trials.  I have discussed this with many people and I do not see any way of preventing exploitation of people who need whatever little amount of money is being paid other than to eliminate the whole idea of payment and to replace that with a reasonably generous level of expenses based on the expenses people actually occur.  I put down amendment No. 44 which proposes to delete the words &ldquo;unless provided for by the permission to undertake the clinical trial&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;other than compensation for expenses actually incurred by the participant in the trial&rdquo;. Section 8 (7) would then read: &ldquo;No person shall offer or cause to be offered to a person for becoming or being a participant in a clinical trial any inducement or reward other than compensation for <Col N="107" /> expenses actually incurred by the participant in the trial&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Whether the payment to volunteers is described as expenses or remuneration, it will always be very difficult to get agreement on what are acceptable levels of payment.  No matter at what level the payment is pitched there will be some who will argue that the payment is so high as to constitute an inducement or a bribe.  On the other hand there will be those who will argue that the payment is so low that the participant is being exploited.</P>
      <P>The practice of paying a fee to participants in clinical trials has been in existence for some time.  When a practice has been in existence for a certain length of time, it comes to be accepted as the norm. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to vary that practice to the detriment of the persons affected by the varying of it.  The Government are discovering this in the other House in relation to the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients.  The levels at which fees for clinical trials to participants are pitched in Ireland at present are reasonable.  I would not like to see a situation where payments would be made on the basis of expenses because that would mean there would not be a flat rate payment to the participants and some participants would receive more than others.  This would lead to considerable unrest.  I have grave reservations about Senator Ryan's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to support Senator Ryan's amendment.  He is suggesting participants should get some form of out of pocket expenses as distinct from what they actually get at present.  I do not think it makes any difference whether they are called expenses, financial expenses, financial recompense, inducements or whatever because at the end of the day what matters to those people who go on these clinical trials is what they get when they leave the trial.  If it not sufficient they will not go.  I would love to think people could participate in clinical <Col N="108" /> trials for expenses &mdash; assuming the expenses would be much lower than what they are getting at the moment.  The social policy action group suggested they should not be pitched higher than the weekly supplementary allowance which is something in excess of £30.</P>
      <P>I went out to the ICP and met people on arthritis trials and heart trials.  I went twice to Elan without telling the people. I just walked in and chatted to the lads. I know many of them and, unfortunately, most of them are out of work.  Some are employed but on very low wages.  Some of them are students.  The common denominator in all cases was that they were there for the financial rewards. They knew exactly what they were going to get.  It was spelled out for them before they went on the trials.  Some of these people have helped me at election times. I asked them would they go on trials for the £31 or £34 a week supplementary welfare allowance and they made it clear to me there was no way that they would participate in a trial for that kind of money.</P>
      <P>In a perfect society we should all be doing trials but for these trials you have to leave your family for three or four nights at a time.  You might be there for the full week-end depending on the trial in question.  Even in a hospital scene where they are well fed, have television and pool, people involved in clinical trials feel that because they are away from their wives, sweethearts and families they are entitled to the money they get at the end of the trial.  As I said, in a perfect society people would be doing trials for expenses.  We should all be doing them for expenses but we would not have the time or the interest to participate in a clinical trial for four or five nights at a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Ryan presses this and the Minister agrees to it, it is the end of clinical trials.  It is a sad fact but it is true. You may say goodbye to clinical trials if they are pitched so low as to make them unattractive.  At the end of the day clinical trials are for social welfare recipients and those on low wages who are saving up to pay an ESB bill, to buy a television, <Col N="109" /> or whatever.  They are there for the money and 99 per cent of them will tell you that.  They will say they are happy in the knowledge that medical research is being fostered and improved and happy to be able to help somebody else.  At the end of the day it is what they get that matters.</P>
    <P>You cannot pitch the payment too low or too high because obviously if it was pitched too high, you would not know what the results would be.  People might tell lies to get on a trial for big money.  It has to be pitched at an acceptable and reasonable level.  If the Minister decides these people should get expenses only, you can say goodbye to clinical trials.  I checked this out very fully during the summer months with people I know well who have been on these trials.  They will not participate for expenses, or call it what you like.  They know exactly the kind of money they are entitled to.  They will go if they get that money.  If they do not get that money they will not go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what Senator Fallon said, unfortunately it lays bare the whole crux of the matter.  I hasten to say that I am talking principally about the recruitment of so-called healthy human volunteers for trials of new drugs being carried out by or at the behest of pharmaceutical companies.  I am not talking about the sort of clinical trials that are carried out in hospitals on patients who already need treatment for illness and so on but about commercial trials of drugs.  This is the inherent difficulty in that, on the one hand, we are being told that it does no harm, that it is a splendid thing to do and that it is something for society but, on the other hand, we are being told the real truth is that it is something nobody in his right mind would do unless he was rightly paid for doing it. This seems to be the crux of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little concerned to think that if we had a system, as some parts of the United States have and indeed some countries in Europe have, whereby people were paid to give blood, there would be people standing up here today saying: &ldquo;Who would go in and give their <Col N="110" /> blood for nothing if we took away this system of payment?&rdquo;  Yet here and in Britain and other countries we are able to manage a perfectly good blood transfusion service without offering payment to people.  In a sense what we are saying is that we must pay people to do this because it is something that none of us would do if we could possibly manage not to do it.  That begs the question that people who volunteer to do this are in need.  What Senator Fallon says bears this out.  People who are doing it are largely people who are out of work or on low wages and need extra money.  When we are offering payment to them we are offering them a temptation which says to them: &ldquo;If you do this for us we are going to pay you&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On a parallel with the idea of blood transfusion, it would be infinitely more desirable if we could have a situation where people who volunteered &mdash; they are called &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; for clinical trials &mdash; did so simply on compensation of expenses rather than on payment but if we are to talk in terms of payment and think of it as something people should be paid for, then they should be paid at a high level, something really worthwhile.  If we are to say it is something we need to pay people for, let us make provision for them to be paid a substantial fee for undertaking these so-called voluntary tests.</P>
      <P>How many of us would be anxious to volunteer as guinea pigs to have drugs tried out on us?  If we looked into our own hearts, we would find that we would be fairly shifty about volunteering to put ourselves forward for these trials.  So, if we are asking other people to do it and we genuinely feel we cannot run a system whereby no one will do it just for expenses, then let us offer a genuine inducement rather than a balancing act, saying we will just about pay them enough to tempt the poorest of the poor or the most deprived to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and I share the concern of Senators that greater care must be given to the framing of this section.  I started out in the drafting of this Bill with a very rigid view in relation to the question of inducements.  I had a great reluctance to be in any way associated with any question of inducement or reward of any kind.  The more I examined it and the more I discussed it with reputable clinical arrangers, the more I saw that it would be preferable to rigorously control inducements.  As a result we drafted section 8 (7) as follows:</P>
      <P>No person shall offer or cause to be offered to a person for becoming or being a participant in a clinical trial any inducement or reward (whether monetary or otherwise) unless provided for by the permission to undertake the clinical trial.</P>
      <P>I discussed this matter with the Attorney General and with the parliamentary draftspersons and the legal advisers of the Department of Health.  We felt there should be a rigid provision whereby the body politic, the Minister for Health of the day, would determine what inducement may be offered, if any; to what extent expenses may be paid, if any; to what extent any moneys in addition to expenses may be paid, if any.  All of that would have to be provided for.</P>
      <P>It is true that one could write into the section that travelling expenses would be paid and we could have a system of compensation for loss of wages and loss of means or hotel expenses where a person may be travelling to and from a particular vicinity.  One could define it on that basis. Nevertheless, one would finish up with substantial problems of definition and of encompassing arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, there are many pharmacological studies which entail very lengthy presence on the part of an individual and would require very tedious arrangements on the part of the individual &mdash; perhaps going on over several weeks of residence &mdash; with the person being obliged to be totally free of tobacco and totally free of alcohol and agreeing to do regular urine tests three or four <Col N="112" /> times a day.  That could go on over a protracted period.  The person would be provided for by way of accommodation, meals and general recreation in a setting which would be agreeable to the person. Within that framework, should one have a statutory prohibition that such persons should not receive any payment whatsoever or a payment which would be the equivalent of a social welfare payment, either a minimum payment or a medium payment or a special payment if the person had a dependant and so on?</P>
    <P>How does one define it?  It is very difficult. There can be the question of sheer personal inconvenience &mdash; nothing more, nothing less.  Is one to deny a person a particular remuneration for incurring that personal inconvenience?  Some trials may have an element of discomfort.  As we know, payment cannot be made and should never be made for risk, but there can be a degree of discomfort &mdash; it may not be major &mdash; but is one to prohibit payment in that regard?  For example, a blood sample may be taken every day or every two days or at the end of every period as agreed.  That is a matter of discomfort.  Is one totally to prohibit payment in that framework?</P>
    <P>These are very difficult questions.  They are questions which we cannot easily deal with.  I am very interested in the views of Members of the House.  I have an open mind on the question.  I framed the Bill on the basis that inducements must be controlled.  They must be specifically provided for in the proposal, must be stipulated in the permission given and adhered to.  Anything in excess of that would result in a prosecution.</P>
    <P>We come to the conclusion that we will have to consider carefully any proposals. I accept and share Senators' concern about an undue inducement.  However, in the case of a trial which involves considerable inconvenience to the person I am loath to say that the expenses should be the same as those for a trial which involved no inconvenience at all.  I would be interested in the further views of my parliamentary colleagues on the matter. This is the best we could frame.  Unless I had some alternative which, frankly, I <Col N="113" /> do not see, I would be constrained to indicate that the section as drafted should stand.  I will leave it in that setting at the moment.  The question arises as to whether some recompense should be allowed for particular features of a trial, such as restriction of freedom of movement.</P>
    <P>The most important single thing about the Bill is that the Minister will now be able to exercise statutory control over the level of such inducements.  I would be loath to have a total blanket prohibition on payments other than expenses directly involved.  I am very concerned about the matter and I have approached it with a great deal of caution and concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am troubled by this area also.  I tend to weigh very seriously the concerns expressed by Senator Ryan in moving his amendment.  There is a very real worry that we would, in this Bill providing a whole method of administering and controlling clinical trials, give a statutory licence for exploitation of people in our society who are very vulnerable. We know the kind of people who are vulnerable and likely to seek to participate in clinical trials purely because of the inducement offered, either monetary or inducement in kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems I have in assessing and weighing the alternatives is an absence of an adequate information base about the situation on the ground.  I can envisage a number of instances where you could have clinical trials without difficulty. You would obtain what we are calling the healthy volunteers, without difficulty, in a hospital context, in a medical school context, where either staff or students would participate, as they do regularly participate in that kind of clinical trial.  It would be helpful if we were narrowing our focus on the circumstances where it would be likely that monetary inducements of a kind would be offered. When we do that, some of the objections Senator Ryan has voiced become more evident because it then becomes clearer that inducements are being offered to people to encourage them to participate <Col N="114" /> for monetary reward, monetary gain, monetary need in this type of trial.</P>
    <P>That may not be the best basis on which to recruit people to participate because you are targeting in on a particular sector and it can lead to exploitation.  If the legislation is to leave it open by the provisions of section 7 (4) (h) and by this section &mdash; if Senator Ryan's amendment is not accepted &mdash; to offer monetary payment as an inducement, then surely we should insure that that is at a very high level.  Surely we should actually put in a minimum requirement of either so much a day or so much an hour to make it absolutely clear that if monetary inducements are being offered they would be very substantial.  That would have an interesting effect on the proposers of clinical trials.  For the first time they might actually consider very seriously the way in which these clinical trials are conducted.</P>
    <P>It would also have the beneficial effect of very high minimum payments for the persons who had to suffer the discomforts the Minister was describing &mdash; spending three or four nights away from home, giving up smoking or whatever.  Those offering would be required to take the whole situation onto a new plane and by so doing in effect one would at least avoid some of the exploitation.  It may be that there would be a very substantial queue to participate.  That in itself would increase the pool of potential participants if one is doing it on a paying basis.  It is a question of really thinking through the implications.  If it is on a paying basis then we should, as legislators, be insisting on a very high minimum payment for participation and that would take some of the worries out of the system.  The alternative proposed by Senator Ryan in his amendment is that it would not be on a paying basis.</P>
    <P>I have one concern with a legislative prohibition on any payments other than expenses, that is, how it would be enforced.  I would be concerned at the possibility of hidden inducements and the real difficulty of policing them.  Senator Fallon has said he knows of a number of people who seek to participate and only <Col N="115" /> do so on the basis of the monetary return to them.  If by accepting Senator Ryan's amendment we prohibit any payment other than what Senator Ryan has made clear would be generous expenses, then there is a real concern that this would simply be by-passed by covert payments which were never acknowledged.  Those receiving them would be prepared to go along with that because they are vulnerable. They would be prepared to accept payment on the basis of its not being declared and never going before the ethics committee and so on.  We could be into a worse situation of exploitation. Of course, if somebody is caught at it, it could be a ground for revoking the clinical trial, but it might be quite difficult to police.  This is a difficult area.</P>
    <P>I come back to my initial point.  We really do not know enough in this House about the present situation in relation to those who participate.  Like Senator McGuinnes, I emphasise that we are really talking about healthy volunteers at this stage.  We are talking about those who voluntarily participate in clinical trials.  There is the contrast between those in a medical school or hospital context who can be persuaded to do it for reasons of advancing the trial itself, advancing their knowledge, advancing medical science, and the alternative, a pharmaceutical company which wishes to do a clinical trial on a substance and is therefore seeking to obtain volunteers to participate.</P>
    <P>Having raised a number of the difficulties I still lean substantially in principle towards Senator Ryan's amendment.  When we are setting up a legislative system we should seek to do so on the basis of not providing monetary inducements which would become exploitative of certain people in our society. We could ensure that the kind of expenses did take into account discomfort of the kind that has been described, or segregating yourself from your family for a certain period, or undergoing that kind of discipline in the course of a clinical trial.  That could be reflected in the measure of the expenses.  The point <Col N="116" /> is a very important one and it really is the litmus test of how we do approach clinical trials and where we place the emphasis. If we place the emphasis substantially on protecting the public and, in particular, protecting vulnerable sections of the public, we should not be permitting through the legislation and authorising payments for participating because of the dangers involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last hour of debate has been of a quality that deserves more wide appreciation than this debate will actually get.  It has been a very serious discussion.  I do not think there is anybody in the House who is in any way differing on the principle of a profound concern that people should not be exploited.</P>
      <P>It was helpful and constructive of Senator Fallon to say that people are undergoing clinical tests for money.  If that is the case, we can do two things about it.  We can either say it is unacceptable in principle that people should undergo clinical tests for money, or we can see to it that people are paid sums of money which represent real substantial earnings on their part and which probably of themselves would be a substantial disincentive to those running the trials to get involved in excessive numbers of trials.  By substantial payments, I mean payments on an hourly basis of at least twice the average industrial hourly wage. There is also a distinction to be made between the two major profit generating companies which conduct clinical trials on a systematic basis and the many hundreds of other clinical trials conducted by hospitals and other bodies on a limited basis, with a limited number of people, for reasons other than profit to the institution or profit to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two very different forms of trials involved.  As far as the two major companies are concerned, my view is that if we cannot prohibit payment, there is no safe intermediate position.  We should either prohibit payment and restrict it to the expenses actually incurred, or alternatively we should pitch the payment at a level which makes large numbers of <Col N="117" /> people interested and which, in the process, will compel the company to take a representative sample of society and thus eliminate the risk of exploitation of people.  It is not the idea of doing trials that exploits people.  It is not the idea of being paid for doing trials that necessarily exploits people.  It is the idea that people feel compelled to do something they would otherwise choose not to do because of the money.  There are other forms of exploitation.  There is the suspicion that covert payments will be involved.  Senator Robinson mentioned that and I agree with her.  Do we, as Members of the Oireachtas, believe that the bodies running clinical trials on a commercial basis are capable of that sort of activity?  I have a considerable amount of evidence that they cut corners and have done so in the past.  The inquest to which I have referred suggests that on many occasions a lot of the noble principles espoused were far from rigorously enforced when pressure came on, for one reason or another, to get a trial done quickly.  If that is so, there is a strong case for not allowing these things to be done at all.</P>
    <P>If we are not satisfied, we can regulate them, organise, control and police them in a way which prevents all the things we want to prevent being carried out or implemented.  I am acting on the presupposition that we will be able to regulate them properly and that this legislation will see to it that they are regulated properly.  If they are regulated properly we can eliminate the risk of covert payments by a variety of means including the simple question of finding out whether the people who do the trials are getting covert payments.  One presumes that the response of a Minister to that particular activity would be to refuse all further permissions and that, effectively, would close down the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister sympathised with the case I put forward but he seemed to be at a loss to do something about it.  If you tease out the principles involved here, it is possible to talk about an alternative form of words.  What I would have in mind is <Col N="118" /> something which, first of all, incorporated what I had proposed as the basic principle; that in general nobody should be paid anything more than the reasonable expenses incurred.  Secondly, an exception could be made where bodies conducting the tests are profit orientated bodies doing these tests on a commercial basis.  In exceptional circumstances the Minister could approve payments in excess of the expenses incurred where he was satisfied there was justification for it. That would mean the rule would be no payments, but exceptions would be permitted where the Minister was satisfied.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of whether we are prepared to incorporate in legislation the seriousness with which we take this issue. The way to do it is to state a principle which is that no payment, other than expenses, should be the rule but that the Minister should be authorised to permit exceptions to that rule where he is satisfied. That would have to be done in the individual application for an individual trial where a case could be made that there was a level of inconvenience or discomfort involved but this is perhaps something we could discuss outside the House.  That would be the sort of suggestion I would make.  If we are not prepared to eliminate payment completely and if there are limited circumstances where the inconvenience and other things are justified, perhaps the way to do it is to state a general principle of no payment and make a proviso for the Minister to identify exceptions.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will say that that is not very different from subsection (7). To do it in that way would be to identify the principle which the Oireachtas regarded as being the necessary principle on which this process should operate.  We are agreed, judging by the seriousness of the debate and the detail in which we have debated it, that this is a very fundamental, philosophical question in the whole issue of clinical trials.  We should talk about it in terms of what principles we want incorporated in legislation. When we are talking about inconvenience and discomfort, it is important to remember that people who give blood <Col N="119" /> in blood transfusion clinics are suffering inconvenience and are suffering discomfort. They are asked to be careful about their diet and the things they do for a short period afterwards.  They are asked to avoid certain things and they do it for no payment or compensation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGuinness that, if we were to be presented with a case in relation to blood donations and if we were a society where people were paid for them, we would hear many of the same arguments that we are dealing with here tonight.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, and before I decide what to do with this amendment, I should like to hear whether the Minister has any interest in my suggestion that the principle should be no payment with a provision for the Minister to authorise payment where he believes exceptional circumstances permit it.  In the case where payments are to be made, the payments should be sufficiently generous to ensure that people are not induced even onto those trials for small sums of money. The ICP suggest that the rate of payment used is what they call the minimum industrial wage.  I do not know what the minimum industrial wage is but I know what the average industrial wage is.  There are two different rates; there is a female rate and a male rate.  If there is to be payment it should be of the order of twice the average male industrial wage rate.  We should incorporate the principle of nonpayment as the principle in the Bill and make provision for the Minister under exceptional circumstances to permit payments in excess of those.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a continuing difficulty in meeting the situation.  It is arguable that if the payment was twice the male adult industrial wage for transportable goods industries the whole country would be taking holidays to go on trials of a minor nature.  There is this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reluctant to be drawn into analogies such as blood transfusions and so on.  After all the giving of blood or the selling of blood, obnoxious as it would <Col N="120" /> be, is very different from the acceptance into oneself of a foreign substance of unknown therapeutic components and effects.  It is difficult to draw analogies of that nature.  There is not a great deal of direct information available in relation to the matter.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in a publication in January 1986 made a point regarding volunteers and I quote:</P>
    <P>Ethics Committees should be informed of all proposed payments to volunteers and should be satisfied that they are reasonable and not so large as to induce subjects to take risks primarily for a reward.</P>
    <P>I tend to share that view.  It is interesting to note that, for example, Professor Kevin O'Malley who is the current chairperson, by appointment, of the National Drugs Advisory Board, is one of the people who signed the working party report as did many other distinguished members of the College of Physicians.  But that is a broad guideline. What we have put into the Bill is much more rigorous and more controlled.  In section 7 (k) we repeat the strictures specifically for the work of the guidelines, namely, that any payments, monetary or otherwise, to be made to any person for facilities used for the purposes of the clinical trial must be taken into account and then any payment, monetary or otherwise, to be made to a person for conducting clinical trials or any part of the trial, must again be taken into account.  All the criteria are there and there is the section itself which is as tightly drawn as we could possibly manage.</P>
    <P>The recent report on research on healthy volunteers by the Royal College of Physicians of London, Volume 20, No. 4, of October 1986 made the point about financial and other inducements and I quote:</P>
    <P>...many studies, particularly in pharmacology, are lengthy and tedious, and may involve urine collection, <Col N="121" /> multiple venepunctures or other procedures associated with some discomfort. It is reasonable that volunteers in this type of research should be paid, over and above reimbursement of expenses incurred.  These payments are for inconvenience or discomfort and increased payments may be reasonable for procedures requiring extra care on the part of the subject or involving more discomfort.</P>
    <P>Payments should never be for undergoing risk.  Payments should not be such as to persuade people to volunteer against their better judgement, nor to induce them to volunteer more frequently than is advisable for their own good.  While appreciating that any given sum would be viewed differently by a student or person who is unemployed than by a person in full paid employment we suggest that payment should range somewhere between rates equivalent to current student grants and a daily equivalent to the average wage, but time involved and inconvenience incurred should be taken into consideration.  All payments to volunteers should be approved by the Ethics Committee.</P>
    <P>They are quite clear on that and also they make it quite clear and I quote further from the report that:</P>
    <P>When a volunteer withdraws for medical reasons related to the study full payments should be made.  When the volunteer leaves the study and exercises his right not to give a reason or is required to leave for non-compliance, no payment need to be made if the consequences of leaving the study in these circumstances have previously been explained to him.  If a volunteer withdraws for other reasons, including non-related medical reasons, the investigator or sponsor should make a proportional payment.</P>
    <P>Some investigators receive personal payment, or members of their staff, the department, or laboratory equipment may be funded by a sponsoring company or other organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> That is quite a common occurrence and these payments should also be disclosed to the ethics committee.  This is commended in the Royal College of Physicians report.</P>
    <P>Overall there are multiple reasons why the position can vary.  I am comforted by the fact that Senator Robinson brought out the complexities involved in assessing the acceptability of particular payments. She stressed the difficulty of phrases such as &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; and confining it exclusively to a phrase of that nature.  The safeguards that we have of first satisfying the ethics committee about the level of payments and secondly that the Minister must in turn be satisfied that the level of payments which would be disclosed as payments has to be formally recorded departmentally and by the ethics committee. The National Drugs Advisory Board who would be very much involved in the general advice and guidance would be aware of the amount of the payment. If people felt they were being shortchanged they would not be too slow in coming forward.  Where a company made an effort to offer an inducement which was away over the odds for reasons of doubtful propriety this would become known in time.  If you have total blanket prohibition there is the real problem of the underhanded payment of expenses. We all know how insidious and appalling that can be.</P>
    <P>Overall I am inclined to stick to my views and if, between now and Report Stage, we and in particular our academic colleagues who are familiar with that area of compensation, have any views which could be brought forward I am quite willing to have advice sought again from the National Drugs Advisory Board. Between now and Report Stage I will be quite willing to listen to the views of any of the medical colleges who have particular views and indeed, the views of individuals.  I would like to receive information.  The volume of actual information as to what precisely happens is not very great.  I would be glad to have that.  I would certainly consider it and I would be prepared to meet Senators on an informal basis to have a look at that <Col N="123" /> section if they feel it must be amended in a particular formulation.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that our colleagues in the Department would be available to discuss the position with Senators on an informal basis.  I have an open mind.  This is the best I have been able to draft at this stage because there is no statutory legislation in the UK or on the continent to which I can readily refer.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister quite persuasive on this issue.  My intention was to press this amendment but one should never press an amendment when the door is even one centimetre open not to mention when the door is reasonably wide open.  Consequently, even though I appreciate that the Minister has made no commitment to do anything, I would prefer to have some time to think about it, consult with my colleagues and perhaps discuss it with the Minister, rather than close the debate now.  Therefore, in the light of what the Minister has said and the obvious concern of everybody that we should work out a system which protects people from exploitation and meets the obvious occasional difficulties I wish to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mullooly raised the question of the person who is consenting to a trial being informed of what the trial involves and having to be informed of the facts of section 8 (5) which reads:</P>
      <P>Any person who has given his consent in accordance with this section may withdraw it at any time and no contractual liability shall be incurred by such person...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He suggested to the Minister that it should be specifically stated in the guidelines that a participant must be informed of that right as part of the process of <Col N="124" /> informing him about the implications of the trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Just very briefly may I make a suggestion which might exclude from the body of helping human volunteers people who really should not be volunteering on account of their unfitness to do so and who might be tempted, supposing there is a fee paid, to volunteer in order to get the money. Would it be possible for the Minister to consider &mdash; I am not asking him to answer this question now &mdash; between now and Report Stage the possibility of allowing an independent body such as the Blood Transfusion Board to assemble a panel of applicant healthy human volunteers who could be vetted independently before they go to the people who are performing the clinical trials, and that it would be from this panel that people would volunteer and be accepted.</P>
      <P>I have not thought this idea out very well but we could have an additional filter system to prevent people whose health condition should rule them out from being volunteers.  It would be an independent body who would decide this rather than the people who are anxious to get volunteers because they are running the clinical trials and have a profit based interest in them.  There should be some way of setting up a panel of people from whom volunteers could be drawn.</P>

We have had discussion on two of the more critical sections of the Bill and if the Minister could start his Report Stage preparation process on those sections without waiting for the completion of Committee Stage, time would not be lost by postponing the debate until next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I think Senator McGuinness and I would agree to that.  Before we adjourn I would like to say that I appreciate the manner in which the Minister has handled the debate.  He has been most forthcoming and most responsive. Until recently the Seanad was not the House &mdash; and credit must be given to the Leader for this also &mdash; where much serious business tended to be done regarding legislation.  I thank the Minister <Col N="126" /> for his response both on Second Stage and up to now on Committee Stage.  I am very happy with his response.</P>
