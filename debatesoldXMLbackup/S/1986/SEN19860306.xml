      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to seek the early review of the verdict at Portlaoise Circuit Court on Tuesday, 4 March 1986, in the Ballinspittle statue case.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to rule that this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of no official responsibility.</P>

      <P>I realise that I would not be in order to criticise the court in any way.  I did not intend to do so.  I was concerned with the situation where it appears that in this case damage to the amount of £9,000 was caused to a statue.</P>

      <P>I wrote to the Senator yesterday and I am absolutely in sympathy with him.  The Senator might be able to frame a suitable motion.  I tried to say that the Minister for Justice was not responsible for the verdict of the court.  If the Senator is still unhappy about it we will discuss it later.  I would prefer if there was not a speech now because we would be in a debate situation then.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order for today Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  It is proposed that if No. 1 carries through past 1 o'clock the debate would be adjourned at a suitable time between 1 o'clock and 1.30 and the House suspended and that the House should resume at 2.30 in order to take up item Nos. 2 and 3.  In the event of No. 1 not lasting until 1 o'clock it is proposed that the House would be suspended at the conclusion of No. 1 and in this case the resumption would be still at 2.30 because, as I explained to the House yesterday, the Minister for Social Welfare is liable to be engaged in the Dáil until that time and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, who is concerned with motion No. 3, has a longstanding engagement for the morning outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go dtugann Seanad Éireann dá aire an Tuarascáil ón gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge: An Chéad Tuarascáil i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht na dTithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag éirí as an tuarascáil sin tá orainn an <Col N="1109" /> cheist a phlé as Gaeilge, as breac-Ghaeilge, nó as leath-Ghaeilge agus as Béarla chun go leanfaimid an moladh atá sa tuarascáil ag úsáid níos mó Gaeilge, cé nach bhfuil ach cúpla focal againn, agus an Ghaeilge sa Teach seo a mhealladh. Mar sin, ní amháin do na Gaeilgeoirí an díospóireacht seo &mdash; díospóireacht gach Ball den Seanad atá i gceist.  Tá an moladh seo le fáil in alt a 3 (a) ar leathanach a 5 den tuarascáil atá os ár gcomhair, agus seo sliocht as an tuarascáil féin:</P>
    <P>Is teanga beo í an Ghaeilge agus caithfear í a labhairt i dtreo is go mairfidh sí.  Tuigtear go bhfuil go leor ball den dá Theach go bhfuil cumas maith Gaeilge orthu.  D'fhéadfadh na Baill sin agus foireann na dTithe ar ndóigh i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt sna Tithe agus lasmuigh dóibh.  Is gá daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu a mhealladh chun í a labhairt agus d'fhéadfaí é sin a dhéanamh tri atmaisféar níos Gaelaí a chothú sa dá Theach.  Dá gcruthófaí atmaisféar ar an nós sin ní bheadh leisce ar a lán daoine mar atá faoi láthair, is cosúil, an méid Gaeilge atá acu a úsáid.  Tá se rí-thábhachtach go dtuigfí ón tús go bhféadfadh gach ball a bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith aige nó aici a chur leis an iarracht chun an tatmaisféar sin a chruthú, tríd an méid atá acu a úsáid oiread agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Tá an tuarascáil seo os ár gcomhair ach is sean scéal é bheith ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a mhealladh agus athbheochan na Gaeilge a chur ar siúl.  Sna fichidí bhí Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ann agus Ristéard Ó Maolcatha ina chathaoirleach ar an gcoimisiún sin.  Níos luaithe, in ar n-aimsir féin, is dócha, bhí an Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge curtha ar siúl agus bhí tuarascáil deiridh den choimisiún sin curtha faoi bhráid na Dála agus an tSeanaid i 1963.  Tá morán moltaí san tuarascáil sin a bhaineann leis an Oireachtas agus an méid ba cheart don Oireachtas a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a athbheochan.  Na moltaí atá ann, is dócha gur ceart tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh sa tuarascáil seo.</P>
    <P>Since I have said this debate should not <Col N="1110" /> be merely for those interested in Irish I am going to break now for a short time into English and to read the recommendations of that commission in English so that it will be clear to all Members of this House what the basic recommendations of that very important commission were. The first eight recommendations made by the commission for the restoration of the Irish language related to the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am quoting from the English summary of the Report of the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 July 1963. It is No. PR7256.  On page 21 we read the recommendations which are made to all Members of the House and to all political parties.  Recommendation No. 1 states:</P>
    <P>That the Government and the various political parties should request the newspapers to appoint Irish speaking reporters to cover Dáil and Seanad debates.</P>
    <P>This is an important recommendation and one that would affect very much the tendency of Members of the House to use the Irish they have.  Before we had our present recording system here our internal reporting system was deficient in regard to the reporting of speeches in Irish.  I will always remember that the first time I spoke in Irish in this House I spoke on a Bill relative to the Gaeltacht. I took great care in the preparation of that speech.  I took a good deal of care particularly with my opening paragraph dealing with the general principles.  I went to the trouble of introducing a few cora cainte.  I also tried to make sure that my Irish was idiomatic, but apparently, when I rose to speak, the reporters who were on duty at the time had no notion what I was saying.  Of course, my speech was reconstructed afterwards by one of the senior editors from a purely phonetic attempt to reconstruct it but all the polish of those opening paragraphs, to which I had devoted so much time in preparation, was lost.  We got a completely bland opening to a speech.  This was no encouragement for me to continue to speak in <Col N="1111" /> Irish in Seanad Éireann.  That difficulty does not arise now with our recording system because, of course, the tapes can be examined afterwards.  I think it is symtomatic of the problem.</P>
    <P>It exists also in regard to public reporting. Senators and Deputies who have ambitions to be returned at the next election are interested in being reported and being reported accurately.  Let me put it this way.  If it is easier to be reported in English and if it is easier to get publicity speaking in English, then of course, this is a temptation to speak always in English, which is hard for an elected representative to resist.  I would say that recommendation No. 1 now made over 20 years ago, I am quite sure has improved the position in regard to the question of reporting.  I am quite sure that our newspapers have taken account of this but I would not say that the problem has been completely removed.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 2 states:</P>
    <P>That a simultaneous translation service should be provided for the benefit of Deputies and Senators who do not know Irish.</P>
    <P>This has been adopted in Dáil Éireann but it has not been adopted in Seanad Éireann.  It might be interesting if the Minister could let us know what is his evaluation of the effect of the introduction of that service in Dáil Éireann. Indeed, if it has been a remarkable success, if it has led to the greater use of Irish then, of course, it is a matter that should be seriously considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House.  I think the committee took the view that the introduction of a translation booth might spoil the appearance of this House.  Let us look around us at the present appearance of the House without the booth and it is not very aesthetic.  If our Chamber has to be torn asunder for structural purposes perhaps &mdash;if this is something which would make a real difference&mdash;it could be part of this reconstruction.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 3 of this committee, which reported in 1963, was:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> That the political parties and also the nominating bodies in the cases of elections to Seanad Éireann, should strive to have Irish speakers chosen when new candidates are to be nominated for election.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this has had any effect. There are so many factors in regard to the selection of candidates that realistically this will never be a high priority.  In the words of the famous phrase &ldquo;all else being equal&rdquo;, we might at least hope that there would be a larger number of people not only who are Irish speakers but who would be prepared to speak in Irish in Seanad Éireann.  I hope this debate will reveal that there are quite a number of Senators capable of discussing these questions in Irish.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 4 states:</P>
    <P>That in order to give their members an opportunity to discuss political questions in Irish, the political parties should organise study courses in politics, economics, sociology, history, law, etc. through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>One might also say that perhaps they should organise them through the medium of English also in order to improve the grasp that the Members of the Oireachtas have on these particular disciplines which form the background to political decisions.  There have been attempts from time to time&mdash;I can remember several attempts&mdash;to establish discussion groups here within the House, sometimes on a party basis, sometimes on an all-party basis, in order that Deputies and Senators could come together to discuss problems, so that they would become familiar with the vocabulary of discussing these points.  I remember, in particular, an effort being made by Deputy Denis Jones several years ago, which was successful for a time; but, like many other things that are started in this House, the sheer pressure on Members of the Dáil and Members of the Seanad caused these discussion groups to decline and wither away.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 5 states:</P>
    <P>That in the allocation of time for <Col N="1113" /> political broadcasts on radio and television extra time should be allocated to parties prepared to use it for a programme or programmes in Irish.</P>
    <P>I think in recent years the political parties at times of general elections have done more than they used to in regard to the use of Irish.  This may be due partly, of course, to the advent of Radio na Gaeltachta, which has resulted in the political parties preparing party political broadcasts for the audience of Raidio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No 6 states:</P>
    <P>That the grants given to periodicals in Irish should be available also for the publication of periodicals or bulletins wholly in Irish by the political parties.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister or any of his predecessors have taken any action in regard to that.  I do not know, indeed, if any of our political parties have yet produced any bulletins wholly in Irish, except possibly for policy statements at election time.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 7 states:</P>
    <P>That the preservation and revival of Irish is a primary objective of all the main political parties.  It should promote the use of the language in its correspondence, propaganda and internal administration and should instruct its local branches that work for the restoration of the language in their own areas is one of their functions.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable recommendation. All I can say is that the General Secretary of the Fine Gael Party, Mr. Finbar Fitzpatrick, is a fluent Irish speaker and writer and, to my knowledge, uses Irish in internal party communications wherever this is appropriate.  I have never come across an occasion, when this was appropriate, that he was not capable of handling it through Irish.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 8 is adressed to Irish speakers.  It states:</P>
    <P>That Irish speakers in general should <Col N="1114" /> take a more active part in the activities of the political party of their choice.</P>
    <P>I think that again this is something which has been attempted from time to time within parties.  Those who are interested in the use of Irish have attempted to come together.  The Minister with us today, I know, has been active from time to time.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also taken an interest in attempting to bring together those interested in Irish in order to promote these various activities.</P>
    <P>So we have here in this report published in 1963 eight basic recommendations. These recommendations were supported by the Government of the day in the White Paper of January, 1965. Each of these eight recommendations was exhausted.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán tuarascálacha eile le fáil.  Tá an coiste um Taighde ar dhearcadh an morán tuarascálacha sin atá mar chúl don morán tuarascálacha sin atá mar chúl don cheist atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  Agus ina dhiaidh sin bhí Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge, 1983 - 1986 agus sa phlean sin tá tagairt freisin do cheist na Gaeilge san Oireachtas.  Anois tá moltaí san tuarascáil sin freisin agus léifidh mé sliocht as an tuarascáil, leathanach 43:</P>
    <P>An Dáil agus an Seanad: D'fhonn úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn ar shlí réadach sa Dáil agus sa Seanad, molann Bord na Gaeilge:</P>
    <P>(i)  sa chás go mbeadh ceisteanna as Gaeilge curtha ar an gclár go dtógfaí ceist amháin ar a laghad as Gaeilge gach lá a mbíonn Tráth na gCeist sa Dáil (1983), agus dhá cheist ar a laghad as Gaeilge (ó 1984 amach); nó, mar mhalairt air sin go leagfaí amach tréimhse áirithe le haghaidh ceisteanna Gaeilge lá amháin gach seachtain.</P>
    <P>Sin moladh (i).  Moladh (ii):</P>
    <P>go labhróidh cainteoir amháin ar a laghad as gach páirtí as Gaeilge den chuid is mó de, ar an Dara Céim de gach Bille a thógfaí sa Dáil nó sa Seanad <Col N="1115" /> agus go mbeadh mír as Gaeilge in oráidí scríofa an Dara Céim (Second Reading speeches) ón Rialtas agus ón bhFreasúra.</P>
    <P>Agus uimhir (iii):</P>
    <P>Go molfaidh an Rialtas do gach Aire ar ócáidí oiriunacha a mbeadh tuairisc ghinearálta ar obair a Roinne á tabhairt aige don Dáil nó don Seanad (mar shampla nuair a bhionn Meastacháin na Roinne á bple):</P>
    <P>(a)  go dtabharfadh sé cúntas ar fheidhmiú pholasaí na Gaeilge sa Roinn, agus</P>
    <P>(b)  go mbeadh an mhír sin nó mír shubstaintiúil eile dá óráid i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>I ndiaidh an phlean sin, tá tuarascálacha bhliantúla le fáil ó Bhord Gaeilge.  Faoi dheireadh cuireadh ar siúl i mí na Samhna, 1984, an Comhchoiste Don Ghaeilge&mdash;teideal simplí atá ann &mdash; agus na haidhmeanna a bhí ann ná go ndéanfadh an comhchoiste athbhreithniú agus moltaí ó am go ham i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge a leath in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Anois tá an chéad tuarascáil ón chomhchoiste sin againn.</P>
    <P>Tháinig an comhchoiste le chéile mí na Bealtaine anuraidh agus do bhí orthu tuarascáil a thabhairt isteach chomh luath agus ab fhéidir.  Do rinneadar a leithéid. Ní raibh dhá mhí caite nuair a bhí an tuarascáil seo bailithe agus sínithe acu. B'fhéidir gurb í sin an chúis nach bhfuil mórán ann.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé níos fearr sé mhí nó mar sin a chaitheamh ar an obair agus tuarascáil níos láidre a bheith againn chun an cheist a phlé sa Seanad anois.  Níl mórán ann.  Níl mórán ann nach raibh sna tuarascálacha cheana féin go rinne mé tagairt dóibh.  Is deacair an méid atá déanta acu a luachtáil mar sin.  Ba mhaith liom a chloisint ó na Seanadóirí atá mar bhaill sa chomhchoiste níos mó ar an gceist seo mar níl sé sa tuarascáil atá againn.</P>
    <P>Tá lochtanna beaga le fáil ar an tuarascáil. Sa réamhrá, alt a haon, tá tagairt do <Col N="1116" /> thuarascáil dheiridh an Choimisiúin ar Athbheochan na Gaeilge a leagadh faoi bhráid na Dála i mí Eanáir 1965.  Ní ceart é sin, is dócha.  Bhí sé curtha faoi bhráid na Dála agus an tSeanaid bliain go leith roimhe sin.  Sin é an dáta ar cuireadh faoi bhráid na Dála an Páipéar Bán ón Rialtas.  Sin mar atá an scéal, is dócha. Ba mhaith liomsa freagra ón Aire mar gheall air sin.  Sílim gur locht atá ann agus ní ceart locht mar sin a bheith i dtuarascáil ó chomhchoiste an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Locht beag eile: níl an leagan amach atá sa tuarascáil ró-shuimiúil; níl se rófhuarasta na moltaí atá ann in alt 3 a léamh.  Más mian liom tagairt a dhéanamh do cheist Riar na hOibre &mdash; Order of Business &mdash; caithfidh mé tagairt a dhéanamh do 3 (a) nó trí Arabaic, lúibín (a) dún an lúibín lúibín (iii) beag Románach, dún an lúibín lúibin (a); dún an lúibín.  Níl an leagan sin oiriúnach do thuarascáil mar seo.  Foirm dheachuíl &mdash; bheadh sé sin i bhfad niós fearr.  Bheadh an fhoirm nua mar seo: 3.2; 3.1.  Tá sé ar fad meascaithe trí chéile.  Is locht beag é sin &mdash; agus sin rud ba cheart dúinn a dhéanamh, lochtanna a fháil ar an gchomhchoiste, nuair a bhíonn lochtanna ann ach is maith an rud go bhfuil an comhchoiste ann.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil an tuarascáil ann agus go bhfuil an díospóireacht againn sa Seanad inniu. Molaim an rún atá os ár gcomhair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDeBrun" hpid="Séamus de Brún Séamus de Brún">
      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tuarascáil.  Measaim gur ócáid stairiúil í seo sa chás go bhfuilimid ag plé tuarascála faoi úsáid agus leathnú na Gaeilge in imeachtaí Thithe an Oireachtais agus a dtimpeallacht den chéad uair.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh céadach ar bheartais uile an chomhchoiste.</P>
      <P>Is cuis áthais dom a rá go bhfuil an tuarascáil féin le moladh.  Tá sí curtha le chéile go stuama, ealaíonta.  Cé nach bhfuil sé chomh toirtiúil sin, b'fhéidir nár mhiste a rá dá mbeadh a bhfuil luaite curtha i bhfeidhm againn bheimis ar an mbóthar ceart lenár n-aidhmeanna a thabhairt chun críche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mian liom tagairt don réamhrá.  Measaim gur tráthúil agus gur chóir go ndeanfaí tagairt don tuarascáil dheireanach den <Col N="1117" /> Choimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge a cuireadh faoi bhráid na Dála i Mí Eanáir 1965.  Aontaím ar fad gurbh fhiú an sliocht a tógadh as tuarascáil an Choimisiúin sin a chur in ár láthair ath-uair i dTuarascáil an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge.  Dá thoradh sin, is breá liomsa an sliocht mar atá a aithris arís inniu sa gcaoi go mbeidh sé le léamh i dTuairisc Oifigiúil an Tí seo san am atá romhainn.  Seo é an sliocht mar atá:</P>
    <P>Ba mhór mar a chuideodh sé leis an teanga náisiúnta a leathadh mar ghnáth-theanga na ndaoine dá mb'eol dóibhsean go raibh an gradam is dual di ag an Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus go raibh sí á húsáid go rialta ina gcuid imeachtaí.  Ar an dtaobh eile de, is mór mar a bhaineann sé de thábhacht na teanga i súile an phobail, agus is mór a lagaíonn sé a ndúthracht di, nuair is eol dóibh nach mbionn sí le cloisteáil ach an uair fhánach i dtionóil dhá Theach an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom gur suntasach an sliocht é sin agus gur cheart é a chur i gcuimhne anseo inniu.  Má tá aon rath i ndán d'imeachtaí an chomhchoiste, caithfear aird a thabhairt ar a bhfuil sa chéad chuid den sliocht sin, níl an dara rogha againn.  Ach tá deacrachtaí bunúsacha eile le sarú freisin.  Is léir go bhfuil culú nach beag maidir le tábhacht na Gaeilge tagtha le tamall de bhlianta.  Is follas, cinnte, go bhfuil lagú tubaisteach tagtha in úsáid na Gaeilge ar ócáidí poiblí.  Is trua liom é sin a rá, ach is fíor é.  Is baolach go bhfuiltear éirithe leithscéalach faoi Ghaeilge a úsáid ar ócáidí poiblí.  Caitear aghaidh a thabhairt air sin agus go luath.</P>
    <P>Measaim dá réir go bhfuil sé thar am an cúlú agus an lagú seo a chosc.  Caithfear tábhacht na Gaeilge agus fealsúnacht uile na hathbheochana a dhearbhú arís go láidir agus go teann, agus anois an tam. Chuige sin caithfear lán-tacaíocht a thabhairt d'obair an chomhchoiste le leas na Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh i dTithe an Oireachtais agus ina dtimpeallacht agus, dá n-abróinn é, taobh amuigh de sin.  Is ón mbarr anuas a chaithfidh an treoir agus an tacaíocht teacht.  Caithfidh sí teacht go príomha ó cheannairí na bpairtíthe <Col N="1118" /> éagsúla.  Beidh an comhchoiste ag súil go mbeidh an tacaíocht le fáil go fonnmhar. Tá sé sin riachtanach má tá aon toradh le bheith ar obair an chomhchoiste seo.</P>
    <P>Cloistear go leor faoi láthair faoi dheathoil agus an méid dea-thola atá i bhfabhar na Gaeilge ach ní mhaireann teanga ar dheá-thoil amháin.  Rud beo is ea teanga.  Caithfear í a labhairt agus a chleachtú.  Muna gcleachtaítear í agus muna labhraítear í níl i ndán dí ach an fhaillí agus an bás.  Smaoinim arís ar an nath cainte: déan mar a deirim ach ná déan mar a dhéanaim.  Caithfear gníomh a chur leis an mian agus caithfear iarracht a dhéanamh deireadh a chur, mar adúirt mé, leis an gcúlú agus leis an patuaire atá tagtha isteach i saol an lae inniu maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge ar ócáidí poiblí.</P>
    <P>Fillim anois ar an dtuarascáil féin.  Cé go raibh dhá chéim sna horduithe tagartha a tugadh don comhchoiste, is léir gur díríodh i dtosach ar an ngar-aidhm sé sin &ldquo;úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach agus tá an dréacht sin i lúibíní dúnta agus is dóigh liom gur ceart é sin mar sin mar atá sé ins an tuarascáil.</P>
    <P>Cinníodh i dtosach ar atmaisféar a chruthú sa timpeallacht sin a chuideódh le húsáid na Gaeilge.  Mar atá ráite sa tuarascáil socraíodh ar shuaitheantais agus comharthái a chur in úsáid ar fud an dá Theach, is é sin, sa Seanad, sa Dáil agus i dtimpeallacht na dTithe sin araon. Céard tá i gceist againn le suaitheantais? Sin suaitheantais a thugtar do chuairteoirí agus do oifigigh Roinne a thagann isteach anseo ar cuairt, ach na suaitheantais atá ann faoi láthair, faraor, is Béarla atá orthu&mdash;&ldquo;visitor&rdquo; agus é greanta go h-an deas orthu agus níor thuig an coiste agus ní thuigimid fós an fáth nach bhféadfaí na suaitheantais sin a bheith i nGaeilge chomh maith céanna.  D'iarramar go ndéanfaí sin ach is próiseas as mall an phroiseas sin.  B'éigean scríobh chuig foinsí údarás an Oireachtais trí chéile.  Bíonn rudaí mar sin mall.  Tá sé sin intuigthe agus is é deireadh an scéil nach bhfuil na suaitheantais againn fós.  Tá díoma orainn faoi sin agus tá díomá ar an gcoiste ar fad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> Is é an scéal ceánna é maidir leis na comharthaí.  Tá roint comharthaí le feicéail timpeall an Ti seo ach, arís, comharthaí aitheantais nó comharthaí treorach iad.  Tá na comharthaí sin ar fad i mBéarla agus ní dóigh liomsa go gcruthaíonn sé sin atmaisféar a mheallfadh daoine chun Gaeilge a labhairt agus is trua leis an gcoiste gur mar sin atá.  Iarradh go gcuirfí na comharthaí sin ar fáil tríd an phróiseas agus níl na comharthaí ar fáil fós cé go bhfuil sé leath bhliain ar a laghad ó chuathas ar a lorg.  Tugadh cuireadh d'oifigigh Rannaí Stáit teacht isteach anseo i láthair an choiste le comhairle a thabhairt dóibh agus lena dtuairimí a thabhairt maidir le leas na Gaeilge go ginearálta.  Tháinig siad isteach sa Teach seo, Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta, leasrúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta agus oifigigh eile ina dteannta ach b'éigean doibh suaitheantais a fháil i mBéarla ag deasc sa Dáil.  Ní dóigh linn go bhfuil sé sin ceart agus ba mhaith linn go ndéanfaí gach iarracht é a aistriú agus go mbeadh na suaitheantais agus na comharthaí sin le fáil go han-luath agus go mbeadh siad i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Rinne an comhchoiste obair eile a bhfuíl tagairt dí sa tuarascáil &mdash; ní rachaidh mé tríd anois mar tá daoine eile anseo go bhfuil fonn labhartha orthu agus ní mian liomsa bheith ró-fhada.  Scríobh an coiste chuig eagrais éagsúla deonacha atá ag obair ar son leas na Gaeilge ar fud na tire ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile.  Iarradh orthu aighneachtaí a chur i láthair an choiste agus caithfidh mé a rá gur tháinig cuid mhaith aighneachtaí tábhachtacha isteach agus go bhfuil siad i seilbh an choiste faoi láthair. Tabharfar cuireadh do na heagraióchtaí éagsúla sin teacht i láthair an choiste amach anseo leis na haighneachtaí sin a phlé féachaint an bhféadfaí teacht ar chomhréiteach faoi aon mholtaí fónta atá iontu a chur i bhfeidhm agus comhairle a ghlacadh leis na heagraíochtaí sin mar go bhfuil go leor acu dílis agus dáiríre faoin teanga.  Tugadh cuireadh freisin do chuid mhaith dreamanna eile.  Cuireadh ciorclán <Col N="1120" /> chuig comhaltaí na Dála agus comhaltaí an tSeanaid anseo ina theannta sin le moltaí dá gcuid féin a chur i láthair an choiste féachaint céard a mhotfaidís maidir le leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Ní féidir a rá gur tháinig an oiread sin moltaí isteach is a bhíomar ag súil leo i dtosach.  Ach, mar sin féin, ta roinnt mhaith acu ann agus, arís, beidh seans ag na daoine sin a dtuairimí breise a nochtadh don choiste agus déanfar gach iarracht freastal orthu sin agus leas a bhaint astu má mheastar gur fiú sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tugadh cuireadh freisin do Bhord na Gaeilge teacht anseo in ár láthair lena dtuairmí a nochtadh mar dhream a bhfuil cúram speisialta acu i leith na Gaeilge agus a bhfuil an-obair déanta acu maidir le Gníomh don Ghaeilge a rinneadh tagairt dó cheana féin anseo.  Chuir siad cáipéis tábhachtach ar fáil ina bhfuil moltaí gur fiú aitheantas a thabhairt dóibh agus iad a chur i bhfeidhm.  Pléadh rudaí le oifigigh Roinn na Gaeltachta agus beidh siad ag teacht chugainn arís.  Tá súil agam i ndeireach na dála go mbeidh moltaí fiúntacha le cur i láthair an choiste agus go dtiocfaidh toradh ar sin freisin.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Seanadóir Dooge do bhunú an Stáit agus do na deacrachtaí a bhain le tuairísciú díospóireachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid.  Tá na deacrachtaí sin ann.  Tá deacrachtaí poiblíóchta ag baint le imeachtaí na Dála agus imeachtaí an tSeanaid.  Le heolas breise a chur ar na deacrachtaí sin agus le greim a fháil ar na deacrachtaí atá ann, thug an coiste cuireadh do lucht an Phreas, do Ghailearí an Phreas anseo inar láthair.  Thaínig triúr nó ceathrar ó na paipéir éagsúla in ár láthair.  Phléamar na deacrachtaí a bhí acusan.  Chuir siadsan a dtúairimí os ar gcomhair agus chuir baill an choiste a dtúairimí os a gcomhair siúd, agus thuigeamar a chéile i bhfad níos fearr nuair a bhí an díospóireacht thart.  D'fhéadfaí a rá, is dócha, go dtángathas ar chomhréiteach a mbeidh an-tairbhe dá bharr amach anseo ach tá deacrachtaí ag baint le díospóireacht agus le labhairt ins an Dáil agus ins an Seanad.  Má labhraíonn tú i nGaeilge is lú go mór an seans atá agat go bfaighidh tú aon phoiblíocht ann <Col N="1121" /> agus is rud dian ar gach duine a labhraíonn gan poiblíocht le fáil aige.  Tá daoine ann go minic nach bhfaigheann aon phoiblíocht is cuma cén teanga a labhraíonn siad, Gaeilge nó Béarla, ach is lú é seans poiblíocht a fháil má labhraíonn siad i nGaeilge.  Tuigtear é sin agus tá deacrachtaí eile freisin nár luaigh mé a chuireann isteach ar dhaoine.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom é seo a rá ar son an choiste, go measaim go bhfuil obair anmhaith déanta acu ins an achar aimsire a bhfuil siad ag obair ó tháinig siad le chéile.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh ar a gcuid oibre.  Ach tá go leor eile anseo, fiadhnaise ar obair an choiste nach bhfuil luaite sa tuarascáil agus, ar bhealach, is trua liom é sin.  Tá clár oibre anseo leagtha amach ag an gcoiste, clár oibre a bhfuil gá le gach mír de agus atá leagtha amach suas go dtí 23 Iúil.  Ins an clár sin ag tosnú ar 5 Márta, beidh cruinniú gach seachtain ag an gcoiste le dream éigin de na dreamanna a luaigh mé cheana féin.  Ní rachaidh mé triothu ceann ar ceann mar cuirfidh sé sin moill orm agus ba mhaith liom cead cainte a thabhairt do dhaoine eile agus seans a thabhairt dóibh a dtuairimí a nochtú maidir leis an scéal seo.  Ach ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé cothrom muna luaifí an clár seo.  Mar a deirim, tugann an clár muid suas go dtí an 23ú lá de mhí Iúil. Tá sé sin ag teacht cóngarach do thráth scortha na Dála agus Sheanad Éireann. Beidh teangmháil dá dhéanamh ag an gcoiste leis na dreamanna a chuir aighneachtaí agus moltaí isteach le go gcuirfí feabhas ar stáid na Gaeilge sa Dáil agus sa Seanad.  Tá cáipéis eile freisin agus is é an teideal atá air &ldquo;An Dara Tuarascáil Maidir le Cur Chun Chinn na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais&rdquo;.  Is páipéar fada fairsing an páipéar seo, trí leathanach ann, ag tabhairt le fios na nithe éagsúla atá pleanáilte go healíonta, mar a dúirt mé i dtosach, ag an té a chuir na tuarascálacha seo le chéile, agus measaim gur ceart é a chur san áireamh in aon mheastachán a déanfar ar obair an choiste agus ar obair an té a chuir an tuarascáil le chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor moltaí breise anseo ach, mar a dúirt mé ní rachaidh mé isteach iontu, ach tá rud amháin atá molta ag an gcoiste <Col N="1122" /> freisin agus tá sé sin sa tuarascáil, go gcuirfí seomra faoi leith ina mbeadh fearais ag daoine a bhfuil spéis acu i bhfoghlaim na teanga agus le feabhas a chur ar a n-eolas ar an teanga, go mbeadh téip taiteadáin agus téipeanna le fáil acu leis an Ghaeilge a cleachtú.  Tá molta freisin go gcuirfí ranganna ar bun do dhaoine mar sin a bhfuil dúil acu feabhas a chur orthu féin agus tá go leor acu, measaim, ins an dá Theach ach treoir agus spreagadh agus cabhair a thabhairt dóibh. Beidh, go gairid, seomra ar leith in áit éigin i dTithe an Oireachtais ina mbeidh téip taifeadáin le fáil agus téipeanna le Gaeilge a chleachtú agus feabhas a chur ar a gcumas labhartha Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Measaim go bhfuil dream amháin i bpobal na hÉireann go bhfuil spéis ar leith acu sa díospóireacht seo inniu agus spéis ar leith acu in obair Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge agus is iad sin muintir na Gaeltachta.  Creidim é sin i ndáiríre. Creidim go bhfuil cluas le h-éisteacht orthu agus go mbeidh siad ag fanacht agus ag feitheamh go bhfeice siad céard é an toradh agus céard é an dáiríreacht a bhaineas le bunú an choiste seo agus céard atá in ann dó, mar mothaíonn siad go bfhuil faillí á dhéanamh in a leith agus go ndearnadh faillí in a leith le blianta anuas.</P>
    <P>Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge. Admhaítear é sin go forleathan.  Má leigtear ar lár í caillfear foinsí dúchais agus féiniúlacht ár gcine.  Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam, a bheidh againn cinnte.  Is léir mar sin gurb í an Ghaeltacht croí agus anam ghluaiseacht na hathbheochana ó thús agus is léir freisin go bhfuil sí ag meath agus ag cúngú le blianta maithe. Má tá an Ghaeltacht le tarrtháil as an ghéarchéim ina bhfuil sí anois, is léir go bhfuil polasaí dearbhta, riachtanach chuige sin.  Mholfainn dá réir gur chuid d'obair aon choiste atá freagrach faoi leas na Gaeilge go bhféachfaidh siad chuige go gcuirfí infrastructúr iomlán ar chomhdo mhuintir na Gaeltachta &mdash; bóithre, séarachas, iascaireact, córas iompair agus cumhachta, cúrsaí cumarsáide agus teileafóin. Measaim go bhfuil sé sin riachtanach le misneach a thabhairt do mhuintir <Col N="1123" /> na Gaeltachta sa chaoi go mbeidh siad bródúil as an oidhreacht atá acu agus fonn orthu í a choinneáil beo i ngach gné. Glacaim go fonnmhar leis an tuarascáil. Failtím roimhe agus guím gach rath ar obair Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh céadach air san am atá le teacht.</P>

      <P>Os rud é go bhfuil mé i mo bhall den chomhchoiste seo tá áthas orm go bhfuil toradh éigin againn anseo sa Teach inniu i bhfoirm tuarascála. Caithfidh mé a admháil go bhfuil áthas orm go bhfuil tuarascáil ghairid againn. Luaigh an Seanadóir Dooge anseo nach raibh mórán ann.  Tá mé cinnte go raibh an iomarca ar fad ann leis na blianta ó thaobh moltaí agus tuarascálacha agus nar deineadh faic faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Tá sé an-easca ar fad tuarascáil fhada, óráid fhada agus gach rud fada a chur ar aghaidh i gcomhair na Gaeilge agus bheith sásta go bhfuil a lán déanta ag an Rialtas nó ag dream eile.  Níl maitheas ar bith i rudaí fada.  Bheinn féin sásta dá mbeadh leath-leathnach againn anseo inniu mar gheall ar úsáid na Gaeilge in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid, mar is féidir linn bheith ag caint go ginearálta faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge go dtí go mbeidh deireadh leis an gcéad seo agus beidh leithscéal againn gan tada a dhéanamh.  Agus cén fáth nach féidir linn anseo sa Seanad Gaeilge a úsáid níos mó? Sin an fhadhb atá ann agus is féidir linn faoi mar a dúirt mé, bheith ag caint faoi moltaí a tugadh dúinn caoga bliain ó shin nó tríocha bliain ó shin, nó fiche bliain ó shin.  Is cuma faoi na moltaí sin muna gcuirfear i bhfeidhm iad.  Cén maitheas atá iontu?  Nílimid ach ag déanamh leithscéal dúinn féin, má táimid ag caint faoi mholadh anseo muna bhfuil Gaeilge á úsáid againn sa Seanad.  Sin í an cheist atá le freagairt againn inniu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a admháil nach bhfuil go leor Gaeilge ann ar chor ar bith.  Nuair a tháinig mé go dtí an Seanad cheap mé go mbeadh atmaisféar Gaelach anseo, sa Dáil, fiú amháin.  Níl.  Nuair a bhi mé <Col N="1124" /> im shuí ansin bhí mé ag féachaint ar an monatóir &ldquo;Seanad Éireann, Item No. 1 Report&rdquo;.  Agus tá saoirse againn le breis agus seasca bliain.  Fiú amháin istigh anseo ni bheadh &ldquo;uimhir a h-aon&rdquo; intuigthe ag Seanadóirí.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil éinne &mdash; b'fhéidir nach ceart é sin a rá ach níl daoine i ndáiríre faoi úsáid na Gaeilge ná athbheochan na Gaeilge sa Dáil ná sa Seanad.  Ni cóir go mbeadh Béarla ansin ar chor ar bith mar thuigfeadh gach éinne taobh istigh de sheachtain cén bhrí a bhí leis sin dá mbeadh sé i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Brúnach eile, an príomh Brúnach, is dócha, faoi na suaintis agus na comharthai atá timpeall an Tí seo.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nach bhfuil siad i nGaeilge i ngach áit fiú amháin &ldquo;Fir&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Mná&rdquo;, cé go bhfuil pictiúirí ann faoi láthair agus ní bhíonn a fhios agam cé acu bean no fear atá ar an doras.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an focal &ldquo;fir&rdquo; nó &ldquo;mná&rdquo; ann.  Ba chóir go mbeadh gach rud anseo a thaispeánfadh nach raibh tú i Westminster nó in áit éigin eile.  Nuair a thagann stróinséar isteach sa Dáil nó sa Seanad ba chóir go mbeadh a fhios aige go raibh sé i dteach Gaelach agus go raibh sé in Éirinn.  Nuair a thagann daoine isteach anseo, lucht féachana, nuair a bhíonn áit dóibh ann, níl tuairim dá laghad acu cén Parlaimint in a bhfuil siad ó thaobh cad tá ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Na gnáth rudaí, tá siad luaite cheana féin agus ní maith liom bheith ag dul siar ar rudaí atá ráite cheana, ach na gnáth rudaí anseo sa Seanad, ni bhíonn Gaeilge ann nuair ba chóir.  Sílim go mba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ag Uachtarán na hÉireann ag an Taoiseach, ag an Ceann Comhairle, an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, an Cathaoirleach anseo agus ag an Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Muna mbíonn Gaeilge ag na daoine sin, tá sé an-deacair bheith ag caint anseo trí Ghaeilge mar b'fhéidir go gceapfeadh siad go raibh tú ró-chliste nó b'fhéidir ró-ghlic, go raibh tú ag iarraidh rud éigin a chur trasna nár chóir bheíth ar siúl ar chor ar bith.  Ní aontaím le moladh a tháinig isteach chugainn go mba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ag gach duine a bheadh ag seasamh sa toghchán.  Bheadh sé sin i bhfad <Col N="1125" /> ró-chúng.  Tá a lán rudaí a bheadh ag teastáil ó dhuine a bheadh ag seasamh mar Theachta Dála.  Bheadh sé go maith da mbeadh Gaeilge ag gach Teachta Dála agus gach Seanadóir, is dócha, ach ní aontaím go mbeadh sé sin mar phríomh riachtanas.  Ba mhaith an rud dá mbeadh Gaeilge ag cathaoirligh ar fud na tíre ar chumann ar bith, mar tá se an-deacair seasamh suas in áit ar bith agus bheith ag caint trí Ghaeilge muna dtuigeann an cathaoirelach cad tá ar siúl agat.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán oibre ar siúl againn sa choiste seo.  Bhuaileamar lena lán daoine faoi mar a dúirt an Seanadóir de Brún ansin, agus beimíd ag bualadh le daoine eile ach níl an tuarascáil seo ach ag tabhairt cúntais dúinn ar úsáid na Gaeilge timpeall na dTithe anseo.  Bhí moladh eile ann, athbheochan na Gaeilge go ginearálta.  Nil meas madra agam faoi láthair ar athbheochan na Gaeilge sa choiste seo go dtí go mbeidh rud éigin déanta againn sa Teach seo agus sa Dáil a thaispeánfaidh go bhfuilimíd i ndáirire agus nach bhfuilimíd ach ag caint faoi Ghaeilge.  Bímíd ag caint i gcónai faoi Ghaeilge ach ni bhímíd ag caint as Gaeilge.  Sílim go bhfuil sé thar am do gach einne atá cúiosach i ndáirire go ndéanfadh sé rud éigin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom éisteacht leis na cainteoirí nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus tá sé an-tábhachtach ar fad go labhródh siad anseo, na daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Ba mhaith liom a chlos uathu cad iad na rudaí a bheadh oiriúnach chun Gaeilge a úsáid, cad iad na rudaí a thuigfeadh siad agus b'fhéidir uathu siúd thiochfadh na moltaí ab fhearr &mdash; níl a fhios agam.  Ní gá go mbeadh Gaeilge ag gach éinne a labhródh anseo ach is gá go mbeadh siad i ndáirire.  Caithfimid moltaí agus tuarascálacha a bhí ann fadó a chur ar leataobh agus, mar a dúirt mé cheana, in ionad bheith ag caint faoi Ghaeilge, caithfimíd Gaeilge a labhairt.  Má tá Gaeilge ag daoine ba chóir go mbeadh sí á úsáid acu.  De ghnáth labhraím as Gaeilge anseo i gcuid den óraíd a thugaim. Bhuail mé le Seanadoír agus dúirt sé liom lá amháin: &ldquo;Bhi tú ag caint trí Ghaeilge ar an ábhar sin&rdquo;, agus is é an <Col N="1126" /> tuairim a bhí aige go raíbh Gaeilge oiriúnach do rudaí airithe ach nach raibh sí oiriúnach do rudaí eile agus nár chóir bheith ag caint trí Ghaeilge ar rudaí, is dócha, go bhfuil baint acu, cur i gcás, leis an eacnamaíocht nó le cúrsaí airgeadais. Tá sé ceart go leor má tá rud éigin gan tábhacht le rá agat go labhrófá trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl an dearcadh ceart ar chor ar bith, sílim, anseo.  Níl atmaisféar ceart ann agus, faoi mar a dúirt mé, caithfimid tosnú agus a thaispeáint go bhfuil rud éigin ar síul anseo, agus ansin, nuair atá an rud ceart anseo, is féidir linn bheith ag rá leis na daoine timpeall na tíre go mba chóir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge a úsáid acu.  Ach go dtí go dtiocfaidh an lá go mbeidh an Dáil agus an Seanad ag taispeáint go bhfuil siad i ndaíríre déarfainn nach bhfuil seans dá laghad againn go mbeidh na daoine timpeall na tíre ag féachaint chugainn.  Tá a lán daoine timpeall na tíre, go mór-mhór sa Ghalltacht, caithfidh mé a rá, atá ag déanamh a lán oibre ar son na Gaeilge.  Ach níl an deashampla le fáil acu ón Dáil nó ón Seanad agus níl meas madra acu féin, sílim, ar na moltaí a thagann amach.  Tá siadsan ag obair go dian, ag déanamh rud tairbheach chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus beidh an Ghaeilge slán nuair atá na daoine sin ann.  Ach go dtí go dtugaimid an dea shampla, ní ceart duínn bheith ag caint faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge nó úsáid na Gaeilge go ginearálta ar fud na tíre.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom failtiú roimh an chéad tuarascáil ón Chomhcoiste don Ghaeilge.  Bunaíodh an comhchoiste seo chun athbhreithniú agus moltaí a dhéanamh i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach, sa céad dul síos agus chun athbhreithniú agus moltaí a dhéanamh i dtaobh dul chun chinn na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.  Sa tuarascáil seo scrúdaíonn an comhchoiste na slite in ar féidir úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí Tithe an Oireachtais.  Más mian linn go mbeidh a háit ceart ag an teanga náisiúnta i saol poiblí na tíre caithfear a úsáid a leathadh san Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Tá an méid seo le rá ag an Tuarascáil ar leathnach 5 faoi labhairt na teanga:</P>
    <P>Is teanga beo í an Ghaeilge agus caithfear í a labhairt i dtreo is go mairfidh sí.  Tuigtear go bhfuil go leor Baill den dá Teach a bhfuil cumas maith Gaeilge orthu.  D'fhéadfadh na Baill sin agus foireann na dTithe, ar ndóigh, i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt sna Tithe agus lasmuigh dóibh.  Is gá daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu a mhealladh chun í a labhairt agus d'féadfaí é sin a dhéanamh trí atmaisféar níos Gaelaí a chothu sa dá Teach. Dá gcruthófaí atmaisféar ar an dóigh sin ní bheadh leisce ar a lán daoine&mdash; mar atá faoi láthair is cosúil &mdash; an méid Gaeilge atá acu a úsáid.  Tá sé rí-thábhachtach go dtuigfí ón tús go bhféadfadh gach Ball a bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith aige nó aici cur leis an iarracht chun an t-atmaisféar sin a chruthú tríd an méid atá acu a úsáid oiread agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Tá Gaeilge réasúnta mhaith ag formhór Ball an dá Theach agus caithimid a adhmháil go bhféadhfaí níos mó di a úsáid ná mar a úsáidtear faoi láthair.  Níl Ball ar bith de cheachtar den dá Teach nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas abairt nó dhó as Gaeilge a úsáid gach uair a labhraíonn sé no sí le linn díospóireachta.  Tá ceacht le foghlaim againn go léir ó na comhairléoirí anseo i mBaile Áth Cliath a rinne sár iarracht cúpla tráthnóna ó shin ar an ngnó ar fad a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhaith moltaí ciallmhara sa Tuarascáil faoi chéimeanna bunúsacha a d'fhéadfaí glacadh leo chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú sa dhá Teach agus atmaisféar níos Gaelaí a chothú.  Mar a déireann an Tuarascáil ar leathnach a 6, d'fheádfaí na suaitheantais a thugtar do chuairteoirí agus d'oifigigh ó Ranna Stait a bheith as Gaeilge agus d'féadfaí na comharthaí ar fud an Tí a bheith i Gaeilge freisin.  Nuair a bhíonn na Tithe ina suí tá go leor treoracha agus ceisteanna agus orduíthe ín úsáid go rialta a d'fhéadfaí a bheith as Gaeilge, mar shampla, &ldquo;Nil ach dhá nóiméad fágtha ag an Seanadóir&rdquo;<Col N="1128" /> agus abairtí agus frásaí mar sin.  Chomh maith leis sin, aontaím leis an Tuarascáil go bhféadfadh na coistí éagsúla roinnt Gaeilge a úsáid ina gcruinnithe sa tslí chéanna.  Ní fheicim go bhfuil deacrachtaí ar bith leis na moltaí sin go léir a chur i bhfeidhm gan mhoill.</P>
    <P>Cúpla bliain ó shin chuir Institiúid Teangeolaíochta na hEireann suirbhé náisiúnta ar bun ar dhearcadh an phobail i leith na Gaeilge agus tá torthaí an tsuirbhé sin an-suimiúil.  Mheas beagnach 70 faoin gcéad de na daoine a cheistíodh go mbeadh sé inmholta dá dtabharfadh ceannairí poiblí dea-shampla agus níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt san Oireachtas agus sa saol poiblí.</P>
    <P>Ar leathnach a 4 den Tuarascáil seo, sa Réamhrá, tá an slíocht seo:</P>
    <P>Ba mhór mar a chuideodh sé leis an teanga náisiúnta a leathadh mar ghnáth-theanga na ndaoine dá mb'eol dóibhsean go raibh an gradam is dual di ag an Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus go raibh sí á húsáid go rialta ina gcuid imeachtaí.  Ar an dtaobh eile de, is mór mar a bhaineann sé de thábhacht na teanga i súile an phobail, agus is mór a lagaíonn sé a ndúthracht di, nuair is eol dóibh nach mbíonn sí le cloistéail ach an uair fhánach i dtionóil dhá Theach an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Tógadh an sliocht sin as an Tuarascáil dheiridh de Choimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge a leagadh faoi bhráid na Dála sa bhliain 1965 agus tá sé chomh fiór inniu agus a bhí sé i 1965.  Níl amhras ar bith ná go bhféadfadh na polaiteoirí cuidiú le cúis na teanga dá bhfeicfí iad á labhairt níos minicí.</P>
    <P>Ar leathnach a 7 den Tuarascáil tá liosta de chuid de na céimeanna praiticiúla atá glactha ag an chomhchoiste cheana féin chun eolas agus téarmaí a mhealladh a chuideoidh le Baill moltaí a dhéanamh.  Mar shampla, tá ciorclán eisithe ag na Baill den dá Theach ag iarraidh orthu aon tuairimí praiticúla a bheadh acu a chur in iúl don chomhchoiste. Freisin, tá litreacha curtha ag na hAoirí ar na bpáirtithe párlaiminte agus <Col N="1129" /> ag a lán daoine eile chun tairbhe a gcomhairle a fháil maidir le téarmaí tagartha an chomhchoiste.  Níl amhras ar bith orm ná go mbeidh dea-thoradh ar an obair seo go léir agus go gcuideoidh sé go mór leis an gcoiste maidir leis na fadhbanna atá le sarú acu.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, tá áthas orm go raibh caoi agam cúpla focal a rá sa díospóireacht ar an tuarascáil seo.  Tréasláim le baill go léir an chomhchoiste, go mór mhor na baill ón Teach seo, go speisialta an Seanadóir Flor O'Mahony, an Seanadóir Michael Lynch, an Seanadóir Seán Browne agus an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil a shaol go léir caite ag mo chara, an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún, ag obair ar son chur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus d'fhéadfá an rud céanna a rá faoí Chathaoirleach an chomhchoiste, an Teachta Denis Gallagher.</P>
    <P>Is soiléir go bhfuil an comhchoiste ar an mbóthar ceart.  Cinnte tá turas fada rompu, ach tús maith leath na hoibre. Agus tá tús maith déanta ag an chomhchoiste cheana féin.  Tá moltaí praiticiúla fiúntacha déanta acu in a gcéad tuarascáil. Níl amhras ar bith im aigne ná go mbeidh tionchar ag a gcuid oibre ar úsáid na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>

      <P>Dá mba rud é go raibh an Ghaeilge níos fearr agam ná már atá sé ba mhaith liomsa am a chaitheamh uair éigin ag smaoineamh faoi cad ina thaobh go bhfuil teipithe orainn an teanga a chur chun cinn d'ainneoin an dea-thoil atá léirithe sa tír le 50 bliain anuas.  Gach suirbhé atá déanta, gach rud mar sin a déantar, taispeántar í gcónaí go bhfuil tromlach mór sa tír seo is bhfábhar na teanga, i bhfábhar leathnú na teanga, i bhfábhar leathnú úsáide na teanga agus gach rud, ach ag an am céanna ní tharláionn sé agus nil se ag tariu, agus is e mo thuairim go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga beo i mbaol a báis anois in ainneoin an méid atá déanta ag polaiteoirí agus a lán daoine eile, ach ní inniu atá oiriúnach dá leithéid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoin tuarascáil ón chomhchoiste i dtús báire, tá gearán beag agam agus tá sé <Col N="1130" /> chomh maith domsa é a scaoileadh uaim, is é sin, structúr an chomhchoiste. Tá sé ar cheann de na comhchoistí is lú san Oireachtas ó thaobh ballraíochta de agus i mo thuairimse is mór an trua é sin mar ba chóir go mbeadh sé ar ceann de na comhchoistí atá bunaithe chomh forleathan agus is féidir.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an ballraíocht i bhfad níos mó.  Ach os rud é nach féidir linn a leithéid, ba chóir go mbéadh fiú amháin cead cainte ag gach ball go dteastaíonn uathu, cé nach mbeadh cead vótála aige, ionas go spreagfaí daoine chun páirt a ghlacadh ag plé ceist úsáid na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Ba cheart don chomhchoiste athrú a fháil ar na horduithe seasta atá acu i gcaoi is go mbeidh cead cainte ag baill ar bith de Thithe an Oireachtais a theastaíonn uathu páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireachtaí an chomhchoiste, ach gan cead vótála acu, ionas go mbeidh na díospóireachtaí chomh leathan agus is féidir faoin Ghaeilge agus staid na Gaeilge.  Sin ceann do na ceisteanna is tábhachtaí a bhfuil le plé againn faoi láthair. Muna néiríonn linn, beidh deireadh leis an Ghaeilge taobh istigh de caoga bliain nó mar sin.  Tá sé i mbaol báis anois.</P>
    <P>Seo seans athrú bunúsach a fháil.  Tá a fhios againn an páirt a ghlac an Seanadóir de Brún in athbheochan an cheoil agus dá bhrí sin tá an ceol, a bhí beagnach marbh tríocha bliain ó shin, beo bríomhar anois agus gan aon bhaol faoi.</P>
    <P>Níl sa tuarascáil ach tosach.  Chomh fada agus a théann sé, ní bheidh éinne ábalta cur in a coinne.  Aontaím leis na moltaí atá ann agus tá súil agam go ndéanfear rud éigin fuithi.  I dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge sna Títhe seo, caithfimid smaoineamh beagáinín faoi.  Mar atá ráite, tá cumas labhartha Gaeilge ag daoine éigin, go deimhin ag cuid mhaith de Bhaill na Dála agus an tSeanaid.  Níl dabht ar bith faoi sin ach ní dhéanann siad úsáid di ach focal anois is arís.  Ní dhéanfaimid riamh an méid Gaeilge atá againn a fheabhsú. Tá an cumas againn, tá an dea-thoil againn ach níl an spreagadh againn chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid, in ainneoin an dea-thoil agus chuile rud.  Cén fáth?  Ar an gcéad dul síos, sa Teach seo níl aon <Col N="1131" /> tseirbhís aistriúcháin, agus ó thaobh na hiriseoirí, muna bhfuil Gaeilge acu ní thuigeann siad focal atá ráite, agus muna dtuigtear, caithfimid glacadh nach scríofaidh siad focal.  Mar sin, cé go bhfuil cumas labhartha Gaeilge againn &mdash; duine mar mise, mar shampla &mdash; níl sé go héasca dúinn Gaeilge a úsáid.  Is beag daoine i measc Ball den tá Teach a bhfuil an cumas céanna labhartha Gaeilge acu agus atá acu sa Bhéarla.  Tá cumas labhartha Béarla go maith agamsa, tá an Ghaeilge go reasúnta maith agam, ach tá se níos deacra, agus tá spreagadh ag teastáil uaim agus ó a lán de Bhall an dá Theach chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Tá moltaí raidiciúla agam faoi sin a thabharfaidh an spreagadh sin.  An chéad rud atá riachtanach ná séirbhísí aistriúcháin sa Teach seo; muna bhfuil sé sin againn ní bheidh seans againn agus ní bheidh aon spreagadh againn, agus gan an spreagadh ní dhéanfaimid úsaíd den Ghaeilge.  Caithfimid structúr a fhorbairt chun cabhrú leis an teanga i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Is é a mholfainn féin ná go ndéanfaí athrú ar, mar a thugtar air i mBéarla, Private Members' Time, i gcaoi is go mbeidh seans againn ansin.  Sa Teach seo is ag na Neamhspleáchaí atá Private Members' time agus bhí moltaí againn agus plé aréir againn.  Molaim go mbeadh Private Members' Time san Teach seo againn as Gaeilge.  Bheadh cead againn rud éigin a ardú gan baint aige leis an Ghaeilge ach amháin go mbeadh orainn Gaeilge a úsáid chun an cheist a phlé. Bheadh seans againn ansin dhá rud a ardú ach amháin go mbeadh orainn Gaeilge a úsaíd chun an dara rud a phlé.  Dá mba rud é go mbeadh seans mar sin againn agus go mbeadh spreagadh mar sin ann úsaíd an Ghaeilge uair nó dó sa Teach agus ní chuirfheadh sé isteach ar ár ghnáth gno.</P>
    <P>Baineann an rud céanna le Tráth na gCeist sa Dáil.  Mar shampla, ba cheart go gcuirfí deich noíméad ar leataobh chuile lá do cheisteanna i nGaeilge. Ansin, bheadh sé beagnach cinnte go bhfreagrófaí na ceisteanna sin as Gaeilge agus thabharfadh sé spreagadh do dhaoine ceisteanna a chur síos i nGaeilge. <Col N="1132" /> Ní thógfhadh sé ach deich nóiméad nó ceathrú uair a chloig.  Thabharfadh sé seans iontach do dhaoine Gaeilge a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Sin moladh a chuirim ós comhair ballraíocht an chomhchoiste: go mbeadh Private Members' time as Gaeilge san dá Theach chomh maith leis an ghnáth Private Members' Time ach go mbeadh sé riachtanach ar dhaoine Gaeilge a úsáid agus nach dtabharfaí cead do dhaoine Béarla a úsáid.  Bheadh an cheist go léir pléite as Gaeilge.  Ní bheadh aon deacracht ann ó thaobh Aire Rialtais a bheith i láthair mar tá cuid mhaith díobh a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Dá mba rud é nach raibh Gaeilge ag an Aire freagrach, bheadh Aire eile a raibh Gaeilge aige in ann an job a dhéanamh dó.</P>
    <P>Bheadh rud mar sin níos deacra ar an Rialtas ceart go leor os rud é go mbeadh dhá seans ag an Fhreasúra gach seachtain ceisteanna a chur os comhair an Rialtais. Thaispeánfadh a leithéid dea-thoil don Gaeilge.  Chomh maith thiocfadh líofacht cainte dúinn go léir as an gcleachtadh.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte arís roimh an tuarascáil agus tá súil agam go mbeidh tuarascáil eile againn go luath a bheidh níos doimhne agus níos leithne.  Déanaim comhghairdeas le baill den chomhchoiste agus tá súil agam go n-éiroidh go maith leo.</P>

      <P>Píosa an-bheag atá le rá agam ar an tuarascáil seo.  Tá suim mhór agamsa san Ghaeilge.  Nuair a bhí mé ar scoil bhí múinteóirí maithe agam agus nuair a fhiafraím díom cén fáth nach bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith agam, is dóigh liom nach raibh an timpeallacht ceart, agus cé go bhfuil Gaeltacht in aice liom, i gCeannanus Mór &mdash; Baile Gib, níos giorra ná cúig míle agus Rath Cairn i bhfogus deich míle, dom.  Sna háiteanna sin tá an Ghaeilge á labhairt gach lá.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil deis iontach againn anois mar bhreithimid ar an neantóg.</P>

    <P>Seacht nó ocht mbliain ó shin chríochnaigh mé cúrsa in Gael Linn in gCearnóg Mhuirfean.  Sheas an cúrsa ar feadh trí seachtain gach lá ó Luan go dtí an Aoine ó 6 go dtí a 10 a chlog agus ar an Satharn ón a 10 a chlog go dtí a haon a chlog.  Bhí 20 <Col N="1133" /> daltaí ag an gcúrsa.  Bhí an muinteoir go han-mhaith; cailin ón bhFíor-Ghaeltacht a bhí inti agus suim speisialta ag na daoine go léir.  Sa deireadh, bhí an Ghaeilge go maith agam, agus ba fhiú an t-airgead agus an t-am é.  Taréis sin ní raibh an t-am agam.  Fiafraítear uaim uaireanta cén fáth nach bhfuil an teanga níos fearr agam.  Tá téipeanna Gaeilge agam, tá suim agam sa teanga agus b'fhéidir le himeacht na haimsire go mbeidh mé ag déanamh dul chun cinn le labhairt na teanga.  Léifigh mé píosa beag ón tuarascáil seo ó 1965:</P>
    <P>Ba mhór mar a chuideodh sé leis an teanga náisiúnta a leathadh mar ghnáth-theanga na ndaoine dá mb'eol dóibhsean go raibh an gradam is dual di ag an Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus go raibh sí á húsáid go rialta ina gcuid imeachtaí.  Ar an dtaobh eile de, is mór mar a bhaineann sé de thábhacht na teanga i súile an phobail, agus is mór a lagaíonn sé a ndúthracht dí, nuair is eol dóibh nach mbíonn sí le cloisteáil ach an uair fhánach i dtionóil dhá Theach an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Cloisim an teanga chuile lá sa dá Theach agus ina dtimpeallacht.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a very important subject.  The report is very brief and deals with a specific area &mdash; the use of Irish in Leinster House and in the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad.  That is something with which we would all agree.  Some sensitivity is needed.  As I mentioned previously in this House, on one occasion I discussed the matter with a taxi driver who told me that he had been embarrassed on a number of occasions by people who were over-anxious about the language and insisted on speaking and discussing their business through the medium of Irish.  This never happened to him with any foreign visitor.  While, I agree it is important and essential for the language that we use it on every occasion possible, that situation should be considered. We should go to some pains to make sure that in the use of the language we do not embarrass anyone.  I am sure that that taxi driver was as enthusiastic <Col N="1134" /> about the use of the Irish language as I was but was embittered that he had been put in the situation where his knowledge of the spoken language was not sufficient and that somebody who was over-enthusiastic embarrassed him.  There is a moral in that for everybody.</P>
    <P>It is not out of order to say in passing that a serious mistake must have been made a long time ago after the foundation of this State.  We had every opportunity to revive the language as the spoken language of the people.  We had Gaeltacht areas where Irish was the spoken language. I do not disagree with the decision to plant areas of the country with people from the Gaeltacht areas.  I welcome them.  In County Meath they have played a very important part.  Nevertheless the Gaeltacht areas have shrunk.  To all appearances the Irish language will never be the spoken language of this country again.  We must face the situation fairly and squarely.  In spite of heroic work done by so many people the signs are not good.</P>
    <P>Industries should have been established in the areas where Irish was the spoken language and attempts should have been made to improve the way of life of the people in those areas without plucking them out of their culture and background and placing them in an oasis where, by and large, it is very difficult to retain the language.  They are fighting a losing cause and need every assistance, financial and otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have not retained the beautiful Irish place names. This report deals with a specific matter but I do not think I am out of order in referring to that in passing.  The Ordnance Survey have done a wonderful job in preserving our place names as regards townlands and other places.  Unfortunately, the names we have retained are not the original Irish ones.  They are a conglomoration or mixture of some kind of unfortunate assimilation of the old place names.  It was unfortunate that when the survey was carried out between 1825 and 1836 a decision was not made to retain the old Irish place names.  It is not too late to do it.  The maps have been <Col N="1135" /> revised and a serious effort should be made to do so.  It was unfortunate that when the Ordnance Survey was carried out from 1825-36 a decision was not made to retain one old Irish place name.  Many of them that are not townland names have been lost.  In selecting place names for housing schemes it is unfortunate that we seem to be departing from names that our culture and tradition would suggest. Some kind of broad outline by the Minister for the Environment to local authorities would help in this regard.  Irish could be used more in places of worship also.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I attended an intensive Irish course organised by Gael-Linn seven or eight years ago.  It was a marvellous course run by very committed people.  Those who took part were very dedicated.  An intensive Irish course should be organised for Members of the Oireachtas.  The course I attended was for a period of three weeks.  I do not see any reason why courses could not be organised for a longer period.  I have no doubt, with the experience I had in that course, that at the end of those courses those taking part would be very competent to come into this House and speak through the medium of Irish.  The commitment is there.  Consideration should be given to the length of time necessary for people at different stages and at different levels.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment to seriously consider holding such courses.  I have no doubt that they would assist in a major way the use of Irish in the proceedings of these Houses.</P>
    <P>Time is a problem for many people, particularly as we get on in years.  In my own case, it is of some assistance that I try to give help to my children.  In this way many of us are kept in touch against our will with the Irish language.</P>
    <P>We have a very fine staff in our Library. No words of mine would be adequate to pay tribute to the hard work, dedication and courtesy of the staff.  I would like to suggest that additional staff should be engaged in the Library to help Members who have a problem in the use of the <Col N="1136" /> Irish language.  One additional officer would be sufficient.  It would be very helpful for someone like myself, who has a problem coming into this House on such an important discussion and anxious to make a meaningful contribution, if there was somebody I could go to who would give me the help and advice that is necessary.</P>
    <P>This is a brief and very important report.  I hope all the matters previously mentioned, including signs in the House and use of the language, will be taken into consideration.  I look forward to the next occasion when the second report will be discussed.  I have no doubt it will be longer and more comprehensive.  It might be possible to include with it a translation. If the Minister does something along the lines I suggest on the next occasion many more Members will contribute to the debate, which could be totally in Irish.</P>

      <P>Ní bheidh mórán le rá agamsa ar an ábhar seo toisc nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge agam.  Is fada an lá a raibh cleachta agam ag caint as Gaeilge. Freisin, tá an chuid is mó a bhfuil le rá agam ráite cheana.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis na Seanadóirí a bhí ag caint agus sílim nach gá domsa a rá arís na rudaí atá ráite acu.  Caithfidh mé comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an chomhchoiste as ucht an tuarascáil seo.  Is tuarascáil gearr agus is tuarascáil chiallmhar í.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Seanadoír Seán Browne agus dúirt sé gur rud maith cúntas gearr a bheith ann.  Dúirt sé gur éasca leathanacha agus leathanacha agus leathanacha a chur os comhair na Seanadóirí anseo gan morán céille ann agus gan morán rudai ciallmhara ráite faoi.  Is maith liom bheith ag déanamh iarracht &mdash; cé gur iarracht lag é &mdash; labhairt anseo ar an ócáid stairiúil seo. Aontaím le gach rud atá ráite san tuarascáil. Deirtear ar leathanach a 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhór mar a chuideordh sé leis an teanga náisiúnta a leathadh mar ghnáth-theanga na ndaoine dá mb'eol dóibhsean go raibh an gradam is dual di ag an Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus go raibh sí á húsáid go rialta ina <Col N="1137" /> gcuid imeachtaí.  Ar an dtaobh eile de, is mór mar a bhaineann sé de thábhact na teanga i súile an phobail, agus is mór a lagíonn sé a ndúthracht di, nuair is eol dóibh nach mbíonn si le cloisteáil ach an uair fhánach i dtionóil dhá Theach an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Is ceart go mbeadh na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí Dála san &ldquo;gcéad líne&rdquo; mar a déarfá sa ghluaiseacht chun an teanga a athbheochaint agus a chur mar gnáththeanga na tíre arís más féidir é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Molaim an chaoi a rinne an comhchoiste a gcuid oibre.  Scríobhadar litreacha chuig gach duine a bheadh in ann cuidiú leo san obair.  Rinne siad a ndicheall gach rud ceart a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>I agree with this report.  It is a very sensible short report and everything that is necessary is in it.  I congratulate the people who brought out this report because they have done a very great service with regard to the question of what importance the general public may attach to the deliberations of this House&mdash;I say this House rather than the Dáil &mdash; in regard to what they may do or say.  Only this morning &mdash; I do not know if anybody else was listening&mdash;I was listening to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and when the announcer was concluding he gave a list of events for the day.  He mentioned that Dáil Éireann was meeting today.  He did not even think it worth while to mention that Seanad Éireann was also meeting.  I do not know if he knew Seanad Éireann was meeting.  He should have known.  If he knew it is a greater shame that he did not think it worth while to relate that to us.  However, it is necessary for us to do our best to give a lead to the general public.  We are expected to be in a position to give a lead.</P>
    <P>Senator de Brún mentioned the possibility of having a special room in the House.  It would be an excellent idea if we could have a room where people who are interested in Irish could meet and talk and those of us who have only a very small knowledge of Irish could improve our knowledge.  It is a harrowing experience to speak in public in any language. <Col N="1138" /> If you have only a very weak knowledge of Irish it is certainly an heroic effort to get up and speak in Irish, particularly on a subject where the general public expect you to be an expert.  It is very hard to convey, in a language with which you are not terribly familiar, the true meaning and the true gist of what you want to say with accuracy.</P>
    <P>Something which was always held in awe in my days was the fact that far too much emphasis was laid on Irish grammar. A number of people could speak Irish but were not grammatically correct. Thousands of foreigners come into this country and they speak English.  They may not speak it 100 per cent correct grammatically but they are able to make themselves understood.  We are able to understand what they have to say and they are able to understand what we have to say to them.  Something like this should be adopted with regard to the Irish language whereby we would be able to make our thoughts known to people irrespective of whether or not we were 100 per cent grammatically correct.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been said about signs throughout the House.  They could probably be as well understood in Irish as in English.  We could gradually increase our knowledge and use of the Irish language.  I note that last week Dublin Corporation announced that they will conduct as much of their business through the medium of Irish as they can and they hope in the not too distant future to conduct their business completely in Irish.  That is a formidable task for them. I believe it will take some time before they will be able to deal with all the intricacies, when they are budgeting for different services and going into detail. However, it is a step in the right direction. If a local authority can agree to conduct part of their business at least through the medium of Irish, it is not asking too much that the House of the Oireachtas should equally be able to do at least as well, if not better.  I congratulate the people who compiled this report and I wish it well.</P>

      <P>Níl mise ar an gcomhcoiste Gaeilge ach, mar sin féin, cuirim fáilte roimh an tuarascáil seo atá os ár gcomhair inniu.</P>
      <P>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an tuarascáil seo ró-mhór ach, mar sin féin, is í seo an chéad tuarascáil agus is maith an rud é a fheiceáil.  Ní raibh aon fhocail Gaeilge le cloisint in aon chomhairle contae lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, ach, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Belton, bhí cruinniú de Bhardas Bhaile Átha Cliath an tseachtain seo agus trí Ghaeilge amháin a rinneadh an gnó.  Creidim go bhfuil go leor Gaeilge ag na comhairlí contae chun an rud céanna a dhéanamh iontú.  Sa Seanad anois, de thoradh chúram an Rialtais, tá an tseirbhís sin lán de Ghaeilgeoirí agus eolas maith acu a chuirfeadh ar a gcumas a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh i nGaeilge da mba ghá dóibh é.  Sí an cheist atá agamsa anois ar an Rialtas gur mithid scrudú iomlán a dhéanamh feasta ar staid na gluaiseachta i láthair na huaire, ar na torthaí atá le fáil ón saothar a deineadh le 60 bliain, agus ón eolas a gheobhfar as an scrúdú agus an léirmheas sin céim nua ar aghaidh a thabhairt in obair na hathbheochana.  Is féidir a rá gur ullmhúcháin í an obair atá déanta go dtí seo agus na torthái atá le fáil aisti don lá nuair a thabharfar iarracht ar an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh in ionad údaráis agus in ionaid Rialtais chun gnó an phobail a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tuarascáil seo. I would welcome the opportunity of the House having more debates in Irish so that we can all practice and keep the language alive.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím go mór roimh an tuarascáil seo agus ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas agus ardmholadh a thabhairt don chomhchoiste.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go maith leis an obair agus go mbeidh níos mó Gaeilge in úsáid sa tSeanad, sa Dáil agus ar fud na tíre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish is our national language, but it is not frequently used.  I should be ashamed to admit that I am not good at Irish, but in the environment I was brought up in, English was the spoken language.  Irish <Col N="1140" /> was taught in schools.  In our youth we did not pay as much attention to the learning of Irish as we now recognise we should have.  I am sure the same is prevailing today.  There was more Irish used in schools some years ago than there is today.  All the subjects were taught through Irish, which is not happening at the moment.  I read a report from some organisation involved in promoting Irish.  They gave percentages which showed that less Irish is spoken now than 20 or 30 years ago.  As it is our national language I feel we should do everything possible to ensure that that is corrected and that we have more Irish spoken.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the joint committee on producing this report.  It is something that we should take note of and try to use more Irish in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I note that in the report they feel the difficulties which must be overcome should be tackled on a planned basis and progress made in stages.  It is good that they recommend that progress be made in stages.  Progress can only be made in easy stages.  Many of the Members of this House are not fluent Irish speakers, but we do our best.  We might not be terribly fluent in the English language either, which is the spoken language of this country.  We should make an effort to speak Irish as often as possible.</P>
    <P>The report states that people with a proficiency in Irish need to be persuaded to use it and that it could be achieved by creating a suitable ambience in the House.  If such an ambiance were created it is felt that many people would not be reluctant to speak Irish.  It is a very important point in the report that if the people with fluent Irish spoke it more often they would encourage the people with less Irish to use it and probably improve their Irish.  There are organisations very much involved in the promotion of the Irish language who use it as often as possible.  But these organisations should also be encouraged to use it even more.  If people with a poor knowledge of Irish make mistakes in conversation it should not deter them from using the Irish language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> The Action Plan for Irish, 1983-1986, referred to the State.  It said:</P>
    <P>Regretfully it must again be recorded that satisfactory progress is not being made in regard to Irish programmes on television, although RTE is to be highly commended for its radio service.</P>
    <P>Television should be a great means of promoting the Irish language and there should be better use made of it.  That is something the Minister for the Gaeltacht should convey to the Minister responsible, the Minister for Communications. Television is definitely a great means of communicating Irish especially to the youth and to the people anxious to hear it and anxious to learn it.  I again welcome the report and congratulate the members of the committee for presenting it to us.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm a bheith anseo inniu agus ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis na Seanadóirí as ucht an suim atá acu agus atá léirithe acu san ábhar seo.  Ghlac naoi Sheanadóir páirt san díospóireacht seo, an chuid is mó díobh as Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom a rá go deimhin gur chuir Seanadóirí anseo ionadh orm leis an líofacht a bhí acu sa Ghaeilge.  Ní gá d'aon duine sa Teach seo bheith náireach nó leithscéal a ghabháil as ucht úsaid a bhaint as Beárla ar a leithéid d'ócáid.  Sé an rud atá le rá ansin ná dá mbeadh daoine sásta úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá acu ar ócáidí den tsaghas seo agus, go deimhin, ar ócáidí eile, bheadh athrú ar an scéal.  Táim cinnte go mbeadh cuid mhór den fhadhb atá againn faoi láthair maidir le Gaeilge réitithe againn dá ndéanfadh daoine an rud atá déanta anseo maidin inniu i Seanad Éireann ag na Seanadóirí.  Tréaslaim leo agus gabhaim buíochas leo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fhios againn gur bunaíodh an comhchoiste seo i ndeireadh na bliana 1984 agus go deimhin is trí thairiscint sa Teach seo a tháínig sé i bhfeidhm an chéad lá. Sibhse anseo a mhol é seo agus tháinig an chomhchoiste ar an saol.  Tá dhá rud <Col N="1142" /> tábhachtach ag baint leis na téarmai tagartha atá ag an gcomhchoiste &mdash; sé sin go mbeidh úsáid na Gaeilge á leathnú taobh istigh de Thithe an Oireachtas, uimhir a haon; agus, uimhir a dó, go ndéanfaidh an chomhchoiste iarracht rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi cheist na Gaeilge agus úsáid na Gaeilge i gcoitinne a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tá an chéad tuarascáil againn agus aontaím leis an gcoiste go bhfuil an ceart acu díriú ar Thithe an Oireachtais i dtús báire, mar sin é an áit gur féidir rud éigin a dheánamh láithreach.  Bhí an ceart acu chomh maith tagairt a dhéanamh don sliocht ó Choimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge san réamhrá don tuarascáil. San sliocht sin dúirt an coimisiún, os cionn scór bliain ó shin, rud atá chomh fíor inniu is a bhí sé an t-am sin &mdash; nach raibh tada níos fearr ná an dea-shampla, agus dá dtabharfadh daoine ó Thithe an Oireachtais dea-shampla do mhuintir na tíre le chéile go bhféadfaí meoín na ndaoine i leith na Gaeilge a athrú agus é sin a dhéanamh go hantapaidh.</P>
    <P>Mar sin aontaím leis an tuairim a bhí ag an gcomhchoiste go mba cheart díriú ar an aidhm sin láithreach agus atmaisféar an Tí a athrú chomh fada agus is feidir ó atmaisféar Gaeilge-Gallda go dtí atmaisféar Gaelach.  Tá &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; thíos ansin ar an mballa ach, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Browne, d'fhéadfaí rudaí beaga cosúil le &ldquo;Item No. 1, Report,&rdquo; a cur in airde ar na scáileáin ar fud an Tí. D'fheicfeadh cuairteoirí é sin, d'fheicfeadh muintir an Tí é agus i ngan fhiosdóibh fein, fiú amháin, bheadh a meoin agus a n-intinní dírithe ar an Ghaeilge mar theanga bheo; mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún, an teanga atá ann, a bhí ann agus, le cúnamh Dé, a bheas ann má dhéanaimid an rud ceart.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht bríomhar ann nuair a bhí ceist an chomhchoiste agus an tairiscint seo á bplé anseo.  Ag éisteacht anseo inniu bhí mé ag smaoineamh ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta go deimhin san achar gearr sin, fiú amháin maidir le Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Níl mé ag cur milleán dá laghad <Col N="1143" /> ar an gcomhchoiste nó ar chomhaltaí an chomhchoiste, ach ba mhaith liom a rá nach bhfuil cuid de na moltaí curtha i gcion nach bhfuil móran deacrachta ag baint leo.  Tá a fhios agam go dtógann sé am rudaí faoi leith a dhéanamh, ach suaitheantais agus rudaí mar sin as Gaeilge, tá sé thar am iad sin a athrú.  Tá súil agam go bhfeicfear &ldquo;cuairteoir&rdquo; ar lipéad cuairteora sa Teach seo roimh i bhfad.  Go deimhin, ní thuigim cén fáth nár dearnadh é sin an chéad lá, ach sin ceist eile.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tá treoracha thart ar an Teach, oifigí faoí leith, go mba cheart na focail a bheith as Gaeilge, mar atá ar oifig an Chathaoirligh agus oifig an Leas-Chathaoirligh taobh amuigh den seomra seo.  D'fhéadfaí chuile chomhartha a chur i nGaeilge agus, más gá, comhartha míniúcháin a chur leis.  De réir a chéile bhuailfí isteach ar mheoin agus ar intinní daoine gur teanga bheo í an Ghaeilge, go bhfuil sí in úsáid, agus go mba cheart go mbeadh sí in úsáid níos mó.  Maidir le Tithe an Oireachtais agus na h-oifigí ann is cuma an nglacaimid leis nó nach nglacaimid leis, tá muintir na hÉireann ag breathnú orainn lá i ndhiaidh lae ag caint fuínn, ag cleamhsán fúinn, ag gearán fúinn, agus corr dhuine ár moladh anois is arís ach tá siad ag caint fúinn ar aon nós, ag breathnú orainn agus aon rud a dhéanaimid, a deirimid, tá aitheantas á thabhairt dó ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile.</P>
    <P>Tá tuairimí an choimisiúin os cionn scór bliain ó shin chomh fírinneach anois agus a bhí siad an t-am sin: má fheiceann daoine ón taobh amuigh &mdash; mar a deirtear, the average punter, cé hé nó cé hí an gnáth dhuine &mdash; go bhfuil muintir an Tí seo agus na Dála i ndairíre faoin Ghaeilge, go dtabharfaidh siad aitheantas dó sin agus go ndéanfaidh siadsan iarracht an dea-shampla a ghlacadh uainn agus a n-iarracht féin a dhéanamh. Táim cinnte go dtarlóidh sin.  Is trua é nach raibh muintir na hÉireann ag breathnú maidin inniu ar an rud a tharla sa Teach seo le cúpla uair a chloig, daoine a chuir alltacht orm, an-ionadh orm go raibh Gaeilge chomh líofa acu.  Táim cinnte <Col N="1144" /> go bhfuil sé sin fíor i gcás a lán nár labhair Gaeilge inniu, toisc nach raibh deis acu.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir Dooge, Ceannaire an Tí, thug sé cúlra dúinn ar na tuarascálacha a foilsíodh le 20 bliain anuas agus roimhe sin.  Anois, tá tuarascail an chomhchoiste againn.  Is é an rud is fearr, dar liomsa, go bhfuil comhchoiste againn.  Tá an tuarascáil gearr, ach mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Belton, tá sé ciallmhar.  Go deimhin, nuair a bhí an Seanadóir Dooge ag caint ar maidin bhí leabhair agus tuairiscí toirtiúla aige, a lán rudaí ann.  Dá bhféadfaí na rudaí sin a chur i bhfeidhm bheadh níos mó déanta ar son na Gaeilge sa Teach seo ná mar a bhí molta sna tuairisci toirtiúla a bhí ag an Seanadóir ar maidin.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadoir Kiely, is de réir a chéile is féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá an Seanadóir Séamus de Brún ag plé le Gaeilge níos faide ná a lán daoine sa Teach seo agus ag plé le rudaí Gaelacha chomh maith.  Cuireann sé áthas orm i gcónaí bheith ag éisteacht leis toisc a líofacht Gaeilge.  Is maith liom Gaeilge líofa a chloisteáil anois is arís, rud nach bhfuil agam féin.  Cuireann sé an-bród orm éisteacht le duine cosúil leis an Seanadóir de Brún.  Tá a dhóthain déanta aige ar son na ceiste seo agus ar son ar gcultúir agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil tada faighte aige as mar is iarracht ar son na hÉireann atá déanta aige.  Mar a dúirt sé, tá an tuarascáil gearr ach tá an míniú ann. Dúirt sé go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint leis, nach dtuigeann polaiteoirí agus daoine eile i mbéal an phobail an tábhacht a bhaineann le úsáid na Gaeilge ar ócáidí poiblí, ag dinnéir, ag cluichí peile nó ag aon tabhairt amach eile, áiteanna ina bhfuil slua daoine bailithe le chéile.  Sa chuid is mó de na cásanna ní smaoiníonn daoine ar chúpla focal a rá, nó leath óráid a dhéanamh as Gaeilge mar nílimíd ag smaoineamh ar rudaí mar sin.</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil thart orainn bheadh sé i gcónaí os ar gcomhair agus ní dhéanfaimís dearmad air.  Bheadh sé á úsáid go nadúrtha againn nuair a bheadh deis againn.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Browne go mba iontach an rud é da bhféadfaimís dul chun cinn a <Col N="1145" /> dhéanamh go pointe go bhféadfaí athrú ó Bhéarla go Ghaeilge agus ar ais arís go nádurtha, go ndéanfai é gan smaoineamh air.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mise i Roinn eile bhí an teacht agus imeacht agam, ag dul amach go dtí an Bhruiséal agus áiteanna eile agus, go deimhin, tá an Seanadóir McDonald anseo, fear a bhfuil an chuid ama caite aige ag taisteal ar an mbealach céanna, agus tá mé cinnte go raibh an taithí céanna aige siúd.  Chuala sé daoine ón nGearmáin, ón Fhrainc, daoine go raibh an dá theanga acu.  Bhí siad ábalta athrú ó cheann go ceann go nádúrtha. Bhraith sé ar cén áit a raibh siad agus cé leis a raibh siad ag caint ach bhí siad in ann Béarla a labhairt, nó Fraincis nó Gearmáinis go nádúrtha.  Ní &ldquo;big deal&rdquo; é, mar adéarfá, seo a dhéanamh.  Is rud nádúrtha é.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Browne go raibh ceist na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais rí-thábhachtach mar dhea-shampla.  Lig dom dul ar ais arís don rud adúirt mé faoi nádúracht na Gaeilge mar mheán chumharsáide.  Thug seisean sampla anmhaith, cheap mé, go raibh sé féin ag caint sa Teach seo ar ábhar eile, ní ábhar a bhain leis an nGaeilge ar chor ar bith agus chuir sé iontas ar dhaoine a cheapann nach féidir úsáid a bhaint as Gaeilge ag plé cúrsaí eacnamaíochta, foraoiseachta nó a leithéid &mdash; rud seafóideach ar ndóigh.  Taispeánann sé sin an meon atá ag daoine, an cinéal bac atá ar intinn daoine glacadh leis gur teanga bheo í an Ghaeilge, gur féidir í a úsáid agus tú ag plé aon ábhar is mian leat ar domhan agus sin sampla a thug seisean chun a thaispeáint dúinn ceann de na deacrachtaí eile a bhaineann le dul chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt eile do rud a thaispeánann domsa go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh.  Is fíorchorr-uair a chloisfeá go raibh, abair, obair chomhairle á plé i nGaeilge i gcruinniú poiblí de chomhairleoirí ach de réir a chéile tá sé sin ag teacht chun cinn trí éachtaí Bhord na Gaeilge, Chonradh na Gaeilge agus na heagrais atá amuigh ansin ag brú ar dhaoine an Ghaeilge a úsáid.  Cé déarfadh, cur i gcás, go mbeadh cruinniú de Chomhairle <Col N="1146" /> na Cathrach i nGaeilge, rud a bhí ann an tseachtain seo, agus tá dul chun cinn suntasach á dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir Brendan Ryan, a bhfuil líofacht aige i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge, chuir seisean moltaí os comhair an Tí.  Dúirt sé go raibh an teanga i mbaol báis.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin fior inniu.  Tá comharthaí le feiceáil anois nach bhfuil muintir na tire sásta an Ghaeilge a ligint uatha agus í a chur faoin talamh.  Bhí gearán faoin gcoiste aige go mba cheart cead cainte a bheith ag aon duine a raibh suim aige teacht isteach ag an comhchoiste agus suí síos.  Sin ceist don chomhchoiste féin agus tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh aon Bhall den Teach seo a d'iarrfadh cead teacht os comhair an chomhchoiste le tuairimí a phlé nach gcuirfí aon bhac air é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an moladh a bhí aige go ndéanfaí gnó príobháideach as Gaeilge agus go mbeadh sé éigeantach, b'iontach an rud dá mbeadh gnó príobháideach. Ní thiocfainn leis go mbeadh ar dhaoine Gaeilge a labhairt mar cheapfainn go mb'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé sin drochmhisneach ar dhaoine páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireacht dá leithéid.</P>
    <P>Bhain an Seanadóir Belton úsáid as leagan cainte amháin agus dúirt, nuair atá duine ag labhairt i dteanga nach teanga theaghlaigh í &ldquo;that it's an heroic effort&rdquo; agus sin é an rud atá déanta aige féin inniu agus ag daoine cosúil leis, &ldquo;heroic effort&rdquo;.  Anois muna bhfuil daoine sa Teach seo ábalta páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireacht agus a gcuid tuairimí a chur i gcion go láidir ó thaobh na polaitíochta de, nach shin é ceann de na cúiseanna a ghlacann daoine páirt i ndíospóireachtaí sa Teach seo?  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé ceart bac a chur orthu ag rá &ldquo;Féach, ní feidir leat ach Gaeilge a labhairt fad atá tú sa Teach seo&rdquo;.  Dob iontach an rud dá ndéanfaí é sin ach go mbeadh cead ag daoine é a mheascadh go nádurtha agus, mar adúirt an Seanadóir Belton &ldquo;heroic effort&rdquo; a dhéanamh más féidir leo ar son na Gaeilge.  Ní thiocfainn leis an dtuairim go mba cheart éigeantacht a bheith ann maidir leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> Tá líofacht cainte ag an Seanadóir Fitzsimons agus duine de na Seanadóirí a cheap mise go raibh dáiríreacht ann, fear a chaith a chuid airgid agus a chuid ama ag iarraidh snas agus feabhas a chur ar a chuid Gaeilge, agus ag an am céanna fear a labhair i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. B'iontach an rud é sa tír seo dá mbeimís ábalta chuile rud ó mhaidin go hoíche a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Ní dóigh liom go dtarlódh sé sin.  Ach d'fhéadfaimís an dátheangachas a thabhairt ar aghaidh go dtí pointe go mbeadh an dá theanga ar aon chéim agus go bhféadfadh muintir na tíre seo úsáid a bhaint as Gaeilge agus Béarla go nádúrtha, go mbeadh líofacht acu sa dá theanga mar atá i dtiortha eile a bhfuil dhá-theangachas i réim iontu, agus dá bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh is daoine cosúil leis an Seanadóir Fitzsimons ad'fhéadfadh óráid ar fad a dhéanamh i nGaeilge ach mar sin féin dúirt sé &ldquo;Look, ní dóigh liom go mbéinn ábalta an rud ar fad a dhéanamh&rdquo;&mdash; daoine mar sin go mbeadh an gnáth-dhuine in ann an deashampla a ghlacadh uathu agus an rud céanna a dhéanamh.  Sin é an cineál rud be cheart dúinn díriú air.</P>
    <P>Maidir le foireann bhreise sa Leabharlann, níl freagracht fóirne an Tí seo faoi mo chúram ach glac uaim go mbeidh mé i dteangmháil le muintir an Tí agus déarfaidh mé leo go dtáinig an moladh sin ar aghaidh nuair a bhí an díospóireacht seo ar siúl agus go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfaí duine nó daoine a fháil sa Leabharlann a bheadh in ánn cúnamh agus cabhair a thabhairt do dhaoine a bhfuil suim acu rudaí mar seo a phlé as Gaeilge, agus, go deimhin is daoine iad lucht na Leabharlainne a bhí agus atá i gcónaí sásta aon chabhair gur féidir leo a thabhairt do Bhaill Thithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir Belton, ag éisteacht leis siúd dá mbeadh daoine sa Teach seo sásta an meíd a rinne seisean inniu a dhéanamh tá leath na faidhbe réitithe agus sin cuid mhór in achar anbheag. Maidir leis an Seanadóir McDonald is féidir an rud céanna a rá, fear nach bhfuil aon bhaint aige leis an Ghaeltacht, fear atá i lár na tíre, machaire méith na <Col N="1148" /> tíre seo, ach atá sásta seasamh suas agus an &ldquo;heroic effort&rdquo; a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus job an-mhaith a dhéanamh de agus fear a bheidh sásta feabhas a chur air féin dá mbeadh na háiseanna ann.</P>
    <P>Is de réir a chéile, mar adúirt an Seanadóir Kiely, gur féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh agus rinne seisean tagairt don teilifís agus d'iarr sé ormsa an bhfeadfainn dul i dteangmháil leis an Aire Cumarsáide.  Ba mhaith liom a rá le Seanadóirí go bhfuilim i dteangmháil leis an Aire Cumarsáide, go bhfuil coiste bunaithe againn idir mé féin, an Roinn Cumarsáide agus RTE féachaint céard is féidir a dhéanamh feabhas a chur ar úsáid na Gaeilge in RTE.  An uair dheiridh a bhí mé anseo rinne mé gearán géar nach raibh a gcion féin á fháil ag Gaeilgeoirí na tíre ó RTE.  Tá feabhas tagtha ar an scéal, feabhas tagtha ar an saghas cláir agus méid na gclár atá á gcraoladh anois ach is féidir feabhas i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh agus tá coiste ag plé na ceiste seo agus beidh mise ag fanacht le toradh na cainte sin amach anseo agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh suim ag Seanadóirí san méid a bheas le rá ag an gcoiste sin.</P>
    <P>Arís tá mé ag ceapadh gurb é an Seanadóir Seámus de Brún a rinne tagairt don áis a bheith ann agus gurbh iontach an rud é da mbeadh seomra faoi leith, cuir i gcás, go mbeadh téipeanna agus téipthaifeadáin le fáil agus go mbeadh áit faoi leith sa Tí seo a d'fhéadfadh Comhaltaí an Tí tarraingt air, suí síos, Gaeilge a phlé, Gaeilge a úsáid agus feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge féin san am céanna. Rachaidh mé i dteangmháil leis na húdaráis anseo faoi sin féachaint an féidir a leithéid d'áis a chur ar fáil agus tá mé cinnte go mbeadh daoine cosúil le Bord na Gaeilge agus na heagrais Ghaeilge sásta comhairle agus cúnamh a thabhairt i leith an ruda seo chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís tréaslú leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil baill an chomhchoiste atá ag obair go dian agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh dul deimhin, tá mé cinnte go mbeidh dul <Col N="1149" /> chun cinn feiceálach ann sar i bhfad, rud atá ann anois fiú amháin.</P>

      <P>I made a rather lengthy contribution last Thursday and my contribution will be brief today.  I made the lengthy contribution, not because I felt I had anything special to contribute or any special insight but because it was the only tangible way in which I could show my concern in this area, particularly as I was a member of <Col N="1150" /> that hardworking committee.  I pointed out that in this report the committee dealt with areas brought to their notice.  There were notices in the papers at the start.  In response to an appeal for submissions 132 submissions were made, which was quite a considerable number.  But, as I pointed out on the last occasion, unfortunately some missed out.  This was rather a pity because in that kind of situation, where appeals are made through the media, only the best organised groups will respond.</P>
      <P>For many groups to make a submission involves considerable time and considerable expense and I suppose they have to come to some decision about whether it is worth while.  I would hope all of them, when the matter is brought to their attention, would feel it is important and well worthwhile making a submission to this committee.</P>
      <P>When I attended the meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I made the case that, in looking for submissions in this way, perhaps some people are missed out and I thought it would be a good idea to write to all the organisations which the committee felt would be interested.  I am glad to say the committee agreed to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas I felt was missed out on the last occasion was that of the unmarried parent.  This was unfortunate. Two of the organisations which are concerned &mdash; I am sure there are others &mdash; are the Federation of Services for the Unmarried Parents and their Children and Cherish.  These are two organisations which do very important work.  It was a great pity we had no submission from them particularly having regard to the negative comments in the media over the past few weeks.  These comments were unfortunate and ill-founded.  While we all agree that there are social problems in this area, we would be better to concern ourselves with the elimination of these problems.  Certainly, mud-slinging is no way to address the problem &mdash; I should like to refer briefly to the situation as I see it as the Minister is here and will be replying.  I feel the unmarried parent situation is a transient state and it is <Col N="1151" /> unfortunate that no statistics are available either to prove or disprove this. It seems the unmarried parent is not a switched-on state of women alone &mdash; men are involved.  While I do realise that many people have made the claim that the unmarried mother situation may be a way of life nevertheless, I do not believe that love has lost all its meaning.  I do not believe that behind most of those situations there are not broken hearts.  That would be my great concern, the individuals who are involved.</P>
    <P>We have been told on a number of occasions that it is a way of life for some people.  I agree that the numbers are sufficient to cause concern regarding teenagers who see this as the only way of getting an identity.  I believe that at present this is the only way to qualify for an independent State allowance under 18 years of age.  There is no other entitlement. There are many people, I believe, who would get married but are better off in the unmarried status.  Certainly they are far better off than if they get married to unemployed husbands.</P>
    <P>I gave figures on the last occasion for illegitimate births.  Some people would prefer to use some other word rather than &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and I would agree with them.  However, under that heading from 1973 to 1984 there were 40,297 illegitimate births.  The adoption orders for that period amounted to 14,578 which left a balance of 25,719.  Of that number only 10,307 are now getting the allowance &mdash; only 40 per cent.  It seems that number of those categorised under &ldquo;unmarried parent&rdquo; may be broken up roughly into three categories; those who get married after the birth of the child; a significant number who are working and cannot claim the unmarried parent's allowance because their income would be over £64 per week.  We know that to qualify for this allowance the income should be under £12 and that above that figure the applicant losses out, pound for pound. Then we have those cohabiting who would not qualify.</P>
    <P>The statistics may also show that in that category there would be many concerned <Col N="1152" /> people who would be living up to their responsibility and who for one reason or another, either because of the commitment to marriage being for life or for some other reasons may not want to undertake to get married.  The hard facts for 1983 prove that the unmarried mothers were cohabiting for at least a year or more before the birth of their child.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot recently regarding the unmarried mothers who were evicted. This got considerable media coverage.  I believe that the evictions had nothing whatever to do with being an unmarried mother.  I made a plea on the last occasion regarding suitable housing for one-parent families and small families and this is something that should be looked at.  In any event, I do not see in this any threat to the traditional family.  I also hear on the radio and read in the papers the emotive term &ldquo;milking the system&rdquo;.  I believe people who are entitled to a benefit of one kind or another, many of them with children, should make sure they get everything they are entitled to. The majority of them are unemployed for the simple reason that work is not available.  It is very wrong to use that emotive term &ldquo;milking the system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report states that people who are entitled to benefit should get information from a booklet of one kind or another. Perhaps the social welfare booklets which are very comprehensive would be considered suitable and perhaps the Minister would make arrangements so that everybody who might apply for benefit would get one of those booklets.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the very many voluntary organisations whose members give their time freely without pay of any kind.  Perhaps if copies of those booklets were forwarded to those organisations they could be distributed where they are most required.</P>
    <P>On the last day I apologised for my record of attendance at the meetings.  I found it very difficult to take part in the affairs of this House and to attend the meetings as most of them were held on Wednesdays.  I have to pay a great tribute <Col N="1153" /> to all the members who attended so many meetings and did such a thorough job.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the EC equality legislation and that is covered in the report.  I hope the Minister will take some action in this regard because it is not good enough simply to say that the staff is not available.  If we are obliged by equality legislation to do something specific, it is no excuse to say we cannot do so because of a staff shortage.</P>
    <P>There is a specific section on means testing.  This is a very sensitive area for many people, people for whom a small amount may mean the difference between starvation and life.  The Minister should act in this regard.  A suggestion was made that means testing should be carried out in a uniform manner.  This is of critical importance.  At present we are told different criteria are laid down for different payments.  The members decided that the Department of Social Welfare should consider training a corps of people to become expert in means testing, with a view to introducing a uniform system of means testing.</P>
    <P>The report referred to the term &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; and suggested that it was not the best description; it suggested that perhaps the term &ldquo;abandoned spouse&rdquo; would be better.  Senator O'Brien questioned whether there would be any improvement with that term and I am afraid I would have to agree with him. It does, I suppose, get away from the description of a female as a &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo;; the &ldquo;abandoned spouse&rdquo; could mean either a man or a woman.  I do not think it is very much of an improvement. Certainly, I would agree with the suggestion that the letters &ldquo;DW&rdquo; should not be used on the correspondence from the Department.</P>
    <P>In the <i>National Report of Ireland</i>, which was published last July, there is one very short paragraph towards the end which I would like to quote.  It says:</P>
    <P>Ministers should be exhorted to seek out and appoint at least one, and preferably more, women to boards under their aegis each time vacancies arise. Each Minister should set a target for <Col N="1154" /> an increased proportion of women to be appointed to the public bodies for which they are responsible.  Nominating bodies should be encouraged by Ministers to include women nominees. A Public Appointments Unit should be considered.</P>
    <P>I wonder if any action has been taken in that regard or is it like my contribution &mdash; something to fill up a space but which will not be referred to again?</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention again this suggestion of affirmative action where the Minister or his Department would go through the code looking for areas where it is possible to legislate positively in favour of women.  This should be ongoing.  The Minister, being a woman, recognises the problems in this whole area, perhaps in a better way than men. I am hopeful that something positive will be done in all the suggested areas in the future.</P>
    <P>Once again I want to congratulate the committee on a fine report and on the hard work that went into it.  I look forward to the Minister's response and also I look forward to future reports from this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, first of all that I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in this debate.  The subject matter of the report is an extremely important one.  The report has raised a number of very important and difficult issues and I want to pay tribute to the work of the committee.  I assure the House that the views expressed in the report and the contributions made during the course of the present debate will be taken fully into account in the context of the ongoing development of the social welfare system.  I was most impressed with the work of the committee on education, the first area it tackled.  It strikes me that the joint committee appear to be following me around Ministeries and I am wondering what I and they will be doing next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see this discussion as being particularly opportune in that the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare which was <Col N="1155" /> established to examine and report on the social welfare system as a whole, is expected to be completed in the near future.  That report will set the scene for the future development of the system and many of the issues raised in the joint committee's report have been addressed by the commission.  The joint committee's report, in so far as it represents the views of people who, as public representatives, are in close and frequent contact with social welfare recipients must form an important input to the general debate on the future of the system which will take place following the commission's report.</P>
    <P>As far as the general situation of Women <i>vis-a-vis</i> the social welfare system is concerned, there is no doubt that there are many aspects of the system which require review.  The system was devised in an era when the place of women in society was regarded much differently from today and where the place of married women was to be the homemaker dependent on her husband who was the breadwinner.  Many of the rules and conventions underlying the system are a reflection of this basic attitude and that is, perhaps, understandable.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the system as far as women specifically are concerned is the number of schemes which apply to women in different categories of need. Apart from the obvious case of widow's pensions there are schemes for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives under which the rates and conditions of payment are, as for widows' pensions, more favourable than for other categories of social welfare recipients. These schemes have grown up in a fairly piecemeal way in response to needs as perceived at different times.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which arises, however, and it is a problem which is illustrated in a number of the joint committee's recommendations, is that when you have a number of schemes catering for specific categories of persons, there may be other persons who do not fall into one of these specific categories and are, therefore, not covered by these schemes <Col N="1156" /> even though their needs might be similar. The joint committee referred in particular to deserted husbands.  This general question also arises in relation to the various &ldquo;free schemes&rdquo; as they are called &mdash; free electricity allowance and so on &mdash; where entitlement depends on receipt of certain types of payments and where persons who are not on those payments are not covered.  The argument can, in fact, be made that what is needed is one overall system of social security provision covering all persons in need on the same basis, rather than a large number of different schemes for different categories.  This general question is one which will no doubt be addressed by the commission in its report.  I am very much looking forward to hearing what they have to say about it.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the changes which will arise out of the commission's report there are a number of major changes in the system which are due to come into operation in the near future and which will change the system significantly as it affects women.  As a number of these changes are also referred to in the report of the joint committee I would like to refer to them in some detail here.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the implementation of the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  This was mentioned by many speakers, most recently by Senator Fitzsimons. The joint committee's report refers to the delay in implementing the EC Directive and this was referred to also by Senator Mary Robinson in her contribution to this debate.  The Act giving effect to equal treatment was passed last July but it has not been possible to implement its provisions.  Senators will be aware of the circumstances underlying this delay.  Essentially the view taken by one of the staff unions concerned, that the implementation of the equality provisions cannot go ahead until certain staffing issues are resolved.  I am glad to say now, however, that agreement has been reached on the implementation of those aspects of equal treatment which are not dependent on additional staffing. These are the abolition of the special <Col N="1157" /> reduced rates of certain benefits which apply to married women and secondly the extension of the maximum benefit from 312 days to 390 days, thus bringing it into line with the arrangements for applicants generally.  The legislation to give effect to these changes will be included in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill which was published today.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the remaining aspects of equal treatment, namely the abolition of the restrictions on married women in regard to applying for unemployment assistance and the revision of the conditions for entitlement to increases in payments for dependants, depends on additional staff being allocated, new work procedures being devised and staff training.  I can assure the House that I will be doing my utmost to see that the problems in this area are resolved so that the equal treatment provisions can be implemented at an early date.  The full implementation of the equal treatment legislation will eradicate the forms of discrimination which existed in regard to women and will treat them as individuals in their own right than as dependants and as such will be a major development in the system as it affects women.</P>
    <P>The joint committee noted in their report that the EC directive on equal treatment was due to be implemented by December 1984 and the question of retrospective payments going back to December 1984 was raised.  As the House will know, legal proceedings have been instituted in the High Court in regard to this question and the legal issues raised have been referred to the European Court of Justice for an interpretation. Obviously I cannot say at this point what the judgment of the court will be on this matter.  However, as the House will know, the equal treatment package as embodied in the legislation contains elements which involve reduced entitlements in certain cases arising from the redefinition of the adult dependancy concept and the ending of the existing presumption <Col N="1158" /> that any married woman living with her husband is automatically a dependant.  The equal treatment package therefore must be seen as a whole and as retrospection cannot arise in the case of those elements of the package which involve reduced entitlement, providing it on the other elements would not appear to be justified.  Unwelcome as this aspect may be to any or all of us, it is nevertheless highly relevant.</P>
    <P>The joint committee were also concerned that the implementation of the equal treatment legislation to which I have already referred would not cause any family on low income to suffer undue hardship.  The new concept of adult dependant as provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 is based on a spouse being wholly or mainly maintained by the beneficiary.  This will cause some families to suffer a drop in household income as a spouse in employment or on benefit will no longer be deemed an adult dependant.  Some 170,000 payments made each week include increases for adult dependants and about 20,000 of these will be affected by the new concept of adult dependant.  Some 12,000 of these dependants are in employment and the remainder are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  In recognition of the hardship that would result in these families where the spouses income is low, the Act contained provision for alleviating measures to be drawn up.  The first measure provides for a £10 bonus to be paid each week for a transitional period where both spouses are in receipt of social welfare payments.  The second measure will allow a spouse who is earning less than £50 per week to continue to be regarded as an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised in the report which is also relevant in the context of equal treatment is the matter of discriminatory questioning of applicants for unemployment benefit or assistance to ascertain whether they are available for and seeking work.  The report alleges discrimination against women in this area particularly in questioning them about the care of their children in the event of <Col N="1159" /> their obtaining work.  Any such discrimination would of course be contrary to the EC directive and I am particularly concerned that any discrimination of this kind which may exist should be done away with.</P>
    <P>The availability for work condition is, of course, fundamental to our unemployment payment schemes.  Furthermore child care responsibilities can and do affect availability for work in individual cases and questions must be asked in each case.  I do not think anybody denies this. The objection which has been made concerns the manner of questioning and the drawing of different conclusions depending on whether the applicant is a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion of the legislation to introduce equality of treatment into the social welfare code, the previous Minister gave commitments that the necessary steps would be taken to ensure that in the future all conditions relating to entitlement to unemployment benefit, and all inquiries made in connection with these conditions, are applied impartially as to sex.  I would like to renew this commitment.  New guidelines are at present being prepared for the staff administering the unemployment payment schemes explaining clearly the requirements of the EC directive that no discrimination either in laws or administrative provisions is permissible and that in applying availability for work criteria there must be no discrimination on the basis of sex, either directly or by reference to marital status, in questions asked or conclusions drawn.</P>
    <P>Staff will be asked to exercise special care and consideration in this regard and monitoring arrangements will be put in place to ensure that direct or indirect discrimination does not occur.</P>
    <P>Another major development in the social welfare system as it affects women in particular will be the introduction of the child benefit scheme.  The intention of this scheme is to draw together the various different forms of financial support for children&mdash;children's allowances, child tax allowances, increases for children <Col N="1160" /> under the various social welfare schemes and the family income supplement scheme.  The new scheme will unify State support towards the cost of rearing children so that each family will get one single payment per child per month and one of the main effects of the scheme will be to put substantially more money into the hands of mothers whose work is in the home.  When fully implemented the scheme will be of the greatest benefit to families on the lowest income because of its redistributive effect.</P>
    <P>The redistributive impact of the scheme will be achieved essentially through making the child benefit itself taxable.  However, for administrative and technical reasons it is not possible to introduce a full taxable scheme in 1986. As a first step, therefore, the Government have decided to introduce a nontaxable scheme from April 1986.  Under this scheme a benefit of £12.05 per month will be paid for each of the first five children. This rate will be increased to £21.75 per month for each subsequent child. These payments will not be taxable.</P>
    <P>The child benefit scheme now being introduced is a first step in the direction of achieving a redistribution of resources to families most in need.  Three-quarters of all families in the State will be at least as well off under the new scheme as under the existing schemes and many thousands, including families depending on social welfare payments, will in fact be better off.</P>
    <P>These are the main developments which will be taking place over the coming months affecting the position of women in the social welfare system. There are, of course, many other areas which require review and the joint committees' report highlights a number of them.</P>
    <P>In the section on women in the home the report discusses the question of single women living alone or caring for an aged relative and refers in particular in this regard to the single woman's allowance scheme, which is payable at present subject to a means test to single women aged between 58 and 66 who are not in receipt of any other social welfare <Col N="1161" /> payment, and to the prescribed relative allowance scheme.  I agree that this whole area is one which needs to be looked at to ensure in particular that adequate arrangements are made for women who are looking after aged relatives and who are dependent on the social welfare system for their own means of support. Whether it would be possible to go as far as recommended by the joint committee would depend on the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>The single woman's allowance scheme when introduced in 1974 was intended to provide a basic income to women who had no other source of income but at the same time did not have the minimum number of social insurance contributions which were then required to qualify them for unemployment assistance.  The scheme is, therefore, based closely on the conditions of the unemployment assistance scheme.  The rate of single woman's allowance was originally linked to the rate of unemployment assistance.  However, over the years the allowance has been treated as a long term payment and has benefited from the higher level of budget increases applied in recent years to such payments.</P>
    <P>The current maximum weekly rate of single woman's allowance is £37.65&mdash;£39.15 from July 1986&mdash;which is higher than the maximum weekly long term unemployment assistance rate of £34.95&mdash;£36.70 from July 1986.  There are approximately 2,500 women in receipt of the allowance and a significant proportion of these would be women who are looking after aged relatives.</P>
    <P>The prescribed relatives allowance is an increase in pension payable to certain categories of pensioners under very specific conditions.  To qualify for the allowance the pensioner must be so incapacitated as to require full time care and attention and have a prescribed relative living with him or her solely for the purpose of providing that full time care and attention.  Apart from the prescribed relative the pensioner must be living alone or only with a child or an incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced in <Col N="1162" /> January 1969 it was confined to cases where a qualified pensioner was being cared for on a full time basis by a daughter or step-daughter who actually gave up longstanding insurable employment for that purpose.  The scheme has been expanded over the years by widening the categories of pensioners covered and by extending the definition of prescribed relative.  Nevertheless, the purpose of the scheme is still a limited one, and the conditions applying to the scheme effectively restrict payment to cases where the relative providing the care and attention has no independent means of support. There are about 2,300 allowances in payment.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of suggestions to the effect that the PRA should be paid direct to the person providing the care and attention to the pensioner rather than as an increase of pension to the pensioner i.e., that the payment would become a payment for the provision of a service.  This is also the joint committee's view and I would have a great deal of sympathy with it.  It is undoubtedly the case that the persons concerned are providing a very important service and in many cases obviating the need for institutional care of the pensioners concerned.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the question of payments for persons looking after aged relations, including the PRA scheme and the single women's allowance scheme which is also relevant to this question will receive particular attention in the report of the Social Welfare Commission.  The restrictive conditions underlying the PRA scheme would also be examined in that context.  If the PRA were to become a payment for a service and as such payable direct to the carer rather than an increase in pension the question of abolishing the other restrictive provisions of the scheme, including the requirement to have no other adult in the house, would also arise.  There would be significant financial implications in any proposals of this nature but it is an area that I would like to have examined in the light of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations are made in the report in relation to the <Col N="1163" /> deserted wife's scheme, seeking in particular the abolition of the three months waiting period, the payment of maintenance on foot of court orders to be made through the Department of Social Welfare and the abolition of the use of the term deserted wife in official documents. Perhaps I might say a few words first of all about the reasons underlying the three months waiting period before deserted wives become entitled to payment.</P>
    <P>One of the criteria by which it is established that the wife is in fact deserted is that the husband has wilfully refused or neglected to support his family and that the wife has made reasonable efforts to trace him and &mdash; or obtain support from him.  It is very difficult in many cases, as I am sure the House will appreciate, to establish whether desertion has actually occurred and detailed investigations are often required to establish the facts.  There is also the consideration that a certain time should be allowed to enable the family to get back together again, if possible.  It was felt, therefore, when the scheme was introduced that there should be a waiting period before the situation was accepted as being irrevocable bearing in mind that, during the waiting period, it would be open to the wife to claim supplementary welfare allowance in any case where she is in need.</P>
    <P>These are the sorts of considerations which underlie the scheme as it now exists.  The committee make a number of proposals for liberalising the conditions under which payments are made under the scheme.  As the House will know &mdash; and there has been reference here to it &mdash; this scheme and also the unmarried mother's allowance scheme have come under a considerable amount of attention in recent times, mainly, I may say, directed at the alleged abuse of the scheme by women who, for example, are said to be in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or allowance though not in fact deserted but able to arrange their affairs so that they appear to be so.</P>
    <P>The question of social welfare fraud was mentioned specifically by Senator M. Higgins in his contribution to the debate. <Col N="1164" /> He referred in particular to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> where highly speculative estimates were made of the extent of this problem.</P>
    <P>It is clear of course to anybody reading the article closely that the figures quoted are speculative.  However, the problem is, as Senator Higgins says, that articles of this kind may contribute to an anti-welfare mentality and this is something which I, too, strongly deprecate, and which was deprecated by Senator Fitzsimons earlier this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Various figures are being bandied about in recent times which are, I emphasise again, pure speculation.  The only factual information which I can give is that, of the various individual cases which were investigated during 1985 over the Department's services as a whole, it is estimated that some 4,000 of them involved an element of intended fraud and that the total amount of overpayments involved in these cases is in the region of £3 million.  Investigations are still under way in many of these cases and a number have been or are being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>These are the only factual figures available.  The Department are very conscious of the need to combat fraud in the social welfare system, subject to the resources available and to the need to strike a balance between fraud prevention and making sure that procedures are not such as to cause undue delay in making payment to genuine cases.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate what is the level of fraud at any time and any attempt to do so must be based largely on conjecture. Many social welfare schemes are, of course, open to manipulation and every effort must be made to eradicate fraud where it exists in the system.  This should not, however, lead us to abandon basic elements of the system or to make the system a less caring one for people in genuine need.</P>
    <P>I have taken note of the proposals made by the Joint Committee for improvements in the deserted wife's schemes. As far as the proposal to abolish the term &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; in official documents is concerned, a number of Senators <Col N="1165" /> expressed doubts about the suitability of the alternative term suggested in the report, namely &ldquo;abandoned spouse&rdquo; and I must say I would share these doubts. The term &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; is one which has been legally defined and is used throughout the legislation.  However, while the legislation refers to deserted wives, the term &ldquo;social assistance allowance&rdquo; is used on the order books and vouchers for the schemes of deserted wives payments, unmarried mothers' allowance, prisoners' wives allowance and single women's allowance.  The Joint Committee recommended the ending of the practice of using the letters DW on official envelopes.  This has now been done and the letters are also being discontinued in the numbering system so that they will no longer appear on payment vouchers.</P>
    <P>The joint committee also recommend that payment of maintenance on foot of court orders should be made through the Department of Social Welfare.  In this connection I should mention that, in the normal course of events, where a maintenance order is made, the court will direct that all payments under the order be made through the District Court clerk except where the maintenance creditor, normally the wife, requests otherwise and the court so consents.  The latest information available to me indicates that roughly half of all maintenance orders are paid through the District Court clerk and that in most of these cases payments are made regularly.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly difficulties do arise in certain cases and while it is by no means certain that defaulting husbands would be any less likely to default on payments to the Department of Social Welfare the suggestion made by the Oireachtas joint committee is being examined within the Department to see if some form of arrangement might be possible to ease the problem.  There is a further reason which prompts action in this area and that is that there is, I believe, a general consensus that deserting husbands should not be allowed to evade their responsibilities <Col N="1166" /> to their wives and families as many of them may succeed in doing at present.</P>
    <P>The whole area of social assistance allowances which include deserted wife's payments, is a matter which will have to receive detailed attention in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and I am looking forward to having the commission's recommendations in this area.</P>
    <P>A further recommendation of the joint committee was that an improvement be made in the existing maternity benefit and that the scheme be extended to all women regardless of their insured status.</P>
    <P>There are, as Senators will be aware, two maternity allowance schemes.  The general scheme provides an allowance for 12 weeks, the weekly rate of which goes up to £41.10 from July and with which pay-related benefit is also payable.  Entitlement depends on the woman having at least 26 weeks of paid insurance since entry into employment and 26 contributions paid or credited in the previous contribution year.</P>
    <P>A new maternity allowance scheme was introduced in 1981.  It arose from the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  That Act provides 14 weeks maternity leave for women in full time employment and also provides for women to resume work with the same employer at the end of the maternity leave.  The maternity allowance for women in employment is designed to ensure that women in employment who are on maternity leave are fully compensated for loss of earnings after all deductions are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The formula devised when the new scheme was introduced, taking account of tax and other deducations at that time, was for payment of an allowance of 80 per cent of gross reckonable earnings. This was calculated to be equivalent to net take-home pay.  This percentage was reduced in 1984 to 70 per cent and this reduction comes in for critical comment in the committee's report.  Therefore it is necessary to explain the background to it.</P>
    <P>It became evident that because of changes which had occurred after 1981 in tax and other deductions, the original <Col N="1167" /> formula could provide levels of benefit which were very much higher than was intended.  In fact the continued use of the 80 per cent factor in 1983 meant an effective replacement rate of 110 per cent of take-home pay.  This was the reason for the reduction from 80 per cent to 70 per cent.  It did not involve a change in the original basis of the scheme as the application of the 70 per cent factor from April 1984 meant that women would still receive the equivalent of their normal take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The maternity allowance schemes were intended to cover working women for the period that they were unable to work and were therefore at a financial loss around the time of childbirth.  They only apply therefore to women who have a recent record of insurable employment.  I sympathise with the committee's view that maternity payments should be extended to all women regardless of their insured or uninsured status.  An extension of this kind would, however cost around £16 million a year.</P>
    <P>In the section on older women the joint committee called for an increase in the rates of payment of contributory and non-contributory old age and widows pensions together with a progressive reduction in the qualifying age for old age pension to 60.  The Government have already given a firm commitment that, despite the gravity of the recession and its impact on social welfare expenditure, they will endeavour to maintain the living standards of all people who depend on social welfare for their needs.  The national plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> reiterated the Government's commitment to keep long term payments at least in line with inflation and short term unemployment and disability payments in line with take-home pay.  Since mid-1983, including this year's budget increases, long term social welfare recipients have received a compound increase of 32.7 per cent while the estimated increase in the consumer price index for the period mid-1983 to mid-1987 is 23.3 per cent.  This represents an increase in real terms of 7.6 per cent and very clearly <Col N="1168" /> demonstrates the Government's concern for the financial position of pensioners. The general question of a reduction in the qualifying age for old age pensions is being reviewed in the context of the proposals for a national pension plan which are currently being drawn up in my Department.</P>
    <P>The report also proposes that married women over age 66 who remained at home should be entitled to receive a non-contributory pension in their own right and should not be regarded as dependants of their spouses.  Married women over 66 years of age are already, of course, entitled to apply in their own right for the non-contributory old age pension.  This pension is means tested and the married woman's means are deemed to be half of the joint means of the couple. The question of payment of the dependants' portion of a pension direct to dependants of pensionable age by way of a pension in their own right is also a matter which is being considered in the context of the proposals for a national pension plan.</P>
    <P>The report of the joint committee also drew attention to the fact that widows under 66 years of age whose husbands died over that age cannot retain the free electricity allowance to which their husbands were entitled.  The free electricity allowance, as with the various other free schemes operated by the Department, is designed essentially to cover the aged and the permanently incapacitated.  There are anomalies in these schemes and there is considerable pressure to extend entitlements to groups not covered at present. The extension of free electricity to widows under 66 whose husbands died over this age would obviously raise the question of extending the scheme to cover all widows as otherwise we would have the further anomaly that widows of equal means would have different entitlements. Aside from these considerations there is also the question of cost.  Extension of the free schemes to widows would cost in the region of £6.7 million annually at current costs.</P>
    <P>A further recommendation of the Oireachtas joint committee was that the <Col N="1169" /> interpretation of the term &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; would not preclude old people from having a friend or relative stay with them at night time.  The living alone allowance was introduced in 1977 in recognition of the additional costs which pensioners living on their own have to meet when compared with the shared costs of a couple on such living expenses as rent, heating, lighting, cooking and so on. There is no qualification of the term living alone in the Social Welfare Acts or regulations. In general, however, payment of the allowance would not be affected if the pensioner is aged and infirm and has a relative stay for company only at night time, or where relatives come to stay at weekends.  Other instances in which the allowance would be paid include pensioners who reside alone during the day and go to stay with relatives at night time, or pensioners living in self-contained apartments within a main house.</P>
    <P>The joint committee recommend an improvement in administration procedures in the Department including the acceleration of the process of computerisation to ensure a more speedy and efficient service to the public and I would like to make a number of comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>Each week the Department of Social Welfare make some 1.4 million payments and process some 25,000 new claims. There has been a huge growth in the workload due to the effects of the recession at a time when the Government's policy on civil service manning levels has been and continues to be very restrictive. However, the Department's computerisation programme is resulting in significant administrative savings and substantially higher productivity.</P>
    <P>Computerisation was introduced in the Department of Social Welfare initially to deal with records and payments in relation to pay-related benefit and has been extended to handle all records arising under the PRSI system and all disability benefit payments.  Other areas of the Department's operations which have been computerised include the bulk issue <Col N="1170" /> of children's allowance books and allowance books for recipients of old age non-contributory pensions as well as the calculation of payments under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department's computer development programme, over the coming years, will make a major contribution to more effective and efficient day-to-day administration, including better retrieval and communication of information in individual cases.  Computer terminals have been installed in a number of public offices of the Department.  Since the beginning of 1983 visual display terminals connected to the Department's computers have been installed in 23 offices of the Department around the country.  This computer system enables information regarding disability benefit, maternity allowance, occupational injury benefit and associated pay-related benefit claims and payments to be available on the visual display units at the local offices of the Department.  This enables staff to establish the most up-to-date position regarding claims in response to queries from members of the public.  Over the coming years computing facilities will be extended to other areas to assist with the increasing workload and to replace obsolete systems.</P>
    <P>The recent reorganisation of the Department through the setting up of the social welfare services office is intended to improve the quality of delivery of services to the Department's clients.  By having the office solely concerned with the operation of the various social welfare schemes and separating it from the Department, it will enable those who are responsible for the delivery of services to concentrate more fully on effective management and the provision of the efficient and speedy delivery of services.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am grateful to the joint committee for this report and for the opportunity of coming here to discuss at least some of the main recommendations made in the report.  While I have not specifically addressed all of the recommendations, I would like to say that I have read them with great interest and will consider them further.  The extent to <Col N="1171" /> which individual recommendations can be implemented depends of course on a number of factors, not least the financial implications.  We must face the fact that the additional resources which would be required to bring about the changes in the social welfare system which many of us might like to see, in terms of removing all of the anomalies and providing adequate protection for all categories of people in need, would be very substantial.</P>
    <P>Increasing population levels alone will put enormous strain on the social welfare system in the coming decades.  The only realistic approach may involve looking at the system as a whole, eliminating dual payments where they exist and redirecting resources within the system from groups or categories of lesser need in order to ensure that everybody in genuine need is adequately catered for.  This will undoubtedly involve difficult choices but these choices will have to be made if we are to have a social welfare system which is adequate to the needs of the 21st century. The process of debate on these issues will begin following the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and I am looking forward to that debate with interest.  I would like again to express my appreciation for the committee's efforts and to say that their recommendations will be taken fully into account in the context of the forthcoming review of the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>In concluding the debate on this motion there is very little need for me to say anything since the Minister has thoroughly reviewed, in her intervention, the main issues that have been raised.  As I indicated in my contribution, and as has been echoed by the Minister in her contribution, there will be an opportunity for a full scale debate on this and other topics when the report of the Commission on Social Welfare is available.  Nevertheless, it has been extremely useful to have this debate which has run over three sitting days so that we could focus on the specific problems that have arisen in the area <Col N="1172" /> of particular entitlements of women.  As the Minister said, I think we have been fortunate that some of the main problems have been highlighted by the committee and have been dealt with in what I think we can all agree has been a most useful debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on item No. 3.  It was mentioned on the last occasion that this item was being debated in this House, that it was a bit late at this stage, early March, to be discussing the crisis in farming during the summer of 1985.  I do not think it is too late because there is always a crisis in farming.  We had a very bad month in February.  The adverse weather conditions of the summer of 1985 are reflecting on farming in the spring of <Col N="1173" /> 1986.  Fodder is scarce and of poor quality. Because of the bad weather last summer much of it went to waste.  A lot of silage was made which had a high water content and this reduced the feeding value of the silage.  Cows are calving down and are staying down with milk fever, which is definitely putting extra costs on farmers.  It is as critical for them now as it was last summer.  I know schemes were introduced to help them but I do not think they were adequate.</P>
      <P>There are, in addition, cuts in or the abandonment of schemes by the Government which are also creating problems in farming.  There is the farm modernisation scheme, the lime subsidy scheme and, I notice from reading newspapers, that land at present is very deficient in lime. The farm modernisation scheme was abandoned.  A lot has to be done to ensure that we have proper housing for our cattle in winter.  We always seem to be surprised by a fall in income. Although two years passed without very bad weather any farmer who is not prepared to house his cattle in the winter is in trouble.  The abandonment of the farm modernisation scheme was a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the new farm aid scheme.  While there are grants that will be based on present day costings, I do not think they are sufficient, especially the grants for slurry equipment and slurry storage.  This is vital because we have complaints from fisheries and other people interested in the preservation of our countryside about the pollution caused by such slurry.  With the overheads in farming so great there should be greater grants for the developing of slurry storage and slurry equipment. In the recent budget there was a big cut in grant aid to ACOT, especially for training.  I read an extract from the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of 22 February 1986 in which an ACOT spokesman said it would be impossible to accommodate this reduction in their budget without seriously curtailing the education and advisory service to farmers.  Education and advisory services are vital to farmers, especially young farmers.  The cut in the <Col N="1174" /> grant will probably amount to £1.2 million.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency has also had its budget cut.  We have strange priorities because we are reducing the grant-in-aid to training in farming, our major industry and at the same time many young people are taking welding courses with AnCO, which are grant-aided. There should be more aid for the training of young farmers and farm development.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the new ACOT Bill which provides for charges for advisory services.  This is discriminatory legislation. Only farmers who can afford to pay will be able to avail of such advisory services.  In an article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 20 February 1986 Tim Cullen stated:</P>
    <P>This is the latest in a series of charges which are to be borne by the farming community.  As well as paying for disease levies, milk levies and other charges, it is little wonder that many farmers are so despondent.  In addition to this new charge the farmer knows that there are no price increases this year which in turn makes increased income almost impossible.</P>
    <P>The writing is on the wall for farmers. There will not be any increased income and very little encouragement.  An article in <i>The Farmers Journal</i> dated 5 February states:</P>
    <P>A new Bill empowering ACOT to charge for its advisory services was circulated to Dáil Deputies this week. This Bill was expected but its timing coming shortly after a £1.2 million cutback in ACOT's budget was unexpected and, more surprising and indeed, most depressing for the farming community.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not welcomed by farming organisations, the ICMSA and others.  <i>The Farm Press</i>, dated 11 February, had a heading &ldquo;Farmers Attack ACOT Charges&rdquo;.  The chairman of the ICMSA farming development committee, Mr. Dan McCarthy, said the move was most depressing.  He pointed <Col N="1175" /> out that the Government's cut in ACOT grant-in-aid, announced in the budget, will deprive the farm service of £1 million. This is disgraceful at a time when the farming service should be supplemented by £100 million.</P>
    <P>There was an article in <i>The Farmers Journal</i>, concerning the missing £27 million. It said the Minister, in reply to a question from Deputy Joe Walsh, confirmed that an estimated sum of £27 million in the Department of Agriculture Vote for 1985 financial year was not spent.  Taking into consideration that the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture was not sufficient, it is disgraceful that £27 million of that was not spent. This deprived the agriculture industry, a vital industry, of much needed money.</P>
    <P>The bovine disease eradication scheme costs a great deal of money and we still have not got rid of TB.  Farmers every year have to increase the levy and are paying their share to ensure we have a disease free national herd.  With regard to the FEOGA grants for marts, it is important that marts have sufficient cleaning equipment and washing down facilities. It is important that marts are developed and receive whatever grants can be obtained through FEOGA to ensure that our marts are up to date.</P>
    <P>Another important event throughout the country for agricultural and community life is the organising and holding of annual shows.  The County Limerick Agricultural Committee report lists the amounts given to show committees.  It is surprising that the amount granted in 1985 is the same as that granted nearly 20 years ago.  Shows are in great financial trouble.  The Munster Agricultural Society who organise one of the most important agricultural shows in the south, are in financial trouble.  I urge the Minister to examine their position and make some allocation from the Department to help societies like the Munster Agricultural Society, the Limerick Show Society and others to ensure that those great rural events can continue.  They are of immense benefit to the social life and business life of towns and cities.  They <Col N="1176" /> also provide cattle breeders with an opportunity to exhibit their cattle and are essential to producing top quality cattle for export and for dairying.</P>
    <P>Farming is so dependent on weather conditions that you can always have a crisis in farming.  It is important that the Minister and the Department should be alert to the dependency of farming on weather and also to ensure that agriculture will get the finance needed to develop.  If agriculture prospers it will spill out into the whole economy and the whole economy will prosper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that we are talking in 1986 about the crisis in 1985. We learned a good deal from the crisis in 1985.  One thing we learned is the dependency on hay for fodder.  Over 50 per cent of fodder conserved for winter feeding is hay.  Farmers should turn more to silage for fodder.  That is being helped by the announcement in the past month of new grant schemes.  I know the Minister is addressing himself to that problem.</P>
      <P>There were many problems last year but there was a lot of scaremongering and many people panicked when there was no need.  We heard that cattle prices had reached the 1974 level.  Thank God they did not.  I would like to congratulate the Government on the actions they took to alleviate the problems in no small measure. When things started to get bad they recognised there would be a fodder shortage and they started with a nitrogen subsidy of £35 per tonne.  There was a restriction on that.  It was for farmers with under 30 cows or under 50 head of cattle. About 24,000 farmers applied for that scheme.  Even though we were told it was not of any value, we still had a big demand for it and it cost the Exchequer over £600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second measure was the silage subsidy. That was a great success even though it was so late in the year.  There was a subsidy of £4 per tonne for a maximum of 50 tonnes for anyone who made silage before 19 October.  That was later extended to November.  Up to 30,000 people applied.  There is a message there. If those people continue to make silage <Col N="1177" /> we will not have a crisis like that in the future.  We are told about all the cutbacks. That scheme cost about £6 million.</P>
    <P>The next measure, the one that created a lot of hassle, was the feed voucher scheme.  That cost £18 million.  We hear people complaining about a cutback of £1 million but that is small compared with this kind of money.  It was done at the right time.  There were 90,000 applicants for the feed voucher scheme and 80,000 of them qualified.  We all know that some people will chance their arm &mdash; they probably had enough feed.  That went a long way with a reasonably good winter.  Even though it was cold we did not get too much snow.  It took the black market out of trading in feed stuffs.  If you read the papers any day you see so much hay and feed advertised.  I compliment the Government on taking the initiative in giving out the feed vouchers.  It did not leave the farmers who were very badly off at the mercy of the people who were charging two prices for feed.  We had a bit of that in September and October when we saw lorry loads of straw and hay at high prices going to the west.  That all sorted itself out.  We have a reasonably stable situation for feed at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>Another advantage given to farmers during the crisis was the 30 day test extended to 60 days.  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can to continue with that extension of the 60 day test. That is doing a great deal for the farmers in adding mobility to the time of sale. The time is very limited at 30 days.  It would be well worth continuing the 60 day test.  We also have the scheme for tillage farmers which cost the Exchequer £2 million.  When we add it all up it comes to a fairly sizeable amount.  Senator Kiely talked about the cutbacks and about charging for ACOT services.  I believe farmers see that they are getting services and are being looked after by the Department of Agriculture and they do not mind paying a limited amount for services.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the work he has put into potato co-operative and the new market he has <Col N="1178" /> set up with the sugar company, the fruit importers and the farmers with vegetable crops supplying supermarkets.  We can produce some of the best vegetables in the world if our marketing is right.  The Opposition party produced a document the other day.  I have not read it thoroughly yet but I welcome it.  Senator O'Toole had an input into it and I compliment him on that.  I am sure they will get co-operation from the Minister of State if they wish to discuss anything with him at any time.  One of his strong points is vegetable growing and marketing.  I again compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on the good job they did during the crisis last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the very kind words of Senator Quealy on the production of our farm food and vegetable document the other day.  This is the real spirit that we should be adopting regardless of what source a document of this nature comes from.  When it is welcomed, as Senator Quealy has done, that is a step in the right direction.  For many months we researched this document. It is necessary, with the importation of the amount of vegetables we have, to take some corrective measures to bridge that gap.  This is what we hope this document will do.  Indeed as Senator Quealy has said, with the co-operation, of both sides of the House, regardless of who is in Government to implement it, these are the lines that we should be adopting and this is the road forward for this type of bridging.</P>
      <P>Unlike my colleague, Senator Kiely, I believe this report is outdated.  It is unfortunate, with the amount of legislation coming before the Seanad, that it takes so long to bring a document before this House.  The crisis this document deals with is in the past.  All we can do at this time is to examine the implications of the crisis and how it affected the farmers during the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quotas and voucher systems which were introduced did not get around to some farmers because of the lack of inspection, and the system that was put into <Col N="1179" /> force.  I know many farmers in the west did not apply for the feed vouchers because they felt they had a sufficient amount of silage and fodder.  Had they applied they would have qualified easily because no inspections took place.  Whatever was on the form was the only guideline they had.  They had some spot checks but at the very time that this crisis was in operation, we brought out a document and we put forward various suggestions &mdash; as indeed did the IFA and the ICMSA and the co-operatives &mdash; but the one that the Minister adhered to was the system of feed vouchers.  It did work to the advantage of some farmers but the inspection would have been the ideal thing.  That might not have been possible with the number of staff that was available to the Minister.  We were looking for increased headage grants to the maximum of 50 per cent at that time.  The cost was to be borne by the EC.  We also wanted loans at low fixed interest rates for farmers whose crops and fodder had been destroyed and the loans related to the average cost of production per acre. We also looked for realistic financing of farmers severely affected by the disastrous weather particularly in the flooded Shannon area.</P>
    <P>The 30-day testing was extended to 60 days.  That was put into operation for steers but not for heifers.  The reintroduction of the full carcase beef intervention and export refunds immediately to maintain prices encouraged the pooling and distribution of available surplus fodders by the co-operatives and farming organisations. The restoring of and increasing small farmers unemployment assistance, arranging for the banks and the ACC to play an active positive role in helping farmers to bridge their present difficulties and waive any interest were also required.  Many of these proposals were not put forward.  I want in passing to compliment the ACOT people both on the east coast and on the west coast for their liaison and co-operation in having hay and straw transported to the west to the areas that had lost a lot during the summer flooding.  The co-operation of <Col N="1180" /> ACOT at that time was very helpful to the farmers and they did locate straw and fodder in the east to be transported to the west.  While we were very perturbed here at the beginning of the year about what the outcome might be, at the end of the day the outcome was not as bad as people felt it would be.  While the quality of the fodder may have been poor, sufficient food was available as a result.</P>
    <P>The report we are dealing with is extremely outdated at this time.  Unfortunately, a major crisis is developing at the moment with the suggestion, in the 27th report which is now out, that our milk levy may be cut by 3 per cent and, perhaps, there may be the complete abolition of beef intervention.  I want to say that if intervention for beef, as we know it, is going to be abolished, it will mean, according to the economist, Professor Sheehy, from UCD, who has examined this in depth, that we will lose roughly £170 million as a result.  That would return us to the 1974 position and the crisis that year.  It would be disastrous for over 7,000 of our meat plant workers if that came into operation.  Indeed, the crisis is so blatant and of such urgency that my party in the other House have asked for a full debate on it and, indeed, on the introduction of a further reduction of 3 per cent in the super-levy.  If it came into operation there would be 700,000 tonnes of unwanted beef now in the EC.</P>
    <P>On top of that, the EC countries are importing over 430 tonnes of meat from Third Countries.  The same thing happened when they were producing milk only by artificial food which increased the milk production.  While milk production in the US, the USSR and countries outside the EC has risen considerably, we are cutting back on our milk production under the cessation policy.  Milk production is improving in the countries outside the Third World and in the European Community we are trying to decrease it.</P>
    <P>This is something that is going to lead to a serious crisis within our farming community. If intervention is abolished and the levy is reduced by 3 per cent it will have a disastrous effect on our calf numbers. People will be getting out of cows, <Col N="1181" /> our calf numbers will drop and our cow slaughterings will increase.  I do not like to see young cow slaughterings increase. I would rather see the culled cows increasing. You will have farmers selling off their good cows and less beef going into the meat plants if there is this further decrease of 3 per cent as is suggested by the EC at the moment.</P>
    <P>As regards the farm modernisation scheme, we have been waiting for 18 months for the introduction of a new grants system in this scheme.  Unless the Minister is releasing something today, or did yesterday, I have not yet seen the full details of the grants that are available under the new farm modernisation scheme.  It has been announced for long enough to have the details published but we have not got them as yet.  I would welcome any grants that would be spelt out in detail.  I understand that some Members have been looking for them over the last few days and that they are not available.  I hope they will be available as soon as possible so that we will see exactly what grant aid is necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to say in passing that we feel that with our climatic conditions all heavy livestock units &mdash; cattle and cows at any rate &mdash; should be taken off the land during the winter months.  There is great scope for giving substantial grants for slatted houses.  In the west where we have the heaviest rainfall, we find that taking cattle off the land at the end of October or the beginning of November until the following March or April, is the only system that can be operated profitably. Poaching of land is disastrous.  With earlier grass you have silage and early grazing but, if you poach the land over the winter, as has been traditional, you are unable to carry the same number of livestock units.  I would welcome a substantial grant for slatted houses for livestock, especially cattle, and in some cases sheep.</P>
    <P>The drainage grant is being reduced from 70 per cent to 40 per cent.  That is a cut of 30 per cent.  Arterial drainage is at a standstill.  There is no grant available and no new schemes coming on stream <Col N="1182" /> for arterial drainage.  The lime subsidy and the AI subsidy have been abandoned. The establishment grant for young farmers is not easy to get because a farmer must have over 40 livestock units and a knowledge of farming and certificates from the EC, or some other scheme, to qualify.  That is a good thing, but it will not be as easy to qualify.  I have not read the details of the scheme yet, but I would welcome any improvement in it.  It is a lesser scheme than the one that was proposed many years ago but was never put into operation.  I have not got the details of that scheme yet, but I would welcome any scheme to establish young farmers with training either inheriting land or buying farms.  They should be equipped with knowledge in the same way as a person is qualified to run a business on a proper basis.  Young farmers should be educated in modern farming. The best possible young farmers should get holdings to achieve the highest production possible.</P>
    <P>The dismantling of our agricultural advisory services has been taken on board by ACOT.  In my county we have lost ten agricultural advisers.  That is a substantial decrease in our staffing in Mayo and, if we are to implement our horticultural scheme, or any horticultural scheme coming on stream we will have only one horticulturist in Mayo to implement the scheme as a result of the public service embargo on staff.  This should be reviewed if we are to increase our vegetable growing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disease eradication scheme, I saw a document from the Irish Veterinary Union in connection with the amount of moneys that have been allocated to disease eradication this year.  In 1985 the Minister for Agriculture introduced a planned three year programme to rid the country of bovine TB.  This year that three year programme has been stopped and we are back on the stop-go programme which has cost the country dearly for 26 years.  We understand and support the general needs for cutbacks in Government spending, but the facts make this cutback a false economic strategy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> The fixed expenditure of 1,021 civil servants costs £15 million per annum. Travelling expenses for public servants cost an extra £5 million.  To justify this £20 million fixed expenditure the national herd must be TB tested.  It costs £8,500,000 in fees to 850 vets to TB test the full national herd, but only £5 million is being made available this year for this vital work.  It is not proper management to spend £20 million on fixed costs and TB test only half the national herd thus allowing TB to spread.</P>
    <P>We have been messing about with bovine TB eradication for some time. The three year programme was introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, as a crash programme to produce results and give us a disease free herd.  The EC are demanding this.  It is a crisis.  The cutbacks will not help to accelerate the eradication programme.  I would welcome a bigger input of capital into this serious scheme.  The problem has been with us so long now that it is necessary to have a crash programme to finally eradicate it.</P>
    <P>We will have a national brucellosis free herd shortly.  We were trying to achieve a national free zone in the Sligo-Donegal-Leitrim - Mayo - Galway - Roscommon region because of the low incidence there.  The incidence has been the lowest in Ireland for many years.  Because a regulation came into force in Britain whereby we are no longer allowed to export cattle from that traditional region, we are unable to send any heifers across to the north of England.  The quicker the national herd is cleared of brucellosis the quicker we will be able to trade with Britain again.  It was beneficial to the store people who are only able to provide stores in the west and had that traditional outlet to the northern part of England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>We hope that the abolition of intervention beef and the increase of 3 per cent in the super-levy will not have a disastrous effect.  The economists are pointing to a very bad year ahead.  They have been quoted in the papers over the past few days as saying we could have another <Col N="1184" /> 1974 crisis.  I hope we do not reach that level again, because that was a very low level and one to which we do not want to return.</P>

      <P>I must say that I was quite impressed listening to the Senators here, giving an impressive performance on both sides of the House. There is a great deal in this report, particularly in the chapter giving the views of the joint committee and in the conclusion of this most useful report which I have fully accepted.  The committee rightly foresaw that increasing the headage grants to the maximum allowable might not, due to its cost, commend itself to the hard-pressed Exchequer.  I have from the very start held the view, also expressed by the committee, that one of the greatest problems in dealing with this disaster situation was to ensure that aid and rescue measures were accurately targeted. I have been totally opposed to the implementation of any blanket aid scheme, such as increasing headage payments, which would result in many farmers who were not faced with a critical fodder problem being provided with assistance.  Apart from the fact that this would be intrinsically wrong in itself, it would also have reduced the amount of aid that could be paid to those who had most need of it.  The committee also correctly pointed out that there were many farmers outside the disadvantaged areas who were in serious difficulty who would derive no benefit from a beefed-up headage scheme.  Clearly, a further measure would be needed to meet their situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee also saw quite clearly that no single measure would provide an adequate remedy but that the problem must be attacked on several fronts.  This is precisely how I have dealt with the problem.  Last July, when we foresaw that as a result of the continuous heavy rain a fodder shortage was very likely in the coming winter, I immediately had the matter examined and on 8 August announced the introduction of the winter fodder scheme, comprising a fertiliser subsidy scheme and a scheme for aiding <Col N="1185" /> first-time silage making.  These schemes were ridiculed in certain quarters at first but it transpired that those most concerned, the hard-hit farmers, saw them in a different light.  In fact, their response to them was well in excess of all expectations. We received almost 60,000 applications under the two schemes and the vast bulk of these have been paid, many of them before the end of December last.  By late August flooding on the River Shannon was approaching crisis dimensions; the Government considered the position as a matter of urgency and in early September the introduction of the Shannon Valley flood scheme was announced.  Under this scheme some 1,600 farmers have received aid in varying amounts up to the limit of £500 per farmer.</P>
    <P>The Government's main response, however, has been the nation-wide feed voucher scheme based on an allocation of £13.25 million from the Exchequer plus 125,000 tonnes of intervention grain made available by the European Economic Community at 75 per cent of the intervention price.  Under this scheme we had some 90,000 applicants of whom some 78,000 were found to be eligible and that figure has been updated to nearly 80,000.  These were issued with vouchers during January.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing specific measures, I also arranged to have brought forward to December last the payment of headage grants which would normally have been issued early this year. More recently, I announced details of a working capital scheme to aid tillage farmers affected by the bad weather, including those seriously affected by the severe hailstorm on 25-26 July last.  This scheme will provide a subsidy of 5 per cent per annum on up to £40 million of working capital loans to tillage farmers.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey raised the question of the valuation of the &ldquo;grain&rdquo; voucher.  The value of the &ldquo;grain&rdquo; vouchers is determined by the market, having regard to the prevailing market price for grain and the price at which cheap intervention grain can be purchased with vouchers.  In general terms, the value of the discount <Col N="1186" /> on one tonne of intervention grain is the difference between 75 per cent of the intervention price and the market price of grain, adjusted by the costs incurred by merchants in buying grain from intervention.</P>
    <P>The intervention grain available for the scheme consists of 36,000 tonnes of high quality feed wheat and 89,000 tonnes of feed barley.  As the grain is allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, it was to be expected that initial demand would be for the higher quality feed wheat and, accordingly, that the value of &ldquo;grain&rdquo; vouchers would be higher at the outset. During the first two weeks after issue the vouchers were valued at between £20 and £26 per tonne but following the allocation of feed wheat, there has been a slight drop in the value.  However, with almost 70,000 tonnes of grain allocated, I understand that the situation has stabilised. The value given to farmers for the vouchers is being continuously monitored by my Department having regard to market prices, with a view to ensuring that there is no profiteering.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that intervention grain is only a small element of the feed voucher scheme and that the greater part of support is by way of the &ldquo;cash&rdquo; voucher.  Other forms of assistance such as the winter fodder scheme and accelerated payment of headage grants have also been provided by my Department, as I mentioned earlier, to enable farmers to secure adequate winter fodder for their livestock.</P>
    <P>The joint committee quite correctly refers in the report to the over reliance of hay as a winter fodder.  There is, indeed, a lesson to be learned from the experience of 1985.  Nowadays, with all the experimentation going on with AFT, on the inexpensive ways of making silage, there is no excuse for taking the risk of putting all your eggs in the one basket of haymaking when, with an ordinary mower and a square baler and some silage additive, good silage can be made.  There is really no excuse.  With a view to encouraging the making of silage I am providing worthwhile grants under the recently announced farm improvement <Col N="1187" /> programme for silos and silage bases and also grants in the west of Ireland for basic silage making equipment.  In the west, reliance on hay is traditional but this outlook must be changed if we are not to have future fodder problems when summer weather is unfavourable.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the main objective of almost all the measures was to prevent panic selling of livestock by farmers who feared that they would be unable to feed their stock over the winter months.  To date there has been no evidence of farmers being forced to dispose of cattle because of insufficient feed.  In November-December 1985 cattle slaughterings were only slightly up, 8 per cent on the corresponding levels in 1984 and this increase was largely due to additional demand from meat factories which were filling contracts for aid for private storage. In the first three weeks of this year, slaughterings have been on the same level as in the corresponding period of 1985. Prices for cattle have also remained quite stable throughout the whole period.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that this House will agree that the measures adopted were comprehensive and far-ranging and designed to meet the needs of a variety of different types of cases.  I believe that the vast majority of farmers are satisfied with the operation of the various schemes and that they have resulted in a substantial improvement in the fodder of the thousands of farmers who qualified for assistance. I feel sure also that they must be regarded as meeting almost in their entirety the views expressed by the joint committee whose work in this matter I must commend.</P>
    <P>Next week, for the information of the Senators, the comprehensive announcement on the grants will be made.  They will be comprehensive.  We welcome any advice or help we can get from the Opposition parties.  Everybody, whatever side of the House his is on, is working in the interests of the farming community.  I would have to say, however, that in November 1982, when I inherited my responsibilities for the horticultural industry, I was landed with a very difficult <Col N="1188" /> scenario.  I had, for instance, a situation at that time of Irish farmers dumping Dutch potatoes into the sea.  That was the chaos I inherited; that was the chaos which prevailed.  I also inherited the situation where, in the previous two or three years, probably one of the finest horticultural processing plants in Europe had been folded, in probably one of the best growing areas in Europe, the Carlow area.  That is the sort of scene it was.</P>
    <P>I was hardly hot in my chair when my own East Cork Foods factory was closed down.  Fortunately, due to my efforts and the help and co-operation of some very willing companies from overseas and at home, we got that factory going again. Within the last six to eight weeks we had another closure on our hands, that of the Erin Foods plant in Mallow.  I am happy to be able to announce to the Seanad this evening that, as a result of intensive activities over the last couple of weeks, peas will be growing again in Mallow in this season.  We will be re-opening the Erin Foods plant in Mallow.  Maybe we are not talking enough about what we are doing but a lot of things are happening. For instance, as Senator Quealy rightly pointed out, we set up the National Potato Co-operative.  The National Potato Co-operative is exactly what Fianna Fáil are talking about in their document.  It is already set up.  But I would like to appeal to the Fianna Fáil people to ask farmers, even at this stage, to become members of the co-operative.</P>
    <P>We brought legislation through this House with regard to the registration of potato growers.  The response has not been as good as I would like.  We would ask people on both sides of the House to appeal to their constituents and colleagues to become registered, because if they are not registered as growers they cannot sell their potatoes.  The National Potato Co-operative, as Senator Quealy pointed out, has set up a marketing arm within the last couple of weeks.  The marketing arm will be Kinsealy Farms, FII, together with the Sugar Company and the farmers themselves, with a base in Carlow and probably storage and packaging facilities <Col N="1189" /> in Carlow as a start.</P>
    <P>We also set up a National Horticulture Co-op, funded by the State.  We are at present paying for their marketing manager: very shortly we will be paying for their chief executive until such time as they get rolling.  They will have to concentrate their efforts on the Dublin area.  I regard these things as being like an acorn &mdash; perhaps not as slow growing as an acorn &mdash; but certainly as a seed planted in the ground and you are not going to have an oak tree next day.  Progress is slow but sure.  There are other areas in horticulture, for instance the glasshouse industry, to which not enough attention is being paid.  It was in a total shambles when I took over, there was hardly any heated glass.  Fianna Fáil came up with the suggestion of cheap gas.  We explored every angle in Brussels on that suggestion.  Apart from the fact that there are very few glasshouses anywhere near a gas line, it is totally against EC policy. The one country that is doing it is at present before the courts on the basis that it is not appropriate and represents unfair trading.  We decided that by far the most sensible way to approach this was to grant-aid all glasshouses, existing and new, for conversion to solid fuel.  All solid fuel units will be grant-aided this year.  That is the correct approach.</P>
    <P>There are many other things happening in the horticulture area to which perhaps we are not paying enough attention. What is happening is comprised in a business-like, comprehensive programme. We are already roping in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  It is not appropriate to set up another semi-State body.  We are putting the onus on the farmers to set up their own co-operatives.  We will fund-aid them and give them the priming grants.</P>
    <P>It may be very misleading when we hear about the imports of vegetables. Our single biggest imports at present &mdash; which I am trying very hard to rectify &mdash; are potato chips.  They are worth about £27 million.  I have visited America on two occasions to encourage a multinational to come here.  I cannot move any faster than they are prepared to move on this.  After that the problem of looking after the import of vegetables will be <Col N="1190" /> quite small.  It will be basically related to providing vegetables in an off-season period.  We will have to look to the peninsula areas of County Kerry and County Cork and forestry areas in order to do that.  We do not have the climatic advantages of the Dutch, the Spanish or the Mediterranean nations for growing.  We have the advantage of being an island nation.  I am confident if we continue along the lines we are going, with the support of the Opposition, progress will be made.  We must be very careful in anything we do in horticulture that we do not put existing growers out of business by going headlong into over-production or into wrong types of production.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to sit again on Wednesday, 12 March.  On Wednesday it is proposed to take two orders, one in relation to coinage, the 20p piece, and one in regard to winter time.  Following that, we will take up Committee Stage of the Air Transport Bill and following that, the Second Stage of the Free Ports Bill.  If there is still time available, we will then move on to the Slaughtered and Detained Animals (Compensation) Bill.  We will resume on the Private Member's Motion commenced yesterday.  On Thursday, at present the proposal is to carry on with a number of other reports from the EC Joint Committee relating to agriculture, the report on processing and marketing of agricultural products, the report on the use of hormones as growth promoters and also, if time is available, the more recent report in regard to the perspectives for CAP, the Commission Green Paper.  However, before going to those agriculture motions, it is proposed to take, if there are still speakers offering, the conclusion of the motion that was debated this morning on the report of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 12 March 1986.</P>
