      <P>I have something here from the Office of Public Works with regard to the rapairs.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Following extensive opening up of the fabric of the building from first to attic floor level and as a result of detailed survey and calculations by our structural engineers we are advised that the faults are of a more complex character than originally feared.  It is futile to attempt to stabilize the existing walls and beams as we had hoped.</P>
      <P>The engineers recommend the following programmed approach to tackle the problem:-</P>
      <P>1.  Provide temporary support for massive timber roof trusses.</P>
      <P>2.  Repair the trusses.</P>
      <P>3.  Demolish a large part of the north gable over chamber recess.</P>
      <P>4.  Provide new beam and walling over demolished north gable in the vicinity of the attic space.</P>
      <P>5.  Re-build the damaged gable wall.</P>
      <P>6.  Repair ceiling timbers.</P>
      <P>7.  Reinstate decorative plaster work.</P>
      <P>8.  Redecorate the entire chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The engineers are currently engaged in preparation of detailed plans and documentation to enable execution of <Col N="412" /> the reconstruction and repair works. They will supply a breakdown of time scales and costings and the OPW will make these available to Seanad Members.</P>
    <P>The reconstruction work will have to be done mainly by a specialised contractor. If he is to have the work completed by October, 1987, he will be required to work after hours and at weekends as well as on those weekdays when the Seanad is not in session.  The cost of the overtime will be written into the contract.  On top of this, there will be extra hours to be worked by Leinster House supervisory and security staff but, of course, until the details are received from the Structural Engineers it is too early to give you definite information as to what is required in this report.</P>
    <P>I told Members of the Seanad that I would keep them informed of the position and that we would have the report this week.  We have it and that is the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for keeping you word to Members of the House to bring in a report from the Office of Public Works on progress in relation to the repair of the Seanad ceiling.  From having listened to you reading the report and having read it, it would appear to me that, in addition to replastering the roof or part of the roof, there is some little bit of a hole to be knocked in the wall and to be rebuilt.  I am glad to see that a specialist contractor is being brought in because despite all the verbiage in this document that is what it <Col N="413" /> amounts to &mdash; a piece of a wall is to be taken out, straightened and rebuilt.  I am confident enough that if a competent contractor is brought in this piece of gable that has to be rebuilt should not take too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>In view of the conflict, because it could be a very significant one, perhaps the Cathaoirleach will resolve by next week the question as to whether it is an independent competent contractor or whether it is an OPW contractor.  I am reasonably satisfied with the bit of progress that has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for this report which was laid before us this morning. This is dangerous because any time you open your mouth about it now you could well be in trouble.  It is lovely that if the PDs or somebody else do not decide to get rid of the Seanad, the OPW are going to knock the side wall down and shift us anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the time scale, my colleague from Clare or perhaps it was Senator Ross, asked you a question you could not possibly answer about October, 1987. There is no way we will be back in the old Seanad, whether it be by the votes of our sensible electorate or any other way, by October 1987.  I am one of the people who have shown deep concern about this.  I did not climb to the rafters yesterday evening but I climbed at an earlier stage when there seemed to be only a small crack.  Indeed, on that trip up the ladder I had with me OPW experts and geniuses and all those <Col N="414" /> people who knew what they were at, or thought they knew what they were at. Senator O'Leary was with me and he is a sensible man.  He thought they knew what they were at that evening too.</P>
    <P>Now we find ourselves in this chamber for two to three years &mdash; I do not know how many.  We, the Senators, should show our concern.  I do not mean that in a derogatory way about any Senators who have not shown their concern because everybody is concerned.  I wonder about the extent of this damage.  I know it is here before me in print this morning and I have to listen to the experts who have now found a lot more trouble there and a lot more damage, and walls etc. have to be removed. Of course you have the cost of all this.</P>
    <P>I do not like this chamber that I am in. I like being in the Seanad but I do not like the room I am in.  There are extra hours for supervisory and security staff to be covered.  There is no way we will be in the old Chamber by October 1987.  We will be there by election, but we will not be there by the men in the OPW.  I have the same respect for the OPW that everybody else has, but I am deeply concerned about the extent of the work they have now laid before us which has to be done.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his concern and for the report before us today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to the top of the trusses yesterday.  I had seen the lower part of them before.  I am satisfied that the amount of work proposed to be done &mdash; whatever about the time scale &mdash; needs to be done.  If Senators had not drawn attention to this extremely dangerous crack it is obvious that the wall would have collapsed. If we are to thank ourselves at all we should thank ourselves for drawing attention to the defects in the wall particularly over the Cathaoirleach's recess.  Having seen the work yesterday at the highest level, it is obvious that it is a major job and whether it is enginered by the Office of Public Works or directed by them it needs experts.  I am sure we have them in the Office of Public Works but they are talking about having further expertise available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing is that whatever <Col N="415" /> is done is done properly, so that the finished job will be something we can all be proud of.  There is no point in doing a botched job now, plastering over it and having it collapse in ten years' time.  There is a responsibility on us &mdash; and it is accepted by the OPW &mdash; to have it done correctly and as quickly as possible.  If we want it before the end of October 1987, which we all do, it means that these people will have to work outside the sitting hours of the House.  This House is sitting more often and for longer periods so the amount of time available to them is more restricted. That is the dichotomy in the problem we have.  It is a good report and I want to thank the Cathaoirleach for bringing it in and affording us the opportunity to see it at first hand and to compliment the OPW on the effort they are making to have the job done correctly.  Anyone who does not know what is to be done could not be forgiven.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is the fourth time I have seen the work.  I am sorry Senator Honan was not with us yesterday at the upper extremes of the House where she would have seen the level of the work that needs to be done.  It is a big job and it has to be done properly because we have responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we in the real world at all?  Was it not in July 1985 that the Office of Public Works took control of this property?  Are we really saying that between July 1985 and now &mdash; never mind what is going to happen in the future &mdash; all the Office of Public Works have done is to assess the problem?  Is there any indication that they have done anything other than assess the problem between July 1985 and December 1986?  The thing is daft.  I will not be a party to congratulating them on anything because not only is it <Col N="416" /> beginning to look as if those of us who will not be in the next Seanad will not be in the Chamber, but those of us who will be elected will never meet in the Chamber even if the Government selected last for a full four or five years.  In a period of one year and a half they have now succeeded in assessing the problem.  It is no wonder we are the way we are.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I indicated what I hoped would have been the business today and in the days between now and 19 December and I remarked that there were uncertainties.  The uncertainties have already overcome us in that the Air Pollution Bill did not complete Committee Stage last night and accordingly we are not in a position to move straight to the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill today.  I propose for the Order of Business today Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and to deal with them in the following fashion.</P>
      <P>Item No. 1. is the formal fixing of Second Stage for another Bill which has been introduced into the Seanad.  I would propose that we should then continue the Committee Stage of the Air Pollution Bill and continue that until 4 p.m.  If the Air Pollution Bill has not been completed by 4 p.m. we should then pass to the Second Stage of the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill. If the House has completed whatever number of stages it wishes of that Bill before 7 p.m.  I would suggest that we should finish the motion on Development in Southern Africa.  There are very few speakers still offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other matters I want to mention on the Order of Business.  One is in regard to the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill of which we will be taking Second Stage on Thursday.  This is a Bill to allow certain persons to vote who up to this have not been able to vote in elections.  I do not imagine there will be any dispute on it but nevertheless in case the circumstance did arise that an individual Member claimed a division this would mean that we could <Col N="417" /> not determine the Second Stage until Wednesday next and we could not proceed to Committee Stage today nor proceed to Committee Stage on Tuesday next.  I am now suggesting on the Order of Business that for the purpose of that Bill today we suspend the Order of the House of 29 October 1986 which allows the postponement of a division.  In other words, if a division is called for today on that Bill the question of the division will be determined.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to raise is that at the conclusion of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill on Committee in the Seanad yesterday, I was not in the House at the time the order was made on that occasion that Report Stage be taken on Wednesday 10 December.  It gives us more flexibility in regard to our arrangements if that order could be replaced by an Order for Tuesday 9 December so that we would be able to take it either on the Tuesday or the Wednesday.  I do not want to make that a specific proposition at the moment because Senator Fallon who is Opposition spokesman in regard to this matter is not present. I will consult with him in the course of the day but for the information of Members I wish to indicate that I have in mind to propose the discharge of the order for Wednesday and replace it by an order for Tuesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House seems to think the Air Pollution Bill will not conclude until 4 o'clock.  Other Senators think it may conclude by lunchtime. If that happens we then go on the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill.  The Leader of the House has suggested that we sit until 7 o'clock.  I am in favour of finishing that Bill but if we finish No. 3 by 5 o'clock we should adjourn.  Not too many Senators will be anxious to speak on the other item at that stage.  When Senator Fallon comes into the House we will discuss the Clinical Trials Bill with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill I do not see any immediate urgency about this because a special register will have to be prepared and I do not see it as being operative until <Col N="418" /> after the 15th April I cannot see any need to rush it through the House.  I suggest that we open the debate on Second Stage but some of us will have to leave the House before 7 o'clock.  Would the Leader of the House take that into consideration?  I am spokesman on the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill but I will not have to leave earlier than that.  We could take the conclusion of the Second Stage and the remaining stages on Tuesday or some day next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business.  I wish to move that Item No. 22, the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill, 1986, be taken first this morning and that it be taken to the conclusion of Second Stage this morning.  I move this amendment and in moving it I presume I am entitled to explain why.  The reason I am moving the amendment is the disgraceful way this Bill was treated in this House last night.  I do not expect Private Members' Bills to be given priority by the Government.  I do not expect Private Members' Bills to be allowed to take up a disproportionate amount of the business of this House, but I am entitled to expect that as a Member of this House what I or any other Member proposes to be discussed in this House should at least be discussed seriously and should at least be responded to seriously. We had, first of all last night, after three hours of debate, either the unwillingness or the fear of the Minister, which prevented her from speaking on the issue at all. Now this is a fundamental issue which affects well over a million people and the Minister for Social Welfare ran away from the issue and declined to speak.  I do not know if that was a Government decision or a personal decision.  It does not really matter because of the question of collective responsibility.  That is the second time a Private Members' Bill from Independent Members has been treated like that.  The Abolition of Capital Punishment Bill was treated like that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second reason for wanting to move it is the equally disgraceful behaviour of a former Cathaoirleach of this House and Deputy Leader of Fine Gael in the House <Col N="419" /> who filibustered for 35 minutes, talked about everything except the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill and stopped on the dot of 8 o'clock.  I am not used to being treated like that in this House and, because I am not used to being treated like that, I am usually unaware and uncertain about how to deal with that sort of treatment.  As I have said frequently, under the leadership of Senator Dooge, I have come to feel that this House is taken seriously, that all Members of this House are treated equally and that all issues raised seriously by Members of this House, are treated seriously.  That was not done last night, either by the Minister or by the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael in this House and I am confident that the Leader of the House was not a party to such carry-on.  It is because of that and because I want to register my clear, fundamental and utter disgust at being treated like that &mdash; it was my first experience in this House of being treated like that &mdash; that I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we conclude discussion on the Second Stage of Item 22 before we go on to any other business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second this amendment proposed by Senator Ryan.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan, what is your amendment and where is it to go in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Order of Business be amended and that No. 22 be taken first and be taken to the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I also do not believe for one moment that the Leader of the House who treats this House extremely seriously, was a party to this appalling treatment of this Bill last night.  I am extremely surprised to hear that this happened because when I have raised matters here and the Leader of the House has said to me: &ldquo;We will not give Government time to it, but you have your own time for it&rdquo;, I have accepted that as being genuine, if inconvenient for us. As Senator Ryan says, this is the second time we have used our time for serious Bills in this House and it is the second time <Col N="420" /> the Government has treated them with a certain amount of contempt.</P>
      <P>The first time this happened was when I proposed the Abolition of Capital Punishment Bill in this House nearly two years ago.  I have not chosen to take it in Independent Members' Time since, for two reasons.  The first reason is that I hoped the Government would introduce such a Bill and the second is that when it was proposed in this House, Deputy Noonan, who was Minister for Justice at the time, sat it out and the Fine Gael Party gave us no indication of what their position on that Bill was.</P>
      <P>There is no point in Independent Members proposing Bills or Motions in this House if the Government are going to refuse even to respond to them, positively or negatively, and while one would prefer a positive response to the Social Welfare (Appeals Tribunals) Bill last night and the Abolition of Capital Punishment Bill, it is treating us with contempt and the House with contempt, if the Government put up one of their own members to filibuster the Bill and the Minister refuses to take a position on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan will recognise that last week when I spoke in Private Members' time on this Bill I personally welcomed the introduction of this Private Members' Bill and I said I hoped time would be made available for the continuation of discussion on this Bill and that I looked forward to the Minister's response this week in the House.  I had hoped that would have taken place.  I was unaware until now of what happened.  I was not in the House at that time because I was involved with deputations from my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if this happened on what is fundamentally a good Bill.  The detail might be defective, faulty or otherwise but at least an effort was made in this Bill to redress some of the problems in this area. I would have hoped that the Minister would have made a positive response in the House and then we would see where we are going on it.  I must remind Senator Ryan that the Government have a priority on legislative time and that is the only <Col N="421" /> reason I would oppose the change in the Order of Business today.  We have very important business from the Government's point of view.  That does not take from my view of Senator Ryan's Bill and I will assist in every way possible to ensure that it gets a proper reading in this House and that we try to make time available even if we have to postpone discussion on reports of Oireachtas joint committees to facilitate him.  The Bill should have been treated better than that in the House.  I certainly was not a party to what happened and I am sorry it has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points which have been raised.  Firstly, I accept the suggestion from Senator Willie Ryan that the finishing time today should be 5 p.m. rather than 7 p.m. I think we should still try to make as much progress as possible on the Air Pollution Bill.  In regard to the Electoral Bill and the point made by Senator Martin O'Toole in regard to this Bill, I feel, in fact, that this House should deal with this Bill as soon as possible.  While we who have studied the detail of the Bill can appreciate the actual time of its coming into operation, I think any putting off of discussion on this Bill might be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet the case which in fact, should have been remedied long before now.  I would suggest that we should make every effort to take the Second Stage of this Bill today.  I think Senator Martin O'Toole has this in his own hands to some extent since he also is the spokesman in regard to the Air Pollution Bill.  I feel there is time today before 5 p.m. to complete both the Air Pollution Bill on Committee and to take the Second Stage of the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill.  Only if both of these are done before 5 p.m. should we than turn to attempt to complete the report on the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the amendment that was moved, I was not in the House for Private Members' Business because I was at a meeting in the precincts of the House.  All I know and can say positively from my own knowledge in this regard is that, when this <Col N="422" /> was discussed with the Fine Gael Group four or five Members of the Fine Gael Party expressed a desire to speak on this Bill from the point of view of supporting the principle of the Bill and the necessity for reform in regard to the appeals system, but expressing doubts whether the manner in which it was being done in the Bill were not so cumbersome as to render it ineffective. The other point I can state from my positive knowledge, because it was part of my duty as Leader of the House to ascertain it, was that the Minister had a speech prepared and the Minister was ready to speak at an appropriate time during the debate.  So, in fact, a ministerial speech was prepared and ready to be delivered. Apart from the two Fine Gael Members who spoke yesterday there were two other Fine Gael Members who also wished to speak on this.</P>
    <P>Naturally, as Leader of the House, with an extremely crowded agenda between now and the end of December, I certainly cannot be expected to do anything else but resist any attempt to replace Government business by Private Members' Business at this stage.  Whether we can find a gap somewhere in the last or second last week in order to continue the discussion of that Bill is a matter that I am prepared to discuss.</P>

      <P>I would suggest, in regard to the matter of a lunch adjournment, that if the Air Pollution Bill, 1986; concludes at a reasonable time there should be an hour's adjournment.  I am thinking in particular of Senator Martin O'Toole, who is spokesman for the Opposition both in regard to air pollution and electoral law. We would not like to see Senator Martin O'Toole faint from weakness on the floor of the House.  No. 1 is the Order for the Second Stage of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1986.  Again, I would like to thank the Minister and the Government for introducing a Bill into the Seanad, even though we seem to have quite a surfeit of Bills at present.  It is a very welcome development.  I am not certain when this Bill can be fitted in, whether it can be fitted in between now and the recess, so I just suggest we deal with the formal matters and order the Second Stage for next Tuesday, 9 December 1986 with no guarantee it will be taken on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just say in reference to our discussion here last night that in the immediacy of our exchanges on section 14, the section dealing with powers of authorised persons, I referred to powers of entry under a number of related codes of legislation.  I am afraid that I may have confused the position under the Planning Acts, 1963, the Water Pollution Act, 1977, and the Public Health Acts, altogether as it were.  I would now like to set the record straight, in case I inadvertently confused any of the Senators on this.  The Planning Acts allow entry by an authorised person on land &mdash; and this includes houses and all other structures &mdash; in two ways.  The first is without any notice, and this is what we were referring to, but is subject to the consent of the occupier.  I want to make that quite clear in case I gave the impression it would be otherwise.  Secondly, where consent is refused it is subject to 14 days' notice.  What we were talking about in relation to other codes of legislation stands, but under the Planning Acts that is the <i>de facto</i> situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions reflect the generally more static nature of the controls, structures and so forth operated under the <Col N="425" /> Planning Acts.  As we stated last night, the Public Health Acts, for the purpose of examining as to the existence of nuisance, allow entry on all premises without notice. So does the Water Pollution Act, 1977, in the context of urgent action to abate water pollution.  Lest I inadvertently misled any Senator &mdash; we had so many exchanges and went back and forth on so many sections &mdash; I just want to make that quite clear.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 16, this amendment inserts a preamble already contained in section 23 of this Bill.  Section 10 of the Local Government Sanitary Services Act, 1962, which this section, effectively replaces, contains a similar although differently worded preamble. This amendment relates section 25 more definitely to the general purpose of the Bill, that is, to control air pollution.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 25, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25(2)(e) states that regulations may:</P>
      <P>prohibit or restrict, subject to such exceptions as may be specified, the burning of straw, waste or any other substance at such premises or at such times as may be specified.</P>
      <P>This is with regard to regulations which the Minister may make prohibiting or restricting the emission into the atmosphere of smoke from any premises.  The definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is given on page 8, section 7:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;premises&rdquo; includes any messuage, building, structure or land (Whether or not there are structures on the land or whether or not the land is covered with water) or any hereditament of any tenure, together with any out-buildings and curtilage;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear exactly what is prohibited in this area.  On its face value it seems that farmers will be prevented from burning straw on their land because premises includes land, according to the definition in the Act.  Also I am aware that in the recent <Col N="426" /> past, when the increase in oil prices became acute, there were heating systems installed which used straw.  I do not think there are very many of them, if there are any at all at present.  I have no information with regard to that.  The burning of straw does create a certain amount of smoke and I do know that in the travel books of previous centuries Arthur Young and other authors referred to the &ldquo;pernicious practice&rdquo; of burning straw.  Again I am not clear whether it was burned on the land or burned in the houses; but that at that time, when most of the houses were thatched, it would have seemed to be rather dangerous to burn straw in the house. Nevertheless, it was a common practice. In regard to the burning of straw in a central heating furnace, I feel we should have control under the terms of the Bill. However, in regard to farming in an agricultural country, and I do not think the practice is very widespread &mdash; in reality straw is only burned in cases where the cost of harvesting the straw is less than the remuneration to be got from the sale of the straw.  I feel this section would place a very severe restriction on farmers, and under the terms of this section I feel also that a local authority will not have the power to alter the regulations to allow, for example, the burning of straw in a particular situation. Therefore, we should think again about that.  The burning of straw on land in a rural setting is not like the situation we have in a built-up area.  Having regard to all the factors perhaps the Minister would look again at this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that on Second Stage some Senators were concerned about this section.  I recall I addressed the matter somewhat at that time in my reply to Second Stage and I would like to assure Senator Fitzsimons that we appreciate the growing practice among farmers particularly on the eastern seaboard who are burning straw &mdash; burning stubble as well has been a long practice in this country.  We do not intend any blanket prohibition on the burning of straw.  I draw attention to section 25 (1) which states that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;, not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The reason for an enabling section here is to <Col N="427" /> have control in the future, if needs be, if this should grow into a problem.  Straw burning is an increasing feature of modern agricultural practice and while it may not, as yet, have any deleterious effect of any consequence, a power to regulate is considered desirable by the Minister.  We do not expect to have any difficulties with farmers in once off situations who just want to burn stubble or straw.  It is only in case there is a continuing nuisance created on a regular basis.  I refer Senators to section 4 &mdash; effectively creating air pollution.  The burning of straw would have to be to such an extent as to be liable to:</P>
      <P>(i) be injurious to public health, or</P>
      <P>(ii) have a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or damage property, or</P>
      <P>(iii) impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment.</P>
      <P>They would be the only occasions on which the Minister might invoke this section.  It is not to deal with a nuisance or to irritate the once off situation that arises in farms from time to time.  That is not intended.  The farmer would have to be causing air pollution under one or all of those criteria that we discussed here yesterday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Also there is the possibility that a person, a farmer or whoever, would for whatever reason burn large quantities of straw at somebody's boundary wall, or cause a nuisance in the neighbourhood in that sense.  We would like to be in a position to be able to control that.  That would be the exception where there may be less than good relationships between neighbours. We feel that an enabling section is necessary for the future so that, if necessary, we can come in and control a very acceptable practice if it happened to get out of hand and cause pollution.  We are trying to protect the environment, to protect human health and not to irritate any section.  It is in all our best interests, including the farmer, that we have this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the practice of using straw for central heating or solid fuel heating <Col N="428" /> systems of any kind, that is not affected by the Bill.  Effectively the burning of straw would be inside an oven or a container of some kind.  Other sections of the Bill may apply in that case but it will not be affected in this section.  I would like to put the Senator's mind at ease about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said and I have no doubt that is the intention.  I am not too sure whether the case might be taken out of the Minister's hands.  For example, in section 28 an individual would have certain rights and powers.  We know the problems that have arisen, for example, where there is a proliferation of houses in a rural area. In certain circumstances objections have been made to certain farming exercises. For example, houses have been erected in a rural environment and when a farmer set out to build a silage pit, objections have been lodged.  This is wrong.  In a primarily agricultural country the farmer should not be inhibited in that way.  It appears from what the Minister said it could be suggested that with a vindictive motive the farmer would burn straw.  That would be very exceptional.  While it is in the Bill, there is the possibility that somebody in a rural setting might object to the burning of straw and then it would be taken out of the Minister's hands.</P>

      <P>I refer the Senator to section 28 which applies to any instance of air pollution, not specifically to straw burning: &ldquo;The High Court may, on the application of a local authority or any other person, by order, prohibit or restrict an emission from any premises where the court is satisfied that&rdquo;: (a), (b) and (c) are complied with.  That is not specific to straw burning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither should it exclude straw burning.  It will be up to the court to decide whether it is a vexatious claim or motivated by anything less than honourable considerations.  Third parties should be able to have some redress if they <Col N="429" /> have genuine cause to complain in relation to this area.  Already this is the situation under the Planning Acts and various other Acts.  An Bord Pleanála, for example, have to consider whether appeals are vexatious or whether they are genuinely well grounded.  It would be somewhat similar in this case.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure Senator Fitzsimons that 99.9 per cent of straw burning by farmers is once off and causes absolutely no problem.  It is a practice we are all accustomed to and I have no doubt it will continue.  With this as an enabling section to ensure that if a problem should arise in the future that could be defined under section 4(i), (ii), and (iii), in other words the definition of air pollution, the Minister would be in a position to do something about it.</P>
      <P>This is what this Bill is all about, to prevent air pollution and to prevent injury to human health and the environment.  It is purely enabling.  I do not see any threat to existing practices except in the very rare case where they may already be causing air pollution as so defined in section 4.  I do not think any farmer or anybody involved in agriculture practices has anything to worry about in once off situations of burning straw or stubble.  It is not intended to be in any way restricted to that category of person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to us that the section as it stands excludes confirmation with regard to this particular phrasing and that it would improve the section to amend it as we have <Col N="430" /> suggested by including the word &ldquo;confirm&rdquo;.  Perhaps it would be better to have provision for an appeal to an independent body such as An Bord Pleanála rather than the Minister.  We feel there should be provision for an appeal in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that these amendments seek to bring greater clarity to the procedures concerned, perhaps they are somewhat misconceived.  The presumption in both sections is that the notice once made should stand but that there should be a period within which representations against the notice, or against some aspect of it, must be entertained by the local authority.  Arising from these representations the local authority may then modify or revoke their notice in favour of the complainant concerned. If they decide that the notice should not be amended or revoked there is no need for the permit.  The notice simply stands as originally served.  I do not see what could be gained for the rights of any individual by accepting these amendments. There is no way in which the courts would uphold an enforcement action on a notice by a local authority in advance of a statutory period within which the public may seek annulment or modification of a notice. It follows that enforcement action will not arise until the possibility of any modification of a notice has lapsed.</P>

      <P>In page 17, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where any person feels aggrieved by the decision of the local authority under <i>subsection (5),</i> an appeal may be made to the Minister within a period of twenty-one days.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is wrong that a local authority with wide ranging powers can require the party to comply with the notice and the party has no appeal except back to the local authority.  It should go back to An Bord Pleanála or the Court.  I would like the <Col N="431" /> Minister's comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Both these amendments oppose the idea of representations regarding notices being dealt with finally at local authority level.  They seek to add a further procedure of appeal to the Minister for the Environment.  I shall be defending the principle of appeal in relation to amendment No. 34 but in the case of the present two amendments a formal appeal system is not warranted.</P>
      <P>Section 26 is virtually identical to section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which has proved crucial to the whole operation of water pollution control.  Hundreds of notices have been served under section 12 and we have not as far as I know had any serious representations that the absence of an appeal to the Minister for the Environment has resulted in injustice to the public.  This is a well tried and practised procedure under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and has proved crucial to the successful operation of this Act.  What is certain, on the other hand, is that, if such a right of appeal existed, the speed and effectiveness of this provision would be blunted with the consequent reduction in its value as a measure for pollution control.</P>
      <P>On section 44 we will be dealing with a situation where a special control area, carefully considered in the light of all objections at an oral hearing, will have been confirmed by the Minister for the Environment.  The principle that certain types of control should apply to certain classes of property will also have been established in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If after all of this we are then, as this amendment proposes, to allow each householder to convey individual objections beyond the local authority and to the Minister for the Environment, the administration of the control measures involved will be rendered inoperable.  The implementing powers of the local authority would be seen to be weakened and there would be every encouragement for householders to object again to the principle of air pollution control measures <Col N="432" /> already decided on in the context of the order.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) brings us back to a matter we discussed on section 18. Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to a local authority that it is necessary so to do in order to prevent or to limit air pollution, the local authority may serve a notice under this section on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission.</P>
      <P>This should be modified as follows:</P>
      <P>Where it appears necessary after detailed analysis and research to a local authority to prevent or to limit air pollution, the local authority may serve a notice under this section on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission.</P>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  In an important area such as this, any steps taken should only be taken on the basis of a very thorough scientific survey.  I do not think this is costly, and even if it is, it should still be carried out.  The powers given to a local authority are very extensive.  Before a decision is made by a local authority the actual situation should be set out and clarified to determine whether there is pollution and what steps need to be taken.  If the scientific evidence suggests that steps should be taken, clearly under the terms of the Bill they should be taken.  This power should not be given to a local authority where a scientific survey proves that there is no need to involve the powers given under this Bill.</P>

      <P>This section empowers the local authority to serve a notice requiring the occupier of any premises to take such measures as the local authority consider necessary to prevent or limit air pollution.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment as proposed by the Senator.  The meanings are quite explicit. <Col N="433" /> I must refer again to the definition of &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; in section 4:</P>
      <P>(i)  be injurious to public health, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  have a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or damage property, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment.</P>
      <P>It would only be under one of those categories that such a notice would be issued by the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, has similar powers which are well tried and practised and have proved to be very necessary in the successful operation of that Act.  In the Senator's opinion that Act has not been successful.  I disagree with that.  There are some difficulties in certain areas of the country with it, but overall it has made a tremendous difference to what otherwise might have been in this very important area.</P>

Surely it is wrong that a local authority with wide ranging powers can require the party served with the notice to comply with the notice and such party has no appeal but except back to the local authority.  We feel the appeal should be back to An Bord Pleanála or to the court. Does the Minister feel it is right that the appeal should go back to the local authority rather than to An Bord Pleanála or the court.  Perhaps the Minister could define when a local authority is mentioned if that means the manager or the members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the issue we are talking about.  It is the manager, as it is an executive function.  I am satisfied with this provision.  It is well tried and practised under the Local Government (Water <Col N="434" /> Pollution) Act, 1977, and section 12 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to a local authority that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent or control pollution of waters, it may serve a notice in writing under this section on any person having the custody or control of any polluting matter on premises in its functional area.</P>
      <P>This is an equivalent provision in this Bill. There could be once off instances of pollution.  They could be serious or they need not be so serious.  There could be ongoing instances of pollution, some continuous operation that is causing air pollution as defined under section 4 of this Bill. If we were to allow a procedure of appeal to An Bord Pleanála or any other party, we would be effectively saying that we would ignore the continuing pollution incident for another two or three months until the matter was resolved.  I do not think that is satisfactory because of the very nature of the Bill we are dealing with and because there already is a well tried precedent in other control legislation, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied when a notice is served that the person on whom the notice is served will not have an appeal except back to the local authority that served that notice.  I think that is irregular.  I feel that it should be back to an independent body such as the courts or An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister made provision earlier whereby for a continuing offence there is a fine of £100 in one case, and of £1,000 in another.  That is sufficient to cover the continuance of air pollution or any other pollution under the Act.  An independent body such as An Bord Pleanála or the courts should be the deciding body on an appeal rather than the local authority, or the manager &mdash; in this case, it is back to the manager to decide. Surely the man who serves the notice is judge and jury over that particular case when it should be, in my view, an independent body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I disagree <Col N="435" /> with the Senator.  If any citizen feels aggrieved under the whole area of natural justice he will have recourse to the courts. What is intended here is not licensing or anything else; it is purely the serving of an enforcement notice to ask the occupier, or the person concerned, to sort out the problem as it may be defined.  It is long before we get to the courts when we talk about £100 a day or £1,000 a day as we were discussing yesterday.  Hopefully, this would prevent the person concerned having to go in to the courts.  As is our experience under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, normally action will be taken to rectify the problem, to rectify whatever happens to be causing the area of pollution.  It could be in the interest of the person concerned that it be drawn to their attention that something is amiss in this area under section 4, as we define it.  It gives them the opportunity to put their house or their premises as it were, in order.  Indeed, I would expect it to prevent an enormous number of instances of pollution ever getting to court.  This practice has worked very successfully under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  The type of problem we are dealing with does not allow us the luxury of two or three months system of appeal to whatever authority you suggest, because if we are serious about environmental protection we must sort out these problems fairly quickly.  It is in the interest of everyone, including the person on whom this enforcement notice is served.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has answered adequately, if it all, the matter I raised with regard to scientific surveys.  Having regard to the powers that local authority gets under this Act, and also having regard to the very punitive penalties, under no circumstances should a local authority proceed with regard to their powers under this Act except after a detailed scientific survey.  I know that we dealt with that on section 18 and it will be coming up again.  It is central to the Bill.  It is of fundamental importance. The Minister should make some concession in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>From a practical point of view, if an instance of pollution is looking at you in the face, a detailed scientific survey would be a further delaying tactic, with respect.  They have not been deemed necessary in respect of instances of water pollution.  A considered and informed judgment is necessary for the person concerned who is investigating the difficulty.  I think that should suffice in this case.  These instances of pollution could literally be once-off, although they could be extremely serious in their nature.  But, if a scientific survey was undertaken, there could be enormous damage done to either human health or the environment in the area by the very delay that would cause.</P>
      <P>May I point out again to the Senator that under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, even though it is not specifically provided for in that legislation, local authorities in practice send out advice letters pointing out the difficulty, or the area of problem, before enforcement notices are served?  For example, in 1985 there were 2,360 investigations in the country under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  Subsequently advice letters were sent to 2,000 people &mdash; in other words, something was found amiss under that Act in 2,000 case.  It was only necessary to follow that up with enforcement notices, which we are talking about now, in 374 of those 2,000 cases. In practice the local authority handles this very pragmatically and there is absolutely no unnecessary hassling of any individual in relation to that.  It is in the local authority's interest, and it is in all our interests, that we get our environmental controls in place and properly operating. Two thousand advice letters, which are not provided for under that Act, were sent out advising people that something was amiss and in only 374 cases were enforcement notices necessary.  Subsequently, only a very small number of that 374 &mdash; a handful or so; I do not have figures &mdash; had to end up in court when they did not answer the enforcement notice.  This practice is well accepted by the public at large and is in the best interest of the common good.</P>

      <P>There can be a <Col N="437" /> difficulty here.  Annual polluting of the air as a once-off operation was referred to earlier &mdash; the burning of straw or of stubble, particularly adjacent to built-up areas.  In my area of county Dublin, where we have an enormous increase in population, we try to leave green belts and, as far as is possible, to keep them for agriculture; but it is becoming more and more difficult.  That is a difficulty in the Dublin area and, I am sure, in Limerick and Cork also, where there is a large population concentrated.  As a natural part of living, air pollution will increase.  But a farmer, a landowner or a contractor who is carrying out an operation that has been carried out for centuries &mdash; the burning of the stubble before reploughing &mdash; can be the one at whom the finger will be pointed because he has put the level of pollution over what it should be; whereas others cause a certain amount of pollution throughout the year, but it does not rise above a level which would be worrying to a local authority.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will say that stubble burning is a once-off operation and that the time the notice takes effect the burning is over.  That person can be warned that he is not to do it again; but the time will come 12 months later, when he will be required to do it again.  There is a difficulty here for somebody carrying out such an operation. On the overall yearly average he does less polluting than anybody else in the area, but yet he is the person who will be blamed because at the time he does it he causes an enormous amount of pollution.  This would not be noticed if it was in the Minister's county or Senator Fitzsimon's county, but when it is in my part of the country everybody notices it and I get a shower of complaints which I pass on to the local authority.  Action is taken under the Planning Acts at present but now it will be taken under this Bill.  I can see a difficulty here for agricultural operations adjacent to built-up areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should give some consideration to this.  In other words, they will blame the person who now causes the pollution for two, three or four days, whereas there are other contributors to the <Col N="438" /> high level of pollution and they are there all the time.  It is the last straw, if the House will excuse the pun, that breaks the camel's back.  In other words, the contractor is coming in to burn the straw and he will not be required to do it again for another 12 months.  He is the person who will be blamed for polluting the air.  Some such provision should be made.  There may be other operations but that is the one I am thinking of because I have been concerned about it in my own area and it has already happened there.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator McMahon that there are different instances such as the once-off situation, the urban and the rural situation, but we are referring here to the power of a local authority to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit air pollution.  Quite apart from the penalties involved, these measures could be quite costly in some instances.  Without a scientific survey is the Minister saying, for example, that some official could just walk around, sniff and determine that certain measures are necessary?  Surely there is some way of using scientific instruments to determine the pollution level and to monitor it over a period.  Everybody agrees this will not be brought in overnight and, indeed, it will be done in stages. Surely what Senator McMahon has said underlines in a far more emphatic way than I have stated already the necessity for a scientific survey.  In spite of what the Minister says, with regard to section 18, this section and subsequent sections which the basis of any steps taken by a local authority under this Bill must be related to a necessity which is shown through a scientific survey and monitored over a period to overcome the problem with regard to a once-off problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rule out scientific surveys in all cases.  There may be complicated and sophisticated incidents of pollution when they will be absolutely necessary.  Sophisticated monitoring equipment will be needed to find out what our problem is and to determine base line activities and levels in certain areas and to be able to measure what the increase over <Col N="439" /> that will be.  If there is a pollution incident I do not think we should put it as a universal requirement in this section.  I would imagine most pollution incidents were such that a well qualified or well informed judgment would be able to point them out, or indeed, point to the polluter if I use the correct term &mdash; or the potential polluter, the risks involved and thereby allow him to rectify the matter before it ever comes to an enforcement notice or to court.  The procedure is well tried, as I have said, under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and is extremely successful.  It has prevented many of these smaller incidents from getting to court and has prevented many smaller incidents from becoming big incidents in relation to pollution and damage to our environment.  Whether the incidence of pollution is small or big it must be possible to define it under section 4 of the Bill.  I have mentioned those twice this morning and I refer the Senators to it.</P>
      <P>On section 25 I dealt at some length with straw burning incidents and I assure Senator McMahon that we are not after the once off or annual burning of straw and stubble which is a well accepted and common practice, particularly on the east coast and in Ireland generally.  It is becoming increasingly popular and it is only if there is a nuisance caused to such extent that effectively it is causing air pollution, as defined in section 4, that we are enabling the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word is &ldquo;may&rdquo;, not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in that section and we do not envisage it interfering at all with normal agricultural practice.  Only when air pollution is caused by it would the once off burning of straw be considered injurious to public health or having a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or, indeed, damaging property.  Nor would a once off incident of straw burning impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment &mdash; bar that it was done in central Dublin or in the centre of any of the other rural cities which it is not.  That is not what is intended.  It is an enabling section for the future, or should the situation arise that constant difficulty was <Col N="440" /> being caused which could be defined as air pollution under section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept most of what the Minister has said but I do not think she has a real grasp of the position particularly in the Dublin area.  It may not happen in other areas in the country, but in the Dublin area at present the burning of stubble is causing pollution which, I believe, is well above the standard level. The person carrying out the burning, where it has been carried out for centuries, is the person who is going to suffer, whereas it is those who have come into the aea who have put the pollution above the standard level.  It is really the newcomer who is getting away with it, for example factories or chimneys may be causing pollution.  They naturally bring it up to a level where there is an enormous burst of pollution, as there will be with the burning of stubble.</P>
      <P>If that is to continue on an annual basis, that operator will be warned that, if he does it again, he will be prosecuted.  He will get away with it for one or two years.  Even though it is of short duration, he will suffer despite the fact that he was there long before anybody thought we would have a Bill of this kind.  He is the unfortunate person who is now being caught because somebody else has raised the pollution level.  When he burns his straw annually I have no doubt he can be caught under this section, despite what the Minister says.</P>
      <P>For the vast area of the country it does not matter.  Nobody pays heed to the burning of straw.  Sometimes it is a welcome sign that the harvest is over and many people are delighted to see the straw burning and many children gather to see it burning in fields.  In County Dublin and surrounding areas it is a different matter now because of the serious pollution of the air.  The Minister should give some consideration to those who have been operating for centuries and causing nobody any trouble.  Now they will be accused of causing a serious health hazard simply because somebody else has raised the pollution level before the burning of the stubble.  There is a serious problem no matter how we look at it.</P>

I do not want to labour the point but rather to get back to the question of a scientific survey.</P>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister says. As I understand it, a well intentioned official could determine what measures are necessary and whether there is a problem. We have An Foras Forbartha, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and all the university graduates who are qualified in this area.  It is wrong that powers under this Act should be used except on the basis of a scientific survey. We have spoken about this and it seems the Minister still remains unconvinced.  We have the alternative of putting down an amendment on Report Stage but having regard to the powers which are given to local authorities under this Bill and the very substantial penalties it is naive of the Minister to suggest that the responsibility for involving firms in very heavy costs under the provisions this Bill should be vested in somebody without any qualifications in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so long ago. I seem to have spent just as much time in Dublin since I left as I have in the country, for different reasons.  I do know exactly what are the problems.  If you like, it is a general conflict of the urbanisation of the countryside, demographic moves, people <Col N="442" /> moving from rural areas to Dublin.  I might refer the Senator to section 26 (1), which states:</P>
      <P>... the local authority may serve a notice under this section on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission.</P>
      <P>They cannot serve a notice if they think there will be an emission, or if they know there will be one next harvest or if there has been one.  The once-off straw-burning is over in a couple of hours.  As we all know, if it is dry, it burns very quickly. It can be rather nasty if one is in the immediate area.  There has to be an actual emission for this notice to be served.  One cannot be putting farmers on notice for next harvest or the previous harvest.  It is unlikely that an official will be standing outside the fence waiting for them to light the match and then go in with the notice. In practice, unless there is a continuing air pollution problem from straw-burning, as could be defined under section 4 (i), (ii) and (iii), I do not see any well-tried and practised procedure of our agricultural community under threat, unless there is continuous air pollution and it is affecting human health or the environment on that basis.  If it is, even if it discommodes a few, I am afraid we have to be serious about it. However, I do not think it will affect those about whom concern was expressed here today.</P>
      <P>I have already given my views on scientific research and qualified people to which Senator Fitzsimons referred.  If the Senator looks at the Water Pollution Act, he will see that there were 2,360 investigations. If before we investigated it or served enforcement notices, we had to have 2,360 scientific surveys, there would be very little done in relation to controlling environmental pollution or air pollution. I do not think it is justified.  However, I do not rule it out.  There will be complicated cases where we will have to have such a procedure.  But I do not accept that we need a universal provision for it in all cases.</P>

      <P>Section 27 (2) states:</P>
      <P>(2) Where a local authority take steps, carry out operations or give assistance under this section, the local authority may recover the costs of such steps, operations or assistance as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction from such person as the local authority satisfy the court is the person whose act or omission necessitated such steps, operations or assistance.</P>
      <P>I assume that, in this instance, the local authority will have the option of not attempting to recover the costs.  In other words, in every instance, a local authority would not insist or feel it was proper to recover the costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables local authorities to take steps to prevent or limit air pollution in cases of urgency.  A similar power is contained in section 13 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  Environmental type legislation is well tried and practised in that respect.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) enables a local authority to recover the costs incurred by them in taking measures under this section as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction from such person as they satisfy the court is the person whose act or omission necessitated the measures. I might draw the Houses' attention to the relevant portion of this subsection: &ldquo;the local authority may recover&rdquo;; it is not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; recover.  Therefore, there is discretion left there.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that that option obtains because in certain circumstances I could envisage a scenario in which the carrying out of those urgent measures would be very costly, one which some firms might be unable to finance.  In certain circumstances this might be the breaking point for some firms.  My understanding is that in taking such urgent <Col N="444" /> measures a local authority would not be constrained by costs.  The implementation of the necessary measures might be a very costly operation.  Perhaps a firm, given the option, would close down rather than get involved in such costs.  It appears to me here that a particular firm might not have that option, that the work would be carried out by the local authority and the firm would be responsible for payment.</P>

I am thinking of rescue operations for animals, or cases of flooding where the fire brigade have to come to people's assistance.  In these cases the costs can be sizeable.  Therefore, I could foresee a much greater costs involved in the event of a local authority taking the necessary steps to prevent pollution.  I welcome the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  That would leave it to the discretion of the county manager to implement or to bring a person to the court for identification as the person responsible for the costs.

      <P>This section deals with a situation in which there is an appeal lodged with the High Court.  We have already dealt with the problem in Moneypoint.  Under this section any person &mdash; and since we are a member of the European Community it does not necessarily mean an Irish person &mdash; could make application, as is stated under subsection (1), which reads:</P>
      <P>The High Court may, on the application of a local authority or any other person, by order, prohibit or restrict an emission from any premises where the Court is satisfied that &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> For example, with regard to Moneypoint, somebody somewhere could feel aggrieved about acid rain which they might feel was caused by the plant at Moneypoint.  Would the Minister indicate if such a person could apply to the High Court to have certain refinements carried out to Moneypoint?  If so, I could envisage a court deciding in favour of such an application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put the Senator's mind at ease immediately.  The EC are concerned, but they will take their action only with the Government of another country, not with any section lower than central Government.  Their action would be taken through the European Court, not a local court of the land.  We are referring here to our High Court, within our jurisdiction.  The EC will not come into our High Court and take action against anyone. They will only take action against a sovereign Government in the European Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not relating it specifically to the EC in that sense.  What I am saying is, as we are a member of the EC &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;, not necessarily an Irish person, could appeal.  The question I am asking then is &mdash; we are all conscious of this transboundary pollution in relation to Moneypoint &mdash; whether somebody on the Continent, for example, within the EC, could make this application.  In any event, if an Irish person applied is the situation with regard to Moneypoint that, under the provisions of this section, an application could be made to the High Court to have certain refinements carried out?  I am thinking, for example, of the emission of sulphur dioxide and having the flue refinements that were spoken about yesterday carried out &mdash; a rather costly operation.  Is there the potential under the provisions of the Bill for a court order to be granted to compel those refinements to be carried out at Moneypoint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the potential is there in the Bill.  One need not be a member of the EC.  It could be a resident of Kilrush who could take an action.  But <Col N="446" /> they would have a very heavy burden of proof, as outlined here under subsection (1) (a), (b) and (c).  They would have to satisfy the court under those provisions.  In theory the potential is there.  If a resident of Kilrush &mdash; to take a hypothetical situation &mdash; won their case we would be into a situation of retrofitting Moneypoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, this is a power that does not exist at present. A person might have the right but certainly would not have the power given in this section.  Scientific proof could be easily provided to show that there is this emission from Moneypoint.  In representations made to us the problem is well documented. Therefore, it seems that the provisions of this section could have serious repercussions for Moneypoint or, indeed, for any other plant.  For example, some single individual could urbanise scientific research with regard to a particular premises.  If that person was able to satisfy the High Court that there was a problem of an emission, I could foresee the High Court opting in favour of that application. From what the Minister has said, that is my understanding.  Therefore the provisions of this section are very powerful. I will not say it is an extraordinary power because perhaps some similar power is given elsewhere.  I am thinking specifically of Moneypoint and the problem arising from emissions there.</P>
      <P>Having regard to all the representations made to us by concerned groups and individuals it appears to me that, when this Bill becomes law, action will be taken in the High Court to compel the ESB to provide scrubbers or refinements to the flues in Moneypoint in order to overcome the problem of emission of sulphur dioxide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say the position about Moneypoint <Col N="447" /> and I understand the Leas-Chathaoirleach's concern lest we would inadvertently cause alarm down in her part of the world is that Moneypoint is operating under planning permission granted in 1979 to which strict conditions were attached.  In passing I might say there was no appeal by any third party to An Bord Pleanála on any of the conditions in the granting of the planning permission to Moneypoint.  If, as the position now stands, with Moneypoint or any other similar plant, a third party, an individual, felt it was not complying strictly with the conditions as laid down in the planning permission, there exists already the mechanism under the Planning Acts whereby any third party can take it to the High Court.  It is not new &mdash; it already exists under the Planning Act &mdash; if people feel that the conditions are not being complied with and feel their case will stand up in court.  Vexatious cases will not stand up in court and will be extremely costly to take.  The system has worked very well under the Planning Acts.

It already exists under the Planning Acts, as they now stand, apart at all from pollution incidents.  That procedure is already well-tried and practised in our courts, and in the High Court.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  The main purpose of this section, and of Part III of the Bill generally, is to give expression in Irish law to the requirements of Directive 84/360 on the combatting of air pollution from industrial plants which has been adopted by the EC.  That directive obliges member states to operate, by 1 July 1987, a system of prior authorisation &mdash; in other words, licensing in relation to the air pollution aspects of industrial plant.  The central obligation of the directive is not necessarily confined to new industrial plant, although, clearly, in terms of design approval and considerations of this kind, new plants take priority.  The system of prior authorisation is also required for substantial alteration of plants.  Given all of this, it would be unacceptable, as this amendment seeks to do, to remove existing plant from any possibility of control under the new licensing system which Part III establishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the requirements of the EC Directive, I would be adamant, for the good of the Irish environment, that we should retain the power gradually to extend air pollution licensing to existing industrial plant.  In other words, I favour 100 per cent retrospection.  After all, existing plant will for a long time to come give rise to the bulk of industrial air emissions in Ireland.  It would be wrong if the specifically designed air pollution controls of this Bill could not apply to them.  Let me say immediately that I do not envisage that immediately this Bill is passed we will be insisting that plants and operations that have been working under planning conditions for years, perhaps decades, spend an enormous sum of money in complying with certain conditions we would now demand of new plant coming into existence.  But there will be cases where we will have to request that <Col N="452" /> they improve emission standards.  This may include emission chimneys, scrubbers, retrofitting and desulphurisation plants.  There will be cases where, over the years, we will have to request that they fall in line with what we now consider to be the minimum acceptable standards in terms of emissions which are polluting our countryside.  This is for the sake of human and environmental health in this country. It is not a draconian measure.  Subsection (3) provides for reasonable transitional arrangements in the event of existing plant being brought within the scope of licensing.  That point is made quite clearly. Reason will prevail here.</P>

I was insisting that the expression we are using of &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo; should stick.  I think the Senator finally agreed with me on it.  Here we have an example of why the expression was so important as we defined it.  &ldquo;Best practical means&rdquo; generally can take into consideration the age of the existing industrial plant or any other premises, the nature of the facilities installed therein and the period during which the plant or the premises is likely to be used or to continue in operation.  If a very old plant was about to shut up shop in two years time, even if it was causing an environmental nuisance, I think we would have to consider this fact and not insist that they would have to spend millions on fitting or modernising, if the life of the plant was determined.  Also, under &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo; would come the cost which would be incurred in renovating the plant or the premises, or of renovating or replacing the facilities therein, in relation to the economic situation of the undertakings concerned. These are the issues which will have to be taken into consideration in retrospection under our view of &ldquo;best practical means&rdquo;. Senators can rest assured that commonsense will rule.</P>

      <P>Section 31 (2) (h) states: &ldquo;requiring an applicant to defray or contribute towards the cost of any investigation carried out by a local authority in relation to an application&rdquo;. What does the Minister envisage would be the cost involved, or what type of investigation would be envisaged that would carry a substantial amount of costs? That has to be built into the Bill because it is a very wide-ranging financial consideration for an applicant to have to &ldquo;defray or contribute towards the cost of any investigation carried out by a local authority&rdquo;.

In the case, for example, of a large chemical plant applying for a licence there could be quite an expensive procedure in a local authority investigating, analysing and researching the situation before them.  A large combine, a multinational, would quite easily and quite happily contribute towards whatever information is necessary to grant them the licence to operate.  This section makes provision that the local authority may, as such, claim such costs if necessary.</P>

      <P>This could be unfair in circumstances where the information was not deliberately false.  It could be wrong in a situation where the granting of the licence did not hinge on the false information &mdash; in other words, in a situation where, if the correct information had been submitted, the licence would be granted.  The Minister might consider adding there something to the effect that: &ldquo;If it appears that because of the false information the licence was granted&rdquo;.  Without the false information &mdash; and in this situation this could be due to an error &mdash; the licence would be granted. It would be wrong or unfair to revoke the licence on that account.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the review of licences.  Section 33 (3)(a)(i) refers to where the local authority have reasonable grounds for believing that any emission from the industrial plant to which the licence relates constitutes a serious risk of air pollution.  &ldquo;Reasonable grounds&rdquo; should be better defined and should include some scientific evidence.  To my mind, this is very vague in this kind of situation, and is something which would require expert opinion to be included.  Section 33 (3)(a)(iv) refers to &ldquo;further and better evidence, which was not available when the licence was granted, has become available relating to a pollutant present in the emission concerned or the effects of such a pollutant.&rdquo;  In relation to &ldquo;further and better evidence,&rdquo; again there is no reference to a scientific basis.  It is a sloppy term in a Bill of this kind and I would not regard it as professional.  Some kind of acceptable standard should be used here.</P>

      <P>Section 33 (3)(a)(iv) empowers the Minister to make regulations in relation to the procedures for review of licences including the giving of notice of review, the making of representations in relation to review and the publication of these notices.  I do not accept that the expression &ldquo;further and better evidence&rdquo; is sloppy, as suggested by the Senator.  It is essential that this section stands as it is.</P>
      <P>For example, our knowledge is increasing at an enormous rate in the area of pollution control and standards we would have accepted ten years ago would not be accepted today, for example, base line standards for emissions of one kind or another.  It is only in recent years that we have come to fully realise the danger of the organic chlorides, incomplete combustion and the difficulties with incineration and emissions of that kind.  It is quite conceivable that if the system existed plants could have been licensed years ago before our knowledge was at the stage where we could include the conditions in relation to these matters.  If we are serious about human health and the health of the environment, we must be in a position to proceed with the pace of scientific research and with the acceptable universal and internationally laid down standards.  That is why section 33 (3) (a) (iv) is as stated here.  What was the Senator's first point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

      <P>Section 33 (3) (a) (i) states: &ldquo;the local authority have reasonable grounds for believing that any emission from the industrial plant to which the licence relates constitutes a serious risk of air pollution....&rdquo;  The licence can be reviewed in those circumstances.  This is what this Bill is all about.  If we are serious about curtailing or, if at all possible, preventing serious air pollution, we must have the power and teeth to do that.  We are either serious about this issue or we are not.  I have absolutely no concern about this as expressed here.  The expression &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; is well tried and tested and &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; is well defined <Col N="458" /> in the Bill.  I refer the Senator to section 4 which states:</P>
      <P>(i) be injurious to public health, or</P>
      <P>(ii) have a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or damage property, or</P>
      <P>(iii) impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment.</P>
      <P>The reference is not just to air pollution; it is to serious risk of air pollution.  It is one step above the definition in that there must be a serious risk.  In most cases of seriousness scientific evidence &mdash; evidence that will stand up to scientific scrutiny &mdash; will be needed to prove the case.  I do not feel it should be universally essential because there will be cases where it will not be necessary or where it will not be challenged and will be accepted.  The occupier of the premises will be well aware of the difficulties he is causing as soon as it is pointed out to him, and there will be no need to go any further than that.  There will be no need to spend large sums of money or any money at all in having scientific surveys or analysis of the situation if there is agreement with both parties that there is a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the term &ldquo;better evidence&rdquo; we are dealing with air pollution and this is a measurable commodity.  It can be determined in any situation whether or not we have air pollution. With regard to an engineer examining a plant or an air pollution scientist dealing with air pollution, there can be a number of people involved.  I could have a plant and get three engineers to examine it and I would get three different reports.  I would be in a position to determine which was the best evidence or the best report so far as I was concerned.  That is not good enough.  When air pollution can be dealt with on a scientific basis and when we have data and standards to go by, it is not good enough to introduce this vague phrase &ldquo;better evidence&rdquo; or &ldquo;better scientific evidence&rdquo;.  I am not sure what way it would be phrased.  The connotation of &ldquo;better evidence&rdquo; is rather subjective in that it could be better for different people. There should be some objective way of <Col N="459" /> dealing with evidence.  Throughout the Bill my greatest complaint is that this scientific basis seems to be missing.</P>

It would have to stand up to scientific scrutiny particularly in our courts.  Generally also in all EC directives there is provision whereby we must adapt all standards to technical progress which is what I was talking about earlier.  As our knowledge progresses, we have to adapt our standards and conditions accordingly. The dose effect relationship becomes better understood and we push forward the frontiers of what we consider acceptable in relation to protecting human and environmental health and we must have provision to do so.</P>

I have to oppose that.  The right of third party appeal is now fundamentally established in Irish environmental legislation operating under both the planning and water pollution Acts.  I see no circumstances peculiar to air pollution which would justify a departure from this established policy in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is well to keep the question of third party appeals in prespective.  Some three-quarters of appeals now being made to An Bord Pleanála are non-third party. However, I acknowledge the concern of industrialists and developers that there should not be an abuse of the third party procedure.  Perhaps this motivates the amendment and I appreciate that.  Under section 34 (4) appeals regulations under this Bill will be able to avail of all of the restraints on unfrivolous and vexatious appeals which are now built into the Planning Acts.  An Bord Pleanála will be authorised to deal summarily with these.</P>

      <P>I agree that persons should have that opportunity otherwise than in this section.  I suggest that perhaps to phrase it as follows would be an improvement: &ldquo;Any person whose application for a licence pursuant to section 32 and 33 has (a) been refused, or (b) been made subject to conditions may at any time before the expiration of the prescribed period appeal to An Bord Pleanála&rdquo; etc.  That is more acceptable. The people involved would be enabled to make this appeal because there would be an opportunity in this section for people who might want to object.</P>

      <P>We said at the outset that scientific research should be made mandatory on a local authority before declaring the special control areas.  That is something the Minister has been trying to avoid since this Bill went into Committee Stage.  Mention has been made of pollution, suggested surveys and people carrying out surveys.  What is wrong with making it mandatory on a local authority to carry out scientific research surveys before they decide on controlling or identifying special control areas?  Is there any reason for the Minister shying away from this mandatory regulation?  We feel very strongly that it is necessary to have a local authority carry out scientific research before they identify zones or special control areas.  Up to this the Minister has declined on any section to ask a local authority for this mandatory scientific research.  I would like the Minister to be more specific in her reply on why she feels it is not necessary to have scientific research carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator O'Toole and to rephrase section 39 (1) as follows: &ldquo;Where it appears necessary to a local authority after detailed <Col N="464" /> analysis and research that the whole or any part of their functional area should, in order to prevent or limit air pollution, be declared to be a special controlled area, they may make an order (in this Act referred to as a `special control area order') under this section.&rdquo;  I dealt in great detail with this matter on sections 18 and 26 and there is no need to repeat myself.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that it is an area which gives great power to the local authority solely on the basis of scientific experimentation or research and this section should be invoked.  I appeal to the Minister to agree to consider the matter before Report Stage.  Perhaps the question of a scientific survey could be included in this Bill in such a way as to satisfy the arguments we have been making to try to convince the Minister in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice all of these special control area orders will be subject to an inquiry.  They do not have to be, but in practice we know there will be an inquiry if there is even one objection.  An inquiry under section 41 (4) will be held within a specified period.  Section 41 (4) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall cause an oral hearing to be held in relation to the order and shall afford each person who duly made an objection to the order the opportunity of being heard.</P>
      <P>At that stage the local authority will have to subject their proposals for the special control area order to confirmation by the Minister.  The reasons they are applying for this order will be rigorously fine combed. In practice we are not talking about any large areas of this country.  We are all aware that if it is to happen at all in the future on the first occasion it is more likely to happen in Dublin, given the way the trends are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already there is monitoring and a lot of research and investigation into the Dublin situation.  We had the Warren Spring Laboratory in advising, discussing and researching the position for the Dublin local authorities.  I think the Senator's fears are unfounded.  I presume the Senator <Col N="465" /> considers monitoring of international standards, to be research.  I do and I want to make that quite clear.  I assume we are talking about the same thing here.  The only reason it would not be necessary to make scientific research of any kind compulsory or universal in the legislation, would be if there was no objection to the order.  There would be absolutely no need to proceed along certain lines if the matter was to be agreed between all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>In practice, that is most unlikely to happen.  I cannot envisage it happening at all particularly in view of what we are talking about, the special control areas and specific geographic locations in Dublin or portions of Dublin.  In practice there will always be an oral hearing and the evidence of the local authority will have to stand up to scientific scrutiny, totally satisfy the Minister that it is soundly based on scientific considerations and international standards.  The Senators need have no fears in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to come back on this.  The Minister has failed to answer our question.  She has pointed out that this may not occur except in special areas and perhaps in the cities.  I believe it would be mandatory on the local authority to have scientific research carried out before you could control a specific area and tell the people in that area what pollutant was there and to what extent.  In regard to smokeless zones in other countries very rigid controls are being implemented.  We are asking the Minister in those special circumstances to make it mandatory on a particular local authority in a specified area to have scientific research carried out.  It would not be necessary at all in rural Ireland, but it may be necessary in a special area.  Where there is to be a specified controlled area, the Minister should make it mandatory on the local authority to have scientific research carried out on the level of the pollutant in that area.  It would be necessary to define the geographical area, if nothing else, in the special control area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless you have scientific research carried out and make it mandatory on the <Col N="466" /> local authority, you will not be able to define the boundaries of a special control area.  I do not know why the Minister does not want to accept this.  If she can give me some special reason she does not want that scientific research carried out, I will accept it but I have got no reason as yet.  The Minister has not answered our question either yesterday or today as to why she will not make it mandatory on a local authority for the special control areas.  That is all we are asking for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be concerned about giving particular status in the Bill to scientific research or to a generic reference to scientific research.  In itself, it could give rise to vexatious claims on the techniques in which the research was carried out and the thing could be dragged through the courts for years in relation to that even though there may be no doubt at all that a problem existed.  I speak with limited knowledge as one with some scientific training in my background and who has done a lot of this sort of thing in the past. I refer to Part VI, section 54 which states:</P>
      <P>A local authority shall carry out, or cause to be carried out, such monitoring of &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  air quality, and</P>
      <P>(b) the nature, extent and effects of emissions,</P>
      <P>as the local authority may consider necessary for the performance of their functions under this Act or as they may be directed by the Minister to carry out.</P>
      <P>The first thing they will be asked by a Minister at any oral hearing in relation to, for example, a special control area order is what justification they have for this order, and they will have to present justification.  The monitoring will be part of that.  The monitoring will define the geographic limits of the area.  They will have to know to what extent and how far this pollution is reaching.  I am quite satisfied that with the provision under section 54 (1) the Senator's worst fears are catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder are we talking about the same <Col N="467" /> thing when we talk about scientific research.  This is the difficulty of using a global or generic term like that in a Bill in that that very term itself could be a letout for polluters or for any other body which, for whatever reason, vexatious or otherwise, wanted to prevent a special control area or at least hold it up indefinitely.  Again it comes down to the fact that we want to ensure that the power is there to rectify a problem when there is no doubt that the problem exists. Monitoring, as far as I am concerned, is sufficient scientific evidence to calculate and evaluate the problem of air pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with some of the points made by the Minister. Scientific evidence in relation to this Bill seems very straightforward as far as I am concerned.  The Bill sets out in the First Schedule to describe the pollutants that are referred to in the Bill.  It seems very simple from a scientific point of view to measure the amount of pollutants in the air at any time and in any place.  Surely there could be no ambiguity whatever about a scientific basis.  The Minister, with her training and her skills in this area, must surely agree that in no way could it be ambiguous.  We are dealing with air pollution.  The Bill sets out very clearly the pollutants in the First Schedule.  There could be no confusion whatever in discussing a scientific basis even with somebody who has no training whatever in this area.  This is all we are looking for.  That is my understanding of a scientific basis and I do not think there can be any other understanding of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Scientific input or monitoring of the air pollution of an area is only one of the criteria that need to be considered.  It is, after all, a reserved function and there is considerable political input.  In other words, the expense which would be incurred, for example, in complying with the order can also be considered.  The availability of means necessary for compliance with the order is also to be considered.  I am satisfied that the requirements in relation to monitoring are sufficient or will release sufficient scientific evidence for consideration on <Col N="468" /> those grounds alone in relation to the special control area order.  There are other considerations the Minister has to take into account.  I am satisfied with the Bill as it stands in relation to this.</P>

As a trained scientist I am satisfied that the monitoring procedures that can be enforced will give sufficient scientific evidence for the consideration we are talking about here. I cannot say they are the same, but they are very similar.  What we want is scientific evidence for what we are talking about, I think monitoring is most satisfactory.</P>

      <P>My colleagues opposite are making heavy weather of this.  They are looking too deeply into it.  Any local authority who will be contemplating making a special amenity area will naturally have their ground work done. Scientific monitoring is going on in my area at present.  As Dublin County Council members we get monthly reports on air pollution in the various areas in Dublin. The report tells us the amount of air pollution in Clondalkin, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Terenure, and so on, on a monthly basis.  I see this as scientific monitoring.  Before a local authority would <Col N="470" /> contemplate making it a special control area, they will have to have the back up to justify doing that and it is done scientifically.</P>
      <P>There are two monitoring stations in Tallaght, I am not sure where the others are.  This is enough scientific monitoring for me.  If my local authority contemplated making a special control area naturally all public representatives for that area, including myself, would question it and there would have to be justification for it. We are going too deeply into this section. Perhaps it will be clarified later on.  I think the section could be agreed.</P>

Revoking or amending orders will themselves be special control area orders under subsection (1) and so will be subject to all of the confirmation procedures involving the Minister for the Environment required by section 41.  It is to ensure that there is no risk of this country not complying with an EC directive.  The Minister is responsible to the EC not the local authorities.

    <P>A local authority may, with the consent of any other local authority concerned, make a special control area order in relation to an area which is <Col N="473" /> within the functional area of the other authority.</P>

      <P>We are into transboundary pollution here, not in an international sense, but across the borough bounds or across the district electoral divisions or constituency boundaries.  It is basically good commonsense.  Subsection (5) allows a local authority, with the consent of other local authorities concerned, to make a special control area order which relates to an area within the jurisdiction of that other local authority. This is where geographical limitations and monitoring would come in.  There is no point in limiting a special control area order to the bottom of one townland and not being able to go any further just because the district electoral divisions are laid down in some maps in some office. This subsection effectively allows an order to extend outside the functional area of the local authority making it.  Similar provisions exist for special amenity area orders in section 42 (3) of the Planning Act, 1963.  Again there is a precedent.</P>

      <P>This is as far as legislation ever goes in relation to these types of provisions.  It is up to the Estimates for any particular year to take this on board if it should be the wish to the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Finance.  The budgetary considerations for each year would have to be considered and there is no precedent in any legislation specifying exactly that any of these grants must be compulsory or the amount of the grants.  The enabling legislation for these grants is built into this Bill and it would be the intention if, for example, we are still talking about a house improvement grants scheme we now have, that any such scheme as may be relevant would be considered applicable or, indeed, any other scheme that may be necessary to enable any premises or dwelling to comply with the necessary alterations for a special control area order.

      <P>The home improvement grant scheme is different.  In relation to a special control area order could we assume there would be no order except where financial help would be given if it were necessary to install special appliances such as enclosed stoves because it could be very costly?  I made the case before that if in the house improvement grants scheme, an incentive had been included for this &mdash; even without the Air Pollution Bill, 1986 &mdash; many families might have taken advantage of it.  That was never done.  There was nothing specific to influence people in their choice of appliance.  Could we assume that in all <Col N="476" /> cases a grant will be available and provided by the Department for the alteration?</P>

We cannot assume there will always be grants available and, even if a grant was introduced, it would be subject to annual revision at budget time or at Estimates time.  That is for policy later on.  All we can do is make the necessary regulations in the section I have referred to that grants can be provided subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>In this monitoring of the special control area order, will we know what pollutant is there before these orders will come into effect?  It is very important to know who is polluting, the extent of the pollution, and from where is it coming.  There might be certain premises in the special control area with special type solid fuel emissions but they may not be responsible for the pollution.  When a special area control order is put into operation, it will have to be spelt out the type of pollutant and what area the pollutant is coming from.  People may be brought in under this umbrella who may not be responsible for the condition.  With regard to special control area orders, I note the exemption in section 40 (1) (e):</P>
      <P>exempt, with or without conditions, such premises or classes of premises as may be specified from all or any of the requirements of the order;</P>
      <P>In (f):</P>
      <P>exempt, with or without conditions, such fireplaces or such classes of fireplaces as may be specified from all or any of the requirements of the order;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these paragraphs a special type fireplace and a special type solid fuel may be exempted, but the type of fireplace and solid fuel necessary for exemption is not spelt out.  Could the Minister elaborate on what is meant by the exemption of a particular fireplace and particular types of fuel?  Could she also specify the pollutant <Col N="477" /> and identify what would require a special control area order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I refer the Senator to section 39 (3) (a) and (b):</P>
      <P>A special control area order shall specify &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the area to which it relates,</P>
      <P>(b) the pollutant with which it is concerned...</P>
      <P>I hope that puts his mind at rest in relation to his last point.  In practice, at an oral hearing or inquiry which is a procedure I imagine all of these special control area orders will follow, the polluting source will be quite clear.  I think the Senator has in mind the danger of, say, a special control area order being put on a certain geographical location and all the householders, for example, having to comply and perhaps being put to some cost as a result when, in fact, the increase in background pollution may be just from one industrial source, rather than from the domestic source.  This will all become quite evident at the oral hearing and the pollutant will be specified.  These factors will be taken into account in considering whether the order will be made or not.</P>
      <P>Yes, there can be exemptions for certain fuels and types of fireplaces.  We are not in a position to state at this stage what those may be or what type of fuels.  It is basically until the Bill comes into effect.  We had a discussion this morning on an earlier section in regard to requiring fuel manufacturers to give notice in writing of certain parts of their operations, the type of fuel, the quantity and so on.  Availability of certain types of fuel is a consideration which will have to be taken into account, because we cannot discommode overly the elderly and those who may not be in a position to get specialist type fuel.  All of this has to be taken into account in planning a special control area order in order to make sure it will be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>If it were intended to have a certain type of smokeless solid fuel, it may be very expensive for the poorer <Col N="478" /> section of the community.  While the rich people could comply very easily, the old, the infirm and poorer classes of people in that particular area would want to be exempted because they would not be in a position to buy the fuel since it would be much dearer than ordinary fuel.  That would discriminate against the poor, and it is something I would not like to see happening.</P>

I do not imagine the Department or the Minister will be concerned with ordinary household emissions except in urban areas which are designated as smokeless zones.  There are a number of nuisance practices that should be dealt with.  I wonder if this Bill is strong enough to do this?  In many cases people who trade in scrap buy up wires covered with either plastic or rubber and then burn off the covering in order to sell the copper.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister propose to deal with emissions from industrial plants?  How will the legislation draw a line between maintaining valuable employment opportunities and at the same time considering people who reside adjacent to an industrial estate or a chemical plant?  In the main the residents will have been there before the plant was <Col N="479" /> set up.  Most areas are anxious to have industrial plants.  How will the Minister ensure that the quality of air and the environment is protected?  Will the Minister have power, under this section, to require plants to put in tall chimney stacks and or attach scrubbers to them?  If we take a non-chemical plant, a cattle slaughtering facility, where you can get the whiff from it four or five miles away, will the Minister have the power to ensure that existing plants do not pollute the surrounding areas, and, if say under which section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed that under the licensing section we have powers for retrospection.  I feel very strongly about this myself.  I hope that the section as now is stands, if my recollection is correct of what we agreed this morning under Part III, the licensing section.  Section 40 (1)(c), which the Senator referred to and caused some concern about on Second Stage, needs to be in here.  What we are talking about under section 40 is:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the provisions of <i>section 39 (3)</i>, a special control area order may make provision for the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It lists subparagraphs (a) to (j) prohibiting certain practices.  Straw burning could be one of those because the effect of straw burning is to create smoke.  If on monitoring the general agreement was that we should place such a special control area order on a certain geographical location to ensure that certain requirements were met by private dwellers and industrial premises, then it goes without saying that you could not have the burning of vast quantities of straw in the middle of one of those areas.  There would have to be very good and stringent reasons for putting on one of those control area orders. Generally, we are talking about fairly large urban areas.  Probably Dublin would be one of the first we would consider, and we may consider hypothetically Cork, Galway, Limerick and other big cities. But, effectively, our thoughts for the moment are directed towards the <Col N="480" /> possibility of this situation happening in Dublin or parts of Dublin.  The remainder does not seem to be a realistic possibility in the near future.  The reason it is included is to ensure that, if a special control area order is placed, all types of activities could come under it.  The section states:</P>
    <P>...prohibit, subject to such limitations and exceptions as may be specified...</P>
    <P>In relation to all this vexed area concerning the burning of straw, I pointed out this morning that it was not the intention to annoy or upset the long-established agricultural practice of the annual burning of straw and stubble which, particularly on the east coast, has become very common. It is only if the burning of straw would actually cause air pollution as defined under section 4, where &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; is defined as a condition of the atmosphere in which a pollutant is present in such a quantity as to be liable to:</P>
    <P>(i) be injurious to public health, or</P>
    <P>(ii) have a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or damage property, or</P>
    <P>(iii) impair or interfere with amenities or with the environment.</P>
    <P>It would only be in regard to the burning of straw to that extent that we would envisage any action being taken.  As most burning of straw by farmers is a once-off situation on an annual or irregular basis, this Bill is not intended to affect that at all.</P>

Nevertheless, the open fire is still as much beloved there as it is in the rural areas.  I do not think there is any distinction. Perhaps a decision should have been made a long time back, in areas where it was felt there would be a problem, to encourage people by way of grant.  However, that opportunity was lost, and I think if that opportunity had been grasped we would not have the problem now that we have.</P>
      <P>Section 40(2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by regulations, declare that any particular class of fireplace shall, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the regulations, be an authorised fireplace for the purposes of a special control area order.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister envisage that in all cases this would be an enclosed appliance, a stove of some kind?  Is there any situation in which a refinement sufficient for the purpose of this Bill could be included in the open fire?</P>

      <P>The fact that Government amendments No. 26 and 26a have been put down on this matter in addition to those of Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzsimons acknowledges that they have rightly identified a weakness in the original draft of subsection (1).  It would be wrong, as arguably the original text allows, if a local authority could serve notices on occupiers of premises requiring certain things to be done on the strength of an order still awaiting confirmation by the Minister for the Environment, that an offence under subsection (1) could arise before a special control area order comes into operation.  The Government amendments correct both of these flaws.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 means that a notice may be served only where a special control area order has been confirmed by the Minister for the Environment.  It will still allow a notice to be served during the period which under section 41(7) must be at least six months between confirmation of an order by the Minister and its coming into operation.  Amendment 26a provides that where this happens the period within which works must be carried out cannot end sooner than the date on which the special control area order comes into operation.  In order words, failure to comply with the notice can only arise when the special control area order comes into operation.  This is what amendments No. 24 and 25 put down by Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzsimons seek to protect. However, their amendments go further and want to delay any service of notice until the special control area order is in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 (7) provides for a minimum delay of six months between the Minister <Col N="488" /> confirming the order and its coming into operation so that the public can be given notice of adaptations which will be required of them to comply with the order.

      <P>We have referred to this before.  I accept the Minister's point that it conforms with other legislation.  It is a pity there is no commitment on the part of the Government to provide financial assistance.  The vehicle to do so is there.

      <P>Section 45 provides the basic enabling power for a scheme of grants.  The form of these grants is not fixed by the Bill and they could consist of grants, loans or subsidies towards the cost of the relevant works.  There has been criticism that this provision is stated permissively rather than mandatorily, &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, and that accordingly there is no obligation on the Minister to provide a scheme of grants.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a number of points in reply.  First, the scheme of grants is wholly related to the existence of a special control area order or orders which the Bill itself cannot bring into operation.  These will depend on an assessment by the local authorities or the Minister himself or herself under section 39.  Pending this assessment, it would seem premature to provide mandatorily for a scheme of grants.  Secondly, it is normal practice, reinforced by the argument at the first point above, to provide statutory authorisation for new grant schemes in permissive terms only.  I referred to this earlier.  The introduction, scope and financing of the scheme then becomes a matter for debate by the Dáil in the context of the relevant estimate &mdash; in this case, the Environment Vote.</P>

None of the powers in the Bill should be implemented without detailed analysis and research.

      <P>Section 46 enables local authorities to make air quality management plans for the preservation of air quality in their areas.  It is implicit in this that a local authority would only propose such a plan where monitoring has shown a need and that the proposals for upgrading and preserving air quality would be based on an analysis of the monitoring results.  In any event, where local authorities propose making air quality management plans, they would be basing their proposals, in the main, on achieving EC air quality standards and guide values.  These standards are distilled from international research carried out by such bodies as the World Health Organisation.  Local authorities have neither the expertise nor the money to duplicate such research, nor is there any need to do so.  Similar provision is made in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  I believe, with respect, that this amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the power of the Minister in relation to an <Col N="491" /> air quality management plan.  The Minister may direct a local authority, or two or more local authorities jointly, to make an air quality management plan.  If two or more local authorities are to make a joint plan, I would prefer it to be the decision of each of the local authorities.  Here it is taken out of their hands and the Minister may decide that more than two should join together.  The Minister referred to the functions of public representatives and happily the air quality management plan is a reserved function and it is a pity the Minister has this power rather than giving the local authorities the opportunity to make a joint plan if they so decide and wish.</P>

      <P>Effectively, if they wish jointly to do a water quality management plan, local authorities have the power to do so under section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1955.  We are into the area of transboundary pollution again.  I have referred to this before.  This section is ancillary to section 46 and it empowers the Minister to direct in a variety of ways the making or co-ordinating of air quality management plans by local authorities.  I could say also that a similar provision exists for water quality management plans under section 15 (7) of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  There is a well tried and tested precedent for this type of measure.  The Minister may direct an individual local authority, or two or more local authorities jointly, to make a plan.  He may require variations in any plan or require co-ordination by two or more local authorities.  The local authorities are required to comply with the directions of the Minister under this section.</P>

The period should be quite substantial.

    <P>I ask the Minister if that power does not exist already in regard to fuel.  I refer to the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1985.  Under regulations of that kind does the Minister not have that power?  In regard to the fuel, it is not always the fuel on its own that is material; it could be the condition of an engine, for example, the situation with regard to mechanically propelled vehicles, motor bikes without silencers and so on.

There is no reference to control of the buses that are polluting Dublin city at present.

The point was made by many Senators &mdash; indeed, it was made by Senator O'Toole on Second Stage &mdash; that in the city we have buses, cars and vehicles of all kinds spewing out poison at breathing level.  In this section there is provision in relation to fuels which in effect is no better than the statutory provisions that we have at present.

      <P>Much as I would like to make this Bill more effective, I will not be considering such a section between now and Report Stage.  The areas we are talking about are the controls and production, marketing and vehicle testing, and all of these are more properly dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce. We already have vehicle testing, including that of buses, which is already mandatory. I agree that until we get our act together in all these areas we will not have the desired effect as quickly as we would like. They are not specifically relevant to what we are discussing today.</P>

      <P>It is not as effective as it should be because we are dealing with other areas.  With regard to fireplaces, for example, we are dealing with the consumption <Col N="497" /> of fuel.  Here we are also dealing with the consumption of fuel.  I cannot see why in relation to fuel, in a domestic or in a commercial situation, there should be such restrictions.  Then there is this other area of such importance with regard to pollution.  I cannot understand why that is not included.  It is a serious defect in the Bill and I am sorry that the Minister does not agree.</P>

I do not accept that the addition of the words &ldquo;at regular intervals&rdquo; improves the meaning of the section or indeed makes more specific the obligations placed on local authorities.  The Bill requires local authorities to carry out such monitoring as is required for the performance of their functions under the Bill.  Additionally, they are required to comply with any directions given by the Minister in relation to the number and location of monitoring places, the manner in which sampling and so on is to be carried out and the equipment to be used.

      <P>There need not necessarily be a situation in which a local authority has failed for the Minister to so direct.  In fact, he might require An Foras Forbartha, the IIRS or any such body to monitor or to do some specialist monitoring of any kind over and above what perhaps a local authority would be in a position to do.  In practice, air quality monitoring will be mandatory under this section on local authorities in whose areas appreciable air pollution exists.  The proof of this is as follows: first, the EC air quality directives on smoke and sulphur dioxide and on other pollutants have been adopted and applied throughout Ireland. The Minister will have to give expression to these air quality standards by regulations under section 50.  Where an air quality <Col N="499" /> standard has been prescribed by the Minister the provisions of subsection (5) of this section oblige a local authority to make such arrangements for monitoring as may be necessary so that they can determine whether the air quality standard is being complied with.  They will have to monitor; otherwise they will not be able to determine if the air quality standard has been complied with.  When in Dublin, and more rarely in some of our other large urban areas, these air quality standards are sometimes exceeded or approached, then the local authority concerned will be under a clear obligation to carry out monitoring under subsection (5).</P>

    <P>These amendments have the common purpose of correcting a drafting error.  This <Col N="500" /> would have meant that the transitional provisions of this section would not apply to so-called scheduled works which the 1906 Alkali Act controls in addition to alkali works.  The amendments apply the transitional provisions to both classes of works.  By invoking the concept of existing industrial plant the new subsection (4) also makes it clear that the transitional arrangements will not affect new plant coming within the scope of the Alkali Act. New Alkali Act-type plants will, therefore, be subject only to the provisions of Part III of this Bill.</P>

This new section provides for transitional arrangements similar, to those of section 57, for alkali etc. works.  Section 6, as amended, provides that existing plant, licensable under the 1985 regulations, that is plants for the extraction or recovery of metal from scrap, will remain exempt from licensing under Part III of the Bill until regulations are made under section 30(2).

It forbids emissions which cause a &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo;.

      <P>At present, in certain circumstances, there is little limited power to a local authority to deal with this.  I mentioned yesterday evening specifically the case of a moving vehicle.  I realise, and accept what the Minister said yesterday evening, that there is provision to deal with a specific location within a town, let us say.  We have encountered the problem in my home town when a truck periodically passes through the town; it is not the only town to encounter such problems.  Animal by-products are transported in this truck which causes a very offensive smell.  Many people feel that if the vehicle were properly covered this smell would be eliminated. There are problems encountered with firms at present, that it is not possible to do everything they would like in regard to the conversion of trucks and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that by-laws have been passed by the urban council. But, in order to prosecute the offending party, it is necessary for some individual to actually see the truck, to experience the nuisance and then to be prepared to give information and go into court in that regard.  It is not easy to do that because people cannot be awaiting the arrival of this truck.  There is a certain amount of sympathy for the firm involved.  Is the Minister saying there is a specific provision to cover the problem caused by <Col N="504" /> moving traffic?  If there is, then I am satisfied.  It appeared to me that our amendment would deal specifically with that problem.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that &ldquo;smell&rdquo; is not covered in section 107 of the 1878 Act.  That is why we put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not deal with mobile pollution; it is pollution from stationary sources only.  I dealt with that at length on Second Stage.  There are other areas where perhaps this problem should be more properly dealt with.  We are revising the road traffic legislation.  This is a matter we will bring to the attention of the Minister in that regard.  Also we are updating the by-law provisions of local authorities in relation to smells from animals and offal being transported through towns and at slaughterhouses.  The Minister for Agriculture is drawing up slaughterhouse legislation at present.  We will bring to the notice of the relevant Ministers the points Senators have made. I agree; they all contribute towards pollution and nuisance factors but we precluded mobile sources of pollution specifically from the provisions of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not feel that is a serious defect in the Bill?  We have a serious pollution problem.  Those involved are not concerned whether the cause is stationary or mobile.  At present there is insufficient legislation to deal with the problem.  Indeed this problem applies to many more towns; it cannot be resolved. Clearly it is within the ambit of air pollution.  The question of whether it arises from stationary or moving traffic is immaterial.  Perhaps the Minister could reexamine the Bill ascertaining whether it would be possible to deal with this problem.  I will not say it is a very widespread problem but it is sufficiently widespread to be of considerable interest and concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point but provision for it will not be made for in this Bill because it is more properly dealt with by a different code of law.  Quite <Col N="505" /> frankly, if the Road Traffic Act provisions were working as they should be we would have no need to discuss the matter here today.  Perhaps we need to turn our attention to the deficiencies in that Act rather than duplicating it in this Bill.  It would help the pollution problem if the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts worked as they were intended to, but that has not been the case.  This is modelled more on planning legislation and deals specifically with stationary or built structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very sympathetic towards Senator Fitzsimons' point of view.  Even if the Road Traffic Act provisions were working as we would like to see them working or if the regulations governing the Road Traffic Act were enforced, we could reduce that pollution.</P>
      <P>Road traffic users are not the only mobile polluters.  Such pollution can arise in areas close to airports where there may be a lot of air traffic &mdash; for example, at Baldonnel or at Leixlip, where there is a private airport, or in or around national airports where there is ever-increasing air traffic.  Aircraft and helicopters operating from these areas can add greatly to the pollution of the air and push beyond the limit.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that moving vehicles or polluters are not dealt with in the Bill.  It is my personal opinion that the greatest cause of pollution in Dublin today is our public road transport.  I will not go into any detail on this.  I am sure the Minister, who has an office in an area where I occasionally stand awaiting a bus will know what I am talking about.  I know that I feel its polluting effects for the half hour or so I stand in St. Stephen's Green waiting for a bus.  It will be evident to any pedestrian, especially those stationary at a bus stop, that one of the greatest polluters in Dublin city today are CIE.  I regret to have to say that, but it is true.  I compliment the Minister on having dealt expertly with this Bill over the last two days, indeed since its introduction.  We would all agree on that.  I congratulate her on presenting this detailed Bill to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> It is unfortunate that, when the Bill is enacted, we will still have CIE operating as they do today, with vehicles which are polluting the air beyond bearable or permissible limits, beyond anything permissible in this or any other city.  I do not know if it can be rectified at this stage. Perhaps it cannot.  I would ask the Minister not to forget that there is an area not covered by the provisions of the Bill which is of serious concern to people living in this city.  Other cities have less public transport &mdash; perhaps they have a better public transport or better maintained public transport vehicles &mdash; but the greatest polluters in the streets of Dublin today are CIE.  There are other private companies who add to the pollution, but none with as many vehicles as CIE.  I would like to see some provision in the Bill that would help to reduce that air pollution.  I ask the Minister to be concerned about it.  If CIE are not accountable under this Bill, then the efforts of the local authority within the confines of the city will be far less effective on account of CIE being permitted to perform as they have been over the past eight or ten years with vehicles giving out an emission that is polluting the air.  It is my personal opinion that they are the greatest polluters in Dublin city today.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator McMahon for his kind remarks.  All contributors to this debate, particularly those now present &mdash; Senators O'Toole, Fitzsimons and McMahon &mdash; have shown a tremendous commitment to a betterment of our environment for all our sakes, whether for human health or the health of our environment.  Apart from putting into place the correct procedures and machinery for looking after our environment in relation to air pollution problems in the years to come, I hope this debate will help to raise public consciousness.  Tragically, in all of the areas of pollution, we all hold the cure if only we could all be more aware of how our untidiness and lack of concern affects our neighbours, visitors and generally is costing the country dearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As some time has elapsed since the Second Stage debate, I might quote from <Col N="507" /> my speech in relation to this issue which is causing some concern.  On 23 October 1986, as reported at column 862 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>First, it is a fact that neither in Ireland nor in many other parts of the motorised world have road traffic controls by themselves been especially effective in achieving environmental objectives such as better air quality.  This is why at EC level, and within other international environmental bodies, the emphasis is now on vehicle emission controls which will not principally depend on driver behaviour.</P>
    <P>Limitation of vehicle emissions is now being approached primarily through controls on fuel inputs and on vehicle design.  The present Bill, through Section 53, will be fully competent to provide environmental regulation of all vehicle fuels.  Already, the permitted lead content of leaded petrol has been reduced this year in Ireland from 0.4 to 0.15 grammes per litre and unleaded petrol has recently been introduced on the Irish market.</P>
    <P>I accept the concerns being expressed by Senators in relation to this.  It is true to say that the provisions of this Bill have been designed principally to deal with emissions from stationary sources and do not attempt to take over the powers which exist already under the Road Traffic Act to control emissions from vehicles.  Regrettably, the powers that exist under the Road Traffic Acts have not proved very effective.  I take the points made.  Perhaps tightening up of other legislation might be the correct procedure to achieve what we all desire in relation to this.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 37, before section 58, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> 60.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall make regulations under this Act prescribing&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  emission limits for road traffic exhaust fumes, and</P>
    <P>(b)  provision for the checking at regular intervals of vehicles to ensure compliance with the limits referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i> and the issue of certificates of compliance for each vehicle where appropriate.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who is the owner or in possession of a vehicle which fails to comply with the regulations under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is eminently suitable in the light of Senator McMahon's request and is also geared to all our concerns.  Is it possible for the Minister to amend the Bill to take into consideration moving vehicles rather than stationary vehicles or objects?  She might do so by way of reciprocating our cooperation in accepting all her amendments.  It would be a good day's work if the Minister could amend the Bill, whether now or a later stage, by way of incorporating this amendment.  It is necessary.  Senator McMahon dealt very ably with it.  He lives in the midst of it.  I am lucky enough to be able to move out of that atmosphere from time to time and I come back reluctantly into it.  Finally I ask the Minister to try to accept amendment No. 38.  It is necessary for everybody concerned and I have no doubt the Minister will be sympathetic towards it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Senator McMahon has highlighted a very serious and considerable source of pollution.  I have followed the case made by the Minister but, particularly in an urban and city context, pollution from this source could be more considerable than from domestic dwellings in relation to the level of emissions.  There is provision in the amendment to deal with the emissions, to ensure that there will be periodic checking of vehicles and to provide substantial penalties where this is not carried out. Even though the Minister may say traffic legislation may be the appropriate place to <Col N="509" /> do this, in many areas we have cross-references and while there may be a delay in bringing in legislation with regard to traffic, we have an opportunity now in a very simple way to deal with this problem. I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <P>I answered the substance of this amendment while I was answering the last amendment and Senator O'Toole would perhaps agree with that. He is only too well aware of my views on it at this stage.  I regret I must oppose this amendment.  In relation to the &ldquo;balance of co-operation&rdquo;&mdash; I remind him that I have taken on board the substance, if not exactly the wording, of some of the amendments put by Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzsimons.  Ultimately my only concern, much as I would like to make co-operation one of my priorities, must be that we produce legislation that will be effective, that will have teeth and that will do the job in preventing air pollution as far as possible and ensuring a clean, healthy environment for all of us and our children to enjoy in the future.</P>
      <P>I oppose this amendment for the reasons I made clear.  I must reiterate also that it is unnecessary and would duplicate powers already available to the Minister for the Environment under section 11 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  While I appreciate and share the concern of the Senators who tabled this amendment about the proper control of vehicle emissions, when all the current measures are fully implemented there will be an ample legislative base from which to control such emissions.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary to reconcile the otherwise absolute and competing claims of section 28 (4) and section 58 (3).  Section 28 (4) gives absolute force to an order of the High <Col N="510" /> Court notwithstanding the terms of any permission given under any other enactment in relation to a premises. Section 58 (3) gives complete immunity to the Safety in Industries Acts, 1955 and 1980, which involve licensing of premises in relation to the whole of the present Bill.

      <P>The Minister for the Environment was very prompt in attending this House.  He came to the ante room when we reached the second last section of the Bill.  I think he underestimated the pace at which we were travelling and having had no lunch decided there might be time to have a cup of coffee.  He promised to watch the monitor and he will be with us within a few minutes.</P>

    <P>Senators will recall that originally the <Col N="512" /> Electoral (Special Voters) Bill was to be the first item of business today.  Discussion among the Whips in another place indicates that they wish that this Bill would pass from the Seanad to the Dáil next week.  My suggestion would be that we should now commence Second Stage.  In order to facilitate possible amendments on this Bill we should be as brief as possible on Second Stage leaving the major part of the discussion to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I have no wish to restrict discussion on this Bill but it would be helpful to Senators who have amendments and to the Minister himself if we were able to conclude Second Stage.  From the appearance of the House it is probable that it might be sufficient to have the Minister's introduction, a speech from each side of the House on the principle of the Bill which is absolutely agreed among all parties, a reply from the Minister and then we could get down to the hard grind of the examination of the Bill at the beginning of business next Tuesday on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill introduces two measures of electoral  for which there has been long-standing and deeply-felt demand.  It provides special voting facilities for disabled electors and also establishes a system which will make it possible for diplomats representing this country abroad to vote at elections here. I am sure that the principle behind these reforms will be met with approval and, indeed, with a good deal of satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the case for providing adequate voting facilities for the disabled has been made with force and conviction by Senators on both sides of the House. It has been maintained that our present voting arrangements, by not taking appropriate account of the specific needs of the disabled, may be discriminatory and may have the effect of disenfranchising an <Col N="513" /> appreciable number of our citizens, the particular citizens being persons who already have to bear the considerable burden of ill-health or disability.  The Seanad will recall that one disabled elector was so concerned about this state of affairs that she felt impelled to institute legal proceedings which have been dealt with in the High Court and the Supreme Court. The present Bill will make good this deficiency in our electoral law.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the problem of voting by disabled electors the Bill recognises that there are two different levels of disability to be catered for.  There are many disabled persons who are perfectly capable of making their way to the polling station but find access to the voting area difficult because of the physical characteristics of the building concerned.  There may be steps to be mounted, narrow doorways or awkward corridors to be negotiated.  The disabled electors may be faced with the choice of sacrificing their vote or enduring the indignity of being physically conveyed past the obstruction.  At future elections, persons in this category will be able to transfer their vote to another polling station to which access is easier for them.  In the run up to the election or referendum they may apply to the returning officer for the constituency who will issue the necessary authorisation.</P>
    <P>In relation to those who are unable to visit the polling station by reason of long term physical illness or physical disability that voter may apply to the local registration authority for entry on what will be called &ldquo;the special voters list&rdquo;.  This list will be drawn up each year at the same time as the draft register of electors.  Each application for entry on the list must be supported by a medical certificate.</P>
    <P>At an election or referendum a ballot paper will be conveyed to each elector named on the special voters list, at their residence, by a special presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The special voter will make and sign a declaration of identity, which will be witnessed by the special presiding officer, and will then mark the ballot paper in secret.  The ballot paper, enclosed in a sealed envelope will be conveyed by the <Col N="514" /> special presiding officer to the returning officer for the constituency.  It will then be placed in the postal voters ballot box and will be treated in exactly the same way as voting papers received from postal voters.</P>
    <P>Under existing electoral law no provision is made for voting by civil servants attached to our diplomatic missions abroad.  I understand that we are alone among the 12 member states of the European Community in not making some provision in this regard.</P>
    <P>The position so far as this country is concerned is that, not only are special voting arrangements not made for persons in this category but the persons concerned are not, generally speaking, eligible for registration as electors.  Under existing law, a person must be ordinarily resident in a constituency in order to be eligible for registration.  A temporary absence of up to 18 months is not regarded as breaking the continuity of residence.  However, civil servants attached to missions are normally posted abroad for a period of several years and, thus, would not satisfy the residence requirement for registration.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that civil servants and their spouses will be deemed to satisfy the residence requirement and will be entitled to be registered in respect of the address in this country at which they would be living if not posted abroad.  They must, of course, also satisfy the normal requirements in relation to age and citizenship.</P>
    <P>The arrangement envisaged is that applications will be made to the appropriate registration authority each year at the time when the draft register is being drawn up.  The fact that the applicant is qualified for registration under this procedure will require to be certified by the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The registration authority will enter the names on the draft register and, as in the case of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, will also enter them on the postal voters list.</P>
    <P>Voting by persons registered under this provision will in general be carried out in the same way as voting by gardaí or members of the Defence Forces but with an important modification.  In voting they will make a declaration of identity in the <Col N="515" /> presence of a person authorised for this purpose by the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; normally the ambassador or head of mission &mdash; and will mark their ballot papers, in secret, in his presence.  The purpose of this modification is to provide a safeguard against the possibility of the kind of abuse which appears to be endemic in any postal voting system.  I will be dealing with the question of abuse at greater length later.</P>
    <P>In satisfying a long standing demand for reform in relation to voting by the disabled and by our official representatives abroad, I am confident that the Bill will be welcomed.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated which, I think, will serve to answer any question in relation to the detailed operation of the provisions.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with some questions of principle and policy which I anticipate may be raised in the course of this debate.  In particular I would like to set out the considerations which led the Government to go for the rather cumbersome and expensive special voting arrangement proposed for the disabled in preference to the seemingly simpler and less expensive postal voting system.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will recall that we have had experience in the operation of an extended postal voting system at two local government elections.  A fairly open-ended system was introduced for the 1974 local elections.  It was tightened up considerably for the elections which took place in 1985 and additional safeguards were introduced. However, the sad and inescapable conclusion to be drawn from experience at these two elections is that postal voting is open to abuse, that it has been abused and that there is every likelihood that it would continue to be abused.  It is equally clear that it is not possible to devise safeguards which would guarantee the elimination of such abuse.  In particular, under postal voting, the individual voter and his ballot paper cannot be given the protection and the guarantee of secrecy which is afforded to an elector voting in the polling station.</P>
    <P>As legislators there is undoubtedly an obligation on us to provide reasonable <Col N="516" /> facilities to enable electors to cast their votes and in providing such facilities to take into account, as far as reasonably possible, the specific difficulties experienced by particular categories. However, there is a still more fundamental obligation on us to ensure that elections are decided by the free vote of the people and not by machinations.</P>
    <P>The preservation of the integrity of the electoral system is particularly important in our situation where Government majorities tend to be slim and where individual seats can be won or lost by late preferences on a handful of ballot papers.  I am aware as I am sure many Senators are of one situation in a recent general election where the allocation of the last seat in a five seat constituency was decided by five votes on the eleventh count.  No doubt other examples can be given.  The clear message is that abuse even on a very limited scale could call into question the result of an election.  In those circumstances the concept of an acceptable level of electoral abuse is simply not on.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the problem of striking a balance between the desirability of adjusting the voting arrangements to suit particular circumstances and the necessity to preserve the integrity of the electoral procedure.  The special voting arrangements proposed in the Bill represent a measured response to this problem.  They provide the disabled with a reasonable opportunity of voting and at the same time provide a complete safeguard against the abuse associated with postal voting.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that the abuse which took place was not perpetrated by the sick, the disabled or the other categories for whom the system was devised.  These were simply the innocent victims of the abuses which took place.  It must be a source of sadness to us all that this is the situation.  But we live in the real world and our proposals must take account of the situation as it is, not what we might wish it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. We have had regulations and Bills to cover <Col N="517" /> persons who are incapacitated and are unable to get to the polling booth because of their disability and incapacity.  We on this side of the House are prepared to agree to the suggestion by the Leader of the House that one speaker from each side of the House should contribute to the discussion.  I hoped to have an opportunity between the debates on the Air Pollution Bill and this Bill to examine this Bill in depth.  We will be making a better and perhaps a more substantial contribution on Committee Stage rather than on Second Stage.  Because the debate is limited to two speakers the Minister should be able to put it through both Houses of the Oireachtas without undue delay.  We on this side of the House will not in any way deter its passage through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, there were abuses of a few of the systems we have had.  This Bill should have the effect of eliminating abuses and of allowing us to provide facilities for voting for people who are unable to go to the polls.  Would I be right in saying that if this Bill goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas and an election takes place between now and 15 April, this legislation will come into effect for any election prior to 15 April or will the Bill only be operative from 15 April 1987, the date of the new register?  If this is the case there is no urgency but I understood that speed was essential in order to have the legislation for the next election so that people on the present register will be allowed participate in any election prior to 15 April 1987.  Will the Minister clarify this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of outlying islands along our coasts and these will have to be catered for under the Bill.  I would envisage the sending of an officer, appointed by the county registrar, to these islands long before the date of the election in order to give an opportunity in the case of inclement weather for ballot papers to reach the returning officer in time for the count.  It is important that the Minister would take into consideration the people on the islands so that people who will be qualified to vote under this Bill will have that opportunity.  Ample notice should be given to ensure that the people of those <Col N="518" /> islands have the same facilities as people on the mainland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby people who are on the register but who are in areas outside the jurisdiction of the State, through no fault of their own, will now have an opportunity to vote in any election. These people spend some time away but they also spend much of their time in Ireland and they should have the right to vote.  We will probably be putting down amendments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It will be a cumbersome and expensive job to get around to each voter who is deemed to be incapacitated.  I understand that the jurisdiction of deeming a person a voter in this category will rest with the county registrar.  He will be the person who, on the submission of a medical certificate will deem the person a voter under this legislation.  Sometimes it can be quite easy to get a certificate.  Will evidence other than the medical certificate be required for this purpose?  That is a very sensitive area and one the Minister should give some thought to.  Voters should be given sufficient time in which to make their applications.  We must allow enough time in which to deem an applicant a voter and, subsequently, for him to be called on by the representative of the returning office and a garda.  We do not want to have a situation in which these representatives would be rushing around constituencies in order to have voters complete their ballot papers as fast as possible and return them to the returning officers.  There should be ample time to ensure that everybody is catered for under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on bringing in this legislation.  It is only right that those who are incapacitated and also those who are out of the country and for whom we are providing here be given the opportunity of having their say in the election of people to govern the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that the kind of abuses that were perpetrated up to now will be eliminated by this legislation but that is something we will be able to judge only in time.  It would not be easy to pre-empt abuses at this stage.  We can only ensure that we tighten the legislation as much as possible in that regard.  If this legislation works properly <Col N="519" /> on this occasion it can be easily repeated in subsequent elections.  That is what everybody would wish for and I have no doubt but that the Minister will get the cooperation of the people involved in the administration of the legislation.  I look forward to seeing it in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Toole I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister speed in getting it through both Houses and putting it into operation.  While most of us pay a lot of attention to our electoral system and how the system operates, and indeed we could spend a long time discussing this and any matter connected with election day, I think we are all anxious to see the Bill through, particularly in these uncertain times.  I certainly see no reason why it should not be enacted before the new register comes into operation.  It really has nothing to do with the register. The most important thing is to ensure that it is enacted before we have a dissolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas so that it can be in operation for the events that will follow.</P>
      <P>Even though we are extremely interested in the voters and how they operate, it is not generally realised that the Irish people are far better voters &mdash; I am not referring to their choice of candidate or party &mdash; than are most of our European neighbours. They are certainly more anxious to go to the polls.  We see on the papers following an election the percentage of votes cast but I have always found that percentage to be far higher than the published percentage. If one takes a page of the register one finds on that page somebody who would dearly have loved to have cast his vote but for reasons, and some of the reasons are being dealt with in this Bill, beyond his control he was unable to vote.  I have met some of these people at election time and indeed subsequent to elections and I cannot express to the House how they felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish people are deeply interested in voting.  I may not always agree with the way they vote but certainly the onus is on all of us, the democratically elected members and parties in the democratic <Col N="520" /> system, to ensure that as many as possible of people fulfilling the qualification are enabled to carry out their duty on that day. With this in mind the Minister, has brought this Bill before the House and probably because of the uncertain times we are now in politically he has probably rushed it through his Department.  I would certainly go along with the Leader of the House who said we should not delay it here, that we should have a look at it quickly.  I hope we can finish Second Stage today and then deal quickly with any amendments that may be proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The most important thing in this Bill &mdash; there are a few points I want to make on it &mdash; is that we get the Bill through because it will enable more people to cast their votes on election day, something which is indeed dear to their hearts.  I have some neighbours who for years were on the register and then because of a typographical error or whatever they were omitted from the register.  In one case that person nearly had to go to hospital.  He was a man in his early seventies and he had voted all his life from the time he was 21 years of age in every election and he could not understand why he was being denied his vote.  I could not explain to him that it was unintentional that he was not on the register.  The local authority could not explain it to me but it seemed to have been a typographical error.  That is the effect it had on this man.  There are many people in the categories being dealt with here in this Bill who have had to suffer that annoyance at every election.  I am certainly glad the Minister has brought the Bill before the House, I want to see it enacted as quickly as possible so that in case we do have an election in the near future we will give these people the pleasure and indeed the pride of casting their vote because that is how they feel about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extending the vote also to civil servants on diplomatic mission but I wonder if he has considered extending it to other people?  He mentioned that we are the last in the EC to do this but there are certainly many citizens with voting qualification who are abroad because we are in the EC.  They may not necessarily be civil servants but could be serving many <Col N="521" /> of the committees and the like in the EC. Indeed, many of them are also civil servants but could not be described as being in the diplomatic service or on diplomatic missions.  I know of many people who are now in Europe with their families for a period of four or five years or for whatever period their contract lasts with the EC and I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to allowing them to vote.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to me from the Bill if those who will be permitted to go from their own polling station to a neighbouring polling station within the same electoral area need to be on the special voters list.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this point.  Can a person on the ordinary voters list we have published today apply?  You could have a person who has been disabled for a short period and who might not have been disabled when the special voters list was being compiled.  That person could have problems gaining access to certain polling stations.  It is not clear to me whether a person being directed from his own polling station to another polling station must be on the special voters list.  The special presiding officer appointed by the returning officer to visit the homes of the disabled people in connection with voting is to be accompanied by a garda but I notice there is no provision for another agent, say a personating agent of a candidate or a party personating agent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this should be permitted because it is normal standard practice in the ordinary voting stations that candidates can appoint their agents if they so wish.  This seems to be a normal act being gone through in an abnormal way. A specially appointed presiding officer with a garda visits your home and nobody else is permitted to be present.  We do not know who the presiding officers will be or who the gardaí will be.  I am not casting aspersions on them any more than in the normal polling station situation, but we should ensure that democracy is carried through to the full and a personating agent of the candidate should be permitted to accompany the special presiding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> There is another point which I have raised on Electoral Bills in the past.  The time for registration is from 15 December to 15 January each year.  There seems to be no movement on that despite the fact that I and many other Oireachtas Members have pleaded for some relaxation or some re-arranging of it.  There is a further requirement that the person being registered between 15 December and 15 January for the register operative from the following April must be resident at that location in September of that year.  Strictly speaking a person moving into an area today cannot be registered and cannot vote from that address until April of 1988.  A person moving into a residence in October 1986 under the law as it stands at the moment is not permitted to vote from that address because he cannot be registered at that address until the following year and cannot vote until April 1988.  For a year and a half that person is residing at that address and has no legal right to vote.  In this day and age of technology and computers in every office surely we can give a speedier response to a request for registration than that.</P>
    <P>Those are the few points I wanted to make on the Bill.  Under section 9 the returning officer at an election or a referendum will appoint a special presiding officer.  These officers will have all the powers vested in a presiding officer appointed to a polling station except authority to enable an elector to be assisted in voting by a companion.  A person can be on a special voters list simply because he cannot use his hands.  Many disabled people cannot use their hands and have to be assisted.  How does the Minister hope to get over the fact that this officer will have all the powers vested in him except the authority to enable an elector to be assisted in voting by a companion?  Perhaps it is the reverse, that it is giving him that authority.  I have only glanced through the Bill since the Minister came into the House but I am sure he will clarify that when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>Whatever faults the Bill may have, it is to be welcomed because it is enabling more and more people who heretofore could not cast their votes to do so.  I would like to <Col N="523" /> see an extension in the areas I have outlined and I await the Minister's reply to the points I have made about the EC personnel who are involved.  We could extend that to firms because very often a multinational firm here send some of their personnel managers abroad for a period of a year or two to see how the firm are operating in other countries and thereby improve their operations here.  People go abroad for brief periods like this and I can see no reason why they cannot be facilitated in the same way as civil servants in the diplomatic missions.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say at this stage.  No doubt we will have a further opportunity on Committee Stage.  I wish the Minister well with the Bill and I appeal to all sides of the House to ensure that it is enacted as quickly as possible so that it can be effective.  I hope we will not need it for eight, ten or 12 months but, at the same time, we know what the position is and we could need it in three, four or five months time.  We have the Christmas holidays coming up and we should ensure that it will be put through both Houses of the Oireachtas and be available for people to cast their votes whenever the next voting day comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as do all Members of the House.  In principle I cannot give it quite such a warm welcome as Senator McMohan and Senator O'Toole gave it because too little and too late.  It has been a very long time coming.  We need to know if this Bill is so urgent as has been suggested in this House today and yesterday, will it come into operation immediately on passing through this House and the other House.  It is unclear whether a new register needs to be compiled and whether this Bill will not come into operation until April.  If it does not come into operation until April what is the hurry? I hope the Bill will come into operation immediately it goes through both Houses and I presume this is the reason it is going through this House with a certain amount of welcome speed this week.  It should then go through the Dáil very quickly and be in operation for the election whenever it <Col N="524" /> comes.  I am not prejudiced about whether it comes next month, in three months, six months or nine months, but the important thing for disabled people is that it comes through as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why this Bill was not introduced last year or the year before.  At the time of the referendum on the amendment to the Constitution on divorce we had a similar type debate on votes for the disabled in this House and unfortunately it is only now that this Bill is coming to the House.  The urgency today seems a little bit absurd when the urgency was emphasised last year and the year before and the year before.  It would be a tragedy if, the Bill having been presented in this House as being urgent, an election was called and those people this Bill is supposed to franchise are still effectively disenfranchised in the next election.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could clear up that point.  The timing is very important and it is unclear to both sides of the House according to the speeches made here.  I welcome the Bill because it is a recognition of the difficulties under which disabled people labour in this country and the lack of awareness in our laws, in our attitudes and in our rules about the needs of the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most interesting point about this is that polling stations are so inaccessible at the moment to disabled people.  Very few polling stations are accessible to the disabled and I would like to see this Bill beginning a process whereby all public buildings are made accessible to wheelchair users so that not only polling stations, not only the National Concert Hall but all public and private buildings are accessible, and compulsorily accessible, to disabled people.  There are no facilities even in this House, for instance, for disabled people.  It would be very difficult for someone in a wheelchair to listen to what I am saying here at this moment, which is very unfortunate for them.  It would be very difficult as well for members of the public who are in wheelchairs to visit the Dáil.  While the Bill recognises one aspect of the difficulties of disabled people &mdash; and elections are on everybody's mind at the moment &mdash; we <Col N="525" /> should ensure that all public buildings, private buildings, cinemas, theatres, post offices are accessible to disabled people. It would take only one or two removable chairs and an accessible lift to allow disabled people to come in here.</P>
    <P>The postal vote has been criticised implicitly in the Bill and in the Minister's speech.  I can see the difficulties but I think they are over emphasised in this Bill.  I see very little evidence in the system under which the University Senators in this House are elected by postal vote of massive, broad personation.  You may get very strange results but I do not think they would be the outcome of a massive amount of fraud in the electoral process.  I wonder if it would be less of a humiliating process and involve less paraphernalia for the disabled if they were to receive their votes by registered letter and return them by registered letter.  While a registered letter, it may be maintained, is a rather loose or insecure way of allowing people to vote, to me it is a particularly safe way.</P>
    <P>If a registered letter goes astray as I understand it, it is very easy to put a trace on it, and if a disabled voter does not get his registered letter in time he will be screaming and kicking up a fuss about it. It is very easy to trace a registered letter, where it has gone, whether it has been delivered, where it has been delivered.  I find it difficult to meet the objections which the Minister has to this in the Bill but I will concur with the House's desire that this Bill should go through Second Stage today and will not detain the House at length.  I welcome the Bill.  It is only the tip of the iceberg and it is only a small piecemeal way of attacking the problems of the disabled.</P>

      <P>I understand the House has agreed that only one member from each grouping should speak but lest it be thought that my interest in the Bill is not keen, I should just like to say that I will reserve the major portion of my contribution for Committee Stage.  As a nominee to the Seanad of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland, obviously I have a particular interest in postal voting for the disabled and have contributed in the <Col N="526" /> past to discussions on this subject.  I look forward to contributing at length on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senators for the general welcome which they have given to the provisions contained within this Bill.  I agree that it is extremely important that the House, the Legislature and the Executive should recognise the special needs of the disabled in a variety of respects and I would like to think that I have endeavoured to do that during my own time in Parliament &mdash; back to the late seventies, when I was party spokesman on health.  In the other House, I was very interested in and actively pursued the cause of the disabled.  Quite recently I was glad to have the opportunity to announce that families who have a physically disabled member amongst them may, even if they have previously owned a house, apply for and get the first time purchaser grant if they are purchasing a new house which they are having especially adapted to the needs of the disabled member of the family.  Indeed, about the same time we issued instructions to local authorities and others who are involved in the provision of swimming pools to provide specifically for special access to be made available to swimming pools for the disabled.  When I was Minister for the Public Service I availed of the opportunity on at least one occasion when we were having a large intake of young people to act as temporary clerical trainees to increase the objectives set for public employers generally of a 3 per cent quota of disabled people to 5 per cent in relation to that category.  Many of us could ensure that life which obviously is somewhat more difficult for disabled people than it is for the rest of us could be made a little easier if the rest of us gave more care and attention to the problems which the disabled encounter, which we <Col N="527" /> more able-bodied people just do not notice.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross was less than fulsome in his welcome of the measure largely based on his submission that the Bill represented too little, too late.  Of course, if that was to be the yardstick for the criticism of any measure it might well mean that no new proposals would ever to put forward on the basis that they all should have been put forward previously.  The simple fact of the matter is that the reason for the delay in recent years in presenting this legislation is quite simply the ingenuity of the Irish in managing to pervert the previous postal voting attempts which were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could regale the House for many hours in recounting to them details of widespread abuse of the most extraordinary ingenuity achieved in different parts of the country by candidates, agents on behalf of candidates and friends of candidates and agents.  Indeed, were it not for the system which we are now proposing, which I admitted in my introduction of the measure here is somewhat cumbersome and certainly a very expensive system, were it not for the adoption by the Government of that system I am afraid the inescapable conclusion would be that it was not possible to provide special voting facilities for the disabled for fear of abuse of the same type as had been experienced when postal voting was attempted in those local elections.  May I say in that regard, just to give one single example, that in many instances, postal vote applications were made in the names of people without their knowledge?  Complicated mechanisms were set up to intercept the postal vote and, occasionally when queries were raised by the registration authority, to intercept the query and to respond to it on behalf of the supposed applicant.  There is a rather interesting account of a different version of &ldquo;Postman's Knock&rdquo; which took place in a certain part of the country where the postman was literally followed by a string of agents or runners on behalf of a particular candidate who arrived shortly after the postman at the various houses where postal votes were being delivered and while one would engage in deep and interested conversation with the applicant <Col N="528" /> his companion would remove the postal vote.</P>
    <P>It is interesting in another respect to hear the Senator criticise the system because, frankly, this system as adopted by the Government at my suggestion is based on my experience of the voting system which obtains in relation to the majority of the Members of the Seanad.  If the Senators care to examine carefully the system &mdash; the signing of a witness authorisation and the placing of the disabled person's vote into an envelope which will then be put together with the witnessed document into a larger cover for returning, they will realise that to a large extent it is modelled on the system which elects 43 Members of the Seanad.  I am sure Senators would attest to the adequacy of that system.</P>
    <P>In that regard perhaps I might at this stage avail of the opportunity to deal with a specific point raised by Senator McMahon in relation to companion voting and the attendance of personation agents. The Bill specifically excludes the right of persons other than the presiding officer and the Garda to be present at the time of voting.  There are several reasons for this. In the most part the voting will take place in the disabled voter's own home or residence and often, because of the nature of the disablement, perhaps in the voter's bedroom.  We were anxious to minimise as much as possible the invasion of privacy of the home by having a large number of people arrive.  In addition it was felt that the presence of the presiding officer and the Garda adequately protected the integrity of the ballot procedure.  While personation agents are provided for in general polling stations where large numbers of people attend it was felt that the likelihood of another person representing themselves to be the disabled voter in the residence was relatively small and would be adequately dealt with by the presiding officer and the Garda.</P>
    <P>For the same reason the companion voter system has not been provided for here because the intention is that where a voter is physically unable to mark the paper the presiding officer will have the power to complete the ballot paper on the instructions of the disabled voter.  I draw the <Col N="529" /> attention of Senators to the fact that a number of disabled voters will almost certainly reside in institutions and that in the implementation of this measure, as well as visiting individual voters in their homes, it may well be that groups of voters will apply who are in long stay residence in particular institutions.  Without over emphasising the point I think many Senators who have experience of practical politics on the ground will know that those voters can sometimes be inordinately influenced by those who care for them on a daily basis within the institutions.  It was felt better that the voters should be allowed cast their votes in the presence of the presiding officer and the Garda rather than in the presence of other people or have other people offer to act as a companion voter on behalf of the disabled person in a long stay residence.  That is the reason for the exclusion of those two provisions. It is not inadvertent, it is quite deliberate and it is to deal with particular problems which I have to say have been experienced from time to time and of which I suspect the majority of the Members of the House have personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>Three of the four Senators who spoke asked about the commencement date for this measure.  The intention is to have this system brought into operation in time for it to coincide with the introduction of the register of electors in 1987-88 which would be 15 April 1987.  I have noted the views expressed by almost all of the Senators who spoke regarding their desire to see this measure introduced immediately on the enactment of the legislation.  I would like to give those suggestions some thought to see whether it might be possible to accommodate them.  There would be major administrative difficulty obviously in trying to introduce a system like this separately from the general compilation of the register of electors which process of course is taking place in the normal way now in preparation for the introduction of the register of 1987-88.  If, however, in view of the views expressed by Senators it were found possible to introduce a system on the enactment of this legislation I would be quite favourably disposed towards that idea.  I would need some time <Col N="530" /> to examine the legislation to see whether in order to provide for that, if it is administratively possible, there would need to be an amendment put forward to the House on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the situation regarding disabled voters who may live on islands.  In that connection it would be a matter for the appropriate returning officer to ensure that arrangements were made to see that the papers were got to those voters in good time, bearing in mind the possibility of inclement weather conditions.  I have every confidence that once this system comes into operation the returning officer will recognise where there may be particular difficulties in visiting the homes of disabled voters living in isolated areas or on islands. I hope they will be able to provide accordingly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the medical certificate required, the medical certificate will I expect in virtually all cases be that of a general practitioner but the Bill provides for a certificate to be signed by any medical doctor.  In the main I would anticipate that the certificates would be signed by general practitioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon asked for clarification regarding disabled persons who are not on the special voters' list either through their own choice or perhaps because at the time of suffering their disablement the special voters' list in force had been compiled. There is provision in section 14 where a disabled person who is not on the special voters' list and who will not have the machinery we have just been discussing apply to them to cast their vote.  There is provision for a person in that category if they have difficulty in casting their vote in their local polling station because of difficulty of access, to apply after an election has been called but within not less than seven days before polling day to the returning officer to have their vote transferred to another polling station in that constituency where there is better provision or special provision of access made for the disabled.  I think that is a provision which will be availed of widely. I hope it will help people who either are not on the special voters' list or, who for <Col N="531" /> one reason or another, do not choose to have their names entered on that list.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross suggested as an alternative to the system outlined, the possibility of having the ballot paper sent to the voter by registered post.  I hope that in the few small examples or vignettes I outlined to the House, he will realise that while the use of registered post might to some extent reduce the possibility for abuse, bearing in mind our considerable ingenuity it would leave open &mdash; widespread possibilities.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon raised three other points.  One was a suggestion that people other than civil servants or diplomats posted abroad, but who are natives of or normally resident in this country should be afforded the opportunity of voting in the same way as those civil servants.  This point was given considerable attention by the Government and it was not found possible to introduce a system which safeguarded against abuse.  It might be argued perhaps that people working in the public service generally who are posted abroad might have the same provision extended to them and then it might equally be argued that people working on behalf of private sector interests abroad might have the franchise extended to them.  It is very difficult then to resist the temptation that people on long-stay holidays abroad should have the franchise extended to them.  Once the door is opened, the further groups who would come onto the horizon are virtually endless.</P>
    <P>While there are relatively wide postal voting provisions in some other countries, it is also interesting to note, for example, that in both France and Belgium the entire postal voting system was abolished ten years ago because of the difficulties of abuse and the difficulties of policing it.  I am afraid that were we to pursue the course as suggested by the Senator, we would eventually have so many groups claiming eligibility that there would be a very wide and uncontrollable postal voting system fraught with all of the difficulties of abuse which I have earlier referred to.</P>
    <P>The final two points do not relate specifically to the provisions of this Bill but <Col N="532" /> rather to the electoral law generally.  I refer to the difficulties experienced by some existing voters who find themselves through some error omitted from a subsequent register.  There is also the point that the time of publication of the draft register, during which people may inspect the register and make an appeal if their name has been omitted or wrongly entered, is unsuitable running as it does from approximately this time until early in the New Year.  Both of those matters have been receiving attention.  I accept that the period is a particularly difficult one and was adverted to by the working party some time ago.  I am examining the electoral law generally and I hope to be in a position to come back to the Oireachtas shortly with a proposed amending Bill relating to various aspects of the electoral law which will deal with this matter among others. It would make specific provision also for persons who have previously been registered on the electoral register and who have not changed their address but through some clerical or administrative error find themselves omitted from the register to be able to claim their entitlement within a reasonable period prior to an election.</P>
    <P>I suspect that that electoral Bill when I bring it before the Houses will be the subject of lengthy debate.  There are many matters which are introduced by Ministers in the Oireachtas on which a number of the members in each House would see themselves as having particular special or expert qualifications.  There are very few measures which are introduced where in one House 60 of the Members and in the other 166 all know they are the acknowledged experts on the topic.  I imagine that a further Bill will receive very close and detailed scrutiny from the Senators and Members of the other House when I introduce it, hopefully some time early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking Senators for the general welcome they have given to the provision.  I hope they understand the practical difficulties on the ground which we have encountered and which have brought us to the realisation that the system providing for voting for the disabled has to be of necessity one which contains as <Col N="533" /> many safeguards as possible within it, as does the system which is outlined in the Bill now before the House.  Again, I will give consideration as to whether it is possible to introduce the commencement of this provision immediately following the enactment of the Bill and, if so, whether that might necessitate the introduction of an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>

The other business that is liable to be ordered for Tuesday is the Report Stage of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill.  I might state for the information of Members that there will probably be about ten Government amendments on Report Stage of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill.  These are at present in the hands of the parliamentary draftsmen and it is hoped they will be circulated by Monday at the latest.  If, in fact, they are not circulated in time to allow us to have a debate late on Tuesday, I will not be pressing Senators to take it without due notice.  We would then be able to pass on to the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill which has been circulated and to take Second Stage of that Bill.</P>
