      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Government to provide support for activities in Ireland in connection with International Year of Shelter, 1987.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2.  The proposition is that on the conclusion of the Committee Stage of No. 1 we would proceed with the remaining Stages.  Those having been passed, it is proposed that we would then take No. 2, concerned with the Earlier Signature Motion.  The question of whether the sitting should be suspended from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. can be considered later in the morning when we see what progress has been made.  If we are well on with the debate I think it would be the wish of Senators that there would not be a suspension, that we should carry through to complete the business as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the <Col N="1761" /> various rates of increase that have been referred to in the Bill.  I accept, as the Chair has told me, that my amendments to this and later sections would impose a charge, but it is no harm to restate the fact that the increases of 4 per cent in some cases and 5 per cent in others will not be a reality because we are talking about eight months instead of a full year. Therefore, these increases are of 2.7 per cent instead of 4 per cent and 3.4 per cent in the case of the 5 per cent.  The Government say they are giving 4 per cent and 5 per cent increases but that is not the case.  In the meantime, having regard to the various VAT increases which were imposed from day one, social welfare recipients are the real losers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had covered that in my reply yesterday.  I repeat that for the past few years increases in social welfare rates have been granted from either the end of June or some time in July.  We have not only matched inflation but we have outpaced it in these increases every year.  The standard time for the commencement of the increases has been the middle of the year.  The 1985 increases fully matched inflation up to the middle of 1986 and the increases in this Bill are expected to do the same and, indeed, to outstrip inflation up to mid-1987.  Therefore, we are arguing about something with an historical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this has been done in the past few years, but the Government were breaking with tradition in this respect because Fianna Fáil Governments dated the increases from as early as possible.  Therefore, people had come to expect the increases from April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In planning our expenditure every year we have looked at every possible aspect of Government expenditure particularly with a view to ascertaining how we could ensure that social welfare recipients were more than sheltered against any cost of living increase. <Col N="1762" /> We have managed to do that and, as of next week, give taxpayers an enormous boost in their disposable incomes.  As I said yesterday, we are talking about considerable extra expenditure.  I think I made it clear yesterday also that over the last three years, had these increases been implemented from April, the extra cost involved this year would have been £22 million, in 1985 £32 million and in 1984, £34 million.  Those kinds of sums would have more than swallowed up the kinds of increases we have been able to grant, the kind of help we have been able to give taxpayers and the child benefit allowance. While all of these may be very desirable, we must be realistic and ascertain what is the best use that can be made of the resources available to us.  I am happy that the increases being given from their date of implementation, and those given in the last couple of years, will have more than protected social welfare recipients against any cost of living increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, would the Minister accept, particularly in the case of single unemployed people, that the rates are still abysmally low and bear no relationship to people's needs in order to have any kind of dignified lifestyle?  I emphasise single unemployed people. Would the Minister agree that, in spite of the admitted progress made by a number of Governments in recent years, the basic rates for single unemployed people remain abysmally low?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator B. Ryan that the single rates are not by any means at a level any of us in this House would like to see.  However, that would apply to many other rates also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Senator was here for the Second Stage debate yesterday when there was considerable ranging over various forms of payment.  For instance, Senators mentioned widows, prescribed relatives allowance, a great many rates were mentioned as being worthy of increase.  I responded by saying that I agreed fully that such increases were desirable.  Therefore, I do not disagree at <Col N="1763" /> all with the Senator when he makes his point about the desirability of increasing the single person's allowance.  Unfortunately, to implement increases over and above those made consistently over the last few years would put considerable strain on some other element of social welfare expenditure.  This is something that has to be balanced.  If we could increase the rates for the weaker sections of society, nobody would be more pleased than I.  Indeed, the Government would be very happy to do so.  It is a question of what is possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the increase from £49 to £58 in the amount of weekly earnings to be disregarded in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit.  It is correct to say that over the past three years this increase has risen from a figure of £36 to £58.  This must be seen as representing a major loss to those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs or become ill.  It has to be recognised that this would reduce further any benefits that would be payable to those people who were unemployed, disabled or who were in receipt of maternity or other benefits.  It could entail suffering a loss of as much as £2 per week.  These unfortunate people are getting little enough, and to reduce their net incomes <Col N="1764" /> further can only be unfair.  If, on the one hand, we maintain that there is an increase of whatever amount, we should also make the point that there could be losses incurred on the other side also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House will forgive me, I might spend a couple of moments in an endeavour to put this into perspective. Pay-related benefit is calculated as a percentage of a person's reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year between two fixed amounts &mdash; the floor, which is currently £49 per week, and a ceiling, which is at present £220 a week.  Pay-related benefit is paid as a supplement with disability, unemployment or injury benefit.  It was introduced in April 1974, and since its introduction there has always been a proportion of reckonable earnings disregarded in order to calculate the amount of pay-related benefit in addition to the flat rate benefits.  In 1974, the year of its introduction, the disregard was set at £14 &mdash; that was over twice the prevailing rate of flat rate benefit, which was £6.55 a week.  There was no change at all effected until 1981, even though the flat rate benefit had been increased very significantly in the meantime.  The purpose of the disregard is to ensure that the amount of personal flat rate benefit is taken into account in determining the amount of the pay-related benefit.  The significant point here is that, if the floor had been maintained at the same level in relation to the flat rate benefit as it was when the whole scheme was started, the floor would now be £84 instead of the £58 we propose.  That is a relevant point to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point I must make is that, of course, the new £58 floor will apply only to new claims being made after next week, 1 April.  Existing claimants will not be affected.  Their entitlement will continue to be calculated on the basis of the lower floor.  As Senator Fallon said, there is some effect, but it is relatively small.  The maximum pay-related benefit will be reduced by just over £2 as a result of this new floor.  However, had the floor <Col N="1765" /> being maintained at the same level since 1974, as was the intention at its commencement, it would now be approximately £84 instead of £58.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express some reservations about the movement of the floor and the ceiling with which we will be dealing in the next section.  I understand the Minister's rational explanation, but the beneficiaries of pay-related social welfare worry about the philosophy of fiddling with floors and ceilings.  Either we accept the principle of pay-related or we do not.  Unfortunately, in England they have come to disregard pay-related completely; it has been abolished.  Trade unions, employers and others in this country are now beginning to condemn the philosophy of pay-related.  Formerly it constituted a tremendous source of sustenance in that people, when they became ill or unemployed through no fault of their own, knew that their pay-related benefit would be in line with their former earnings.  The record shows that I have commented on this Bill every year since we began to endanger the pay-related principle that we are now employing floors and ceiling to have it social welfare-related and not related to pay. The principle for which the scheme was intended originally was to relate the income of an unemployed or sick person to the payment that a person had when working.  Now we are trying to ensure by manipulating these two figures that the income people get under this heading is related in some way to the social welfare income of somebody else and not necessarily pay-related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a dangerous road to go down. I can see the reason for it.  We must remove anomalies and ensure that there are incentives for people to go back to work, but it should be done on the basis of the percentage of the pay-related benefit rather than on the floors.  Otherwise we will be tinkering with the whole principle of pay-related as opposed to dealing with a percentage income that people should have when they are unemployed.  I do not know if that makes sense to the Minister, but there is a feeling on the ground that <Col N="1766" /> people who have no objection to paying pay-related and possibly have objections to paying tax on the pay-related element of their income, when they are unfortunate enough to be sick or unemployed the amount they get from the State should be related in some way to what they were earning, that there should not be movement of floors to ensure that anomalies are removed.  I would say the same for the ceiling.</P>
    <P>There should be no ceiling.  Everybody should pay pay-related based on income. We should not stop it at a given exclusive rate for people in the higher bracket who suddenly find themselves at various parts of the tax year paying very much less because suddenly their pay-related contributions have stopped, although one would argue that they are the least affected when they are unemployed or sick.  The other argument is that people with a fairly high income faced with the trauma of unemployment find it even more difficult than the poor to adjust to having no income.  I worry about this believing, as I do, in the principle of a pay-related social insurance scheme based on income while one is earning which should be based on a relation to that income when one unfortunately is not earning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only presume that the Minister's previous experience in these benches was why she noticed my absence yesterday.  She keeps a more watchful eye on these Independent backbenchers here than many people would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am intrigued that the benefit increases are dated from some time in July while the adjustments downwards are dated from 7 April.  The Minister made a plausible case for it if all we are doing is attempting to restore the situation to where it was previously. However, as Senator Ferris said rightly, there is an increasing identification of pay-related benefit by the well identified new Right as one of the areas of public expenditure that could do with some heavy cutting.  There is a good deal of talk about disincentive to work and things like that which do not apply to them, <Col N="1767" /> but obviously apply to everybody else. Therefore, I would like an assurance from the Minister that all that is involved here is the restoration of a situation. While I might not like the situation, that would at least give us a ceiling above which we will not eliminate or pare away pay-related benefit.  Pay-related benefits are one of the more useful, innovative and compassionate benefits that have been introduced in recent years here and they have been beneficial in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>We need to be very careful.  Many of the people who speak loudest about the disincentive value of the pay-related benefits, particularly disability benefit, in their own employment have the magnificent cushion of having a full salary when they themselves are sick, but they try to prounounce that other people in other areas of employment must have something less than 80, 70 or 60 per cent of income available when they are sick in order to provide an incentive to work. Their pronouncements on disincentives to work identify no such disincentive for themselves.  People often make decisions about other people's values, lives and motivations which are entirely different from what they would attribute to themselves. It is a form of very clear cut social snobbery.  I would like the Minister to explain, though, why this whole area could not be related to the time when benefits were being paid in July and why it must be done with such urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will forgive me if I am not able to answer in great detail every point they make at this stage. I understand Senator Ferris's concern about what he considers to be the tinkering around with the floors and the ceilings. I will not bore the House by repeating what I said earlier on the question of the foundation of these schemes and what has happened since then to change the relationship of the floor from what it was in 1974 when the scheme was first started.  I said that the scheme started in 1974 with a ratio which was just over twice the prevailing rate of flat rate <Col N="1768" /> benefit.  Nothing at all happened for some reason until 1981.  Perhaps it would have been better if the relationship had been kept in tandem in those years, because the level of flat rate benefit, as we know, was increased significantly in that period but the floor was not touched at all.  Perhaps it is a pity that it was not kept in tandem.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris stated that there are concerns among various people about changes being made in the floors and ceilings in this area and he mentioned the danger to what is considered to be the very good principle of pay-related benefit.  At the same time there are a great many clearly expressed concerns, not always from what Senator Ryan refers to as the new Right, about disincentives to work.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will rephrase that. A great many people who are not of what I consider to be the new Right are genuinely worried about the real disincentive to work.  Let us face it.  We know we are talking about people who are at the lower end of the spectrum in our society, and to place extra burdens on them in terms of persuading them by benefits that we have available not to work is not a good thing from that point of view.  How one deals with that is obviously a matter for wider debate and there are various ways of trying to do it. Some of the ways might be very attractive but would involve enormous expenditure. Debate on ways of increasing the minimum incomes could be opened.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Ryan who asked me to give undertakings about not doing away with PRB.  That was the general trend of his remarks.  Obviously, no Minister in any Department in any Government can give undertakings about what might happen at any time in the future.  It is no part of my understanding of my job to embark on that sort of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the reservations expressed by <Col N="1769" /> Senator Ferris and Senator Ryan and I understand the reluctance of the House to give its agreement enthusiastically to this section.  If the original relationships had been kept the floor could be much higher.  I hope the House can accept what we are trying to do in this section.</P>
    <P>Question put and declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section the earnings ceiling for PRSI contributions is being raised by £900 with effect from 6 April 1986.  The point raised by Senator Ryan has been well noted, that what is being taken in comes in almost immediately, but what is being given out is delayed for a further three or four months.  It is no harm to say again that not alone have we PRSI contributions being raised by £900 but the Minister for Health told us last week that the income level for the health contribution levy was being increased from £13,000 to £14,000.  Whatever one may say about it, it is another form of taxation.  The regrettable feature of it is that the unfortunate people paying these contributions are getting less by way of return for their payments than at any other time.  In terms of social welfare benefits and health care generally things are quite bad at the moment.  The result is that a worse deal is being created for those paying increased contributions generally.  That must be noted and it is worth highlighting it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be because of my lack of experience of the ins and outs and intricacies of either Government or, indeed, responsibility for anything that I have never understood why the income is set at such a relatively low level, less than twice the average male industrial earnings, which seems to me to be an exceptionally low level.  I have never understood it in principle and I doubt if there are that many people with earnings <Col N="1770" /> in excess of the figure here who become unemployed.  Given the class nature of unemployment, by and large it tends to affect the poor worst of all.  In the area of disability benefit most people in that sort of earning bracket will have some sort of scheme for payment of full salary when they are sick and I cannot understand why we do not extend PRSI to all earnings and all income levels.</P>
      <P>I have never understood why for purely political reasons Governments do not do it.  Any good done by a Government in terms of income tax is entirely lost on a large section of the population because that benefit in income tax is entirely swamped from 6 April in the renewed payment of social insurance contributions, as the Government will discover at the end of April.  Many people who would have benefited from the income tax adjustments will discover then that instead of their net pay going up it will go down because they are to start paying PRSI again.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the <i>rationale</i> behind a modest limit.  I do not think it would cost a lot more because the number of people in that income bracket who will be claiming benefit will be quite small.  It would introduce a note of equity.  It would also distribute the burden fairly and would get rid of a particularly thorny issue which has got every Government in the last five or six years into a lot of hot water at the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On this issue, I am fully with Senator Brendan Ryan and against the philosophy of Senator Fallon.  I mentioned in the debate on section 5 that I had a worry about section 6.  If the whole principle of PRSI is to be followed through there should be no such thing as knocking off at the top end and people not having to make a contribution.  On the basis of social equity alone we should be able to ensure that people in the higher income brackets continue to pay a percentage of their salary into the coffers for distribution to the poorer sections. Instances of unemployment at that rate of income are much lower than they are <Col N="1771" /> at the average income level.  The beneficiaries in the higher grades would be fewer in number and the cost to the Exchequer would be minimal, but the benefit to it by continuing the principle of expecting income earners over this limit to pay PRSI would be considerable.  The Minister would have more funds at her disposal to do all the things we have been asking for in the other sections.</P>
      <P>Obviously, we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot call for widespread payments of social welfare, bringing forward the payment dates and so on, without trying to ensure that we get an income from some source to do it.  Those in the PAYE sector are at their wits end to know when this spiral of increased taxation is going to stop.  We now have a very strong lobby from that side and they are fast running out of patience.  That means we have either to extend the capital tax base or increase borrowings. Although we have tried to control borrowings we still have had to increase them to enormous sums.  The people who suffer as always are those at the lower end of the scale.  I have tried to elicit information privately from Ministers as to why there is a limit beyond which people are no longer required to pay PRSI.  If the income limit was abolished at the upper end and everybody was expected to pay his slight percentage increase in PRSI, the gains to the Exchequer would be considerable. There would be more money available for disposal to the lower sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the point Senator Fallon mentioned which, although not contained in the Bill, is relevant, that people are expected to pay their consultant surgeon when they arrive at a certain income limit.  Of course, that is tied up with the vested interests of consultant surgeons who, in addition to their salary, which is pretty substantial and up to three or four times this limit, want the facility of being able to collect fees from people whose incomes are above certain limits. That is where the VHI comes into play. <Col N="1772" /> We now find people paying their VHI who will not pay their health board contributions. We have a funny attitude to such things.</P>
    <P>If we believe in the principle of PRSI there should not be a stopping of the payment for a selected group of people who earn more than £14,700.  There are quite a few of them in the country, such as members of the Government, officials of semi-State bodies, people in the private sector and directors of companies. They all have pretty substantial incomes. However, at £14,700 they stop paying PRSI.  PRSI should be at the same level for every employee, members of Government, civil servants or the ordinary fellow on the road, the road sweeper working for the county council.  They should all in fairness be paying the same contributions. Those who earn the high income should pay more and those on a lower income pay less, but the principle should be intact.  I do not know why there has to be a limit at this level which is indexed every year to move slightly up.  Is there some reason?  Are we ever to have a national pay-related pension scheme for everybody, farmers, self-employed and business people?</P>
    <P>People should in some way have to contribute to the State to ensure their entitlement by law to a pension at 60 or 65.  At the moment we have this odium of means testing for non-contributory pensioners while property owners legally divest themselves of everything they have to their relatives and descendants in order to qualify for a State pension.  There is only a limited purse available to us.  Let us be honest with one another, everybody should pay something and should not be requested to stop paying it because they are fortunate enough to be earning £14,700 or more a year.  Many people in this country are earning more.  I think I mentioned everybody except trade union officials, so I want to mention them now, because some of them are in a very high income bracket, too.  They are the people with a vested interest in ensuring that there are percentage-related increases. Naturally if you are a negotiator for increases the greater the percentage the <Col N="1773" /> better it is for you.  We must be honest with one another because we are dealing with 240,000 people, unemployed, or sick, or otherwise dependent on the income that we can get into this pool.  We want to do something further and in the process of taking that income into the State, we should not be giving any privileges to people on higher incomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite a wide-ranging set of remarks on this section and I would like to make a few remarks in reply.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon said yesterday that he considered the service available to people in the health and social welfare areas was very bad and getting worse.  He must be aware that health, social welfare, education and housing are the huge spending areas.  The money which we expend on them is not met by what the taxpayer contributes and that is why we have current budget deficits.  The Senator always seems to be making proposals which involve enormous amounts of extra spending without actually saying where he intends to get the money from.  In fact, the people who are paying PRSI, income tax, or in other ways contributing to the Exchequer are only paying for a small amount of the public services being provided and these are provided, unfortunately, far too much on borrowed money. That is the kernel of the country's problems and there is no other way of looking at it.</P>
      <P>We have a range of social services right across the field &mdash; social welfare, health, housing, education, all those big spending areas &mdash; which is far more than the country can afford.  This is the basic problem which has been realised by the Government over the past several years. Indeed, it was this realisation which caused the electorate in the last election to say finally that they had had enough of free spending which got us into this mess in the first place.  I cannot accept that the services available to the public are inadequate.  They are about twice as much as we are actually paying for out of our income tax or any other form of contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> I am not a dogmatic person in any respect on any issue and I am not dogmatic about there not being any ceiling on PRSI contributions.  I would say however, that apparently over the years Governments have looked at the position regarding our tax levels generally.  People above a certain income are paying huge amounts of tax about which they constantly complain and to ask them to pay PRSI above a certain limit on all their income might be considered to add too much to their enormous tax burden.  The Government have to look at that situation and the overall tax burden.</P>
    <P>Remarks have been made about abolishing the ceiling.  If one abolishes the ceiling for PRSI contributions presumably then one is talking about abolishing the ceiling for the actual pay-related benefit as well.  Senators have remarked that very few people in a particular income group become unemployed. Many of us deal with advice clinics in our constituencies and it is becoming more and more a feature that people who were earning higher wages find themselves redundant or unemployed and the question of also extending the full pay-related benefit to that group might be an extremely expensive proposition.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also mentioned that well off people were divesting themselves of all their means in order to benefit from State pensions.  This is something that I have come across consistently as a TD and, since I became Minister for Social Welfare, it has come up in terms of people complaining about it, but it is not only well off people who divest themselves of anything they have.  It is apparently happening right across the board and particularly in an area we discussed at length yesterday &mdash; the area of smallholders where decisions are made to transfer the whole farm to somebody else, whether or not he or she is capable of running the farm, in order to qualify for State pensions.</P>
    <P>There are cases where elderly persons decide to sign over their houses and whatever small amount of property they may have to their family and then apply to the State for a pension.  The Department <Col N="1775" /> have to take a very serious view of these decisions and are considered to be severe in their judgment.  I am making the point that one comes in for great criticism from some people for not giving that person a State pension and, on the other hand, one is accused of giving State pensions to people who do this.  It is something of which I and the Department are acutely aware.</P>
    <P>On the question of pensions generally, as Senators will be aware, a National Pensions Board was established recently because the Government recognised the anomalies and complications of the whole pension area.  This board will be an extremely useful adjunct to our Department and to the Government in looking at the whole range of pensions from whatever source they are funded, to see how we can make sure that citizens are well protected in their old age and that the State is not faced with an impossible burden, not having received contributions from taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The net point I want to make, in case there is any misunderstanding, is that there will be an overall decrease in the PRSI contributions payable by people with yearly earnings of £14,700 because the increase in the ceiling for health contributions and the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy together amount to a decrease of £1.68 per week in the maximum PRSI contributions, so in April they will not find themselves having to pay more.  People on an income of £10,000 will have a more dramatic decrease in their contributions and, at the same time, the workers will be getting a return from the income tax concessions announced in the budget which, taken together with the decrease in their PRSI contributions, will mean that they will have considerably more disposable income in their pockets at a time when inflation is at an all time low, certainly by modern standards.  Senators should not be too concerned about this section which might seem on first sight to penalise people but, in fact, does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's final <Col N="1776" /> point, at the end of March and beginning of April people above the limit will see their PRSI contribution going up because they will have paid none for the last couple of months of the year when they were in excess of the limit.  They will see a decrease in their take home pay at a time when they are being told that they are better off.  A sensible Government should find some way of changing that because it eliminates any credit they will get from reductions in the taxation burden.  In March people have a certain take home pay and in April, when they are told they will be better off, they discover that their take home pay is gone down, which demolishes forever any goodwill the Government might hope to get from changes in the income tax code. It is not one that will burden me too much, but I wish we could stop saying it is the burden of health, social welfare and education that creates the gap between income and expenditure for Government purposes because it is the total level of Government expenditure which exceeds taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as valid to say that it is the servicing of the national debt which creates the gap between income and revenue for the Government and it is just as valid to say we cannot afford to pay that if international interest rates go up as it is to say we cannot afford to pay higher levels of benefit because of the state of the public finances.  Our overall level of national taxation as a percentage of GNP, given the enormous levels of dependency we have in this country, is not particularly high.  Our problem is that we have a massive debt and it is not fair to say that the problem of our expenditure level is caused by social welfare, education and so on.  It is the total level of public expenditure, a large proportion of which is debt service.  Debt service is causing the problem, not social welfare and we will never refuse to pay an increase in debt service, irrespective of what happens to the currency or interest rates.  We can say that we cannot afford to pay anything else, for instance teachers' pay or social welfare payments, but we will always agree that we have money <Col N="1777" /> to pay our national debt.  That is why it is rubbish to say there is no more money in the kitty.  If we need more money to pay our national debt we will find it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section makes provision for the PRSI exemption scheme which was announced some time ago by the Taoiseach.  That is important because of the huge amount of unemployment benefit that forms part of the total £2.5 billion for social welfare.  Unemployment is obviously important and anything that would help to create a greater incentive for people in the private sector to take on permanent staff should be welcomed. I have been saying this for some time and I was naturally pleased with the Taoiseach's announcement last October.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, under this scheme people in the private sector who took on additional staff on a full time basis from October last until 31 March this year will be exempt from their portion of PRSI contribution for those employees in each week of the income tax period 1986-87 in which the increase in the workforce is maintained.  In view of the fact that this scheme will cease next week, can the Minister tell me if it was a fruitful exercise and, if so, would the Government consider its continuance?  If it was fruitful I am sure we would all advocate its continuance as every possible encouragement should be given to employers to take on extra permanent staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Fallon in welcoming this provision and I would also like to ask the question he asked, which was foremost in my mind as we approached this scheme.  When an employer loses a part time employee &mdash; an employee who works for half of every day &mdash; and the employer replaces that employee by a full time employee, is the full time employee deemed to come within the ambit of this section?  Does the employer benefit from the operation of this section by virtue of the fact that a part time employee has been replaced by a full time employee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is a bending to the Right in employers' minds because it has been used over a number of years when most of us were involved as public <Col N="1779" /> representatives in trying to coax people to take on employees and talk to them about their national responsibility to do so.  Employers had got into the habit of complaining about too much paper work and they did not want to get involved in PRSI and PAYE regulations.  I was completely taken aback when we announced the social employment scheme which could be used by community-based organisations, religious, schools and others who were being paid by the State to take on people on a short time basis.  The number of people clamouring to sign on, whom we accuse at times of having no incentive to go to work, was so extraordinary that it confounded all the experts' views on the attitude of those who were unemployed.</P>
      <P>I have been a public representative for a long number of years, longer than I care to put on the record of this House, and I have never come across an unemployed person who did not want to work. I have come across people who were sick and unable to work and who had to go on bended knees to prove their inability to work, but I have never seen people who did not want to work because of the pay-related benefits or otherwise.  People are happier when they are working.  I have known people who applied under the social employment scheme in the knowledge that they would actually lose some money every week.  But they are happy to be out working with their fellow man on the street through social employment schemes, through county council schemes and otherwise.</P>
      <P>I know some employers who said that the PRSI system was a disincentive to them to take on people.  Because they felt there was some substance in that, this Government decided that they would give exemptions under this heading.  It will be interesting to see at the end of the month whether or not it was a disincentive to employ people.  I sincerely hope that it has been of some benefit.  We handed State money directly to employers to take people off long term unemployment. They used that money almost as a total payment for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> I know of people who were employed under the youth employment schemes and who were not paid one penny extra by employers during the six months they had accepted State funds.  When the six months were up they let them go and brought in others.  That is a manipulation of State assistance to stimulate employment. I would like to know whether this scheme has been successful to date.  If so, we should consider whether in fact this whole area is a disincentive to employers. We should be extremely careful that we do not go down the same road as Mrs. Thatcher when she abolished the principle of PRSI.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that what is fundamentally a good scheme has now turned out to be unpopular with employers.  This scheme was set up not for employers but in the interest of employees.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that if full time employees who are brought in under this scheme become unemployed or sick, they will be beneficiaries under the whole principle of the scheme.  Are there sufficient funds within the PRSI system to ensure that all these new employees will also be protected in the event of unemployment or sickness?  As the redundancy contributions are also excluded by this exemption can the Minister confirm that, if people who are employed in this period become redundant, they will be protected by the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I took part in this debate.  Having squabbled over the years on so many occasions with Senator Ferris it is nice to find myself and himself agreeing about so many things for a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was always wrong about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to believe that.  There is a coven, and I choose this word carefully, of economists somewhere in this country with a hit list of various areas which they have identified as disincentives to employment.  One after another they are paraded out and a superficially plausible case is put forward for <Col N="1781" /> abolition, reduction, minimisation, introduction of means test or whatever they regard as the appropriate response.  So far where their recipe has been tried out it has failed gloriously.  Most of these things have been tried out across the water and they have not created employment. In fact, they have done the direct opposite.  They have created unemployment throughout the public service without any consequent generation of employment in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the distinction between public and private sectors in this country is a load of nonsense.  The private sector gets far more money from the State in subsidies, grants, training assistance and various other schemes than the public sector.  If we add in the deferred and unpaid tax or exemptions from taxation they probably get three quarters of what would normally be the revenue of the State.  Irish employers pay virtually the lowest level of social contributions in the OECD and definitely the lowest in the European Community.  If I am wrong the Minister can correct me.  Perhaps employers in Greece pay less.  I know that employers in Spain, which has just recently passed us out in <i>per capita</i> GNP, actually pay substantially more in social contributions per hour than our employers do.</P>
      <P>Again we have let the economists stampede us.  The problem is probably not so much the level of payment of social insurance but the amount of paper work associated with it.  You could keep the level of social insurance if you could simplify the administrative side of it.  The real problem for employers is that they are the most cost beneficial part of the taxation gathering system.  They pay the cost of gathering much of these taxes which, if it had to be paid by the State, would make many of these taxes non beneficial to the State because the cost would be enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with reducing employers' social insurance contributions.  I do not believe that in the longer term it <Col N="1782" /> would generate any sustainable employment. We would be as well off to maintain and, indeed, increase to a reasonable level employers' social insurance contributions and simplify the procedures by which paper work has to be done and by which payments have to be made.  We have some evidence of what is happening. In 1985 the top 40 companies on the Irish Stock Exchange increased their profits by 65 per cent over the previous year.  At the same time unemployment went up and employment went down.  Increased profitability does not necessarily mean increased employment.  We are now looking for some method of increasing further the profitability of many Irish employers.  So far they have proved themselves singularly unwilling to increase employment when profitability goes up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their welcome generally for the efforts being made to increase employment and to test out ways of seeing how one can encourage people to take on more employees.  The scheme as announced last October by the Taoiseach had certain provisions and regulations. In the three months up to the time we announced changes about 300 employees were taken on.  It was decided at that stage to make changes in the scheme in order to remove some of the problems which were stopping the scheme from being taken up.  For example, one of the excluding factors was that employers who received some form of assistance or grants in the previous years were excluded.  That is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a stipulation that the new employee had to be on the live register for a full six months.  That has been reduced to 13 weeks.  Since the changes were announced recently and since more publicity was given to the scheme &mdash; we have not got the final figures yet &mdash; we have seen a considerable upsurge in the take-up of the scheme to around 1,000. To people who ask if the scheme will be extended, the only answer would be that I do not think the Government would have any reason to oppose an extension, <Col N="1783" /> but we would have to see if it had evoked the kind of response we wanted in order to have it extended further.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure Senator Ferris that people coming under this scheme are covered, the same as any other employee, for insurance, redundancy and all other benefits.  There is no problem there.  Senator Durcan raised the question of part time or full time employees. The scheme as designed at the moment applies only to a new full time employee. It does not envisage somebody working part time going full time.  I do not feel it is something that could not be changed if the scheme was being renewed and extended.  That is the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned that employers' contributions in Ireland are low compared with other countries; that is correct.  At 11.3 per cent it is the third lowest in the EC but our taxation rates are among the highest in the EC.  One advantage of the relatively low PRSI contributions is that it is a help in establishing our competitiveness for selling abroad. Anything which assists that must be welcomed. As Senator Ferris said, it is a matter for discussion and investigation to see if the level of PRSI is a disincentive to employers.  This scheme will be very valuable in establishing whether that is the case.  I hope the take-up of the scheme &mdash; we are hoping the take-up will be 1,000 with the recent changes &mdash; will show we are making progress in this area because it is one of many different ways the Government have devised over recent years to get people to work.  At every possible opportunity we must bend our minds to ensure we get as many people as possible into permanent employment in the commercial, manufacturing and exporting sectors.</P>

      <P>I do not like to follow the Minister down some of the avenues she travels, but she did mention competitiveness and prices.  It is one of the simplicities that the coven of economists have foisted on us, that you can equate competitiveness and international markets with price.  That is all very well if you are selling buttons, because they are an easily transported and sellable commodity, but all you ever get out of selling buttons is buttons.  If you are selling high technology goods in a high technology market, which is what this country should be doing, competitiveness is as much related to other non-measureable and non-financial matters as it is to price.  To get involved in arguments about the level of employers' PRSI as an index of competitiveness, which therefore generates sales on international markets, is grossly to over-simplify the industrial strategy this country should have.  Other countries have tried that strategy and ended up bankrupt.  I do not think we should go down that route.  It is possible to have a high wage, high salary economy which booms on international markets; many other countries have done it.  Prices and competitiveness do not equate and should equate less and less.  There is a long OECD report which states precisely that.</P>

The Minister indicated yesterday that approximately 75,000 disability claimants were called for medical examination and about 6,000 did not attend for examination.  I would like more information on the figure of 6,000, if it is available.  Obviously within that 6,000 there would be some with very genuine reasons why they could not attend.  It would be unfair to proceed with increasing the period from six weeks to nine weeks if people are genuinely ill and cannot attend.  If the reasons given are not good enough, then I think we should leave it as it is.  I believe there are many genuine cases in the 6,000 cases mentioned by the Minister and I do not <Col N="1787" /> think it is fair to penalise everybody because of a few &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; in that group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am trying to understand this.  If a person is called for a medical examination and fails to turn up without a legitimate reason he should not be paid but should be afforded an opportunity to be able to sign on for unemployment.  That is the next stage if, on a doctor's certificate, he has been ill and unable to work.  The Department communicate with the doctor and inform him that the person he has been certifying for some time is to be called for a medical examination and he is asked for his comments. I would like to know from the Minister if the GP at that stage advises his patient that he is to be checked, that he cannot stand over giving certificates and recommends that there is no point in going for a medical examination as in his opinion he is fit for work.  This is probably one of the reasons why people do not turn up for medical examinations.</P>
      <P>I am worried about penalising people, of which there are many, who are dependent upon the opinions of medical practitioners. If they are not on doctors' certificates, they could be on unemployment certificates.  If it is either one or the other, we should not penalise them.  I made a strong appeal yesterday for people who are genuinely ill and who are suffering the problem of trying medically to prove their illness.  We have been successful in endeavouring to do this with the help of the Ombudsman.  There have been anomalies in the interpretation of the medical inspector's views.  Here, we are trying to penalise people who do not turn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister from her records would know, when a person is called for a medical inspection, is their GP also notified and asked for his views?  If that is the case, is it because the GP has given a view to the beneficiary that he should not turn up because there would be egg on somebody's face?  If so, is six weeks not long enough in penalising such people?  I <Col N="1788" /> presume that during that six week penalty period they are without any income whatsoever and are unable to sign on as being eligible for unemployment.  I do not mind them using the normal couple of days for which they are not paid but to penalise somebody with no income whatsoever for nine weeks means that we are creating another demand on the supplementary welfare discretionary system where you have people with no income unable to sign on as they have been disqualified under this section and who have to have recourse to somebody to buy bread and butter for their children.</P>
    <P>I hold absolutely no brief for those who defraud the system.  I want to make sure that regulations embodied in Social Welfare Bills do not exploit situations or penalise people unduly as we are dealing with those on the bottom end of the social welfare spectrum.  They are in real need. I wish we would use the same liberalisation as was used on the ceiling income for those who are contributing.  We should show the same care and compassion as nine weeks is too strict except where there is a real, genuine reason.  The Minister and her advisers who considered this probably had some information available that we do not have.  I hope that by asking these questions the Minister will realise that we only want to come to grips with the situation and find out what are the reasons for this extension.  Is there a similar disqualification for those on unemployment who have been found working and who are penalised for a lesser number of weeks because of that?</P>
    <P>Having mentioned that, could I say that the people who should be penalised in that situation should be the employers who also exploit the system in employing people whom they know are signing on. They allow them time off to sign.  It is the employer in that situation who should be penalised and not the unfortunate person who is caught in the black economy trap. It is on the employers' information that we could stop the payment of social welfare but they will deny it because they have exploited the labourers.  The employers will deny that they ever employed them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> We are left with asking people to sign on every morning at 10.30 a.m. just because they have a reputation of signing on and working.  I know of somebody who had to sign on every morning, each day of his life, even on the day when his father died, simply because he was suspected of working for somebody.  That employer would have the discretion to say that that person was working and that would be the end of it.  I am worried about the penalty of nine weeks when there might be a genuine reason.  Is it a fact that GPs are consulted in advance of the medical referee's visit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ferris.  We do not exist entirely in a vacuum.  There was a very detailed study on the whole area of disability benefit conducted by Gerry Hughes for the Economic and Social Research Council. His conclusion, unequivocally, was that there was no evidence of serious abuse in that area.</P>
      <P>There is also a myth circulating around this country that we have a high level of absenteeism.  A recent issue of the journal of the Irish Management Institute&mdash;I emphasise the source; I cannot give a precise quote&mdash;had a long article on the basis of a study commissioned by the IMI on absenteeism which scotched virtually everyone of the famous Irish myths and particularly the official level of between 8 and 13 per cent as being so undefined and unquantifiable as to be utterly pointless as some employers incorporated maternity leave as absenteeism in terms of statistics.  That was his identification, not mine, as one of the major anomalies in the definition of absenteeism.  A second one is that it goes up towards the end of the tax year.  There is no evidence according to this independent survey for the Irish Management Institute that this happens at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry Hughes's recent figure is that about 25 per cent of claimants for disability benefit are called to a second opinion by the Department of Social Welfare. That is a huge figure and means that one in four people are called for a second opinion.  Crudely, from memory, about <Col N="1790" /> 25 per cent of those people are found to be fit to work.  That does not mean for one second that they were all consciously defrauding the system.  There is the possibility of people being better and doctors differing.  I suspect from what Senator Ferris mentioned, and I have evidence from people who were told by their doctors that if they go back to work, even though the Department of Social Welfare say they are to go back, that they will accept no responsibility for their health because in their view they are not fit to go back to work.  That is a serious matter and one for which there should be some solution.</P>
    <P>If the Department are doing that kind of thing, getting a second opinion on 25 per cent of disability benefits, they must by now have some information on the names of doctors who are writing certificates on the scale which some people are suggesting is being done.  I know of one doctor in Cork of whom it is alleged that if you send your little brother up saying you have a pain in your back a certificate is handed out by his secretary.  I do not know if that is true but I think that if the Department of Social Welfare are actually calling for second opinions on 25 per cent of recipients for disability benefit in any given year they must by now know the names of the doctors who are signing and there must be evidence of disproportionately high certification in the big cities and towns.  If the Department have that information, it should be passed on to the medical council with a request that appropriate action should be taken against doctors if they are abusing the certification scheme.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that doctors get paid for signing these certificates.  Therefore the doctors who abuse the system are the ones who make most out of the Department of Social Welfare.  It is regrettable that until we have genuinely objective evidence, as distinct from mass hysteria and my coven of economists targeting another area of alleged abuse, we are now further penalising people.  As Senator Ferris suggested, this will leave some people nine weeks without <Col N="1791" /> incomes.  That is an unjustified imposition because it imposes absolute poverty, and if the alternative is supplementary welfare I would not wish it and the process of applying for it on anybody, not even the members of the Government&mdash;it would be unfair even to them.  Nobody deserves to go through the process of applying for supplementary welfare because it is humiliating in the extreme; it is often run by people who deliberately humiliate people and often deliberately go out of their way to demean people applying for supplementary benefit.</P>
    <P>I have often written to the ESRI suggesting that they seek substantial Government funding to do a detailed study of the whole area of social welfare abuse.  As an independent social research body they should be given funds to enable them to carry out investigations that would help them to identify where there is abuse in the system.  Figures based on mythology should be dismissed.  As I have said, 25 per cent of disability beneficiaries are called for second medical opinions. Crudely putting it, 25 per cent of them are found to be fit for work.  That is 25 per cent of 25 per cent, actually 6.25 per cent.  Of those 6.25 per cent, we could argue forever as to whether some of them were victims of differences of opinion and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no hard evidence to suggest that there is widespread abuse of the disability scheme.  If somebody is concerned that there is large-scale abuse, let us for God sake get hard evidence to prove it or disprove it and get away from this constant harassment of people who live on very small incomes, without people like us, in well off positions, adding to their humiliations and their burdens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability and injury benefits, as Senators have said, are a most sensitive area.  Senators are aware that deciding fitness and disability for work can never be in any country in the world an exact science when one is administering a social welfare system.  This is one of the difficulties with Senator Ryan's <Col N="1792" /> suggestion about ESRI going in to try to establish definitively whether there is or not abuse of the social welfare code, how much there is and how it should be stopped.  As Minister, I am the one in the firing line because on the one hand I am being very hard on people who are trying to claim benefits and on the other I am accused of wasting taxpayers' money because abuse is rampant.  One would have to consider Senator Ryan's suggestion carefully because in another breath Senator Ryan and other Senators say that the thing is simply not an exact science.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare must look constantly at these systems and adapt them or change them and make small adjustments here and there as various things emerge which give us cause for alarm.  No matter how you look at it, 6,000 people failing to attend for examinations and failing to give any good reasons, represent large numbers of people and a huge amount of time on the part of the medical referees who have called people for examination.  Those 6,000 people who were disqualified did not have good reasons.  The Department's system will accept good reasons for inability to attend medical examinations. In those circumstances the Government considered that the penalty for nonattendance should be increased, particularly because the number was so high.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question by Senator Ferris, I understand the GPs are informed when persons are called for examination. I do not know whether the GPs then tell their patients not to bother to turn up for the examinations because they would not be passed &mdash; I have no way of knowing that.  If some of the 6,000 came into that category they will hardly give it to the Department as a reason for nonattendance. Senators should know that people are not left without any means at all for the nine weeks.  People who have a good reason for not coming for examination will not be put off disability benefit.  I emphasise that very strongly, and the supplementary welfare system is open to people who have special difficulties and cannot make ends meet.  As well, they can get themselves on to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> Senator Ryan spoke of doctors who might or might not be furnishing medical certificates which turn out to be contested by medical referees.  Obviously, the Department watch that system carefully and if they find cases where this is indulged in wrongly we can write to the Medical Council, and we do not have to continue such doctors on our list.  That area is carefully monitored.  We do not have to continue with a doctor whom we regard as a person not following normal procedures.  So there is a mechanism in the Department to see that people who have genuine reasons for not attending for medical examinations will not be crossed off.  I repeat that, because the high figure of 6,000 people not turning up for examinations without valid reasons justified the Department in increasing the disqualification period from six to nine weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to possible abuses by doctors, has the Minister any information about the numbers of doctors whom the Department have felt obliged to report to the Medical Council or the number of doctors whom they have taken off their lists of approved certifiers? It would be interesting to know how many, if any, have been subject to the wrath of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her response to the questions.  The Minister has confirmed that GPs who are certifying patients as being incapable of work are contacted by the Department before claimants are subjected to investigation. Can the Minister confirm that, when a general practitioner is notified that his patient is being subjected to examination, in the interim that general practitioner is required to submit some kind of report to the Department?  Can the Minister say, when a general practitioner receives that kind of notification, whether he responds?  For example, is he expected to notify the appeals doctor, confirming that his patient is still ill? What I am endeavouring to ascertain is whether, in relation to those 6,000 applicants, <Col N="1794" /> there was confirmation from the relevant doctors that they understood the position, because the Minister has said there was no valid excuse advanced by those 6,000 people.  I should like to know whether there have been any excuses advanced by their doctors.</P>
      <P>It appears abundantly clear that proper facilities are not available to Department inspectors to enable them carry out a proper assessment of an applicant's ability or inability to work.  I posed that question yesterday but, in replying, the Minister did not respond.  My hope would be that there could be greater use made of laboratory, X-ray and out-patient facilities in hospitals so that applicants would be subjected to a proper examination rather than a Department inspector sitting across the table maintaining that in his opinion the applicant was fit to work.  The applicant may contend that he has a bad heart, cancer or whatever, while the inspector will contend that in his opinion that person is fit to work. The inspector probably will say to the applicant, &ldquo;I will be communicating with your doctor and the Department within a certain number of days.&rdquo;  The very most such an inspector might do is check on one's blood pressure; he will not take any blood samples, or look at X-rays even when the applicant produces them at the point of examination.  There have been substantiated complaints by applicants that, in spite of producing X-rays or medical evidence at such examinations, the inspector will say he is not interested.  I have obtained X-rays from hospitals on behalf of constituents in order to help them in their applications.  Ultimately one has to resort to the Ombudsman to sort out these types of problems, the proper medical evidence confirming that the applicant is unable to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want a system that shows some sympathy and compassion let us use to the fullest the facilities available to us in the areas that most affect people.  In some areas there may be district hospitals. Other areas may be fortunate in having proper health clinics.  In the town of Tipperary there is a health clinic nobody could attend because it affords no privacy <Col N="1795" /> whatsoever.  Indeed, the social welfare procedures carried on in that building can only be described as inhuman.  It should be remembered that social welfare officers carry out a public investigation there and there are no facilities for any privacy whatsoever.  I have asked the Minister to make capital sums available for the building of a proper health clinic in Tipperary town to replace the old workhouse building which is ready to fall down.  In this delicate area of establishing people's state of health and their capability to work or otherwise, we should use the other medical facilities available, even if they are located in the out-patients' department of the local hospital. That would appear to be the appropriate location especially if an applicant has a record in that hospital, so that inspectors could resort to consultants at that hospital to establish the real state of a person's health.</P>
    <P>None of us is defending people capable of work or suggesting that they be paid because some general practitioner contends they are not capable of working. Nobody is suggesting that for a moment. We are endeavouring to ensure that the relevant regulations are not interpreted by officers without regard to the full medical evidence available.  I know that has been the practice and the Ombudsman has so proven.  The Department should ascertain how their image can be improved in this respect.  It can be said that applicants for various benefits are now petrified.  Indeed, perhaps that is why those 6,000 people did not turn up; perhaps they did not want to be humiliated. Perhaps it is easier not to turn up than be humiliated in endeavouring to prove that one is not well.  The Department should endeavour to have the regulations implemented with a degree of humanity.</P>
    <P>The Minister will see from my various interventions that this is a matter about which I am most concerned.  I have had the experience of seeing so many applicants in trouble.  I have no complaint at all with the section of the Department <Col N="1796" /> dealing with queries lodged by public representatives. Rather I am concerned about what happens on the ground in, say, Tipperary town, Chair, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel or anywhere else.  I would not worry about the odd applicant not turning up for examination. The inspector will be there examining people over a couple of days.  But one has the impression that sometimes inspectors say, &ldquo;We will disqualify everybody today and those who feel sufficiently strongly will appeal and will be readmitted for eligibility&rdquo;.  If the regulations are to be interpreted in that way then that will lead to a clogging up of the machinery of State because all of us would be involved in representations.</P>
    <P>In her remarks yesterday the Minister almost admitted that the Department experienced difficulties with public representatives making representations on behalf of applicants.  The reason for that is that applicants experience tremendous difficulty in establishing eligibility.  Those problems are not created by us but by people in the system.  There is enough ill spoken of public representatives.  It should be remembered that, in this respect, unfortunate people have nobody else to whom they can resort.  Yet, finally, we have to turn to the Ombudsman. What sort of a monster are we creating in the administration of a scheme intended to help people at the lower end of the scale, people who are unfortunate enough to have no work or are unable to work because, otherwise, they would not be seeking assistance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should remember that we are spending £2½ billion on social welfare, that is £7 million a day, a figure which is at an all-time high and has increased enormously over the past ten years.  Many of those huge increases were occasioned by the increase in the volume of unemployment.  These schemes were expanded enormously to include many more people and their provisions have been improved substantially and as I said earlier, improved over and above the cost of living increases.  There is an enormous <Col N="1797" /> amount of money being spent on the system.</P>
      <P>Much of the discussion on this section would give the impression that, for the £2½ billion, we have an appalling system. I am sure Senators do not intend to give that impression.  I have a great respect for the people who administer the system, who work in an area which, of its very nature, is difficult, establishing people's entitlements, people who are not at all well off.  That is not an easy job. As Senators have rightly pointed out, it is an area continuously under the microscope, subjected to public scrutiny. When we talk about a figure of 6,000 people not turning up let us remember, as I said in the Dáil, that in 1985 over 75,000 disability benefit claimants were called for medical examination.  If you take away the 6,000 people who did not attend and were disqualified for not attending and having no reason, that is 69,000 people who attended.  We should keep that figure in our minds.  It seems that those 69,000 people did not feel as badly about coming as we might deduce from some of the concerns expressed here today.  I understand these concerns very well.  They show an admirable worry about ordinary people trying to get their entitlements.</P>
      <P>Regarding the number of doctors whom we have referred to the Medical Council or whom we have removed from our list, I am afraid I have not got that figure to hand but I will endeavour to find it out for the Senator.  I am told that it is quite rare that we either refer doctors to the Medical Council or remove them from our list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the general practitioner is informed that a person is being called for medical examination he is not asked for his views but, of course, his views may be given to us.  It is open to him to give us his views or his observations, but he is not asked to do so.  There might be some misunderstanding about the powers or abilities of the medical referees to refer people to other sources.  For example, where a medical referee himself has doubts or does not feel that he wishes to <Col N="1798" /> make a pronouncement on the person's condition, he would refer a person to a specialist if he felt he needed to, and it is open to him to do so.  The client can also submit a specialist report.  The deciding officer is the person who decides whether the person will receive disability benefit, and the deciding officer will receive the report from the medical referee.  However, where it is felt that a medical referee or any officer of the Department &mdash; in this case we are talking about medical referees &mdash; has refused to take any medical evidence offered to him, and this is the kind of case Senator Ferris mentioned, we would need to know about that instance because it would be very important to us that people would not feel that they were not getting medical attention or medical examination of any kind.  I ask Senators, particularly Senator Ferris in this case, to let us know the details of where that happens.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of facilities for people coming for medical examination. I accept fully that even within this vast amount of money that is being spent on these services there are inadequate facilities in many places for these examinations. The question of improving facilities is something that we are trying constantly to keep up with, for example employment exchanges, in terms of refurbishing them and building new ones.  The inadequate facilities are very off putting and difficult for people to deal with.  We should look at them constantly with a view to trying to improve them.  I assure Senators that this is a matter of some concern to me.</P>
    <P>I accept very much the concern expressed by Senators on this section of the Bill. I have listened with considerable interest to the opinions of Senators.  As I said last night, I am extremely impressed by the expertise and concern of people in this House about this area, which are very valuable and helpful to me in my work of trying to improve the social welfare system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very long section containing a great deal of technical jargon.  What effectively it means is that under the section, as we read from the explanatory memorandum, &ldquo;a woman's maternity allowance will be calculated as 70 per cent of her earnings in the relevant income tax year or 70 per cent of a specified weekly amount rather than a combination of flat rate, pay-related and additional pay-related benefit as at present.&rdquo;  The maternity allowance scheme should be straightforward enough to the claimant of maternity benefit.  I am mindful that the Ombudsman's report for 1985 recorded that 14 complaints were made in this area.  Having made those points, let me ask the Minister to comment on what I would regard as being the bottom line.  Is the benefit altered in any way as a result of these technical adjustments?</P>

      <P>I take the Senator's point that they might seem to be unrealistic. However, the fines are increased year by year or over periods in keeping with the level at which the fines started off with. This is an increase to keep these fines in line with fines in other sections of the system.</P>

      <P>Having argued on the other side of the fence on humanitarian matters for so long, I have no problem at all with these levels of fines.  If they are a disincentive to people to abuse what we would like to be a good scheme then I have no problem with my conscience. The Ombudsman has mentioned in his report that the Department are very liberal about approaching problems of even overpayments and have on the intervention of the Ombudsman overlooked overpayments because they felt they would create problems.  I have found in working with the Department that, where genuine errors of overpayment occurred, they were very liberal in trying to ensure that people were given an opportunity to repay.  When social welfare payments stopped and the person had no other income from the State the Department were prepared to defer payments. My experience with the Department in this area has been good. They have been liberal in their approach to the problem.  I presume these fines are there as a disincentive to people fiddling the system.</P>

      <P>That would be my reading of it.  If there is a stiff penalty for people who deliberately go out of their way to play the system for their own benefit, it is a disincentive.  I admit that collecting it is another matter.  With the exception of the woman who has 86 children &mdash; she is obviously doing very well and she might be able to meet a fine like this &mdash; to collect such a fine, generally speaking, would pose a problem.  A fine is there as a disincentive.  Having argued for a humanitarian scheme I am also saying that we should ensure that there are sufficient penalties so that people do not abuse it.  I want to be consistent in what I have said on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that a lot of the fines that are stuck into legislation are there to satisfy public opinion as much as anything else?  Public opinion gets itself worked into a frenzy about social welfare abuse and one appropriate response is to up the levels of theoretical fines that people could be fined for offences.</P>
      <P>I very much doubt that people who are fiddling the social welfare system have a clue what the penalties are.  I doubt very much that they know whether the fine is £50, £100, £500 or £50,000.  I doubt that if they did know that they would care.  I have long argued that there is nonsense associated with deterrents.  The deterrent that deters people is the possibility of being caught and not the scale of any penalty.  It is also a fact that close to one-sixth of our prison population are there because of non-payment of fines and are costing the State sums of money vastly in excess of the fines they did not pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I tease this out a little further?  The child allowance, as we know it at the moment, is paid to everybody irrespective of income.  It is paid to either the spouse or the husband, whichever is decided.  The child benefit, as we understand it, will be a direct payment to the mother.  The income earner in the family will lose the £100 tax free allowance which, in some way, will balance it. Having looked at it, and worked out the computations, I note that most people will be beneficiaries, particularly those in the lower income bracket who will not suffer too much from the loss of the £100 child allowance.  That should have been higher because of the difficulty of rearing a family.  I understand that the payment under the child benefit scheme of approximately £30 per month for each child, will be treated as an income for tax purposes by everybody and will be taken into account in their reckonable earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are discussing is an interim scheme under which we are paying an <Col N="1803" /> increased amount of money to everybody and removing the tax allowances for children from those who are in the tax brackets.  In that way, we are moving towards what I would like, a proper child benefit scheme paid directly to the mother but taken into account as a reckonable income for those who are paying tax.  In that case those who are not paying tax will be net beneficiaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent that I understand what they intend to do, I fully support the Government's proposal in <i>Building on Reality</i> for a child benefit scheme.  It is one of the great anomalies of our social welfare system that people like myself and the Minister, to make two extreme comparisons, should get children's allowances indiscriminately and irrespective of income.  It is wrong and I am glad the Government are moving in this direction.  The benefit for the first five children of £15.05 a month represents a 25 per cent increase or about £3.  I understand that the value of that is about £36 a year.  The loss to a person paying the standard rate of income tax from the abolition of the £100 allowance is £35 a year.  The net benefit to a person paying standard rate income tax of this change is £1 per year per child.  I do not regard that as an enormous sign of social progress. I support everything else about it except that at the level of standard rate of income tax, and given the fact that far too many people pay tax above the standard rate because of the injustices and unfairness of the Irish taxation system &mdash; not I emphasise because of the levels of taxation here but because of the uneven way the whole burden is carried &mdash; this benefit will not achieve the admirable objective it should, that is, to put a substantial income directly at the disposal of mothers.  It is really an accountancy exercise until it is either substantially increased or the levels at which people pay both the standard rate and higher rate of taxation are adjusted.  A pound per year is not much of a sign of social progress.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise, at the outset, as Senator Ferris has rightly identified, that this is the interim scheme on the way to the implementation of the full child benefit scheme which will have a very significant redistributive effect towards those on lower incomes. Under this interim scheme three-quarters of all families in the State will be at least as well off.  They will not suffer any change.  Some of them will, in fact, be better off.  Perhaps, I should give some figures in that respect.  For example, in terms of numbers of families, 42,300 families at the 58 per cent marginal rate of tax will lose very slightly&mdash;£1.83.  The next group at 48 per cent marginal rate of tax, 62,600 families, will lose £1.  The group at 35 per cent marginal relief, 188,500 families, as Senator Ryan rightly identified, because of the removal of the child tax allowance will, in fact, be almost unchanged.</P>
      <P>The next group are the 158,600 families on social welfare.  All these categories will gain per child per month.  For example, widows on contributory pensions will gain about 72p per child per month and people on disability and unemployment will gain £1.26 per child per month. People with very low earnings or entirely outside the tax net would gain about £3 per child per month.  This is an interim stage on the way to introducing the full child benefit scheme.  To avoid the interim benefit scheme being detrimental to people, we have had to inject a net £11.1 million from the Exchequer into the system.  We have not increased the child dependant allowance for social welfare recipients because there will be an automatic increase through this new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child benefit scheme that we are introducing as from next Tuesday is the first step in the direction of achieving the redistribution of resources which Senators rightly identify as being called for for a considerable length of time.  I would fully agree with the Senator that it always seemed an anomaly that people on relatively high incomes for this country were in receipt of exactly the same non-taxable <Col N="1805" /> benefit as families who were very much worse off.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is a very significant step in the whole child support system of this State.  It has been an important move forward.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is paying the penalty of being very helpful; that is why I am hopping up and down so often. As Senator Ferris quite rightly said, she is being very forthcoming and therefore it is very tempting to ask many more questions.  If she said no more often, I might ask far fewer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there implied in section 18 some capacity by central Government to <Col N="1806" /> impose a ceiling on expenditure and supplementary welfare in each health board? In other words, is the actual budget beyond which one cannot pass now going to be allocated for a year, irrespective of need?  That, in my view, would undermine the whole objective of the supplementary welfare system.  If people are operating within rigid annual budgets we are going to have serious problems, particularly towards the end of each financial year.  Supplementary welfare of its nature, while it is discretionary and therefore caution has to be exercised by the officers and on the other hand because it is discretionary and meant to be related to need, has to be open-ended.  If it is not open-ended, it will cease to be able to do what it is intended to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pass a few comments on this.  Most of us as members of local authorities this year welcome the fact that for the first time in our Estimates this provision was removed.  I was rather disappointed to see on the other side of the scale that our rate support grant was reduced accordingly, so we were not really beneficiaries.  When the health boards were set up and some powers were transferred direct from the councils to the health boards, on the basis or representation it was appropriate that councils would have made a contribution to health boards.  It also gave an opportunity to make representations direct to the supplementary welfare officer.  It was right for various reasons to be able to approach him at weekends.  The level of antagonism from supplementary welfare officers against people using public representatives to try to stimulate them into action is ever growing.  They have told the recipients that they should not be going to Senators, Deputies, or councillors about these matters, that there is no need, they would turn them down anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year it is appropriate that we tidy up the whole area.  If the State considers that this is its responsibility, it will have information immediately available through the Department that money was paid out under this heading.  In the case of people on supplementary benefit who <Col N="1807" /> are waiting for qualification for various schemes, their claims must be confirmed as correct and there is then a further delay in communicating with the supplementary welfare officer through the health boards to find out how much money was advanced under this heading. A person had to be without income for a week, otherwise the Department could not come through with the payment because supplementary welfare benefit was still in operation.  I welcome the fact that we are going to streamline the operation. I hope that a ceiling or limit is not by the Exchequer on the amount of money they will make available, and that there will not be any change in the interpretation of how this money should be distributed.  God knows, it is tight enough at the moment.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare officers carry on as if it were their own money they were giving out of their own pockets to people.  I know that collectively it is all our money, but these people hold on to it as if it were their own.  One has a feeling that the more they have in their pockets undistributed at the end of the week, the more payment they might get for being very excellent officers.  I hope that transferring the responsibility to the Exchequer, removing it from the health boards and the county councils, might assist in the streamlining.  I know that there is still an argument going on between councils and health boards about the amount of arrears due under this heading, but we will reach agreement &mdash; some of us are members of both authorities &mdash; that we might divide the spoils for four or five years and pay back over a period.  The Government will be pleased when this has been done.  This happened in the transfer of the responsibility of health care and charges for it to health boards and to the Government. Now, this is the final bastion of bureaucracy that we might hand back to the State. Obviously, it cannot be implemented on the ground as I would like to see it done. It is difficult to assess the demands being <Col N="1808" /> made on any local authority or how assessment is arrived at because it is globally done by the health board in consultation with the community care directors, community care officers and administrators. There is a fair bit of bureaucracy in this scheme and perhaps this proposal will help.  It will certainly avoid the delay that happens when both schemes come into play and both cannot operate together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ferris has said, this is purely an administrative measure which will tidy up the system and has generally been welcomed as something that should have been done some time ago.  It is really a financial problem being sorted out between the health boards and the central Exchequer. The central question for answer at this point is that, as in all other areas of social welfare provision, there can by its very nature be no ceiling on expenditure. Obviously, like every Government Department in every area, one has to set Estimates.  In the social welfare payment area, one pays whatever the rates are and there is no ceiling on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has direct responsibility for the funding of supplementary welfare and I support what Senator Ferris said about the way it is done.  People I know have written to the Department frequently about anomalies in regard to social welfare supplementary welfare, particularly the interpretation of the circular letter under which the Act is interpreted.  I should not have seen the circular letter since it is covered by the Official Secrets Act but, nevertheless, having seen the circular I am amazed at what supplementary welfare officers do, given the compassionate interpretation the Department put on the supplementary welfare legislation.  The circular letter is quite compassionate, flexible and intelligent but the people who implement it do so in the most extraordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one person in the North Eastern Health Board who decided that £15 a week was an adequate income for anybody to live on and would not grant <Col N="1809" /> the full supplementary welfare benefit rate.  I know in some places that rent allowances are paid freely and frequently and reasonably intelligently to ensure that people stay in accommodation but in other areas to get anything above £5 a week you get the impression you would need a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure Senator Ferris will confirm this.  The most appalling thing about supplementary welfare is the anomalous way it is operated by individual officers running the scheme.  If that could be straightened out, and if people could run it as it is intended to be run according to the Department's own circular letter, it would be an admirable scheme which would succeed in doing its own job very well.  The tragedy is that it is not done like that and it should be looked at and examined.  The people who run and operate it should be straightened out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of undoing the goodwill I seem to have got from Senator Ryan earlier by being ready to answer questions, I must point out that this section is really only a technicality. It provides that the cost of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should be borne by the Exchequer in the Social Welfare Vote.  I really could not go down the other avenues that have been raised there.</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer and perhaps the Minister can put my fears at rest.  When I read something like &ldquo;Where the Minister revokes regulations made under...the Principal Act and makes regulations which he certifies to be substantially to the like effect as the regulations so revoked&rdquo;...it seems that the <Col N="1810" /> Minister is becoming judge, jury and executioner. As long as he believes that they are substantially the same as those there before, he does not have to get anybody to approve it for him.  It appears that would leave a Minister, not the present Minister obviously, but a subsequent Minister in a position to do all sorts of strange things as long as he could certify that they were substantially the same or had substantially the same intent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, but I am getting my breath back gradually.  The section is entitled: &ldquo;Restriction of provisions requiring laying of draft regulations before Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  The section relates in particular to a number of sections of the consolidation Act.  It provides that regulations made under these sections may be amended in minor ways by the Minister without the necessity of laying a draft of the regulation before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a point of principle, I dislike this type of legislation.  I dislike legislation which allows Acts of the Oireachtas to be changed by regulation.  The Joint Committee on the EC have already <Col N="1811" /> expressed their view in relation to EC regulations in this regard and said that, where a major change is effected, it should always be incorporated in legislation. The sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Legislation which deals with statutory instruments have expressed considerable concern with regard to this matter also.  If one reads through and examines the 1981 Act and if one examines the sections which can be affected by section 22 of this Bill one's worry is increased particularly at section 12 of the 1981 Act which states that regulations may alter the rates of employment or voluntary contributions but where such regulations are proposed to be made a draft thereof should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until the resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>The important part as far as section 22 of this Bill is concerned is the part in section 12 which states that regulations may alter the rates of employment or voluntary contributions.  The mandarins of the Department of Social Welfare, those whom I complimented and thanked yesterday, are conferring upon their Minister the power to alter by regulation, without the necessity of placing that regulation before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the rates of employment or voluntary contributions.  I am very worried about that because it is the kind of legislation which cannot be supported and I ask the Minister to consider very carefully the operation of that section between now and Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean between now and Report Stage.  It is my breathlessness that is giving me difficulty in mentally comprehending the Stage we are at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other sections referred to in section 22 of the Bill deal with the making of regulations for the provision of modifications of contribution conditions for <Col N="1812" /> disability benefit, maternity allowances, unemployment benefit, old age contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widows' contributory pension, orphans' contributory pension, deserted wife's benefit and death grant respectively.  It is very improper that these rates can now be altered, not merely by regulation but by regulation which expressly does not have to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Why is this change necessary?  The 1981 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act is extremely complicated containing 313 sections and six schedules and of necessity has been amended at least once a year since then.  We are now suggesting that it should be possible to further amend that Act by regulations which do not even have to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I see this not merely as a major erosion of parliamentary democracy but as the creation of a situation which will make the social welfare code most difficult and complex and hard to comprehend.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter very seriously between now and Report Stage for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to Social Welfare Bills in the past, I ask the Minister to ensure that her Department or the Stationery Office will arrange for the production of the social welfare code in a composite form in the same way as the Income Tax Acts are produced.  It should be possible each year, with each amending legislation, with each order that must be placed before this House or, if this draconian and terrible section is accepted, with each order that does not have to be placed before this House, for somebody who is attempting to explore this legislation to find it all in one physical form which is easy to comprehend.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the system may occasionally become clogged up because of the amount of representations made by public representatives. Frequently the reason is that the code is very complex and difficult to comprehend. Far less representations would <Col N="1813" /> be made and greater clarity would exist if the suggestion which I made with regard to the production of a composite form of legislation were adhered to.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the general point I made in relation to this section.  I hope that the amendment which I have suggested is introduced and that we will see our colleagues in the lower House being summoned back to Dublin to agree with the change which I hope this House will find acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really alarmed now. I asked a question as a non-lawyer because the wording of this section disturbed me.  The Minister answered me and I did not pursue the matter because I did not think I was qualified or competent to do so.  Senator Durcan has now alarmed me entirely about this.  I do not know whether he is right, but I am sufficiently unhappy with the phrase &ldquo;which he certifies to be substantially to the like effect&rdquo; to ask for a detailed interpretation of that phrase.  What does that mean and how can such a procedure be policed?  For instance, will regulations which the Minister &ldquo;certifies to be substantially to the like effect&rdquo; be public documents? What will their legal status be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations, as I understand it, are either statutory or non-statutory.  If they are non-statutory are they covered, for instance, under the Official Secrets Act? Will we know what is in them, or will the Minister simply regulate them so that they are to the like effect?  I would not have understood the phrase to mean what Senator Durcan said.  I do not believe the Minister is in a position to change rates of benefit or substantially alter regulations. That may or may not be to the like effect. It bothers me that the Minister would have the right to certify what is to the like effect and that there would be no method of redress available to the Houses of the Oireachtas if the Minister is interpreted as going beyond what the section means.  It appears that somebody would have to go to the courts to have regulations of this form overturned.  One would <Col N="1814" /> have to challenge the Minister's certification that there were substantially to the like effect.  Perhaps the Minister would interpret to us in simple layman's language &mdash; and she and I are both laypersons in the area of law &mdash; what this section actually means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Durcan said.  We had a conference before the Seanad sat to consider the implications of this section.  It may be that there is a perfectly rational and understandable explanation.  On a simple reading of the section it appears that it proposes to introduce an entirely new concept into Irish law, that is, to allow the Minister to certify whether new regulations are substantially the same as old regulations. We all know there can be circumstances where changes are necessary in the regulations, for example, indicating the eligibility qualifications for, say, deserted wife's allowance and the various other allowances that are covered by this section.</P>
      <P>What is much more difficult to imagine is a realistic definition of what &ldquo;substantially to the like effect&rdquo; means.  That is a matter of opinion.  It appears that it is going to be a matter of the Minister's opinion.  That is the worst kind of legislation. We are depending on the Minister's interpretation of whether the new regulation is to be &ldquo;substantially to the like effect&rdquo; as the old regulation.  For example, there are income limits in respect of one of the sections.  A figure of £7,000 is mentioned in the consolidation Act.  It has been changed since by various amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were decided to change again the level at which these qualification limits would operate, would that be substantially to the like effect if the change only took into account inflation between the time of the old order and the new order? The problem is that this Minister cannot give us an answer which will bind her successors.  It appears that the Minister has quite an amount of explaining to do in this regard.  By far the best approach for the Minister would be to withdraw this section and have another look at it <Col N="1815" /> even if that requires Members of the other House coming back from their holidays. That will not inconvenience me.  I am quite sure they are so diligent in the way the perform their duties that they would welcome the opportunity to have a meeting to express their views on our views relating to section 22.</P>

I will defer my remarks on that until we deal with the Earlier Signature Motion which arises directly from the lack of time this House has had to consider this legislation.</P>
      <P>Like many other Senators I am worried about section 22.  In the consolidation legislation of 1981 there is a requirement that drafts of regulations shall be brought before each House of the Oireachtas and can be nullified.  It is perhaps a matter of convenience if, where there is merely a textual change, a very minor change, it can be argued that it should not need positive endorsement by each House. But this section appears to go further than to seek that convenience by removing all control.</P>
      <P>If the requirements for positive endorsement were removed there should still be a power of annulment open to either House on the grounds that in the opinion of the Houses there was a substantial alteration.  If this final power of determining whether there was a substantial alteration were left with the Houses of the Oireachtas there would not be the same objection to the requirement for positive endorsement of a regulation being made.  If we were in actuality in the same state of freedom that we are supposed to be under the Constitution in regard to this legislation, I would suggest that an amendment along those lines be introduced on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day will come when this Seanad in exasperation at the short time it is given for certain legislation, will reject a section such as section 22, irrespective of the fact that that action calls for an emergency recall of the Dáil.  I do not think that day has arrived yet, and I do not think this section, which is a difficult one to interpret, is the one on which there should be such a trial of strength or a declaration of final impatience on the part of this House.  I ask the Minster if she would not seriously consider the misgivings that come from all sides of this House, have this matter throughly examined and give an undertaking that if in her opinion and not in the opinion of anybody else, the case which has been made today is well <Col N="1817" /> founded, she would remedy the matter in the next Social Welfare Bill that will be inevitable in 12 months' time.  Rather than standing up here today defending section 22 as it stands perhaps the Minister would undertake the re-examination of this section.  Section 22, as we have it before us, is not the section 22 that was introduced earlier in March.  It has already been amended in Dáil Éireann. We know that in the course of amendments further difficulties can arise.  If we had time available this would be an obvious case for considering section 22, not on a Report Stage taken after an interval from before or after lunch, or Report Stage ordered on Wednesday for a Thursday, but a Report Stage which would follow a Committee Stage by one or two weeks &mdash; in fact, those one or two weeks are not open to us now.  I would feel much happier if the Minister, rather than mounting an all-out defence of section 22 asked us to allow this to go into this year's Bill with an undertaking that the whole question would be examined during the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge has summed up the problem as we see it. If this Bill is passed, without amending section 22, and if the Minister considers it her duty to change the regulations, can I have an assurance that she will come back to this House with a resolution for a decision?  If we have an opportunity to delete the regulations we would be able to give our views on the Minister's interpretation. This is not a shot across the bow for anybody, the parliamentary draftsman or anybody else.  On numerous occasions in recent times this House was left with the responsibility of ensuring legislation was properly enacted, and that is not a condemnation of the other House.</P>

Once again we have to rush very important legislation through this House because the Social Welfare Bill must become law by the end of the month.  I am not supposed to mention the other House but <Col N="1818" /> they leave us no alternative but to rush this Bill through.  We should get some assurance that the Social Welfare Bill, and other Bills of major importance will be brought to this House in time to be debated properly and amended where necessary.  We should not have to waive our right to further investigate and question certain sections or subsections of any legislation.</P>

      <P>I wish to attempt to allay the fears of Senators and assure them that section 22 is not intended to confer the draconian powers which Senators seem to be afraid of.  If I may make a few remarks before responding to the suggestion of Senator Dooge, the purpose of section 22 is essentially to facilitate the work of consolidating social welfare regulations, work which has been considered to be extremely desirable. Senator Durcan asked that we simplify the social welfare legislation and regulations. Various Social Welfare Acts were consolidated in 1981.  That was of major benefit and brought together in one Act all the basic provisions of the social welfare system.  There has been so much additional legislation in the meantime that it is now necessary for us to begin the process of consolidating the Acts again but that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>This section is concerned with the regulations under the Acts.  As Senators know, there is a very large number of such regulations.  Senator Robinson said yesterday that social welfare law is becoming of major interest to legal people, and the consolidation of the various regulations is a matter of great urgency and importance.  A considerable amount of work has already been done in the area and I am anxious that we will complete the work and that the consolidated regulations will be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make this very important point now because it is relevant to questions that have been raised.  There is a general provision in the legislation that where any regulations are being made they must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days, and <Col N="1819" /> there is provision for a resolution annulling the regulations within that time by either House.  The provision in the general legislation is not being affected by section 22.  Senators can be assured on that point.  That general revision remains, which is the main worry of the Senators. Another provision in the Act is that certain regulations must be laid in draft before each House and must be approved by a resolution of each House.  The process of consolidating the regulations will involve bringing together in one regulation a number of different regulations of different types.  I do not think there is very much to be gained by bringing all the consolidated regulations through both Houses and section 22 is designed to avoid this.  I would repeat that there still is the general provision in the legislation that any regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>The section requires the Minister to certify that the consolidated regulations do not involve any change of substance but are merely a consolidation.  While I respect the concern expressed by Senators that some unscrupulous Minister might certify a regulation as being a consolidating measure whereas in fact he or she was taking the opportunity to make a substantial change in some particular area, it need not be a real one.  Obviously, there is a general presumption that Ministers will act reasonably in this regard as in so much other legislation.  Apart from this, if anyone felt that a Minister in a particular instance had misused powers given in the section it would be open to that person to get a declaration to that effect from the High Court.  Senators will know that recourse to the courts in relation to social welfare matters has become more frequent and will become even more frequent in the future.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and pointed out the general provision in the legislation about the laying of regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas, I would repeat that the provision is a reasonable one.  It is only designed to help to do something <Col N="1820" /> which everybody wants us to do, which is to facilitate the process of consolidation. I would very much hope that the House would be able to see it in that light and not in any way an attempt to undermine the role of this House or the other House.  The problem with section 22 is that it was circulated as far back as 4 March.  The amendment subsequently made is very small.  It does not affect the arguments Senators are making.  I have tried to make it very clear that the Senators' fears are not necessary.  Having said that, if Senators feel they are not fully satisfied with those remarks I would be very happy to comply with Senator Dooge's request in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach.  The Minister will also appreciate that it is difficult for us because of the pressure we are under to grapple with this.  I would ask if the Minister will examine the question.  It may well be that when we look at the whole Consolidated Act together, it would be quite clear. There is the general provision which the Minister referred to but there are provisions throughout the Act.  Now that we are dealing with Report Stage, it is not possible for Senators to deal with this point on their feet or sitting down while other Senators are speaking.</P>
      <P>A fair measure of the obnoxiousness of section 22, and I say the obnoxiousness at first sight to Senators, might well have been removed if, in fact, it had contained a phrase at the end &ldquo;without prejudice to the general power under section 3 of the Principal Act&rdquo; which would immediately make everybody look at section 3 of the Principal Act.  The difficulties we have in dealing with it here are the difficulties other people will have when they are trying to see what does this piece of legislation mean.  I would suggest to the Minister that the code which will have to be reconsolidated, as it were, in 12 months' time, should have such a phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what the parliamentary draftsman is going to say when the Minister suggests that.  The parliamentary draftsman is going to say that is unnecessary and therefore, it should not be done.  It <Col N="1821" /> may be unnecessary to somebody who has all the legislation on a computer and concerts the sections and their effects on the computer.  To a member of the ordinary public and to an ordinary Member of the Legislature, I think repetition is no harm.  In fact, the theory of communication on which electronics is built depends on the fact that a degree of redundancy is necessary for good communication.  There is a quantitative theorem known as Shannon's Theorem in regard to this.  What we want is the application of the theorem of C.E. of Shannon to social welfare legislation in this particular regard.  In fact, if that simple thing of the reference to section 3 or a reference to the fact that the general power of annulment was not thereby affected, I think this section would have been passed 45 minutes ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has responded positively to Professor Dooge's suggestion in relation to this overall section.  I am still at a loss now that I have got my breath back again. But the question is the problem with the words &ldquo;substantially to like effect&rdquo;.  The Minister attempted to define those words by saying in effect it meant no change of substance.  Do they mean that in relation to section 12 of the 1981 Act?  I will read section 12 into the record again as it is a very short section.  It states:</P>
      <P>Regulations may alter rates of employment or voluntary contributions but where such regulations are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas....</P>
      <P>What section 12 says is very simple.  I cannot see how there can be a change of regulation made under section 12 which would not, as it were, affect the substance. I still am unhappy about the powers section 22 confers.  I do not know if it is fair to ask the Minister if she would be willing to give an undertaking to the effect that she would not use her powers of certification under this section between now and the enactment of the next following Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge said almost all that I would like to say.  Legislation is not for lawyers, legislation is for the community at large.  There is nothing improper or wrong about incorporating into legislation phrases which may be technically unnecessary but which make the purpose or meaning of a piece of legislation more understood.  A warning I would like to give to the Minister as would the Leader of the House, but cannot, is that the Leader of the House to his great credit has a habit so far of enabling motions to annual regulations to be discussed in this House.  That is something that is not so frequent in the other House, particularly where minority groups, like independent members, raise them.  The Minister ought to realise that on the tradition so far established in this House, the Leader has made it clear that it is not a precedent; we have in the past discussed the annulment of regulations where Members were not happy with them.  Therefore if any regulations come in which are certified under section 22 of this Bill the Minister can assume that if they are, in the view of Members of this House, substantially at variance with the regulations, the proposals will be discussed and if necessary be annulled.  The Leader has already given us evidence that he supports that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to what section 22 is about.  In doing that, the Minister is well served by such a skilful Leader of the House as Senator Dooge who can appear to handle the most difficult problems.  The Minister is lucky that I am not Leader of the House because she would not be getting out quite so early today.  I can guarantee her that.  We are probably lucky that she is not Leader of the House because if she was, she would adopt an attitude similar to my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of consolidation is well known in legislation but nowhere does this section mention consolidation.  The Minister mentions it.  Though the section refers to regulations &ldquo;to the like effect&rdquo;, it does not say &ldquo;the same regulations&rdquo; or &ldquo;like regulations&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;substantially <Col N="1823" /> to the like effect&rdquo;.  I do not think that means consolidation.  It is slighty wider than consolidation.  It is not a consolidation measure, and although what the Minister said about consolidation appears to be reasonable, this section goes a little beyond that.</P>
    <P>Of course, other options were open to the Minister.  One of them is shown in section 3 (5) of the Principal Act.  There are two ways in which measures can come before this and the other House.  The sections we are proposing to amend have, by and large if not all of them, the following rule: that if a change is to be made a positive resolution of both Houses must be passed before the regulation will take effect.  In respect of the other provisions of the Bill, section 3 (5) of the Principal Act allows the Houses to intervene if they see fit.  The provision provides that regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as they are made.  If a resolution annulling a regulation is to be laid before the Oireachtas it must be within 21 sitting days. If nobody raises the issue, that is grand.</P>

      <P>That is not happening here.  There are now three ways in which regulations can be made.  One is that a positive resolution of the Houses is required.  All of the regulations I have looked up require that.  General regulations may be annulled if the House feels it is necessary to do so.  I understand this is a third category of regulation which may not be put before the House at all.</P>

This section contains a provision that the requirement that the regulations be laid before the Oireachtas &mdash; not passed by each House of the Oireachtas &mdash;&ldquo;shall not apply&rdquo;.  Therefore, such regulations do not come before the Oireachtas even for affirmation, or for information &mdash; they do not come before us at all.</P>

      <P>After all the confusion, perhaps I should intervene.  I thought I had acceded to the request when I expressed agreement with the Leader of the House a few moments ago.  I am not sure why we are still arguing.  The important word in regard to the point Senator O'Leary made is &ldquo;draft&rdquo;.  The regulations need not be laid before the Houses in draft, but they must still be placed before the Houses.  I can only quote the legal advice from the Attorney General's Office.  It is that section 22 does not enable the Minister to make a change of substance in any existing regulation including a change in the rates of contribution. The word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; would mean any change in the rates of contribution. That was a matter of some concern to Senator Durcan and others.  As in all legislation, ultimately only the Supreme Court could make a final decision.  In the spirit of what the Leader of the House said earlier, I am prepared to give an undertaking that until the next legislation, which as night follows day must come to us again in the next 12 months, I will not use that power given to me in section 22.</P>

      <P>We are all grateful to the Minister and perhaps it can be all wrapped up now.  I wish to withdraw my interruption of Senator O'Leary's contribution. I said I thought that his point in regard to section 22 was governed by section 3 of the Principal Act.  Senator O'Leary's case at least has to be answered.  It would appear that if we enact section 22 in its present form there will be a conflict between section 3 (5) of the Principal Act, which says that the draft shall be laid, and section 22 which states that the draft shall not be laid. The Act might have said that a draft regulation made under those sections would not be laid.  It actually says that no draft shall be laid.  Therefore Senator O'Leary had a point.  I do not want to provoke him into further making the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have a point after what the Minister said.  It is <Col N="1825" /> important that we keep the thing clear.  I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that what we are talking about is a draft.  I presume that the Minister was confirming that there are not three categories, that all she is being enabled to do is not to have to put the draft before us but that the regulations, when made, still have to come before the House under the general duty imposed by section 3 (5).  If that is the case, I have no objection to section 22.</P>
      <P>In so far as it is a consolidating measure I should like the Minister to spend some time in the next 12 months examining the words &ldquo;substantially to the like effect&rdquo;. Assuming that that is found to mean &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; it is quite reasonable to assume that, if it was merely a consolidation provision, to allow us an opportunity to annul it after the regulation was made would be sufficient.  If it were limited to consolidation only I would be happy that the general provision in section 3 (5) of the 1981 Act should apply to consolidation measures.  Our continued concern is what is the legal definition of &ldquo;substantially to the like effect&rdquo;.  I do not think it is a very good definition.  The Minister should examine that in the course of the ensuing 12 months.</P>

It is extremely important that the social welfare code be readily available not merely to lawyers and legislators but also to officials, to members of the public who have recourse to the courts.  There should be a commitment on the part of the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the Stationery Office &mdash; which I gather comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance &mdash; to produce a composite volume containing the social welfare code in terms of legislation and of regulations.</P>

      <P>That, pursuant to subsection 2º of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad Éireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Social Welfare Bill, 1986, on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.</P>
      <P>Since section 17 has to come into operation on 1 April there is not the normal time available to the President for consideration of this Bill.  Accordingly the Government have decided, that with the concurrence of Seanad Éireann a request should be made to the President for early signature of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, as I say on every occasion on which I move an earlier signature motion, that it is always a matter of great regret I have to move an earlier signature motion.  It always seems that the times when the President's period for consideration is reduced by the passage of the motion are also times in which the period <Col N="1827" /> for consideration by the Seanad has been curtailed.  While Senators received a copy of this Bill, on its circulation on 2 March, we did not receive the Bill, as amended by the Dáil, until 20 March.  Accordingly, our complete consideration of this Bill has had to be compressed into six days, whereas the time for consideration available to Dáil Éireann was 17 days. While I am prepared to accept that Senators may be twice as intelligent as Members of the Dáil.  I do not think we could claim to be three times as intelligent and able to consider matters of this importance in one-third of the time.  As I indicated when talking on section 22, this position is one which the Seanad must deprecate.  Indeed, we must urge on Ministers that legislation will have to be introduced, in whichever House, in time for due deliberation by both Houses, otherwise there will continue to be difficulty and the day will come when the Seanad &mdash; at a time most inconvenient to Ministers and to Dáil Éireann &mdash; will decide that it must amend a particular piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity <Col N="1828" /> to welcome the Minister of State.  I can describe him as a personal friend and I wish him well in his job.  I am happy to put on the record that in the area and on the issue which I raised today I have ample evidence not only of his commitment but also his willingness to make himself unpopular in the interests of homeless people in Cork and, therefore, what remarks I might have intended to make I will temper accordingly knowing the goodwill of the Minister involved.</P>
      <P>The year 1987 has been designated as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.  You need not worry, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, I will not take the entire 20 minutes at all.  The process by which it came to be known to people working with the homeless in this country that 1987 had been so designated can only be described as a slow process of osmosis. We and various people involved heard about it indirectly and from religious and other agencies.  It was one of my colleagues here in the Seanad who mentioned it to me and produced some documentation that he had got from a sister involved in some voluntary organisation.  A number of other people I spoke to were not aware at that stage that this proposal had been made.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister and I would have any disagreement that this is an extremely important decision and one that is appropriate because in the United States and in Europe homelessness has been identified as an increasing phenomenon. The unofficial estimate is that homelessness in the United States has increased tenfold in the last six years from 300,000 or fewer to about three million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This phenomenon is now coming to the attention of the Community.  We had a successful seminar in Cork last September on the problem of homelessness in Europe and the alarming fact for those of us from Ireland who were there was that, even in advanced countries with advance welfare states, the problem of homelessness is becoming more and more visible.  Homelessness is also a Third World phenomenon brought on by large scale migration from rural to urban areas <Col N="1829" /> into environments where there is little or no housing and little or no provision in the form of shelter available.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was appropriate, first, that the United Nations agency to deal with the whole question of shelter should be situated not in the First World but in a Third World country, Kenya, and that the United Nations should designate a year of shelter because this is becoming visibly an international problem.  It is also a national problem in this country and, therefore, the response to International Year of Shelter for the Homeless should be two-pronged.  It should have an international dimension and a national dimension. I was happy to see in the revised Estimate for 1986 for the Department of the Environment provision for the United Nations International Year of Shelter for the Homeless to the tune of £25,000.  I am glad that we are providing funds to the international body and it is emphasised that this is a contribution to an international organisation.  It will not be a contribution to anything that is being done within this country.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed to find that there is no reference in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment to any support for any activities connected with the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless in this country.  There is a very welcome provision under housing for funds for the implementation of what is still the Housing Bill but which it is hoped will become the amended Housing Act. We hope in that area that the funds will be available.  What is missing is any provision for lead in support, for organisational costs, or for the preparation of projects, schemes, publicity, conferences or anything that would involve people in this country where we have a lively, active and fairly vocal voluntary sector dealing with the problem of homelessness. There is nothing evident in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment to make provision for this. One can only conclude that the provision that is intended this year is either so miniscule as not to deserve a separate heading or it is not being provided at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> I do not understand how we can hope to participate fully in such an important international occasion if we do not have provision in the year preceding to support various groups.  I know that the Department of the Environment is the official contact point for the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless and, therefore, I must assume that any activities are going to be supported from within that Department or that activities are going to be funded by that Department. I would therefore have to wonder where priorities are going, because in searching line by line through the Estimate of the Department of the Environment I found interesting references to a grant to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to the tune of £25,000 and a grant in respect of homes or shelters for stray or unwanted dogs or cats to the tune of £125,000.  One must assume, therefore, that for reasons best known to themselves, both the Minister and the Government have either taken no decision about support nationally for the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless or have taken a decision to do nothing this year.</P>
    <P>There are attempts afoot &mdash; I am not involved in them &mdash; to set up a local committee of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.  I have no knowledge of its status, whether it is official or unofficial, or whether the Department of the Environment are officially participating or not.  If such a committee is being set up it should not be left entirely to the voluntary sector to fund what is, after all Irish participation in an international effort.  It should not be left to voluntary organisations that are, as the Minister knows only too well, more and more heavily strapped for funds, to provide the funding to do something proper.</P>
    <P>It should not be left to international organisations to give money to this country. It is a once off thing.  It is one of the small areas of social problem that is beginning to manifest itself.  We could learn from an international conference on homelessness.  We could, for instance, learn &mdash; if I can be slightly political &mdash;<Col N="1831" /> about the failures of legislation to deal with homelessness in other areas which might enable us to amend our own current draft legislation before some of the same mistakes are repeated here.  We could learn about the relationship between urbanisation and homelessness. between homelessness and family breakdown. There is so much we could do if funding was available.  Therefore, it is a matter of considerable regret that funding is not available.  It is difficult to envisage a situation where support for such a international year could be made available if it did not include some funding. We can have moral support, we can have verbal support, we can have the Department of the Environment being officially involved, but without hard cash all other kinds of involvement are really no more than meaningless gestures.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this matter on the Adjournment is not to get involved in a dispute about whose goodwill is greater than whose goodwill.  It is not to get involved in a dispute about who is more or less concerned about the homeless.  It is not to invite a recitation of all the things the Department of the Environment have done or are proposing to do for the homeless. It is to invite a positive response from the Minister to the specific question: are the Government going to provide support to enable activities to take place here under the auspices of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless? I could go on at length, but I think I have made my point.  What is needed is perfectly clear and I look forward with considerable interest to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I am sure that all Senators are aware that 1987 has been designated by the United Nations as International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.  Ireland, in common with other UN member countries, international bodies and agencies, has been invited to make a financial contribution towards the costs of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in organising the year.  Senator B. Ryan made <Col N="1832" /> reference to the £25,000 contribution which the Government are going to make.  I am pleased to be able to announce that the Government have approved an Irish contribution of £25,000 towards the UN venture.  Senators will, I am sure, welcome the fact that we are making the contribution particularly when it is realised that this country is one of a very small number of developed countries to have pledged financial support for the International Year of Shelter.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of the year is on improving shelter conditions in the developing world.  This was made clear at a recent seminar organised on the international year by voluntary organisations here and held in Gort Mhuire, Ballinteer. At this seminar a speech was delivered on behalf of the director of the international year of shelter, who stated:</P>
      <P>It is estimated that one billion people &mdash; a quarter of the world's population &mdash; live in absolute poverty and are either literally homeless or live in extremely bad shelters and unhealthy environments.  The magnitude of the problem is further described by the fact that, in spite of increased Government action during the last decade, the housing situation of the poor in developing countries is continuously deteriorating.</P>
      <P>In organising the year the United Nations are recognising that in the past efforts of many international agencies to tackle disease, to reduce infant mortality and improve health facilities have all too often failed to realise the full potential due to inadequate shelter.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the plight of homeless children and of the millions who live in squatter settlements at the edge of major cities in the Third World countries. It is the main objective of the year to encourage these countries to adopt low technology, self-help and domestic rather than imported solutions to meet these great needs for adequate shelter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank Senator Ryan for his kind opening remarks and the tribute he paid to me.  I am very grateful to him.  He, in turn, is making his own local <Col N="1833" /> contribution and I should like to compliment him for that.  His work in this field deserves to be commended.  His presence here is a recognition of that.</P>
    <P>Due to the past and prospective population growth in many developing countries accommodation is of greatest importance.  Population growth has been compounded by a drift away from the land into urban areas, leading in many instances to sprawling urban squatter settlements and shanty towns.  We do not have shanty towns as such but we do have the rural urban drift which has created problems in our major cities.  We can see it in Cork, Dublin and other parts of our country.  This has been largely the root cause of the problem here.  The United Nations have recognised the impossibility of addressing problems such as these through one-off aid projects and have stressed the need for relying on domestic resources and domestic solutions.</P>
    <P>While this by no means excludes any role for foreign aid projects, it has and does emphasise the national role.  Measures have to be taken at national level to stem the drift to urban areas and to deliver basic services at a cost which individuals and nations can afford. Affordability, a concept which was lost sight of for many years, has again assumed significance and will prove vital to the success or otherwise of plans to improve the shelter of the millions who are homeless between now and the end of this century.  By adopting an appropriate national response aimed at securing basic improvements it is hoped that Third World countries will come to grips with problems which sometimes seem insurmountable.</P>
    <P>While the primary focus of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless is on improving the living conditions of those in the developing countries, this does not mean that we can afford to be complacent about homelessness in our own country.  Despite a very extensive and highly subsidised social housing system, substantial incentives and assistance towards home ownership and an extensive array of welfare services, we <Col N="1834" /> too, in common with the other developed countries, also have our homeless.  I am pleased to be able to point to significant actions and initiatives which have been undertaken in relation to the homeless in advance of 1987.</P>
    <P>This, I feel, would help to answer some of the accusations Senator Ryan has levelled at the Government.  I refer specifically to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985 now at Second Stage in Dáil Éireann which is the most significant amendment of housing legislation since the Housing Act, 1966. The Bill is designed to ensure that the special needs of persons such as the homeless, the aged, the disabled and others will be recognised in the formulation of local authority house building programmes and in the letting of dwellings. In addition, the Bill places a statutory obligation on local authorities to ensure that accommodation is made available to homeless persons.  I am sure Senator Ryan like myself in the past, as a member of a local authority, has been critical of the provisions under the old scheme where health boards were expected to provide accommodation for the homeless. I would not hesitate to say that the services offered were less than adequate. I had occasion, as a local public representative, to make representations to the health board to try to get somebody to put a roof over people's heads, without any great success.  I hope there is a much more enlightened approach and that the provisions in this Bill will ensure that we do not have a repetition of what happened in the past.</P>
    <P>The authorities will, in addition to providing accommodation from their own housing stock, now be able to secure accommodation for the homeless through arrangements with voluntary and other agencies and to assist homeless persons financially.  These changes mark a significant advance on social legislation and have been widely welcomed.  I am satisfied that this Bill when enacted will significantly improve the position of homeless persons in obtaining accommodation of a reasonable standard and suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> I would also like to stress that local authorities are housing significant numbers of homeless persons, even in advance of the new legislation and this trend will continue given, in particular, the enormous success of the £5,000 grant schemes for the surrender of local authority dwellings.  Anybody who has been closely monitoring this development can see the amount of housing that have been made available to the various local authorities throughout the city.  For example, in one particular estate in my own constituency, out of, say, 500 or 600 houses, there were 40 surrendered.  This is a significant number which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The United Nations have stressed the importance of community participation in the provision of shelter in the developing countries and I would like now to mention the scheme in this country through which financial assistance is provided to voluntary groups providing accommodation for persons such as the homeless and the elderly.  Under the terms of a scheme introduced in March 1984 voluntary housing organisations could obtain fully subsidisable loans of up to £16,000 or 80 per cent of the cost per unit of accommodation, including caretaker accommodation.  With effect from 1 December 1985 the cash limit of £16,000 was increased by 25 per cent to £20,000 and this substantial increase will, I expect, result in a significant increase in the amount of modern purpose built accommodation provided by voluntary bodies.  Senator Ryan has levelled criticism at the Government for not providing enough.  This is a very positive step where voluntary bodies can get up to 80 per cent of the cost per unit.  I am a member of Skiddy's charity in my own constituency and I am well aware of what is available for the housing of the homeless.  This scheme promotes community involvement in the provision of accommodation for the disadvantaged.  While the bulk of the accommodation provided under this <Col N="1836" /> scheme has been for elderly persons, my Department are encouraging voluntary bodies to provide more accommodation for homeless persons under the scheme, particularly in the context of the year.</P>
    <P>The motion before this House speaks of the need for Government support for activities in this country in connection with the International Year of Shelter and I believe that the measures I have outlined represent a significant and appropriate basis for the Irish response which can, and indeed will, be developed further during 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>There are one or two comments I sould like to make arising from what Senator Ryan has said.  I do not know if he is offering criticism of the contribution made to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I would not justify my case on the basis of what the other person gets.  Shelter for the Homeless are well able to stand on their merits. People might say that we should not give this money to the society, but they are humane and very concerned that there are abuses.  I am not making any comparison between how a human being and an animal should be treated but, nonetheless, these people are all well intentioned. I know some of them who do a tremendous job on a very slender budget.</P>
    <P>On the question of family breakdown, this is one of the greatest problems with which we are confronted in society today. I hope that in legislation in the Dáil in the near future provision will be made to tackle this problem from another angle.</P>
    <P>Regarding the support for the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, Senator Ryan asked that moneys be made available for the holding of seminars to allow people who are involved in voluntary bodies to organise and overcome their problem.  I regret to say at this juncture I am not in a position to give a commitment to Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 16 April 1986.</P>
