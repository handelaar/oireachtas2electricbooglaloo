      <P>I have notice from Senator Séamus de Brún that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to reconsider the case of the three All-Irish primary schools namely Ring Mahon and Parklands, Cork City, and Cnoc Theas, Limerick, which have been in voluntary operation since last September, with a view to sanctioning all three schools to full recognition under the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business today.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, as on the Order Paper and to suspend the sitting from 6 p.m. until 7 p.m.  Item No. 1 is the Report Stage of the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill.  Item No. 2 is the return to this House of the electoral Bill with an amendment from Dáil Éireann, which will be considered by us <Col N="914" /> on Report Stage.  When these two have been disposed of we will then proceed to the Second Stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  It is proposed in conjunction with the debate on Second Stage, that item No. 4, which is an affirmation by this House in regard to neutrality and in regard to cohesion, should be debated at the same time, and also that item No. 5, the noting of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Single European Act, should be debated on Second Stage.  Accordingly, when the Second Stage is concluded, these two motions, Nos. 4 and 5, will be moved without debate.  If, in fact, items Nos. 1 to 5, are concluded before 8 p.m., No. 6 will be taken up, but not otherwise.</P>

      <P>I understand there was agreement among the Whips that item No. 6 would be taken at 8 p.m.  I may be wrong, but that is the information I received.  I had made preparations because I am dealing with the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill.  It is an inconvenience if it does not come up at 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Early last week I gave an indication of how I thought the business might be handled between now and the end of the session.  There have been some disturbances to that.  Perhaps I should report to the House in regard to the Status of Children Bill which I indicated I hoped would be passed.  Already, in response to what the Seanad said on Committee Stage, 75 amendments were drafted.  Unfortunately the official in charge went on sick leave.  The remaining 15 amendments, or so, have not been drafted so it is unlikely that that Bill will be taken.  I have asked the Leaders of the Whips of the groups to meet with me this afternoon at 4 o'clock so that we can discuss the rearrangement of the business <Col N="915" /> in order to agree how far we can advance our business.  Certainly, it would be the intention of all groups that the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill be advanced as far as possible and that, for example, the Air Pollution Bill, which has been with us since last February, should be cleared.</P>
      <P>One of the points that will be discussed will be the question of whether we will take up the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill tonight, or whether there would be any possibility of sitting to complete the Second Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  I must emphasise that if, at any time, I give to this House any indication of what is the tentative programme of business, it is in order to assist the House and can never be considered as a guarantee.  I regret, that, if at any time in attempting to assist the House in this way, I end up by hindering Senators.</P>

      <P>I want to inform the House that amendments Nos. 3 and 5 have been ruled out of order for Report Stage as they do not arise on the committee proceedings.  I would also like to remind Senators that the proposer of an amendment may close the debate on the amendment but no other Senator may speak more than once.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;for such purposes&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for the purposes of providing bridging finance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with the power of the Minister to prescribe purposes for which loans may be made.  The power has been taken to enable societies to provide bridging loans.  Our amendment says &ldquo;In page 2, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;for such purposes&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for the purposes <Col N="916" /> of providing bridging finance&rdquo;.  The Minister is seeking general powers to do a specific thing, that is, to allow societies to provide bridging loans.  Jurists normally object to this procedure as being bad in principle.  The section gives very broad powers.  These should be restricted to the Minister's declared purpose in view of the piecemeal nature of the legislation. Comprehensive legislation and updating are needed in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wants to make provision that building societies would be allowed to provide bridging finance.  This should be included specifically in the section.  The section as it is gives the Minister wide power, in that he promises everything and nothing.  This power, which he will have through this section, gives him considerable leverage in situations where the Minister might want the building societies to toe the line as happened in the past.  This is <i>ad hoc</i> legislation. If the Minister wants power specifically to provide bridging loans that should be stated clearly in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary amendment. The building societies have for quite some time, been calling on the Government to afford them the opportunity to extend the range of their lending activities.  In the response which the IBSA made to the Government's discussion document earlier this year that association gave an indication that they were most anxious to be allowed to engage in a range of lending activities.  I know that the non-IBSA societies are very anxious that that should be so.  In discussions on earlier stages of this Bill in this House and in the other House I indicated that it had been my intention to afford to the societies the right to engage in bridging finance as an initial step, but that section 3 had been deliberately cast in such a way as to allow the Minister from time to time to enable the societies to engage in whatever lending was deemed to be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also indicated that I thought the facility of allowing societies to make home improvement loans available <Col N="917" /> seemed to be appropriate to the activities of building societies.  Interestingly, when this Bill was first published and when a representative of one of the major building societies was asked to comment on it, he dismissed section 3 as being of little consequence because it provided only for making available to the societies the facility to make bridging finance available. That is quite wrong.  The section as it stands allows the Minister to allow the societies from time to time to engage in additional types of lending as is deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason, late in the course of discussion of this Bill in the other House the IBSA changed their attitude entirely.  They issued a document to Members of the Oireachtas which was totally at variance with their earlier submission, asking to be allowed to engage in a number of different types of new lending.  They suggested instead that the section should be so restrictive as only to allow bridging finance to be made available.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this should be so, and why an association which has been demanding the right to engage in various forms of lending should now, suddenly, seek to have the section made so restrictive as only to provide for bridging finance.  Interestingly, the intention of the Opposition amendment here in this House now would be to achieve exactly what the IBSA lobby have been asking for.  It is, perhaps, interesting to write into the record that the IBSA lobby document, which was sent to Members, suggests precisely that an amendment should be made to section 3 and that subsection (1) of section 3 should be &ldquo;amended only to allow societies to give bridging loans&rdquo; and quoting again from the IBSA lobby document &ldquo;by the substitution for the following words `for such purposes' of the words `for the purposes of providing bridging finance'.&rdquo;  The Opposition amendment says to delete &ldquo;for such purposes&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for the purposes of providing bridging finance.&rdquo;  If that coincidence was not enough the explanation given by the IBSA lobby as to why they want this restriction to be built into <Col N="918" /> the section is, and I quote:&ldquo;The Minister is seeking general powers to do a specific thing, allow societies to make bridging loans.  Jurists normally object to this procedure as being bad in principle.  The subsection gives very broad powers. These should be restricted to the Minister's declared purpose in view of the piecemeal nature of the legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall the opening sentences put forward by Senator Fitzsimons as to why this amendment should be accepted.  They are word for word, down to the commas, identical to the IBSA lobby document.  One can only wonder why, at this stage, this amendment has been entered when this suggestion was not advanced at any other stage of discussion of the Bill here in the House. One can only wonder as to why some of the societies now want to have their additional powers restricted only to the area of bridging finance when I have make it clear on a number of occasions that it is my intention to allow societies to engage in a number of other lending activities and that I felt allowing them to make bridging finance available to their members was the first and most appropriate step.</P>
    <P>It is particularly interesting to reflect as to why the IBSA have changed their attitude in this latest lobby document which they circulated to Oireachtas Members, which is in marked contrast to the document which they produced in May in response to the Government's discussion document, where they asked at paragraph 2.2. of their document that they should be allowed to operate in the area of bridging finance but went on to say that home improvements loans are another area where an APR of approximately 20 per cent is charged by the banks and &ldquo;the building societies will be happy to offer similar finance at a substantial reduction of the bank's interest rate&rdquo;. Yet if I were to agree to the acceptance of this amendment, the societies would not be allowed to engage in that type of loan facility or any other which the societies have been asking for.</P>
    <P>It is particularly interesting to reflect that the non-IBSA building societies are <Col N="919" /> very anxious that they should be allowed to engage in a range of other home-related loan type activities and have expressed the earnest desire that the Minister would, by regulations, allow them at the appropriate time to become involved in a number of activities, including <i>inter alia</i> bridging finance.  It would be a retrograde step if, for some extraordinary reason known now only to the Opposition and the IBSA, section 3 were to be recast in such a restrictive way as only to allow for the extension of the building society powers into the area of bridging finance. I am not prepared for that reason to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's rejection of the amendment and his appeal to people on the other side to have another think about the amendment, I certainly understand the thrust of what they are saying.  It is important that there would be a deal of flexibility retained by the Minister in the development of the building society movement.  I would like to support what the Minister says and to appeal to have the amendment withdrawn.</P>

      <P>On the day the Committee Stage debate was taking place I was on my way up here and I was asked to meet a representative of the IBSA, which is normal practice with Members of the House.  I put it to the Minister that there is nothing sinister in receiving representations and responding to them. I recall a number of occasions in this House when we had a debate in response to matters raised by representation.  I recall Senator O'Leary on the Nurses Bill giving well earned praise to the Minister for changes which he incorporated in the Bill due to the debate here following representations. There is nothing sinister in that regard.  Might I also remind the Minister that I was coming up to the Committee Stage debate when I was detained, but the amendments which we have tabled conform with my Second Stage contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building societies would like more <Col N="920" /> or less to have facilities such as the banks have, but this would belong to comprehensive legislation, not to this Bill which, rightly or wrongly, people conclude was conceived out of confrontation and a certain amount of vindictiveness.  I am concerned about the borrowers and the savers.  There are two sides to the coin.  I appreciate that the Minister tried to achieve a certain purpose and he failed.  It is not appropriate to go into that now.</P>
    <P>In this <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, as the Minister stated previously, he wants to give the building societies the power to provide bridging loans.  The purpose of the amendment is to give the Minister power to provide bridging loans and all the rest should be reserved for legislation which would go into the matter fully.  The building societies have made enormous strides through the years and, hopefully, they will get stronger every day.  In the light of that fact comprehensive legislation is needed specifically in this Bill, to give the building societies power to provide bridging loans.  The rest should be reserved for the comprehensive legislation I mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 25 to 31.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tiered interest rate, representations made to me indicate that all the banks have a tiered system of interest rates.  In the banks it is the smaller borrower who suffers.  I understand, with regard to the building societies and the tiered interest rates, it is the small borrower who benefits at the expense of the larger borrower.  If that is so I am sure the Minister is concerned about the smaller borrower.  Our concern is to provide funds for the building societies. If they lose in one area, they must look for finance in another area.  From the point of view of benefiting the smaller borrower, the Minister should agree to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="921" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment which I find curiously at variance with the last amendment which the Senator proposed.  The last amendment sought to restrict the Minister's powers to extend additional lending facilities to societies to one area, yet, a number of the societies have indicated that, if they are allowed to engage in additional forms of borrowing, the income from those additional forms of borrowing will more than offset any possible loss through any other changes which are being introduced or mooted in the Bill.  The Bill needs to be viewed as a package where the additional powers in section 3 would offset any loss of income which might arise from later sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wonder if Senators realise the variety of tiered interest rates which apply from one society to another.  It is not simply the case that tiered interest rates affect only people borrowing large amounts of money for the purchase of large houses. For example, three societies commence their tiered interest rate charges at loans of £20,000, another society commence their tiered rate at £21,001 and two furtheir societies commence charging tiered rates at £25,001.  Four societies operate tiered rates at a level below the average loan, which is now in the order of £24,000, whilst two other societies commence a loan level only £1,000 above the average.  One society operate a premium rate of 1½ per cent above the standard for loans in the range of over £20,000 to £25,000 and a similar premium on loans of £25,001 in one case and £26,001 in the other case to £31,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no justification for the manner in which tiered rates apply at different levels and in different bands as one enquires as between one society and another.  It is particularly unfortunate for potential borrowers with societies who are operating tiering at those punitive levels especially when one realises that the borrowers will normally have engaged in a savings policy for some years with that particular society and will find themselves when they want to apply for a mortgage virtually locked into that particular society.  As I have already pointed <Col N="922" /> out, a number of societies have said that if they get a reasonable extension of powers under the provisions of section 3 of the Bill that extra income which they feel confident would be generated for them through those additional powers would more than compensate them for any reduction in income which might be brought about either through this section or through later sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other point to bear in mind is that tiered interest rates as applied to home loans, have virtually been eliminated in other countries.  I had hoped that the societies would themselves have been voluntarily moving towards the idea of dropping this practice in preparation for the substantial and additional competition which will come into the home loan marketplace in the immediate future.  Senators should also bear in mind that the two large societies which between them cover approximately 50 per cent, if not more, of the total home loan mortgage market at present have operated very successfully for many years now on the basis of charging the standard mortgage rate only and while one of them recently sought to change that policy the other has not.  I see no reason why they and other societies in the future, particularly after the six months has elapsed after the passing of this provision, should not be able to operate successfully on the basis of charging the standard basic rate to their borrowers.  The facts, as proven elsewhere, speak for themselves as does the success of the societies which have operated 50 per cent of the home loan mortgage market over the past number of years.  This is a provision which has been widely welcomed by the general public and will operate in favour of the public.  I hesitate to remind the House, but I consider it is appropriate that I should, that this is another IBSA lobby amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the matters raised by the Irish Building Societies Association when I met a representative of that association.  As I have already stated, I was on my way into the House for Committee Stage when I was <Col N="923" /> asked to receive representations.  There is nothing unusual in that.  The amendments are in line totally with my contribution on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tiered interest rates, the point I made was that representations were made to me that the small borrower benefits under the present system.  That is either right or wrong, despite what I say or despite what the Minister may say. If that is the situation, it is very wrong that the change will be brought about to the benefit of the large borrower at the expense of the smaller borrower.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's insistence that those points have been brought up as a result of the IBSA lobby, there is nothing unethical or unusual in that.  It is quite normal practice.  The amendments we have done can be checked against my contribution on Second Stage; I would have liked to contribute on Committee Stage but I did not get the opportunity.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 20 to 23.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (b) states:</P>
      <P>the making available to a member to whom a loan is to be made of the report made under section 79 (1) (b) of the Principal Act relating to the value of any security for the loan.</P>
      <P>I hope the Cathaoirleach will give me the opportunity to read section 79 of the 1976 Act, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)&nbsp; It shall be the duty of every director of a society to satisfy himself that the arrangements for assessing the adequacy of the security to be taken in respect of loans to be made by the society are such as may reasonably be expected to ensure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> (a)&nbsp; the adequacy of the security to be taken will be assessed either by the directors or by a director or other officer who is not disentitled by this section to make the assessment, and</P>
    <P>(b)&nbsp; there will be available to every person who has to assess the adequacy of the security to be so taken a written report prepared and signed by a competent person (who shall not be an officer of the society) experienced in matters relevant to the determination of the value of the security, and</P>
    <P>(c)&nbsp; the report relates to the value of any freehold or leasehold estate in the security and to any other matter likely to affect the value of the security.</P>
    <P>(2)&nbsp; A report by a person who has a financial interest in the disposal of an estate in relation to which a loan is to be made by a society shall not be accepted by the person or persons assessing the adequacy of the security as a report for the purposes of subsection (1) (b).</P>
    <P>(3)&nbsp; A person assessing the adequacy of the security for a loan by a society shall not be a person who has a financial interest in the disposal of the estate in relation to which the loan is to be made or a person who is entitled to receive any commission for introducing the parties to the transaction involving that disposition.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to make here is that if this were a trade union matter there would be an objection.  The interest of the surveyors must be considered as well. There is a difference between carrying out a survey and valuation for the building society and for an individual.  It is quite a normal practice of mine to prepare reports and valuations.  I have a fair amount of experience in this area.</P>
    <P>The building society are concerned that the property to be mortgaged is adequate collateral for the loan.  That is the consideration of the building society and that <Col N="925" /> is the approach a surveyor takes in carrying out a survey for a building society.  A surveyor does not deal with every problem, large or small, in the property, which would be the aim of the surveyor acting for an individual buying the property. I could recount many occasions when I carried out surveys where there were problems in this regard.  I will just mention one very briefly which I hope will explain the problem.</P>
    <P>I remember doing a very thorough survey of a fairly new bungalow some years ago.  I got into the roof space and, as people who are familiar with building know, over the ceiling joints of a single storey house normally there is a layer of insulation.  It is very difficult to work in that confined space.  I went through what I regarded as every square foot of that area and I found nothing wrong, no problems. I submitted my report and some time afterwards the individual who bought that property came back to me and told me there was a serious leak in the roof which I had examined thoroughly.  I went back to the house and went through the roof space again.  I discovered at a particular location, where there was a leakage through the ceiling, that there was a basin fitted over the ceiling.  The basin was the same colour as the insulation in order to camouflage it.  The problem of the leakage occurred only when the basin began to overflow.</P>
    <P>There was no way I could have discovered that problem short of lifting the insulation yet it would be my responsibility, if I were doing a survey for that individual, to ensure there was no problem of that kind.  We must bear in mind that in a situation like that it is my responsibility.  It is very costly to get indemnification.  In that report for the building society the bungalow was adequate security.  From the point of view of the individual, I am sure I would have been responsible for whatever expense he had to go to in order to deal with that problem.  It did not arise in that case because I did not make any charge.</P>
    <P>This is the picture I am trying to paint. The objective of the surveyor dealing with the building society is quite different <Col N="926" /> and distinct from that of the surveyor who is dealing with the individual.  It would be very wrong against that background to make the surveyor responsible to the individual as well as to the society because, in effect, it would cause extra expense in getting bonding and indemnification. The result would be that fewer surveyors would be adequately bonded. More time would be involved, and surveyors charge for their time and travelling expenses, and the distance would be greater.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the expense to somebody buying a property and I hope it will be minimised as much as possible, but not at the expense of increasing the cost of employing surveyors.  I agree that the Minister is trying to reduce costs. This will not reduce the cost but rather increase the cost of surveys, valuations and of the report.  In doing a survey for a bank or a building society at present it is not necessary to go into a house, go through each room and go into great detail.  When I approach a house, the general picture makes me 95 per cent sure one way or the other.  It is like a farmer looking at an animal in a field. He knows what the animal is worth; he knows the ins and outs of farming.</P>
    <P>The surveyor who is dealing with these matters on a daily or a weekly basis is the same.  From the point of view of the building society he will check the important aspects, the structural aspects.  If there is something he feels is seriously wrong, he will question it.  If he or she finds that there is some problem about the site, a septic tank or a well outside the boundary of the site, these are important. If an individual asks me to do a survey with the intention of purchasing the house I will do a far more detailed survey and far more time will have to be spent on it and I will give a more detailed report.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister's motive is a good one, which we would all subscribe to, of reducing costs to the purchaser. This subsection will not achieve that purpose. It will cause other problems and in the long run the costs will be greater.</P>

      <P>I recognise what Senator Fitzsimons is saying about these and other amendments.  I have no concern whatsoever as to whether they were sponsored, given to him or suggested to him by the IBSA or any other organisation. That is a normal part of the democratic process which the Minister has to accept. I do not like the confrontational attitude with which the Minister faced the Senator on the other side of the House. It is not in the tradition of this House and I do not like it.  It is a further indication of the confrontational attitude between the Minister and the building societies, which should not exist.</P>
      <P>Having said that on behalf of my friend Senator Fitzsimons, the amendments are very ill thought out and not in the best interests of the people this Bill is designed to protect.  In particular this amendment is one of a series of amendments which deals with turning the main purposes of the Bill on their heads.  They are entitled to be examined on their individual merits and I believe they will be found wanting.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing that reports will be made available. The fears which Senator Fitzsimons expresses with regard to the exposure by surveyors and others as a result of the publication and the availability of these reports are much exaggerated. In the first place, surveyors obviously will have to take into account the possibility that the reports will become public and they will have to reflect that fact in what they are putting forward.  Obviously they are reporting on the adequacy of the value of the property as security.</P>

    <P>I would disagree fundamentally with Senator Fitzsimons if he maintained that merely because a surveyor failed to spot a hole in the roof, through no fault of his own apparently, that that would automatically make him liable for the hole in the roof.  The responsibility of the surveyor will be clearly related to the adequacy or otherwise of the property as security for the loan.  If, as a result of the defect, the property was inadequate as a security for the loan there could be a potential liability.  This could only arise <Col N="928" /> where the purpose of the report, which is the assessment of its adequacy as a security for the loan, is called into question. The benefit of the protection is afforded in that regard to the member of the society who is benefiting from the loan.  Incidentally, I want to say to Senator Fitzsimons that the question of whether he charged his friend for doing the survey is of no relevance because he could be held responsible in any event on the principle of being a person on whom one could reasonably expect to depend for advice.  Irrespective of whether advice is tendered as a result of the exchange of money or on a contractual basis or even if it is tendered free of charge the person giving the advice can be held responsible.</P>
    <P>While there are some difficulties with the section, as I have explained earlier, what it proposes is far better than the existing situation.  What Senator Fitzsimons is proposing in regard to these reports is the retaining of the existing situation.  I do not think that would be in the interests of the members of the society.  In this regard the building societies probably have very little part to play. I do not think it is a matter which would concern them one way or the other.  It is a matter which would obviously concern those who are valuing or surveying property. That is fair enough.  They would have to take into account the realities of the situation as they find it.  In those circumstances I support the Bill as it was passed on Committee Stage and, therefore, I do not support amendment No. 4 as proposed by Senator Fitzsimons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was dealt with on Committee Stage.  The report of the Restrictive Practices Commission into this area generally which I adverted to on Committee Stage recommended that a restrictive practices order should be made which would prohibit building societies from charging borrowers for valuation reports, the contents of which were not made available to the borrower. What I am proposing is that the Minister would be allowed make rules regarding making valuation reports available.  I <Col N="929" /> indicated on Committee Stage that valuation reports were quite simply reports which ensured that the societies decided that their interest in the property had been adequately secured.  I indicated that in the course of making the regulations I would require that the building society in making the valuation report available to the borrower would make it clear to the borrower that the valuation report was not necessarily a full structural report and that if borrowers wished to have reports of that nature carried out that was entirely a matter for themselves.  Senator Fitzsimons could, perhaps with profit or with the avoidance of loss, read the Restrictive Practices Commission Report on this matter, particularly paragraph 5.12.  For the benefit of the Senator I will quote again what I quoted on Committee Stage where the Restrictive Practices Commission said:</P>
      <P>Recent court cases both here and in the UK would lead us to believe that even where the valuer's report had not been disclosed by the society to the borrower, the relationship between the valuer and the borrower would still be sufficiently close to raise a duty of care and to provide grounds for bringing an action for negligence against the valuer.  It seems to us, therefore, that the release of the report would not make any real difference from the legal aspect.</P>
      <P>If the Senator reflects on his comments and on that conclusion of the Restrictive Practices Commission he will realise that there appears to be, based on that report, a likelihood that a valuer does have an obligation to a borrower whether the borrower gets sight of the valuation report. The matter will be clarified through the issuing by the building society of the reminder to borrowers of the nature of the valuer's report and the purposes for which it is commissioned by the society although, of course, paid for by the borrower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to these amendments I have no problem whatsoever in the fact that they are being put forward by the Opposition having been advanced first by the <Col N="930" /> Irish Building Societies' Association.  I do not regard that as a confrontation but it is fair that the House should be clear in its mind that these amendments are those proposed by the Irish Building Societies' Association.  I find them difficult to comprehend because some of them are totally at variance with the stance taken some months ago by that association, for example, in relation to the extension of their lending powers.  The fact that they are now totally engaging in a role reversal on that matter is difficult to comprehend. I also find some of these amendments difficult to comprehend because they seem to be expressing a fear of loss of income while the other amendments would restrict the societies from gaining additional income by restricting their additional borrowing power.  Some of the amendments taken as a set are each contradictory of the purpose of the other. Consequently I find them all very difficult to understand.  I have every intention, despite what Senator O'Leary says, of making that fact clear.</P>
    <P>This Bill was prepared to ensure that a number of objectionable practices engaged in by the societies were put at an end and to allow the societies to engage in additional and new forms of lending to counterbalance that.  It is as such a package and not conceived in any confrontational or vindictive way as suggested by Senator Fitzsimons.  I want to make it clear that the amendments being put forward by the Opposition are those which were called for by the Irish Building Societies' Association and as such represent the view of the Irish Building Societies' Association.  I suggest to the House that the Bill and my comments represent the view of the general public. It is on behalf of the public that I am bringing this Bill forward.  I want to make it clear on whose behalf the amendments are being put forward.  I do not believe that is confrontational but then Senator O'Leary may have more experience than I of being confrontational.</P>

      <P>As I stated before I am very concerned with regard to the two sides &mdash; the borrower and the saver.  My contribution on Second Stage will bear that out.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator O'Leary's contribution and his reference to my responsibility in the situation where I said I did not charge any money, of course I accept that.  I was only telling about the incident in a very brief way.  I thought I was making it clear that I had a commitment, that I took steps to do the job as best I could but unfortunately did not uncover this problem.  I accept fully that that was my responsibility.</P>
      <P>With regard to the surveyor for a building society having a commitment to the borrower as well, I accept that and I think anybody would accept it.  I recall the situation in the UK &mdash; I think it was Yanni versus others &mdash; with the Halifax Building Society which identified that situation where the borrower had rights with regard to the survey.  The report of a surveyor valuing a house and making a report for a building society is very different from the survey he would carry out fro a prospective purchaser.  Having regard to all the circumstances, the report of a surveyor will be so qualified as to be practically useless to the borrower.  At the same time, while it is practically useless to the borrower, the result of this legislation will make the exercise far more costly.  A surveyor will submit a report to a building society, qualified to the extent that it is no use to the borrower and, in effect, if the borrower wants to have another report or evaluation he will have to have it done at his own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reality.  While on the surface it might appear that this will result in decreasing costs for the purchaser, in my view it will not alone increase the costs but, because of the extra indemnification needed, the additional cost of bonding <Col N="932" /> and because many surveyors would have to consider whether it is worthwhile getting indemnification for the amount of work they get you will have almost a cartel or closed shop situation where only a few surveyors will find it worth while to take out indemnification.  I remind the Minister that indemnification insurance is very costly and runs anything from £6,000 a year to £10,000 a year.  As a result fewer surveyors will be available to do reports resulting in increased costs with regard to time, travelling expenses and heavy on-costs.  At the end of the day the report will be practically useless to the purchaser.</P>

      <P>In all, seven amendments were made to the Bill.  Three of those, Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are purely formal consequential changes relating to title and citation. Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are related amendments effecting the same substantive change in the law on Dáil elections, European Assembly elections and local elections.  Amendment No. 4 stands on its own.  We are dealing, therefore, with two substantive changes.  The amendments involve two very important and essential reforms in the electoral procedure. The effect of them will be, first, to prevent the inclusion on ballot papers of the names of political organisations which are not registered in the Register of Political Parties and slogans or other references, be they political or otherwise and, secondly, to strengthen the safeguards against personation at polling stations by providing that electors may be required to produce evidence of identify. In relation to the evidence of identity the purpose of this is to ensure that as much as possible personation at polling stations is eliminated or minimised.</P>
      <P>The Seanad will have noted recent reports by a particular organisation with close connections with a subversive paramilitary organisation, that they intend to contest elections to Dáil Éireann and, if elected, to take their seats.  As democrats we must welcome this decision to get involved in the democratic process however belatedly, however reluctant and limited.  We would welcome, of course, in a warmer way, that announcement if we could be assured that that also signals the end of their campaign of violence.  We have however, had the opportunity to observe the behaviour pattern in relation to elections of this and similar organisations in Northern Ireland and to a lesser extent here also.  It is clear that the involvement of such organisations is associated with a sharp rise in electoral offences, specifically widespread, organised and determined personation, intimidation and similar offences.  We would be lacking in elementary prudence if we did not take appropriate steps to deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> Under present law, the principal safeguard against personation is the right of candidates to appoint personation agents to attend at polling stations on their behalf.  Obviously that right would be no real safeguard against the type of abuse which experience warns us to expect. Under this amendment the presiding officer may, or at the request of a personation agent, shall require any person asking for a vote to produce reasonable evidence of identity before giving him a ballot paper.</P>
    <P>The form of identification will be such as would be prescribed by way of regulations. I envisage that they would merely require that the person would be asked to produce a reasonable evidence of identity, such as a driving licence, a social welfare allowance book, credit card, Post Office savings book or the like.  That list will be amended from time to time as appropriate.  I also intend to ensure that the polling cards which will be issued to voters will draw their attention to that fact.  I do not see why any reasonable voter should feel upset at being asked to produce evidence of identification which will ensure that neither their vote nor the votes of their neighbours can be stolen through personation by persons who would have as their intention the abuse or distortion of the electoral result.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 is to provide for what can or cannot in future appear on the nomination paper and consequently on the ballot paper in the description of a candidate or the candidate's occupation.  The intention of the existing law in this regard is very clear. It envisages that what should appear on the nomination paper is the name by which a candidate is normally known, their address, their ordinary occupation and, if they are a member of a registered political party, the name of the party.  To provide an orderly way of implementing that intention, the system of registration of political parties was introduced about 25 years ago.  That system is a simple, straightforward one under which a group with aspirations to be a political party and to contest elections can secure registration without any real difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> Instead of following that straightforward path, however, some organisations and individuals have tried to show virtually how clever they are by finding ways around it.  A way has been found of frustrating the clear intention of the present law and of getting all sorts of references, whether political or otherwise, onto the ballot paper.  That is done by including names or titles either as part of the supposed name of the person involved or as part of the occupation heading.  In many cases the purpose of including that extraneous material has merely been to confuse, mislead or deceive the electorate.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to put a stop to that and to restore the situation to what is clearly the original intention of the present law.  In other words we are now making explicit what previously was implicit.  The returning officer would be required to object to a name being put forward if the name was that of an unregistered political group or the words indicated a candidate's opinion on social, political, religious or other matters; if additional words were being included merely to take up space on the ballot paper; if material was being put forward for inclusion in the supposed name of a candidate to represent that the candidate was somebody other than the person they actually were; or if the material put forward was designed to cause confusion or to damage another candidate.</P>
    <P>Senators will remember that at recent by-elections in Northern Ireland this device was resorted to by a particular organisation to put forward a number of candidates right across constituencies who purported to be known by the name of Peter Barry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Republic.  In recent weeks the media reported the intention of a person to advance their name and occupation as being identical to the name and occupation of a Cabinet Minister in the present Government with the intention of confusing or misleading the electorate and obviously causing unnecessary difficulty in any election which might be <Col N="936" /> held in that constituency.  I recall hearing some years ago of a plan being devised by a group of people, 20 of whom considered the idea of having themselves nominated in the constituency of a very prominent politician at the time by describing themselves with a name and address identical to his.  The result would have been 21 identical names on the ballot paper.  The name of the actual politician could only have been identified by the mention of the membership of his political party, which would have been included in his description.  Obviously, the Seanad will realise the amount of confusion that would have been caused for the electorate in that constituency had there been 21 names, all virtually identical, on that ballot paper.  It is important that that potential abuse or loophole should be closed off.  We all know of instances where people purported to change their name from the name by which they were commonly known sometimes to get a more advantageous place on the ballot paper as they perceived it or, on other occasions, to introduce political or social slogans into the name which they purported to be the name they were normally known by.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present the returning officer is required to object to the description of a candidate if it is, in his opinion, incorrect, insufficient to identify the candidate, or unnecessarily long.  It appears in that context that the expression &ldquo;description of a candidate&rdquo; may not include the candidate's name and, in effect, refers only to the occupation of the candidate and his address and political affiliation.  In practice, the provision has been interpreted in that way by returning officers over the years. They have taken the view that they are not required to raise any objections in relation to the supposed name of a candidate.</P>
    <P>Candidates are also required to show their occupation on nomination papers. That is shown in small characters on the ballot paper.  Again that provision has been exploited in order to get political titles or references on the ballot paper. Under paragraph (b) of amendment No. <Col N="937" /> 1 the returning officer will be required to object to a political reference included under the heading of occupation or in any part of the candidate's description. Where he so objects and the entry is not amended to his satisfaction, the returning officer will then reject the nomination. The only exception to that rule will be a reference to an elected public office which is at that time held or which was formerly held by the candidate.  Descriptions such as Dáil Deputy, Minister of the Government, county councillor, or public representative, so long as they are accurate at the time or refer to a previously held position, will be deemed to be valid.</P>
    <P>The reason these amendments have been entered is that, with the advent of that organisation with its direct connections to a subversive organisation engaging in paramilitary violence into the election field here it behoves those of us who have responsibility to ensure that abuse of the election system &mdash; and the widespread type of abuse which we have seen in Northern Ireland &mdash; is guarded against.  It is well to remember that that organisation has already publicly proclaimed as one of its objectives the overthrowing of this State and its democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>To those of us who have the responsibility to uphold those institutions and our democracy, it is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas ensure that with the arrival and the participation by that organisation in elections here the Irish electorate should have the opportunity to freely cast their vote, to ensure that their vote is not stolen by any other person or organisation and to ensure that the names and titles of candidates on the ballot paper are set out genuinely as the names by which people are normally known and that the description of occupation is true, accurate and genuine.  That is what the inclusion of these seven amendments into the Bill will bring about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the irregularities that obtain at polls and at the presentation of candidates before a <Col N="938" /> director of elections or county registrar at the time of nomination.  The Minister is availing of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1986, in order to amend other electoral Acts.  When he presented this Bill on Second Stage there was no talk of the irregularities that now obtain. The Minister is bringing these in as second thoughts on the amendment of the existing electoral Acts.  The amendment allowing people who are incapacitated or disabled to vote should be brought in under a separate Bill rather than availing of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1986, to do it.  Maybe it is a tidying up operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned organisations which he fears may be able to penetrate the electoral system.  We must legislate for any organisation that may come on stream, rather than identify any particular organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are loopholes in any Act any individual or organisation can abuse any such Act.  We should legislate for the organisations that may come on stream, that may try to bore holes in our legislation and to protect the right of the voter both at the polls and at nomination time. The Minister was correct when he said that at times of nomination organisations have used additional political names giving them an advantage over other candidates. That should be amended.  The candidate should be seen to be identified positively with the county registrar at the time of nomination.  A candidate may leave his nomination until almost closing time.  If his nomination is objected to at that time, he may not have the opportunity to renominate unless it is done on the spot before closing time.  Therefore, he would not have an opportunity to consult with his director or his legal adviser as to how he should properly nominate. In the event of a county registrar refusing a nomination he should have the option to consult with his director or his legal adviser.  He should have sufficient time to do that.  Nominations should not be closed on his return to present his amended nomination paper.  I see something in the amendments to give that opportunity to a candidate arriving very <Col N="939" /> close to the time of the closing nominations. It is a very small point, but a point that could arise.</P>
    <P>It is our duty as legislators to tease out legislation to ensure that it is foolproof and that the opportunity is given to the person going forward for election &mdash; this is something new.  Very seldom is a nomination refused.  I have not heard of many that were refused by returning officers in the past but it could arise to a much greater extent in the future because of the inclusion of the amendments before us where the returning officer has to be satisfied about the identity of the person who can be turned down on a number of counts.  He may be turned down if he is not commonly known, if he is doing something that is misleading or likely to cause confusion or if his name is unnecessarily long as stated in the amendment, or contains a political reference.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there should be an amendment to the effect that, in the event of the time of closure catching up with the candidate, he has sufficient time to renominate and to consult with his legal adviser or his director of elections.  In regard to the identity of a voter at the polls, in most rural booths nearly every voter is identified but, in the bigger cities and in the large centres where people are not commonly known by presiding officers, personating agents and polling clerks, this is a very welcome amendment.</P>
    <P>Some identification must be produced by the person who requests a vote at that polling booth.  In most cases people bring their voter's card but not in all cases and it is not necessary where the presiding officer can identify the voter.  In the bigger centres, in the absence of a voter's card as suggested in the amendment, some documentary evidence should be produced.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to lend my driving licence or my cheque book to a voter going into the polls.  A voter could produce that type of evidence.  It may not be authentic but it would enable him to vote.  There can be abuses even though <Col N="940" /> the presiding officer may look for documentation. There will be abuses in that regard because if a voter has any document in his possession to say that he is a certain person it is very difficult for the presiding officer, to whom his identity is not known, to refuse him the right to vote.  There will still be abuses in regard to applying for votes in the larger centres and I do not think there is anything we can do about it.</P>
    <P>The amendments dealing with nomination and presentation of the person at the polls are to do with the draftsman and are the only two that are controversial. The Minister, rightly or wrongly, is availing of the Electoral (Special Voters) Bill 1986, to amend the legislation under this heading.  I am surprised he did not think of it when he presented the Bill to the House.  Why did he not have it enshrined in the Bill rather than bring in amendments to the Bill afterwards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unsatisfactory that a major amendment of our electoral law should come back to the Seanad in this way and that Senators should be allowed to speak only once on it.  That is a defect in our own procedure which we have to address.  I am used to Governments introducing last minute legislation which should have been introduced at an earlier time.  No matter what Government are in power that is going to happen. It is up to this House to so organise its affairs that we are not hidebound, that major legislation like this can be brought in and Members cannot tease out what the meaning of the legislation is for the benefit of the House and the people who depend on us to perform that task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These seven amendments which are specially printed for our information have already been incorporated in the Bill.  I have no difficulty in accepting amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 some of which are fundamental and some of which are consequential.  The points made by the Minister with regard to making sure that people should be given a fair opportunity to distinguish between candidates, that ballot papers are not used to present points of view to the <Col N="941" /> electorate or to engage in propaganda are worthwhile, and I support the Minister.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with amendment No. 4 but I am worried as to how it will work in practice.  We must be impressed by the importance the Minister attaches to making sure that everybody who has a right to vote votes and somebody who is not entitled to vote is not given the benefit of someone else's vote.  In any change we make we must bear in mind the realities of the situation as it applies on the ground.  This legislation will have two effects.  I hope it will have the effect the Minister says, that is, that it will deter people from presenting themselves at polling stations pretending they are somebody else and getting votes wrongly. If it achieves that it will have achieved a lot.  Unfortunately, it may cause tremendous confusion for ordinary electors.</P>
    <P>There are problems about not having a Committee Stage debate.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;specified document&rdquo;. I know the Minister gave us a few examples.  I can only assume that a voting card is not a &ldquo;specified document,&rdquo; because if a voting card is a specified document the mere possession of a voting card would raise the person's status considerably in the eyes of the presiding officer.  I presume what is meant by a specified document is a document like a driving licence, or a social welfare insurance book which is additional to the voting card which the person would normally have going to the polling booth.</P>
    <P>If I am right in that assumption let us consider the position of a person who arrives at a polling booth who is the genuine voter and who does not have the specified document with him or her.  If nobody challenges him or her everything in the garden is rosy, but if somebody does challenge him he may not get a vote without the specified document.  There is no discretion.  Even if the presiding officer is presented with his next door neighbour he may not give the next door neighbour a vote if he does not have the specified document.  Amendment No. 4 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> ... the returning officer or the presiding officer may, and if so required on behalf of any candidate or personation agent present in the polling station at the election, shall, request any person at the time of his applying for a ballot paper, but not afterwards, to produce a specified document and, if the person fails to produce such a document, or if the returning officer or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, such person shall not be permitted to vote.</P>
    <P>On first reading of that there would appear to be an out because it would appear that the returning officer or presiding officer has a discretion but, if you read the sentence fully, you will see that they do not have a discretion because it only applies to a situation where a document is produced.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 states:</P>
    <P>...if the returning officer or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates,</P>
    <P>Before being satisfied or unsatisfied in exercising the discretion a document must be produced.  It is in assessing the value or otherwise of that document that the presiding officer can exercise discretion to give or not to give the vote.  If a person is challenged in a polling booth even though they are well known and they do not have a specified document, they may not get a vote.  To organise our elections on such an uncertain series of documents and a randomly distributed series of documents such as driving licences, social welfare insurance books and so on is in my opinion not right.</P>
    <P>Many people will present themselves at polling booths who will not have either a driving licence or a social welfare book and there will be even a greater number who will not have it in their possession. There will be a substantial number of people who will anticipate that, because they are well known in the polling booth, there will be no challenge to them.  In each and every such case if a person of <Col N="943" /> another political party wishes to cause any difficulty or problem for them, all they need do is ask the presiding officer to insist that they produce a specified document.  If they cannot produce the specified document they are not entitled to their voting paper.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this amendment will overcome the problem or will go a long way towards overcoming the problem of people falsely claiming votes.  I am also satisfied, however, that it will raise tremendous opportunities for vindictive and obstructive personation agents to raise niggling and unreasonable questions about people who come to present themselves for voting.  If the Minister wants to introduce these things we are only fooling ourselves in looking for identification at a polling booth if we do not agree with the Continental system of having identity cards.  I am not suggesting we should have identity cards but the advantage of an identity card is that everybody would have one.  These specified documents are the most uncertain things.</P>
    <P>I have a driving licence but where it is located at present I do not have an idea. I am sure it is in some drawer at home somewhere but there will be a large number of people in the same category as myself who will not bring to the polling station, particularly the first time it occurs, a specified document.  If they are challenged they may not get a vote without producing the specified document and there is no discretion on the presiding officer in that matter.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say in response to the points I have made.  While the vast majority of the amendments are useful and their objectives are very worthwhile, the detail of amendment No. 4 is one that should be carefully scrutinised by the House before agreeing to the amendments introduced by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  I do not think this is an appropriate Bill for the introduction of this type of legislation.  It is a panic reaction. We, in this House, can recall <Col N="944" /> occasions when amendments were ruled out of order because they were regarded as being outside the scope of the Bill. What the Standing Orders state is in conflict with the Bill.  This House would not have an opportunity to submit an amendment which would be regarded as suitable simply by changing the title of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Whether we are for or against the introduction of this legislation it should not be introduced in this way.  The Minister made statements with regard to suppositions and instances that could arise and he prefaced some of these with the words &ldquo;had there been&rdquo;.  Quite honestly this is not a serious issue and if the situation arose the courts would be well able to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I have no time whatever for any terrorist or subversive organisation and I am totally against any individual or any organisation who would inflict arbitrarily, or in any other way, pain on any individual.  I welcome very much, as the Minister has done political organisations accepting the democratic process.  It appears to me that it is somewhat naïve to think that because certain information was given on the ballot paper voters would register their choice in a particular way.  It seems to suggest that we should keep this information from them because if they got it they would vote differently.  I do not accept that.  Voters are sophisticated. They know exactly what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding names that are unnecessarily long, that point might be developed further.  When I was christened it was only thought worthwhile to give me one appellation but one is sufficient for anyone.  There are many people with a litany of Christian names and there are people with double-barrelled names. When girls get married now the tendency is, in many cases to retain their maiden name.  I could envisage a situation where a member of a family with a double-barrelled name would marry somebody from another family with a double barrelled name.  We could suppose, as the Minister has supposed in so many instances, that somebody in those circumstances would have a reasonably or <Col N="945" /> maybe an unreasonably long name.  What would be the position then because the names clearly would not be introduced for any ulterior motive?  Finally I ask the Minister if this legislation will apply to individuals who have used this means in the past?  I suppose it will not because it would be unfair to people who, in the past, for political reasons, or whatever, used this device quite legally and quite properly.  There was no sinister or ulterior motive and I sincerely hope those individuals will not be victimised by this legislation. It would be unreasonable if they were and I hope the Minister will confirm that such is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked why these provisions were not included in the original Bill which was before the Seanad.  The fact of the matter is that this Bill was prepared as a Bill specifically to provide for special voting facilities for the disabled and for diplomats and their spouses posted abroad.  Separately, as I think I mentioned to the House in the course of either my introduction of the Bill or my reply to Second Stage, I have been working on the preparation of a general electoral Bill to deal with a number of improvements in the procedures relating to elections.  It had been intended that some of these matters might have been comprehended in that separate legislation.  With the announcement by that organisation with its direct connections with subversive paramilitary groups of their intention to contest elections here, combined with their previously stated intention or aspiration to overthrow this State and its democratic institutions, it was felt that the earliest possible opportunity should be taken to insert in the legislation basic steps which would make it more difficult for the type of abuses which we have seen occur in elections in Northern Ireland in recent years, elections in which this organisation has participated, to be built into the electoral procedures.  All of us, as democrats, have to welcome the announcement by that organisation that they are now prepared to put themselves to the test of the democratic process but it would be remiss <Col N="946" /> of any of us who have a responsibility not to recognise that in the elections in which that organisation have participated in Northern Ireland in recent years, widespread abuse of the election procedures and widespread personation and intimidation of voters have occurred.</P>
      <P>It was felt that it was right that the first available opportunity should be taken to prevent an occurrence of the practice which we saw on the part of another organisation in Northern Ireland earlier this year.  Candidates purported to change their name and to adopt the name of the next Minister who is to bring legislation into the House on the completion of this business.  All of us also know of instances where candidates have decided to build slogans for goals, ideals or campaigns whether worthwhile or draft, into their names and represent that this is the name by which they are commonly known.</P>
      <P>The law in relation to change of names and deed polls generally is less than clear, to put it mildly.  It seems that any person may change his or her name at any time merely by the practice of doing just that, and the making of a deed poll affidavit is merely to indicate their intention of so doing.  Senators with practical political experience will recall various instances from time to time of potential candidates deciding to change the name by which they had been known all their life for particular purposes.  On a different note I do not think it is right that people with the oddest of ideas can decide to incorporate those odd ideas or titles supposedly into their name and that the returning officer has no way of dealing with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On another basis, considering the amount of publicity that is normally afforded to people who engage in that sort of practice whilst standing for election, it would be a relatively cheap method of publicity for somebody who wished to advance their own business or commercial enterprise in a constituency to incorporate the name of that commercial enterprise into what is supposedly the name by which they <Col N="947" /> themselves are known or, indeed, into the occupation which is supposed to be set out in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that the law &mdash; assuming that candidates would be genuine &mdash; set out to provided for a system whereby Martin J. O'Toole appeared on the ballot paper if he wished to stand as Martin J. O'Toole and that his occupation, by which he would most commonly be known or identified, would be inserted in the ballot paper, presumably as a Senator or a member of the county council or whatever.  We have to guard against a situation where, for example, anybody else in County Mayo who might decide that he could embarrass Martin J. O'Toole or confuse the electorate can, as things stand, prior to the passing of this amendment to this legislation, nominate himself as Martin J. O'Toole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the court not prevent that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Were that to occur, in the case of a general election, the Dáil at the time will have been dissolved and while the courts might be able to make certain interpretations, they would almost certainly conclude that what was needed was an amendment of the law.  That amendment could not occur because one of the Houses of the Oireachtas would have been dissolved at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt necessary that this amendment and the other amendment should be incorporated.  Quite frankly, the reason I did not advert to the possibility of these amendments at the time when the Bill was being discussed here in the Seanad is that on the last occasion when we debated Committee Stage and other Stages of the Bill, I was waiting for the conclusion of that debate to go to a meeting of the Cabinet where these amendments were agreed to.  Until that agreement of the Government had been given, it would have been wrong of me to indicate to the House that there was an expectation that these amendments might be introduced. It was quite simply for that reason that <Col N="948" /> the procedure is taking place in this way. I would like to apologise to Senators if they feel in any way upset.  It certainly was not intentional.  It was the circumstances as to how the particular timings evolved.</P>
    <P>I have a considerable amount of work done in relation to the preparation of a general Bill to reform electoral procedures. I referred to that when this Bill was first being discussed in the House. Those proposals are before the Government. I hope it may be possible &mdash; if there is early agreement at Government level on them &mdash; to have that Bill drafted and presented to this House and to the Dáil during the first session of those Houses in 1987.</P>
    <P>Senator M. O'Toole queried the nomination. He referred, in particular, to a point which I had given some attention to, that is, where a candidate might nominate within the last hour before the closing of nominations.  As the law stands, the returning officer is obliged to rule on the nominations within a fixed period of time.  It is not intended that there should be any change in these provisions.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that we are endeavouring to deal with people who are seeking to use or manipulate law for a purpose for which it was not intended. If a person is deciding to try to build some other title or description into their name or a description of their occupation, they realise that because of the enactment of this amendment, they are likely to have tested or queried by the returning officer. It certainly behoves them to make that nomination within a period which allows a reasonable length of time, prior to the close of nomination lest any dispute arises.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary asked how amendment No. 4 would work in practice.  As the House will know, the presiding officer present already has statutory powers to ask the elector certain statutory questions with a view to establishing the elector's identity and may also administer the prescribed oath.  If the presiding officer is still dissatisfied he may ask the question and he may put the oath at his own discretion and must do so at the request of <Col N="949" /> an agent.  This new procedure which is set out in amendment No. 4 will then be in addition to these provisions.</P>
    <P>The documents of which I gave examples are not a comprehensive list of those which it is intended will be prescribed. The intention is to clearly see that the prescribed documents will be of such a nature as to assume that most people would be carrying on his person one or more of these documents.  In addition to that, as I explained at the outset when introducing these amendments, the intention is that on the polling card which would be issued to voters at the time of an election, notice would be given to them of the requirement that evidence in the following manner may be required from them.  I would also hope that it would be possible to advertise that fact in the media so that people will realise that they will need to carry some reasonable identification with them.</P>
    <P>I understand that Senator O'Leary may be at a loss to know which drawer in his house his driving licence is in.  I have been engaged in the same pursuit myself for the past week.  I suspect he probably knows where his credit card and his cheque book are.  Those are the sort of things which perhaps in the case of the Senator he would not find particularly onerous to have to produce.  I do not think there is a range of documentation now which, if approached fairly, will ensure that any genuine voter will have no difficulty in satisfying the presiding officer that that voter is the person in question.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the point that, if he wants to have somebody personate in his name and give him his driving licence, it would be difficult for the presiding officer to deem otherwise.  The main purpose of these amendments is to guard against widespread and organised personation of the type which we have heard takes place in Northern Ireland and, to some extent, in this country when some of these organisations have been involved in recent years.  The personation practice is normally organised through the collection and the distribution of polling cards to the personators.  In answer <Col N="950" /> to Senator O'Leary's question, production of a polling card will not be regarded as satisfactory evidence of identification.</P>
    <P>To be able to organise widespread personation through collection and distribution of polling cards, together with the collection of these documents from the people involved, would assume widespread compliance by genuine voters in allowing other groups to usurp their right to vote.  I do not think that will be the case.  That would seem to indicate that the voter had an intention or a disposition to vote for that particular group or party. That being the case, I think the voter would be prepared to go to the polling booth and cast the vote on behalf of that party.  What we are endeavouring to protect against here is where people represent themselves to be voters, other than they actually are, or people represent themselves to be voters who are away on holidays, in hospital or whom they know will not attend at the polling station until later in the day.  All of us practical politicians here in the House have heard numerous examples of how these matters may be organised.</P>
    <P>Essentially what we want to protect against is the example, which so graphically illustrated for us how simply it can be done, of seeing a series of candidates being put forward in Northern Ireland all in the name of Peter Barry.  In a particular constituency a series of candidates could be put forward all in the name of Martin J. O'Toole.  For example, the Senator will know how difficult it is to achieve election to Dáil Éireann.  I invite him to consider how much more difficult it might be if there were 20 other Martin J. O'Tooles standing along with him in the same constituency.  It would perhaps simplify the electoral procedure for him, because he would spend the entire three weeks trying to explain to the electorate which of the 21 Martin J. O'Tooles was the real candidate.  Those are the sort of things which could create chaos in an election and at a time when it would be too late to guard against them.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is good that an organisation such as I referred to are now putting <Col N="951" /> themselves to the test of the democratic process.  It is important that those of us who are the guardians of it ensure that they are not allowed to abuse that process in their committed aim of subverting the institutions of the State in the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As is set out, the intention is that names should not be unnecessarily long and should not mislead the electorate. There have been persons whose names have seemed to accrete over the years.  It would be reasonable, for example that candidates who describe themselves with a single christian name might be allowed to have double-barrelled surnames.  Candidates who wished to nominate themselves with two christian names would be unlikely to be known also by two surnames, so that it would be reasonable to assume that the combination of christian and surnames ought to be at a maximum of about three.  All of us know that in certain parts of the country many people are known by two christian names and a certain minority of the public have two surnames.  The sort of person who is normally known by two surnames is usually not the sort of person who is described with two christian names.</P>

If the name, however, is the name by which the candidate was genuinely, commonly known in the past, there is no reason to assume that the returning <Col N="952" /> officer would not accept a genuine name which was in ordinary everyday usage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend the Second Stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1986, to the Seanad.  The Bill has two operative sections.  Section 1 will make certain provisions of the Single European Act part of domestic law.  The provisions are those which amend the existing Community Treaties which are already part of domestic law.  Section 2 of the Bill provides that references to the &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; of the European Communities in any earlier Act or statutory instrument shall be construed as references to the European Parliament. This is required because the Single European Act provides, in effect, that the European Parliament be formally described as the Parliament rather than the Assembly as provided for in the basic treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Title III of the Single European Act deals with European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy.  The provisions of Title III do not amend the Community Treaties.  They do not, therefore, require to be made part of domestic law and are not covered by the Bill.  Title III is, however, one of the subjects of a motion <Col N="953" /> in the name of the Leader of the Seanad Senator Dooge, and Senator Michael Ferris, which the House will debate in the course of its consideration of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The motion before the Seanad, in addition to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1986, will permit the Seanad to reaffirm Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances and to note with satisfaction that the provisions of Title III of the Single European Act relating to the co-operation of the Twelve on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer co-ordination of their positions in this area do not affect our position of neutrality outside military alliances.  Furthermore, the motion will give the Seanad an opportunity to note and welcome the provisions of the Single European Act on Economic and Social Cohesion which enhance and strengthen the commitment of the Community to the achievement of the objectives of Protocol No. 30 on Ireland appended to our Treaty of Accession.</P>
    <P>The House also has before it a motion in the name of the Leader of the House Senator Dooge and of Senator Ferris to take note of report No. 34 of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which deals with the Single European Act.  I propose to comment on these motions in the course of my remarks.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act has been the subject of extensive public debate &mdash; a debate which the Government have welcomed and encouraged.  It is right that the modest but worthwhile step forward by the Community represented by the Single European Act should be the subject of such debate.  The Single European Act does provide the opportunity to assess our position and experience as a member of the Community 14 years after we joined.  This is to be welcomed as I feel that we have to a certain degree taken our membership too much for granted.  I have no doubt whatsoever, and I am sure that this House will wholeheartedly agree, that the emphatic support for membership by the Irish people in 1972 has been amply justified by our <Col N="954" /> experience to date.  I welcome the contribution of the Oireachtas Joint Committee to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Government's Explanatory Guide to the Single European Act sets out the background to the negotiations which led to the signature of the Single European Act and explains the contents of the Act and the implications of its provisions for Ireland.  Nevertheless, it would, I feel, be appropriate for me to begin my remarks with a brief review of the background to the Single European Act and an explanation of its contents.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is the culmination of a series of efforts in more recent years aimed at the relaunching of the Community in the direction of closer and strengthened integration.  The Solemn Declaration on European Union, which was adopted by the Stuttgart European Council in June 1983, was the first limited step in this direction.  In February 1984 the European Parliament adopted the Draft Treaty on European Union &mdash; the &ldquo;Spinelli Treaty&rdquo;.  The Parliament's initiative gave an added urgency to the efforts of the member states and greatly contributed to focusing attention on the need for a relaunching of the Community. The Fontainebleau European Council in June 1984 decided to set up the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs which had as its mandate to make suggestions for the improvement of the operation of European co-operation in both the Community and European political co-operation fields.  This committee, established under the Irish Presidency, had as its chairman the Leader of this House, Senator James Dooge.</P>
    <P>The report of the Dooge Committee was the principal basis for discussion at the Milan European Council in June 1985 at which it was decided to convene the Intergovernmental Conference which negotiated the Single European Act.  This conference was formally convened on 23 July 1985 and its work was completed with the signature of the Single European Act by the member states in February 1986.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act amends the <Col N="955" /> Treaties establishing the European Communities and contains provisions on European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy.  These two elements, which were negotiated separately and are, in fact, distinct are brought together in one treaty &mdash; hence the title of Single European Act.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Community Treaties still fall under nine headings.  I would refer Senators to chapter two of the Explanatory Guide to the Single European Act which deals in some detail with the Single European Act's provisions under these nine headings.  In summary, the Single European Act contains provisions to facilitate and expedite the completion of the internal market.  A new chapter is incorporated into the EC Treaty on economic and social cohesion. In order to improve the functioning of the Community institutions the Act includes provisions on the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Court of Justice.  It adds a new chapter to the EC Treaty providing for co-operation in economic and monetary policy.  It incorporates into the EC Treaty specific provisions dealing with research and technological development, the natural environment and the working environment.</P>
    <P>In a separate title, Title III, the Single European Act contains provisions on European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy.  This is dealt with in chapter three of the Explanatory Guide.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act must be seen, as I have said, as a modest but worthwhile achievement by the Community. It has disappointed the advocates of a rapid and more substantial advance towards European Union.  It does not, as critics have maintained, alter the basic objectives of the Treaties we accepted when we joined the Community in 1973. On the contrary, it aims at enabling the Community better to achieve those basic objectives by dealing with some of the inadequacies which have emerged in the operation of the Treaties.  Thus the critics of the Single European Act in Ireland <Col N="956" /> who see it as undermining our Constitution, as a threat to our independent foreign policy, or as a threat to our economic interests are raising fears which have no foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>The Government have always been open in expressing their positive views on the need for the kind of qualitative improvement which the Single European Act will bring to the Community.  We have made this clear both during the negotiations which led to the signature of the Single European Act and since the Act was signed.  The Government have sought to inform the public debate on the Single European Act and the debate which has taken place has been very welcome. There have been very useful contributions from various sources.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation have produced an extensive analysis of the Single European Act which is before the Seanad today</P>
    <P>On the whole, I feel that the debate which has taken place, has enabled us to reassess our Community membership and on the basis of that assessment, to reaffirm our commitment to Europe.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the specific concerns which have been expressed about the Single European Act.  In doing so I hope to lay to rest such concerns. Many of these concerns are, in fact, dealt with in chapter four of the Government's Explanatory Guide.  Nevertheless further examination of the issues which they raise, will be worthwhile if I can convince those who have genuine doubts that these doubts are not in fact, justified.  A number of the points which I will cover were raised in report No. 34 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation.</P>
    <P>Before we joined the Community in 1973, many people were concerned that membership would involve a diminution of national sovereignty.  This concern has been voiced again in connection with the Single European Act.  It was pointed out in the 1972 White Paper, on the terms of accession, that the powers which we would share with our Community partners would be enhanced rather than diminished by the co-operation which <Col N="957" /> membership involves.  The people accepted this in 1972.  The Single European Act does not change the position.</P>
    <P>The question of the constitutionality of the Single European Act has been raised on a number of occasions.  The Government are satisfied that the amendments to the European Community Treaties contained in the Single European Act do not require an amendment of the Constitution. The amendments of the European Community Treaties are limited in nature.  They do not involve major institutional changes.  They are directed to giving a new impetus in areas already comprehended by the Treaties.</P>
    <P>The Community Treaties expressly envisage the possibility that they may be amended, for example, in the case of the EC Treaty through the provisions of Article 236, and they establish procedures for that purpose.  The Treaties have been amended on a number of occasions since we joined the Community.  They were amended, for example, to permit the accession of Greece, Spain and Portugal. They were amended to permit Greenland to leave the Community.  In 1975 they were amended to provide for an increase in the budgetary powers of the European Parliament.  On each of these occasions the Government of the day came to the Oireachtas with legislation to ratify the amendments and to make them part of domestic law.  We are following the same procedures with the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the Third Amendment of the Constitution, the State is constitutionally entitled to play its full part in the operation of the Community Treaties. This includes the provisions of those Treaties which permit their amendment by common agreement of the member states.  For this purpose the Government are empowered to negotiate and agree to amendments of the kind involved in the Single European Act.  The Government is then empowered to present the appropriate legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Dáil and Seanad are empowered to enact it.  When the process has been completed the Government are empowered, on behalf of the State, to <Col N="958" /> ratify the amending Treaty.  It is on this basis that the Government have submitted the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1986.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the Third Amendment to the Constitution does not empower this country to ratify the Single European Act.  This is an argument on which I have already had reason to comment and I would like to do so again in order to allay the concerns which have been expressed.</P>
    <P>The considered view of the Government is that the State, by virtue of the Third Amendment, has authority to agree to amendments of the Treaties which remain within the scope, both as regards subject matter and as regards the nature and functions of the Community institutions, of the Treaties as they were were when we joined the Communities in 1973.  When ratified pursuant to this authority, compliance with these amending Treaties becomes necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that this view of the Third Amendment duly recognises and accepts that the State is a member of the European Communities and that this allows for limited amendments from time to time of the Treaties establishing these Communities without the necessity on each occasion for a further referendum.  This view does not open up a possibility of unlimited Treaty amendments going beyond what was envisaged by the Treaties as they stood in 1973.  In this regard it is important to remember that the Third Amendment consists of two sentences: the first sentence provides that the State may become a member of the Communities.  This provision did not lapse when we joined the Communities.  It has a continuing legal and constitutional significance no less than the second sentence which refers to matters necessitated by the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act contains amendments of the Treaties which, though important, remain within the limits to which I have referred.  I will mention, in particular, three aspects of <Col N="959" /> the Single European Act: qualified majority voting, the position of the Parliament and of the Commission and the new court to be attached to the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>As regards qualified majority voting, this is already the usual rule under the existing Treaties.  It applies, to give just one example, in the agricultural sphere. The extension of that rule to areas for which unanimity is now required, particularly in the sphere of the internal market, is subject to safeguards, particularly those now contained in Article 36 of the EC Treaty, for the important interest of member states.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the European Parliament gains no direct legislative power from the Single European Act.  The implementing powers of the Commission are not being extended beyond those already provided for in the Treaties.  In the case of the Commission, all that is involved is to provide a more regular and systematic basis for doing what is already provided for and the Council, whenever it sees fit, may decide not to confer such powers on the Commission.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the court to be attached to the Court of Justice, which is provided for in Articles 4, 11 and 26 of the Single European Act, will be a tribunal inferior to and attached to the present Court of Justice.  The only reason that it is not being made part of the Court of Justice itself is that there will be appeals on questions of law from the new court to the Court of Justice.  The references in articles 4, 11 and 26 of the Single European Act to &ldquo;certain classes of action or proceedings brought by natural or legal persons&rdquo; does not open up the possibility that jurisdiction in actions or proceedings currently reserved to the national courts could be taken from them and transferred to the new tribunal.  The purpose of the new court is not to make inroads into the current jurisdiction of national courts but to improve the efficiency with which the function of judicial review and control is presently exercised under the Treaties. Moreover, it should be noted that the new court, and its jurisdiction can only <Col N="960" /> be established by the unanimous decision of the Council.</P>
    <P>I have gone into the constitutional question in some detail because of its importance and because genuine concerns have been expressed on this point. It is a question to which the Government have given most careful consideration.  I would emphasise that the Government are satisfied that a constitutional amendment is not required to permit this country to ratify the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>Another criticism which has been made of the Single European Act is that it would somehow remove or weaken this country's ability to maintain and establish its own national provisions in the area of public morality.  This criticism has focused on the areas of protection of the life of the unborn and on divorce.  I should make one point very clear.  The Community has not and does not seek any powers in the area of public morality. The existing Treaties do not give the Community competence in the area of public morality.  The Single European Act will not change that situation.</P>
    <P>The concerns expressed on the subject of public morality with regard to the Single European Act stem from two aspects of the Act.  The first of these is the reference to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, that is, the European Convention on Human Rights, in the Preamble to the Single European Act.  The second is the reference in Article 18 of the Single European Act incorporating a new Article 100a into the EC Treaty, to the major needs referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty.  These grounds include public morality, public policy or public security and the protection of health and life of humans, animals and plants.</P>
    <P>The reference to the European Convention on Human Rights in the Preamble to the Single European Act is there at the request of a number of member states who wished to give recognition to a convention to which all member states are party.  Let me say straight away that <Col N="961" /> the Single European Act does not authorise the Court of Justice of the Communities to interpret or apply the convention notwithstanding the reference to that convention in the preamble.</P>
    <P>This follows from Articles 31 and 32 of the Single European Act.  Article 31 provides that the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Communities under the European Community Treaties shall apply, pursuant to the provisions of the Single European Act, only to the provisions of Title II which contain the amendments of the European Community Treaties and to Article 32 of the Single European Act.  Article 32 provides that subject to Article 3(1), to Title II and to Article 31 just referred to, all of which concern the European Community Treaties and nothing else, nothing in the Single European Act shall affect the treaties establishing the European Communities or any subsequent treaties and acts modifying or supplementing them. These two provisions taken together have the following effect: First, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice remains confined to the European Community Treaties; secondly, the statements in the preamble including that on the European Convention on Human Rights do not affect the European Community Treaties, and accordingly the contents of that convention are not, by virtue of the preamble, in any way imported into those Treaties.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to fears which have been expressed that the implementation of provisions providing for the completion of the internal market could affect our right to make our own decisions in the area of public morality.  We do not have any fears that the Community would seek to undermine our national provisions in this area.  However, partly in anticipation of the concerns which have been expressed on this point, we decided in the negotiations to press for the inclusion of provisions which would further protect exclusive national competences in this area.  These provisions are contained in paragraph 4 of Article 100A which will be incorporated into the <Col N="962" /> EC Treaty by the Single European Act. These provisions ensure that a member state may apply national provisions on grounds referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty including on the grounds of public morality.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed about the effect of the extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers to a number of areas by the Single European Act.  The extension of majority voting is in our interest.  The main area affected by the extension of majority voting is the completion of the free trading market in the Community.  Majority voting is the rule rather than the exception under the treaties at present.  Decisions in areas of vital importance to Ireland are already taken by majority voting.  For example, the annual community budget is established by majority vote and major decisions in the agriculture area are also taken by majority vote.  We have succeeded in fully protecting and indeed successfully promoting our interests in key sectors of Community policy in which this type of voting already applies.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the extension of majority voting by the Single European Act will leave us isolated with three votes out of 76 at the Council table. This would infer that we always have been, and always will be, isolated in our own particular concerns on every issue which before the Council.  Moreover, it ignores the fact that in the vast majority of cases our interest lies in decisions being reached by the Community rather than in obstructing such decisions.  Our interest is, in fact, that the Community should be equipped with effective decision making mechanisms.  Furthermore, there will always be other member states who share our particular concerns and in alliance with whom we will be able to ensure that those concerns are met apart from the most exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>In such exceptional cases the veto will continue to apply.  We remain free to invoke it, like other member states, where an important national interest is involved both in areas where majority voting applies already under the existing <Col N="963" /> treaties and in the areas to which qualified majority voting is being extended by the Single European Act.  The veto is not undermined by the Single European Act and was not an issue in the negotiations. I might refer to remarks made by the French Foreign Minister in the debate in the French National Assembly on the Single European Act on 20 November. M. Raimond assured Deputies, as I wish to assure Senators today, that in fields where the qualified majority rule applies, the Luxembourg Compromise of January 1966 remains fully applicable.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government are very conscious of the difficulties which tax harmonisation could cause for this country.  That is why we insisted that Council decisions in this area should continue to be subject to unanimity.  While the Community may consider steps to harmonise taxation, as it already does under the treaties as they stand, there can be no question of progress unless this country's interests and concerns are accommodated.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee expressed fears on this point both in their report on the Single European Act and in their report on the completion of the internal market.  I would like to reassure the Seanad that the Government have protected our interests in this area by insisting on the retention of the unanimity requirement.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I would refer to statements which the Taoiseach has made, at the Luxembourg European Council, at which much of the substance of the Single European Act was agreed, and again at The Hague European Council, where he outlined Ireland's position on tax harmonisation. Similar statements have been made by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, at the Finance Council and I have also made many statements on the subject.  I hope those who are concerned about the effects of tax harmonisation will now accept that our partners are well aware of our position and that, because of the unanimity requirement, any progress in this area will have to take full account of Ireland's concerns.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed about the <Col N="964" /> powers conferred on the Commission by the Single European Act to implement Council decisions.  Again the joint committee referred to this point, especially in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Under existing treaty provisions the Council of Minister already confers extensive powers on the Commission to implement basic decisions taken by the Council, including very significant powers in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The new provisions do not confer new powers on the Commission but offer scope for streamlining the Commission's implementing powers by providing a more systematic basis for conferring such powers in the future. This, however, will be subject to continued safeguards for the interests of the member states.  These safeguards involve: first, the Council's continued right to impose requirements in respect of the exercise of implementing powers by the Commission; secondly, the Council's continued right in specific cases to exercise certain implementing powers itself; and thirdly, the requirement that, in future, procedures for conferring powers on the Commission must conform to certain principles and rules to be agreed unanimously in advance by the Council.</P>
    <P>The Commission, in full discharge of the role prescribed for it in the EC Treaty, has a key position in the defence of the interests of the Community as a whole.  This role is particularly important in so far as the interests of the smaller member states are concerned.  Moreover, as is clearly set out in the Government's Explanatory Guide, the exercise of management and implementing powers by the Commission can be beneficial to member states such as Ireland with major agricultural interests.</P>
    <P>Many of the concerns expressed in relation to the Single European Act have focused on the provisions on co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy.  In large part, these concerns have dwelt on fears that the Single European Act will erode our neutrality and our independence in foreign policy matters.  We <Col N="965" /> have heard, too, the assertion that foreign policy co-operation has no place in what critics of the Single European Act mistakenly claim is a purely economic community.  The political implications of Ireland's membership of the European Community have been both understood and accepted by every Irish Government over the past quarter of a century &mdash; since 1962 when membership of the European Community first became a genuine option for this country.  The then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, addressing the Foreign Ministers of the original Six in 1962, emphasised &ldquo;that the political aims of the Community are aims to which the Irish Government and people are ready to subscribe and in the realisation of which they wish to take an active part&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This commitment was no less apparent in 1972 when a subsequent Irish Government stated in chapter eight of their White Paper on Ireland's Accession to the European Communities: &ldquo;As a member of the Community, we shall participate fully in the work of shaping its future political development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the means by which the Community decided to make practical progress in the political as distinct from the economic sphere of European integration was through the process known as European Political Co-operation &mdash; the Community's co-operation on foreign policy matters.  This process was initiated in 1970.  We were consulted about the development of EPC before joining the Community and have been involved in it directly since we joined in 1973.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, fail to see why the European Community's political dimension has apparently come as a surprise to some of those who are opposed to the Single European Act.  For my own part, I intend to ensure that Ireland makes the fullest possible contribution within the European Community &mdash; the grouping of western European democratic states which the Irish people decided overwhelmingly to join in full consciousness of all that was involved.</P>
    <P>As to the claim that the foreign policy provisions of the Single European Act <Col N="966" /> will undercut our ability to take independent foreign policy decisions, this is not sustainable if one looks at the terms of the foreign policy provisions themselves. I have stated repeatedly that the principal effect of these provisions will be to formalise the existing practices and procedures of EPC, as they have evolved over the years with our full participation and agreement.  From 1973 onwards, we participated in this process without damage to our independence in foreign policy matters.  We will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The essential characteristic of EPC will remain the joint endeavour of the partners to formulate and implement a European foreign policy by informing and consulting each other on foreign policy matters of general interest, by co-ordinating their positions and by taking joint action.  Our undertakings under the Single European Act, which are quite specific, go no further than to endeavour to achieve common positions and common actions on the basis of consensus. We cannot be forced into a position of the Twelve against our will: there is no voting, majority or otherwise, in EPC.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act poses no threat to our neutrality.  Our neutral position outside military alliances has been fully accommodated by our partners and Article 30.6 confirms that the scope of discussions on security in EPC will continue to be limited to the political and economic aspects of security.  As a corollary of this provision, and for the first time ever, our position is further protected by the provision that nothing in the Single European Act shall impede those states who wish to co-operate more closely on security questions, that is, on military and defence questions, from doing so within the Western European Union or NATO.  We are not a member of either of these organisations and we have no intention of joining them. Ireland will, therefore, neither be involved in nor committed to any co-operation that takes place in those organisations.</P>
    <P>The viewpoint has been advanced in <Col N="967" /> the joint committee's report on the Single European Act that the clear limitation of the scope of EPC to the political and economic aspects of security in some way conveys an agreement in principle on our part to defence co-operation in the future.  It was at Ireland's insistence that the scope of co-operation was limited to the political and economic aspects of security and it is straining interpretation beyond all reasonable measure to see in this provision an implication of a commitment going further than this.  There is no such commitment.</P>
    <P>Misgivings have been expressed about the provision of the Single European Act which speaks of maintaining the technological and industrial conditions necessary for security.  I wish to set the record straight in this matter.  The clause in question is not shorthand for associating Ireland with the weapons procurement of our partners, nor is it code for acquiescence in the operation of the Sellafield reprocessing plant.  The reality is much more straightforward.</P>
    <P>Security is a broad concept and the level of technological development of Europe compared to, say, the US or Japan is a legitimate long term concern which is of direct relevance to the economic and industrial security of this country. Article 30.6(b) of the Single European Act falls under the general heading of the economic aspects of security which the Single European Act specifies as the appropriate scope of Twelve co-operation.  It reflects the growing realisation by Europeans, manifested for instance in the EUREKA project in which neutral countries such as Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland also participate, that we in Europe must face up to the technological and industrial challenges we face internationally, from the United States, from Japan and from the other emerging economic powers of the Pacific area.</P>
    <P>Ireland is nationally concerned with ensuring the conditions for its economic security; it is equally legitimate for us to share in a joint concern for the economic security of the Twelve.  Contrary to <Col N="968" /> claims that have been made, the Single European Act, in Article 30.6(b) or in any other provision of Title III for that matter, cannot oblige Ireland to co-operate in the production of weapons, nor can it restrict our ability to speak out on these issues which concern us.  We shall continue to make decisions nationally in relation to our security.  Any measures that we take in co-operation with our partners will be situated entirely within the framework of the Community and hence within the economic aspects of security.</P>
    <P>Our neutral position, therefore, is totally unaffected by the terms of the Single European Act.  Dáil Eireann has already recognised that this is so by approving a motion reaffirming Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances and noting that this position is unaffected by the Single European Act.  I urge the Seanad to adopt the similar motion put forward by Senator Dooge which, I am convinced, meets fully the concerns expressed in the joint committee's report.</P>
    <P>Ireland's involvement in EPC in general, and its formalisation in the Single European Act in particular, is clearly in the interests of this country.  Our involvement in EPC, far from acting as a constraint on our independence in foreign policy, has afforded us the opportunity to work with our European partners, with whom we share basic ideals, to promote, to a greater extent than we could have done in isolation, our aims and priorities. The claim has been made that co-operation with our European partners somehow weakens our own positions on a range of international issues.  I have not seen one shred of evidence to support this claim.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the progressive elaboration of constructive common positions of the Twelve on the major international issues has led to a situation in which the Twelve have become an increasingly respected and influential entity in world affairs.  The Community, through its collective weight in the world, has a great deal to contribute to the search for peace, security, reconciliation and the rule of <Col N="969" /> law in international affairs.  That weight has been brought to bear in a positive and constructive fashion in the crises facing the Middle East, Central America, Southern Africa and Asia, to name but a few.  In a number of instances, the position of the Twelve has, as a result of the operation of the EPC process, been brought closer to the position with which Ireland started out.  It is in our interest, the interests of the Community and the interests of the wider world to continue to play a full part in this enterprise.</P>
    <P>I note that the joint committee stated in their report that they would have preferred to see the foreign policy provisions of the Single European Act fully separated from the rest of the Single European Act.  I cannot agree.  To have separated the foreign policy provisions from the Single European Act would have divorced foreign policy co-operation from its essential and original rationale: the achievement of progress towards European Union.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is the incorporation of foreign policy provisions under the umbrella of the Single European Act in such a way that EPC remains legally distinct and separate from the Community Treaties, with its own rules and practices.  This is clearly in our interests and reflects our view that the economic and political elements of European integration are interdependent and form part of the same dynamic of European construction; and our view that progress towards European Union, to be successful, must be realistic, balanced and coherent.</P>
    <P>The balance, in our view, consists in the realisation that progress in the area of political co-operation should be fully based on a growing community of interests between the member states in the economic and social areas.  The Single European Act strikes that balance.  On the one hand, Title III accurately represents the appropriate limit to political co-operation at this stage of the Community's development and, moreover, sets those limits out in a juridically clear fashion.  On the other, Title III, by being brought under the umbrella of the Single <Col N="970" /> European Act, gives expression to the interdependent nature of political and economic progress towards European Union.</P>
    <P>So far in my statement I have dealt with the concerns which have been expressed about the Single European Act.  I would now like to take up a more positive theme.  I would like to consider how the Single European Act will improve the operation of the Community and how it will be to the benefit of this country. Senators have before them, as I have mentioned, a motion in the name of the Leader of the House concerning Title III of the Single European Act which I have already dealt with in some detail, and the provisions of the Single European Act on Economic and Social Cohesion on which I will not comment.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a new chapter on economic and social cohesion in the EC Treaty is one of the most significant aspects of the Single European Act.  Since we joined the Community we have received very substantial transfers from the regional, social and agriculture guidance funds. These transfers have made a vital contribution to our development programmes and to the development of our economy.  They have enabled us to embark on infrastructural projects which are essential to our economy, to train our young people for employment and to develop our food industry.</P>
    <P>However, significant though their impact has been, the serious economic disparities which exist between the peripheral regions in the Community, including Ireland, and the central regions have not narrowed appreciably since we joined in 1973.  The report of the joint committee correctly identifies this failure of Community policies.  Thus in approaching the negotiations on the Single European Act which is designed to chart the way forward for the Community in the years ahead, the Government felt it was essential that the Community's commitment to economic and social cohesion would have to be enhanced and strengthened.</P>
    <P>At the intergovernmental conference which negotiated the Single European <Col N="971" /> Act, we took a lead in pressing for the inclusion of provisions on cohesion.  Our views are extensively reflected in Article 23 of the Single European Act.  This article contains provisions which will oblige the Community to bring about progress on reducing regional disparities.  It will reinforce the Community's existing commitment to Ireland's development which was recognised in Protocol 30 of the Treaty of Accession.</P>
    <P>Protocol 30 has played a very important part in protecting our interests in the Community since accession.  It has allowed us, for example, to maintain our investment incentives at a level which continues to make Ireland a most attractive base for international mobile investment. It has played its part in reinforcing the Community's commitment to the development of the Irish economy, for example, through the structural funds. The cohesion chapter of the Single European Act will ensure that the objectives of Protocol 30 continue to be a priority for the Community by recognising that the aim of economic and social cohesion is one which is central to the development of the Community in the future.</P>
    <P>Among the major considerations which led to the negotiation of the Single European Act was the growing and increasingly urgent recognition that the Community was failing to keep pace with its major trading rivals.  The provisions in the Single European Act on the completion of the internal market will enable the Community to compete more effectively and to derive full benefit from its larger market.</P>
    <P>The years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 were the boom years for the European Community.  Visible barriers to trade were removed and rates of growth were achieved which far exceeded those achieved even during the industrial revolution of the 19th Century. By the mid-seventies, however, this picture had begun to change.  The successive oil crises seriously weakened the European economy.  Europe failed, unlike the US and Japan, to find employment for those thrown out of jobs by the decline <Col N="972" /> of traditional industry.  European firms found it increasingly difficult to cope with competition from their American and Japanese rivals.  This stemmed partly from the fact that within the Community protectionist restrictions prevented firms from taking advantage of a market which has now grown to 320 million people.</P>
    <P>The Commission has estimated that if the existing barriers to trade were removed and a genuinely unified market established, the benefit would amount to at least 2 per cent of Community GNP. This is more than twice the total budget of the European Community and puts into context the debilitating conflicts over the size of that budget.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry have welcomed the Single European Act. In their newsletter of 4 November they outline in some detail the practical benefits and opportunities which the Single European Act confers on Irish industry. This country depends on exports for its economic survival.  If barriers to exports are removed, opportunities for our exports will increase and the attractiveness of Ireland as a base for foreign investment will grow.  Thus our national interest in the completion of the internal market is inextricably linked to that of the Community &mdash; a Community which will find in the completion of the internal market a new impulse towards renewing its economic progress.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the importance of the chapter in the Single European Act on economic and social cohesion.  The cohesion dimension is also to be taken into account in the completion of the internal market.  Consequently, to the extent that the removal of existing trade barriers will operate to the greater advantage of the central regions of the Community, the objective of reducing regional disparities will have to be given full and equal weight.</P>
    <P>One of the major reasons the Community has fallen behind its Japanese and American competitors over the past ten years has been its failure to develop a coherent and comprehensive policy for research and technological development. European scientists and researchers have <Col N="973" /> been at the forefront of many of the major scientific developments of the post war years.  Yet the application of this research and the employment which that creates has often taken place in the US and Japan.  European industry has failed to maximise the benefits of European research potential.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Single European Act on research and technological development are very significant.  They do not take the primary responsibility for research and technological development away from the member states.  However, they do provide a framework for the development of a coherent and comprehensive Community policy in this area.  Member states can now enhance their co-operation and make a more effective response to the challenges posed by US and Japanese competition.</P>
    <P>As a small member state, Ireland cannot hope to develop research programmes on the scale of the large member states.  For that reason an effective and comprehensive Community programme of research and development will be to our benefit.  It will allow this country to participate in large scale and advanced projects for which we ourselves do not have the resources.  We already benefit significantly from the relatively modest co-operation already existing in this area in the Community.  We can expect much enhanced benefits when the Single European Act puts Community co-operation on a firm basis.</P>
    <P>One of the major investments being made by this country is on the education of our young people.  Our educational system is producing scientists to a standard which is comparable with the highest elsewhere in Europe and, indeed, the world.  The provisions on research and technological development contained in the Single European Act will provide an important boost for the Irish technology sector.  Just as significantly, the benefits to European technology as a whole are bound to have a spin-off effect for the Irish economy which is so dependent on the well-being of the European economy.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in describing the provisions of the Single European Act <Col N="974" /> on the environment as rather modest. Nevertheless they do represent an explicit recognition by the Community of the importance of the protection of the environment.  The member states now realise how much they depend on each other for the protection of their common natural environment.  We now realise more than ever that individual countries cannot, on their own, protect themselves from environmental disasters.  The Single European Act provisions on the environment, while they may be modest, clearly represent an overdue and welcome recognition that action at Community level must play an important part in protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>These then are some of the ways in which the Single European Act will strengthen the Community and equip it to cope with the challenges which face it in the closing decades of the century.  The Single European Act is not a revolutionary document.  It cannot be compared in scale or importance with the original treaties.  Rather it is a limited but significant and worthwhile step which, hopefully, will enable the Community to cope with the challenges which successive enlargements have posed.  It takes account of the directly elected European Parliament.  It provides an enhanced means of achieving economic and social cohesion and the completion of the internal market.  It also provides for the formalisation of co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy.  Nothing in these developments is in any way sinister or contrary to any of our interests.  The fact that major economic interest groups, such as the IFA and the CII, have welcomed the Single European Act is further confirmation that we should not see it as a threat.  Rather we should see it as we saw the prospect of membership 15 years ago, that is, as a challenge and an opportunity from which we can benefit substantially.</P>
    <P>The public debate which has taken place on the Single European Act has, naturally, concentrated on specific aspects of the Single European Act itself. It is right that this should have been the case.  I would like, however, to end with <Col N="975" /> a few remarks about how we should view our place in the Community and the contribution which we make to it.</P>
    <P>We should recall that we joined the Community not just because we expected economic benefits but also because we wished to contribute to the development of European integration.  We have been able to make such a contribution under successive Governments since 1973.  This Government's decision to support the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference which negotiated the Single European Act was a logical development of the approach which this country has taken to the Community since our accession.</P>
    <P>A strong and efficient Community is vital to this country.  The depressing succession of bitter disputes within the Community in recent years over, for example, the budget has had a debilitating effect on its development.  There was growing stagnation and a real threat of member states seeking national solutions to problems which could best be solved at a Community level.  Such developments could only be to the detriment of the Community and consequently to this country's detriment.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act will strengthen the Community and provide it with a reason to face the future with increased confidence. Certainly there will be disputes. There will be crises &mdash; that is nothing new in the way the Community operates.  However, the fact that the Twelve have been able to negotiate the Single European Act despite predictions that they would fail, does offer real hope for the future.</P>
    <P>By ratifying the Single European Act Ireland will reaffirm its commitment to the Community and to its future development, a commitment which is unquestioned.  We cannot opt out of this important step which safeguards our interests and reflects our aspirations.  The Government are therefore, determined that, in common with our partners, we will honour our commitment to ratify the <Col N="976" /> Single European Act by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is in our interest.  It will strengthen the Community of which we are part and the development of which is so important to Ireland.  It contains no hidden threats; rather it contains major opportunities.  I therefore ask the House to express its confidence in this country's capacity to grasp these opportunities by supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill I should like to express my appreciation to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities for the very useful report which they provided on this subject.  It is also fitting that I should pay tribute to the Leader of the House for the very important part he played in preparing the proposals which eventually led to this Bill.  We should all be grateful for the effort which he put into that and glad that the Leader of this House played such an important part.</P>
      <P>In looking at this Bill there are two aspects which have to be considered.  One is the political aspect: is it beneficial to Ireland?  The second is the legal aspect: are we obliged to pass it, as has been suggested in some quarters, and are we entitled to pass it?  Are we entitled to pass it without having a referendum?  First, it is quite clear that we are not obliged to pass it.  The reference to &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Community&rdquo; is misleading and does not mean that we are under any obligation to pass this Bill.  Whether we pass it or not, therefore, is a political decision.  We should look on it from the point of view of its merits and its advantages to this country.  We are quite free to refuse to pass it, but it must be realised that if we do not do so, there will be very serious consequences for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, are we entitled to pass it without a referendum?  This is a very complex problem; it is a legal problem; it is one which I do not think can be answered with complete certainty.  The Bill deals with proposals to amend the <Col N="977" /> original treaties.  First, it must be realised that the treaties contain provisions for amendments.  The method for introducing amendments which are provided for in the treaties appears to have been complied with on this occasion.  Obviously, although amendment is allowed in the treaties, that does not mean any amendments can be introduced.  There are restrictions on the amendments.  The amendments must be within certain parameters, within the concept of the original treaties.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the amendments provided are refinements of the provisions of the treaties.  They are modifications to make the provisions of the treaties more efficient and more effective, and it can be said that they do not appear to be breaking new ground or introducing anything which could not have been reasonably foreseen when the treaties were accepted in the first place.</P>
    <P>The amendments include rationalisation of decision-making process, provision to ease the workload of the European Court, more explicit reference to economic and social cohesion, incorporating provisions dealing with research and technological development and with protection of environment, the conferring of European Communities Treaty status on monetary capacity of the Community and, finally, procedure to enhance the role of the European Parliament. It could be said that these are within the framework of the original treaties and that, in ratifying the original treaties, Ireland must be taken to have accepted the possibility of amendments of this kind.  They would appear to have been envisaged by the original treaties and it must have been foreseen that such amendments might be introduced.</P>
    <P>While taking that view and accepting that these amendments are within the framework of the treaties, we must acknowledge that by passing this Bill a further transfer of sovereignty is involved.  It may not be a very major transfer; it may not be of such significance <Col N="978" /> as to cause us any real problem.  Nevertheless, it is another transfer of sovereignty, not much more, but more than existed.</P>
    <P>I come back to the question: should there be a referendum?  In my opinion a referendum is not necessary.  The Dáil and Seanad are entitled to pass this Bill if they think fit.  It comes back to being a political decision.  Will it be a good thing for Ireland?  Like most important issues of this kind there are good aspects and bad aspects.  If we pass the Bill there will be benefits to Ireland but there will also be disadvantages and possible dangers. We have to decide, bearing in mind that there are benefits, should we pay the price.  Is it worthwhile in all the circumstances? Weighing one thing against the other, should we pass the Bill and avail of the benefits in spite of the fact that there may be dangers in doing so?</P>
    <P>In considering this question we should face up to the fact that we are really deciding whether or not we wish to remain a member of the Community.  It may be legally possible not to pass the Act, not to accept the Single European Act, but from the political and practical point of view it would be impossible to do so.  We might limp on as a second class member but the position would become intolerable as time went on.  We would frustrate and antagonise the other members of the Community and, ultimately, there is little doubt that we would be required to renegotiate our position, to diminish our membership and become some kind of second class member.</P>
    <P>Some critics of the Single European Act who suggest that we should not adopt it without a referendum, which is a way of hoping that it will not be passed in a referendum, seem to ignore, to shrug off the benefits of being a member of the Community.  They seem to ignore the fact during the period we have been there over the past 13 years something like £4.7 billion of funds have been transferred to this country.  Membership ensures access for industry and agriculture to a market of 320 million people and, contrary to what some people believe, industry has expanded and has taken advantage of <Col N="979" /> these opportunities.  We now export over two thirds of our production.  Most of this is to new markets created as a result of membership of the European Community. It is not merely exporting goods; it is not merely putting money into the pockets of industrialists.  In fact, two out of three jobs now depend on membership of the EC.</P>
    <P>In spite of the criticism and complaints of farmers from time to time, particularly in the past few years, nobody in agriculture would advocate leaving the European Community.  They may criticise it; they may say the help they are getting and the prices they are getting are inadequate. Nevertheless there is no serious voice raised to say that agriculture is no longer being helped by membership of the EC.  Of course, we have also received significant benefits from the regional and social funds.  As a result of the Single European Act the benefits which I have mentioned should be increased and improved.</P>
    <P>Improved decision-making is necessary to eliminate the red tape, the anomalies and difficulties which make the Common Market less effective than it was supposed to be.  Unless it is more effective and unless it becomes really a free market, we will not be able to fight the competition of the United States and Japan.  If this Act is adopted, if the Common Market becomes more effective and the internal market becomes really a free market, this will be good for Ireland.  I am saying that on the basis of the benefits to Ireland to date and on the basis of the fact that industry has already done very well in exporting to Europe and presumably will do even better if the difficulties which exist at present are eliminated in the new situation.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act also gives the regional fund a specific legal basis and it strengthens the commitment to reducing regional disparities.  In regard to the latter it can be said with a great deal of justification that the provisions in the original treaties dealing with reducing regional disparities have not been effective. It can be said that little may be <Col N="980" /> expected of this because of the new situation, because in the past that provision was there.  It was part of the original treaties and nevertheless very little was done to reduce regional disparities.  Some people would argue that not merely was very little done but the situation is worse now than it was when we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>Although this is in the Act and it appears to be strengthened in the new situation, everybody in this country certainly will be watching very carefully to see whether the provisions in the Single European Act in this respect will make any difference.  It is essential that there should be political will to ensure that this is implemented.  The Government must dedicate themselves to ensuring that it is implemented.  There is little doubt that successive Governments have not been able or willing to ensure or have not known how to go about ensuring the reduction of these disparities.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act has provisions for research and technological development.  I say without any hesitation that this must be welcomed by Ireland.  Europe in general badly needs this.  If Europe needs it and the bigger countries in Europe need it, it certainly goes without saying that Ireland needs it even more so because with our limited resources we have to depend on the European Community to pass on the results of research and technological development to us because most of it is way beyond our reach.  This is something which can be welcomed without any hesitation. I do not think anyone believes it has any sinister significance, or that we should be worried about it from that point of view.  These are some of the main benefits which are advocated as being the likely developments of the new Act and if they turn out to be as good as there is a prospect of them being they certainly are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As I said originally in every case like this there are good points and bad points. There are many criticisms of the Act. There are fears expressed about what may take place if it is passed.  There are fears about change in the decision making <Col N="981" /> process, fears in regard to the qualified majority.  It must be realised that many decisions are already made by the qualified majority.  It has always been envisaged that more and more decisions will be made by this method as time goes on. It is quite unrealistic to think that all decisions will be streamrolled under the new situation when the qualified majority decision-making process takes place.</P>
    <P>The decisions in the EC will continue to be reached by discussion, by negotiation, by amendment, by compromise. It is only when all this has taken place that a vote, if necessary, will take place. It will not always be the three Irish votes against the rest of the Community as some people seem to think and, as has been pointed out, on very sensitive issues if the worst comes to the worst we can still fall back on the veto.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the change in regard to the qualified majority is not something which should give rise to any undue fears on the part of this country. Inevitably, from time to time, it will be used in a way we will not like, but then it will be used in a way that many countries will not like from time to time.  That is part of the handicap, part of what one has to accept from a membership of a Community of this kind &mdash; all of the decisions are not always in the interests of a particular country.  We have to give and take.  That is all we will be doing in this regard.</P>
    <P>Grave fears have been expressed about the effect on our neutrality.  Some critics have gone to ridiculous lengths and read into the Single European Act provisions and consequences which have no basis in reality.  I am an unequivocal advocate of neutrality.  If I thought this Act was any danger to our neutrality I would not be supporting it.  In the course of this debate and even when the debate is over, we should make some positive efforts to examine our attitude to neutrality, to define our policy on neutrality. A great deal of lip service is paid to the ideal without coming down to defining what we mean by it, how far we should go when neutrality is threatened and exactly <Col N="982" /> what our long term aspiration is in regard to neutrality.</P>
    <P>For the moment in regard to this Bill and the fears and views which have been expressed.  I see no inconsistency in belonging to the European Community, in acknowledging our common interest with the countries of that Community, in supporting the political ideologies and cultural values of the western world and, at the same time, stating quite bluntly that we have no intention of becoming involved in any military alliance with them.  If there were more countries in the world dedicated to neutrality, refusing to join alliances, the risks of war would be very much diminished.  I do not think international problems can be solved by war.  I do not think Ireland should lend itself to this approach and in no circumstances will I support a departure from our policy on neutrality.  I believe we can make a far greater contribution to Europe and to world peace by remaining as we are.</P>
    <P>Some curious views have been expressed in relation to neutrality and whether or not we should remain neutral. The Minister for Defence said recently that we should not be neutral unless we can afford to, and are prepared to defend ourselves as a neutral State.  The fact is that in the present nuclear world no country can defend itself no matter how much any country spends.  The prodigious amounts some countries spend serve only to impoverish them in the world in general. In so far as there is any safety in the present world situation we are just as safe and probably more so by remaining out of any military alliance.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Kelly shares the view of the Minister for Defence that we should not be neutral unless we can defend ourselves and calls our neutrality an unworthy sham, lacking in generosity towards our friends and self-respect towards ourselves.  Joining a military alliance of one set of nations to brandish their arms and utter threats at another set of nations is not my idea of being generous towards our friends.  I believe we can best maintain our self-respect by <Col N="983" /> maintaining our own principles, by displaying good-will to all nations and by doing our best to reconcile such international disputes as arise by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Single European Act, I do not think it threatens our neutrality. The references to co-ordination on political and economic aspects of security are no more than what they say and implemented with caution and with commonsense should present no difficulties, besides which there is no obligation to co-ordinate in any particular way.  These are merely aspirations and we do not have to co-ordinate in any way that appears to us to be verging on a departure from neutrality, nor do I think the references to technological and industrial conditions need give rise to any alarm.  These are aspirations which we are asked to co-ordinate in and we do not have to do so if we do not want to.  I do not think they need give rise to any alarm on the part of anybody.</P>
    <P>The political co-operation regarding foreign policy is of considerable benefit to Ireland.  It gives us a voice in international affairs which we would not have as a small nation and we can use that voice to effect.  We have already done so in recent years.  It is in a sense a means of having it both ways because when we agree with the views which the European Community wishes to express we can avail of the fact that we are taking that line.  On the other hand, no position can be taken up by the European Community or no action can be taken without unanimity. This is a right.  This is one of the benefits of membership which we can welcome without any qualification.</P>
    <P>The fact that no position can be taken without an unanimous view of the members of the Community has been demonstrated on several recent occasions where more than one country would not go along with what seemed to be the wishes of the remainder of the Community and took their own line and expressed their own views.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one final comment about neutrality.  We must not lose <Col N="984" /> sight of the fact that if the European Community moves closer and closer to full union.  I believe a time might come when neutrality might become impossible. In these circumstances we would have to make the choice between abandoning neutrality or withdrawing from the European Community.  That is a long way ahead.  I doubt that we will ever have to make that choice.  If it does arise and I am still in a position to comment, my position will be quite clear.  Very regretfully I would be advocating our withdrawal from the Community if we had to sacrifice our neutrality to stay within it.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I would like to make a plea about our approach to the European Community as amended by the Single European Act.  We should support the Single European Act and, having done so, we should adopt a positive and confident approach to the Community.  Our industry has shown what it can do in the past and it should do even better in the future.  Agriculture has benefited in the past.  It is going through a difficult patch at the moment but with adaption and commonsense there can be great benefits from the Community.  Agriculture must realise that they cannot keep everything exactly as it is; they must have regard to the kind of agricultural produce that can find a sale within the Community.  Having regard to the difficulties that exist at present there is no doubt that agriculture is much better within the Community than outside it.</P>
    <P>Under the new situation our regional and social problems will be helped if the Government have the will to ensure that we get every possible benefit available under these two funds.  All of us should look on membership as a means of developing our resources, of expanding our economy and providing much needed employment.  Nobody in Brussels or in the other countries of the European Community owes us a living.  We must make a renewed effort to make membership of the Community as beneficial as possible.  That can be considerably more so than it has been up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My first words must be words of thanks to the Minister for a comprehensive introductory speech that has set the scene for what I hope will be a constructive debate.  I must go on and pay tribute also to Senator Eoin Ryan for his thoughtful and constructive contribution to this whole debate.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act is the end of a process which emerged from a very real need on the part of all the European countries.  It emerged from the realisation that during the economic storms of the past decade the countries of Europe with a population, with a productive power equal to that of the United States or to Japan had failed to weather those economic storms with anything like the competence with which they had been weathered by these two other similar trading powers.</P>
      <P>The whole movement towards what is enshrined in this Act, the whole movement towards the completion of the internal market, the move towards the changes in regard to institutional balance and institutional powers arise not from a desire of people to tinker with the institutions as laid down in the Treaty of Rome or in a desire to produce a variety in the practices that had grown up in the Community under the Treaty of Rome. The anxieties that gave rise to this process are the very real anxieties that Europe has as to how Europe can deal with the problems of having a higher inflation than the USA and Japan, as having a lesser rate of growth than the USA and Japan, as having a higher unemployment ratio than the USA and Japan in spite of the fact that the economic systems are basically so similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we saw during those economic storms was that despite all the idealism of the Treaty of Rome to which we subscribed in our turn in 1972 when the economic winds started to blow we reverted to national protectionism, not national protectionism in regard to tariffs because that was prohibited to us, but we reverted to economic nationalism within the Council of Ministers and within the other organs of the Community.  Instead of doing as we had in previous times in <Col N="986" /> history when countries resorted to a narrow, economic nationalism in the misguided idea that this was the best way through the storm, what the members of the Community did was they adopted a narrow, economic nationalism of abusing the Luxembourg Compromise so that we had &ldquo;vital national interests&rdquo; being invoked not in the Council of Ministers not even in COREPER but even in specialist committees.  No sooner would a subject start to be discussed than the hints would go round that this could not possibly be done because &ldquo;vital national interests&rdquo; were involved.  We had a paralysis of decision-making in the Community. We had an abuse of the veto based on vital national interests and we had its use at a trivial level.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there arose the concern that unless we were to sink further and further in this form of economic despair and unless we were to fall further and further behind our great rival trading partners of the western world, something would have to be done.  And so there was a great, economic motivation for what is being done and what has led to the legislation that is before us today.  It did not arise only from that consideration because there was still the residual of the idealism which led to the founding of the Community.</P>
    <P>The idea of Europe is, of course, an extremely old one but the Europe of today while in many respects, as we are all conscious within ourselves, has many of the characteristics of the Europe of the past but, like all the rest of the world, it has changed.  The world has contracted notably in the past few decades.  Life has speeded up remarkably in the last few decades and Europe has had to take account of that.</P>
    <P>In a way it is remarkable that we have managed to make progress at all because in a sense what is happening in this whole process towards European union is the replacement of the fiercely independent national State believing in the divine right of sovereignty enshrined in national parliaments by a new system of States still independent but operating through <Col N="987" /> common institutions in a shared sovereignty. In a way one can say that this transformation is in its turn almost as great a transformation as that from the feudal society based on local power to the centralised nation State, a process which took hundreds of years to achieve.</P>
    <P>We had in the 19th century, and again in the 20th century, attempts to unify Europe by force under a single dictator. We had in the 19th century and the early 20th century attempts to establish a balance through diplomacy between completely independent States.  We have now this new departure.  In the next century people will look on the notions that are being floated today in this country in opposition to this measure in regard to the idea that sovereignty is an absolute indivisable thing, as old-fashioned as the divine right of kings.  Its time is past.  It is now part of history and it is time to move beyond it.  This has been there in the consciousness of those who think and are concerned about the position of Europe.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of attempts to grapple with this problem.  I would ask the House to bear with me for a few moments in dealing with these because we can see the benefits of what is proposed to us today when we look at what happened to some of the false starts.  We can look back at the effort that was made to get Europe moving along the lines that were advocated in the Tindemans reports.  The Tindemans report is now a matter for the archives.  Why?  Essential to the operation of the Tindemans report was the idea of a two-speed Europe.  The instincts of the leaders of Europe in shelving the Tindemans report were correct because the idea of a two-speed Europe in the long run operates against the whole idea of Europe moving forward as a whole towards European union.  Senator Eoin Ryan mentioned in his excellent contribution here this evening that this is what we would face.  If we reject this measure for one reason or another, this would be the reintroduction of the two-tier Europe and all that this will mean. Of course, we would be able to stand on our existing rights under the Treaty of <Col N="988" /> Rome to which we have adhered.  Of course, we could allow the others to regroup and go ahead with a new separate treaty to which we would not adhere. This would be a division of Europe. Where would we be after a few years because there would be two separate institutions and there would be two separate budgets?  Which budget does anyone think would dominate under such a system?  This particular path of trying to seek and refine the separate speeds is one that will not lead to a solution.</P>
    <P>The next initiative in regard to Europe also tended to go down a blind alley.  This was the Genscher-Colombo proposal.  It made the mistake of basing itself on the political as being the major, if not the sole, driving force and forgetting the balance between the economic and the political which is the essential of the solution that must be found.  It is no wonder that in that initiative there was the tendency with this great stress on the political to raise matters which would be a danger to our policy of neutrality and the concept of European political co-operation as at present enshrined in the Community and as will be formalised in this present instrument.</P>
    <P>The instinct of the leaders of Europe coming together &mdash; the few days they come together leaving behind them for the moment their national preoccupations &mdash; was correct.  What was the outcome of this initiative?  It was the Stuttgart Declaration, a declaration not approving all that had been originally in the Genscher-Colombo proposals but approving the idea that there must be a move towards European union.  There might perhaps have been a tendency on the part of the leaders of European Governments to leave things there without doing anything.  We must all be grateful to the European Parliament, to its Committee on Institutional Affairs and to Signor Spinelli for the fact that they took up the running at that point and produced the Draft European Treaty.</P>
    <P>This galvanised the heads of States and government again into action and they set up the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Instititional Affairs.  In the very first meeting <Col N="989" /> of that committee it was necessary for the members to decide what was their job and what they proposed to do.  The agreement was made from the very beginning that their task was not one of the drafting of treaties, their task was purely to produce a political document &mdash; a document on which political action could be taken.  It started out by saying that the very first essential in this regard was that Europe, faced with appalling economic difficulties, should have faith in itself.  I quote from page 11 of the report of the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs.  It states:</P>
    <P>Faced with these challenges, Europe must recover faith in itself and launch itself upon a new common venture &mdash; the establishment of a political entity based on clearly defined priority objectives coupled with the means of achieving them.</P>
    <P>This paragraph was followed by a paragraph which I was particularly glad to see included in the preface to this report.  It underlines the point that when we talk as we do of the Community and talk of it as Europe, we are talking in shorthand.  We must always remember that just as Europe went from the Six to the Nine to the Ten to the Twelve there are many countries of Europe separated from us at the moment.  We must realise that the task of full European union will not be completed until big changes, too big for us to contemplate at the moment, come about.  These countries are also part of Europe.  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee stressed that it was not just a matter of not forgetting these countries but that what was proposed to be done was something that kept them in mind and was in their interest too.  It is worth quoting this paragraph which says:</P>
    <P>The Community has not lost sight of the fact that it represents only a part of Europe.  Resolved to advance together, the Member States remain aware of the civilisation they share with the other countries of the continent, in the firm belief that any progress in <Col N="990" /> building the Community is in keeping with the interests of Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>What then should we do?  I must confess that having lived with this problem intensely for a period of six months and having been a member of the committee that produced this report and having been one of those who recommended an inter-governmental council, I was initially disappointed with the outcome of the deliberations of the inter-governmental council which produced the Single European Act.  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee asked for a qualitative leap forward &mdash; rather a strange phrase in English but it originated in French.  I came to like the term.  I prefer to talk of a &ldquo;leap&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;step&rdquo;.  I ask you to think of what is the difference between a leap and a step.  In a leap you make sure you are going in the right direction and then you propel yourself with both feet off the ground.  In a step you are more cautious, you again try to go in the right direction but you step always leaving one foot on the ground while the other is in the air.  What the <i>ad hoc</i> committee was recommending was a leap and what the inter-governmental conference produced was a step. This was a disappointment.</P>
    <P>I want now, speaking on this Act, to say that while one might commend the <i>ad hoc</i> committee for the greater level of idealism we must congratulate the inter-governmental council on a greater degree of wisdom because the most important thing about what is now being proposed is that is it acceptable to all of the Twelve. This was a remarkable achievement, one even the Parliament of Denmark was not prepared to accept.  The conventional wisdom was that no move would be acceptable but perhaps it was right that no move would be acceptable to the Parliament of Denmark or to their particular committee and we will be returning, Senator Higgins, to a discussion on this topic again this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And tomorrow evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The really essential <Col N="991" /> point was that it was acceptable to the people of Denmark and in that we must applaud the wisdom of the negotiating foreign ministers and those who are assisting them in those negotiations.  It is worth reducing ourselves from a leap to a step if it means bringing everybody along with us.  Indeed Senator Eoin Ryan spoke of one of the key problems of whether in fact we needed a referendum in this country.  We came to the conclusion that we did not need one but if Denmark had not come along with the other Eleven we could not have operated under Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome. We might well then have found ourselves in this country faced with a referendum with all the whipping up of wild enthusiasm and mistaken notions that referenda can sometimes involve.  So we find ourselves with this proposition before us, one that is acceptable to all the Twelve.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed to us?  First, what is being proposed to us is the completion of the internal market.  In other words, what is being proposed is that we should do what should have been done long ago.  I forget the original target year and I am sure the year changed.  Time and time again the target year for the completion of the internal market has been set and missed and the purpose of what is being done here in the Single European Act is to see that the present target of 1992 is not missed, that we do not just go calmly on and miss that particular target again.  There is nothing essentially new in this idea of the completion of the internal market except a new determination and a new political will to see it achieved.  As Senator Eoin Ryan said, this will involve for us certain difficulties but on the whole it will be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the things that people in this country have been slow to realise. We, a small country dependent on exports for our standard of living, cannot exist and cannot prosper in an economic jungle.  It is to our interest as a small country that there be rules in regard to this game and that there will be a referee to blow the whistle when the rules are broken.  Without the protection of the <Col N="992" /> Community rules, we would find ourselves in a deplorable condition.  This is the realistic way forward for this country. This is the only path to growth &mdash; through exports in a true market of 320 million people, not something that calls itself a market and is littered with non-tariff barriers to trade that result in a lack of competition.  I think we can all take heart from the fact that at the present moment we have one of our own countrymen acting with courage in order to break down the barriers to competition as the Commissioner in charge of competition policy.</P>
    <P>If we look at what is in the Single European Act in Articles 13 to 19, we find here a number of provisions which at first sight might appear dangerous from our point of view such as the greater use of qualified majority rather than unanimity. I want to say I believe that we and the other small countries have suffered more from the lack of the use of the qualified majority than the larger and more powerful countries.  Of course, we are aware of the number of cases where we would like to stop certain things happening or stop them happening in a certain way, but we do not read in our newspapers of the 20 other cases for every one case we read of where some of the other members have blocked progress in an area which would be beneficial to us.  We will be, I trust, debating at another time the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the completion of the internal market and these points can be discussed in greater detail at that time.  What is proposed here is beneficial to us, particularly in regard to Articles 18 and 19 with the right to temporary derogation under special conditions.</P>
    <P>What is the next major group of items that are proposed in the Single European Act?  They are the extension of the competency of the Community.  In other words, the giving of legal competency to things which the Community is already doing in an informal way because they were things which were necessary, things <Col N="993" /> that required common action.  We have now brought under the treaties the European monetary system, we have brought the social policy under the treaties and in particular we have now got enshrined in Article 23 an article on cohesion which should be of great value to this country. I want to compliment the Minister and his negotiating team on having that passage as part of the text.  It is worth reading into the record from Article 23 of the Single European Act the words of the new Article 130(A):</P>
    <P>In order to promote its overall harmonious development, the Community shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on in the next paragraph to define what it means by this:</P>
    <P>In particular the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions.</P>
    <P>I consider this a most notable advance. What was in the aspirations of the original treaty, and even what was in Protocol 30, are not worth as much as what is written there as the new Article 130(A).  Up until now everyone in the Community has been saying that they agree with convergence but when a Greek says he is in favour of convergence he means convergence of living standards, and when a German said he is in favour of convergence he is in favour of a convergence of economic policies that would make Greece and Ireland follow exactly the economic policies of Germany.  This ambiguity about convergence which bedevilled many a discussion, formal and informal, inside the Community is now resolved by abandoning the word and by putting into the treaty the purpose of social cohesion and the definition of social cohesion.  This is something for which we can all be thankful.</P>
    <P>So much for those things which have now been given treaty force.  In addition to these we have Title III in regard to European political co-operation which has probably given rise to most of the <Col N="994" /> discussion such as there has been in this country.  Let us be quite clear in regard to the nature of what is being done and how it is being done.  First, it is quite clear that it is outside the treaty: it is in a separate title.  It is not in the Bill whose Second Stage we are discussing at the moment because it is not to be made part of Irish domestic law.  If it were not for the fact that the affirmatory motion is down, the Cathoirleach might be tempted to rule me out of order for speaking about European political co-operation. It is something completely and absolutely different.  Title II deals with the foundations and the policy of the Community and Title III deals with co-operation.</P>
    <P>There were times over the past few years when proposals were put forward with regard to European political co-operation which might well have given rise to anxiety on behalf, not just of the individuals who had been vocal against this Single European Act but to people like Senator Eoin Ryan and myself and the Minister who are completely devoted to the policy of Irish neutrality.  As I mentioned already, there was this tendency in the early stages of the Genscher-Colombo proposals.  However, one of the problems in regard to the discussion that has taken place is that the arguments which have been put forward by people like the Minister, Senator Eoin Ryan and myself have not been listened to.  I was amused in a wry sort of fashion on reading in a number of letters to the newspapers that one could disregard any argument made by Garret FitzGerald, Peter Barry or Jim Dooge in regard to neutrality because they would say what they were saying in this regard and one should not listen to them.  In other words, one should not listen to three people who had attended meetings under European political co-operation and who knew how European political co-operation actually worked.</P>
    <P>While those meetings were confidential, I want to give an example, and I am sure my colleagues of the day who have survived in the domain of Foreign <Col N="995" /> Affairs will forgive me for this illustration. I think it brings home, and it brought home to me, the reality of European political co-operation.  There was a proposal made informally at an informal meeting that there should be meetings of European Ministers of Defence.  I said this was incompatible with Ireland's neutral status.  There was no discussion, there was no attempt to persuade me that I was wrong or that it did not really matter whether our neutrality would not be compromised in any way.  The chairman said in that case the subject would be dropped.  That is the reality of our position. It means that we have our Minister there to say this every time one of our colleagues tends to stray beyond the barrier but the position is that there is never any attempt to force it.  In many ways, having looked at the organisation and the operation of the two bodies, I sometimes think that there is far less danger to an independent foreign policy in our being concerned in European political co-operation than if we became full members of the organisation of neutral and nonaligned States where members often find themselves unable to maintain their independent position whereas under European political co-operation where consensus is the rule one can always walk away from the table saying &ldquo;I do not agree, our policy is so-and-so and our policy remains so-and-so&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Well, I support the formation of a foreign affairs committee and perhaps we could take up this particular topic.  Of course there are times we do not like this consensus rule.  There are times we do not like the fact that it is a matter of consensus and I am quite sure that our own Minister quite recently would have loved to use qualified majority in order to deal with the two members who were not in favour of sanctions against South Africa.  It would have been very nice for us and very much in line in what we wanted to do in regard to <Col N="996" /> South Africa that the rule of consensus would not apply.  However, it would be dangerous to go down that road because we, in our turn, need our protection.</P>
      <P>It has been said that it is impossible to distinguish between the political and the economic aspects of security and the military and defence aspects of security.  It is not impossible.  It needs care at times but it is not impossible.  If we were to say that these things cannot be distinguished and that we should not be concerned in security matters, all Ministers for Foreign Affairs from Frank Aiken to Peter Barry would be debarred from pursuing policies of disarmament.  We find no trouble in being part of the Helsinki process.  I found no trouble at the Madrid Conference in regard to the follow-up to Helsinki and I am quite sure the present Minister found no trouble at the Stockholm meeting in the further follow-up to Helsinki.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of it and on that occasion the Minister was still able to set out the common policy without the slightest embarrassment, without the slightest commitment that would interfere with our neutrality.  I think the joint committee were wrong to see these as two completely separate things.  They are separate but related, very different in their natures.  I believe that the political aspects of security should be discussed.  I want my Foreign Minister to be able to talk to the Foreign Ministers of our Eleven colleagues about the situation in the Middle East, about the situation in southern Africa, about relations with the countries of South-East Asia, about the situation in Central America, about the Helsinki process on security in Europe and about disarmament generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Irish viewpoint made and when that Irish viewpoint is made in general terms, for example, in talk about disarmament, there is no need to talk about what should be the particular negotiating stance of the West in East-West <Col N="997" /> discussions about disarmament.  That is where the distinction comes.  This has nothing to do with the creation of a European pillar of NATO, but it has everything to do with our making an input, our being able on occasions to persuade our friends.</P>
    <P>I ask people who have any doubts about this to look at the text of the Single European Act.  I ask them even to look at the text of the report of the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs from which I dissented, because it compromised our neutrality and did not discuss and had no hand in drafting.  Even that text, which was unacceptable to me, talked about &ldquo;the differing capabilities and responsibilities and the distinctive situation of the Community member states.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we look at the Single European Act, look at the actual text and ask where is the danger in it to our neutrality, let us look here under Title III.  Under Paragraph 2(a), what do we have?  An undertaking to inform and consult one another. Secondly, under 2(c), we have an undertaking to take full account of the position of other partners.  Very reasonable.  That makes every one of the Eleven take account of our position of neutrality because that is the position of all of us as members of EPC.  Paragraph 2 (d) asks members to avoid any action which impairs their effectiveness as a cohesive force.  I want Europe to be a cohesive force in the post-Helsinki process, in the UN and I think the more Europe as such, acting within the limits of EPC on the political and economic aspects of security, the more they act as a cohesive force, the less misunderstanding there will be in this country about our relationships and about our supposed entanglements with NATO.</P>
    <P>We want a European identity on external policy on matters other than defence. It is remarkable that if you look at this particular Article 30, there is one particular section that does refer to NATO and to the Western European Union.  It states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Title shall impede <Col N="998" /> closer co-operation in the field of security between certain of the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason for that to be in?  The whole thing appeared to be so neutral that if that paragraph had not been put in, some people might be afraid apparently that they could not be members of NATO and suscribe to what is here at the same time.  They had to put in specially that having adhered to this restrictive form of European political co-operation, they were not required to resign from NATO or to resign from the Western European Union.  That is the only meaning of a saving clause for us.  That clause is not in there to trap the one, that is an escape clause for the Eleven.  Let us read the text as it is.</P>
    <P>What is in the rest of this Title III? Some people have a fear that it is being made altogether too powerful.  If you look at that, Article 2 (b) associates the Commission with EPC.  What does it do in that?  That is what has been <i>de facto</i> the position for many years but not since the beginning.  That is the formal resolution of an argument long since settled as to whether the Commission was entitled to attend EPC meetings or not. Another article says that the European Parliament must be informed about what is going on, again highly desirable.  Under Article 10 (a) we also have the actual operation.  It says:</P>
    <P>The Presidency of European Political Co-operation shall be held by the High Contracting Party which holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>In other words, they are distinct.  The Title is saying that the one person will hold the two jobs at the same time so that is saying that there are two jobs, that they are two quite distinct jobs.  It also provides for the meeting of political directors which is the normal means of communication and it allows for a small secretariat not for a bureaucracy.  In fact, the position up to now is that I think this <Col N="999" /> is definitely in everybody's interest.  Up to now the position has been that the secretariat is being operated by a troika, the current presidency, the previous presidency and the forward presidency. There has been a danger in regard to EPC that it almost became a mystic priesthood among the political directors with no secretariat, no filing system which would say what are the precedents.  This is the setting up of a very small secretariat and this will certainly not involve a new building of the size of the Berlaymont for example.</P>
    <P>What else is done here in this Single European Act?  There are certain provisions in regard to the institution and one is in regard to decision-making within the council.  Unless this problem of decision-making within the council is solved within the next few years its effects will be felt throughout Europe.  Our economic problems will not be solved.  Our attempts to give a decent life and a decent job to our young people will prove to be impossible unless the decision-making procedures within the Council are streamlined.  The giving of executive powers to the Commission is an improvement and something that is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose the giving of what is called the Second Reading power to the Parliament but I think it is grossly inadequate. The Council of Ministers are storing up danger for themselves in the future by not having agreed during the intergovernmental council to more powers for Parliament than have now been given.  This is one of the points on which I am particularly disappointed.  To have made the decision that the Parliament should be directly elected and not to give it powers that are in some way consonant with this popular mandate is to put together an explosive mixture.  I think there will be trouble here.  The <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs suggested that Commission proposals should pass first through Parliament and then to the Council so that the Council would be acting on a Parliamentary text. As it is now, the Parliament will only act <Col N="1000" /> on a Commission text which has been to the Council and on which the Council have had an opportunity to take up positions. This is the major point on which I am disappointed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the court, I believe that the establishment of this tribunal is long overdue.  To clutter up the Court of Justice of Europe with cases that were really personnel matters is what happened. Cluttering this court with matters that were concerned with the rights of the personnel of the Community was an abuse of that particular institution of the Community and I am glad to see that is done.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the increased use of qualified majority will hurt us in this country.  I do not believe that greater powers for the Commission will hurt us in this country.  Non-ratification and non-approval by us of the ratification, which strictly speaking was made in the Dáil last week, would be a setback for Europe. They would find a way round that setback. They would find a way ahead but for us it would be a setback from which we might find it extremely difficult to recover.  It would be economically disastrous for us, politically disastrous for us but, above all, I want to say I think it would be psychologically disastrous for the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Dr. O'Donoghue Dr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and to say it is good to see again some indication of progress towards the eventual objectives of creating the ultimate union of the European peoples which, of course, has been the underlying objective of the Communities since their inception.  It is an objective which has been reaffirmed on many occasions since including the time when we were joining in 1972 before our formal entry in January 1973.  If we were to have a criticism of this Act, and of its content, it would be more an element of regret that the progress has to be, if I paraphrase Professor Dooge correctly, &ldquo;more in the nature of a step rather than a leap forward&rdquo;.  Like him I would have preferred to see something more in the nature of a leap.  The reason <Col N="1001" /> I would wish to see that is that, in the nature of the modern world, things have been changing so rapidly over recent decades, and we have seen it in so many spheres, there is a sense in which frequently one finds time is running out not just for Ireland but for western Europe. It has been touched on and, indeed, it has been referred to even in the context of the debate on the Single European Act.  The emphasis was on being able to achieve sufficient momentum in the area of technological progress and the recognition of, for whatever reasons &mdash; various ones were mentioned and perhaps I will come back to them &mdash; the way in which Europe appears to be lagging behind in its ability to compete in the modern world.</P>
      <P>It is not just the question of Europe's own progress which I think is so important. The way we act is crucial, for example, to acquire a leadership role for many other areas of the world.  In different contexts as we debate with, trade with, negotiate with and come in contact with peoples from Africa, Latin America and so on, we are conscious of the attitude which they have towards their participation in international affairs.  We all know that in some spheres, not just in the sphere of military might many of these nations feel that, in some sense, they are simply almost unwilling participants sucked into an economic international structure which they can do virtually nothing to shape.  We have seen the way in which different entities, different countries and different groups have sought to do something about this. Europe has provided the clearest and most effective example through the initiation of the European Communities, several decades ago and more important, through laying down some practical way for achieving their eventual goal of some form of ultimate union of the peoples of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the importance of the Communities for the European peoples themselves, they provide a very important exemplar role for people in other parts of the world.  I support these actions to help bring about economic unions in Africa, Latin America and so forth. <Col N="1002" /> These are practical steps which can help to create not only greater degrees of solidarity and cohesion among those areas, but also provide more of a psychological and social climate which eventually contributes to a greater sense of stability and security in global affairs.  Everybody does not share that view.  Here in Ireland we have had to listen to some strong dissenting voices in recent months when the subject of the Single European Act arose.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to make my own position clear and to emphasise that I totally disagree with what I regard as a national sense of inferiority.  On the contrary, far from dragging our feet, we should be in the vanguard of seeking to encourage and promote even more rapid progress towards the achievement of our eventual European objectives.  My reasons for saying this is that it is the nature of the modern world.  No country in the contemporary context can afford to go it alone, not even the largest and mightiest of them and certainly the dominant economic power for so long.  The United States who called the shots on so many issues for so many years, found increasingly in recent times that they too had to start substituting the word &ldquo;interdependent&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;. There is no country in the world which is independent in any ultimate sense.  In the long haul that is what will help us to create a safer world for our children and their children, a world in which they can look forward to some sort of prospect of a stable peace.</P>
    <P>We are creating a world in which there can be no winners, whatever about losers, in any sort of new style conflict.  We are learning that that applies not just to military conflict but even to any extensive form of economic conflict.  No matter how reluctant some people may be to be dragged to negotiating tables I believe that the future lies in bringing home to all nations that their future and their future success depends on their ability to work and act through consensus, cohesion and compromise &mdash; some of the words we have been hearing here this afternoon. That is the central message we have to repeat and reiterate over and over again <Col N="1003" /> because it is very easy to be forgotten or overlooked in the heat of any one issue.</P>
    <P>Of course it is understandable and correct from a tactical bargaining position that when any one specific issue arises, we should be active in advocating our own national interests in seeking to ensure an outcome that will adequately cater for those national interests.  But &mdash; and the &ldquo;but&rdquo; is important &mdash; we also have to learn that our national interests are rarely, if ever, promoted by pushing some issue to the point where we end up being on some sort of extreme position with no supporters, no friends elsewhere in the European context, if we are talking about our membership of the European Community.  That would apply to some other international arenas as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome in this Act the emphasis on greater reliance on majority voting, the movement away from the exercise of the unanimity rule, I agree very much with Senator Dooge who said what we had seen happening for many years was a growing abuse of the Luxembourg Compromise, a compromise which had been originally introduced to deal with a quite substantial and important matter, but which was eventually being degraded and debased to the point where it was even being dragged in to relatively low level committee discussion.  It is important that we should move away from the notion that countries or nations could go on living in this sort of fools paradise of reaching for the veto at the drop of a hat every time somebody opened their mouth and said something which was not to their liking.</P>
    <P>The nature of the modern world requires a growing exercise and use of the formation of consensus and compromise decision making.  The best way to give a very powerful encouragement to nations to develop that attitude when they are approaching the bargaining table is to realise that they will not have a veto but rather there will be some sort of majority voting outcome.  They then have to actively exercise their diplomatic and bargaining skills in order to help construct a majority decision which will be a <Col N="1004" /> sufficient accommodation of their own interest.  I said &ldquo;sufficient accommodation&rdquo; because, again realistically, any successful operation of a consensus bargaining structure implies that in general no one party is going to have his or her way all the time.  We are all going to have to learn how to give and take and to settle for some acceptable level of recognition for our own particular interests.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which Europe should more forward.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.  I also think it is the context in which wider international questions and issues must come to be resolved because, at the end of the day, if you will not approach the bargaining table with the attitude that you are willing to search for and work for an acceptable compromise, there is only one other logical alternative and that is that you are going to dig in your heels and if you feel you have the ability to do so you are going to resort to conflict as a means of settling a dispute.</P>
    <P>As we know from our own experience here in Ireland, the Irish have a marvellous ability for resorting to conflict at the drop of a hat.  We do not think of it in this military sense.  We shy away from any references to military alliances and so forth.  But if we look at the way in which we conduct a great deal of our economic and social affairs it seems as though our attitudes are still very much conditioned by a conflict approach. Rarely do we see many issues which ultimately have to be settled by some sort of bargaining procedure; but rarely do we see them approached in that spirit.  On the contrary as we know even from reading our newspapers, we can see quite a number of instances where it is conflict first and talk about it afterwards.  That would be another way in which Ireland could hopefully benefit and be educated by its European experience, if we were to learn how to carry over this concept of bargaining for compromise and consensus much more into our daily lives and more routine economic and social issues.</P>
    <P>The other point which struck me listening to and more often reading some <Col N="1005" /> speeches people who are expressing concern are just outright opposed to supporting this Single European Act.  Many of them are seeking to achieve a set of safeguards, writing some form of insurance policy which would hold, not just for today, but for the indefinite foreseeable future.  Again, the modern world is not like that.  Not even the most powerful country could seek to write out the terms in which it and the rest of the world will function in the years to come.</P>
    <P>What you can do is to write out a set of proposals which provide you with a reasonable range of opportunities.  What happens and how you make use of those opportunities would be partly the accident of circumstances, would be partly the consequence of the behaviour of your partners in your community, but it also can be influenced significantly by the behaviour of your own people.  Perhaps if some of the criticism of our European colleagues and some of the regrets expressed about our experience in Europe were to be analysed more fully and more deeply it would be seen that very often the fault lies not in the stars but in ourselves, that if we are not as well placed in the Europe of today as we might have been and as we would have reasonably expected when we joined in 1973, we could look back over the 13 years of membership and see many actions of our own here in Ireland which certainly damaged our ability to participate more fully in the European experience and to be able to derive more substantial opportunities and benefits from that participation.</P>
    <P>While I agreed with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Dooge and his general attitude I have to say I think he made a bit too much of Article 23, the new article about cohesion in the Community.  He was saying how much of an advance this represented over the earlier way in which some of these problems were approached by discussing them in the context of convergence.  He gave the example of how convergence can mean one thing to a Greek, who will talk about convergence of living standards and another thing to a German, who will <Col N="1006" /> talk about convergence of policy.  I have to say it does not matter whether we talk about convergence or cohesion.  It does not matter what nice words you get into a statement of aims, which is what Article 23 contains.  It does, indeed, contain the right kind of statement about aims for coping with the imbalances in the different regions in the Community.</P>
    <P>Coming back to my remarks of a few minutes ago, statements of aims and statements of objectives, in themselves, are not going to deliver anything.  They will butter no parsnips as somebody used to say.  What will decide the outcome will be the actual policies adopted and, much more important, the effectiveness of the action taken to implement those policies. That will bring us back not just to the behaviour of our fellow member states in the Community but also to our own actions here at home.  Even if we got the most noble expressions from our fellow members, even if we got the articulation of the right kinds of policies in conjunction with our fellow members, that would not guarantee the right of progress because we are quite capable here at home of acting in a way which would seriously handicap or negative many of those efforts.  While I certainly welcome the sentiments expressed in Article 23, I do not see that, of itself, it will make any significant difference.  It is more a reiteration of the sort of attitudes and sentiments which have been expressed on numerous occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>I speak here with a relatively long memory because I was involved, from 1970, in the actual entry negotiations and I am familiar with many of these debates and many of these discussions.  Indeed, on later occasions, I was involved in many of the negotiations which led to the formation of the European Monetary System.  One can look back on those occasions and can see when there was an indication of a sufficient degree of understanding and support for Irish circumstances, for Irish aspirations and adequate commitment to helping with the kind of actions that were needed.  At the end of the day we have to learn how to adapt and bring ourselves into line <Col N="1007" /> with European performance, rather than expecting Europe to share our behaviour in so many spheres of economic and social life.</P>
    <P>I will refrain from making a longer speech because I know there are a number of other Members of the House who wish to contribute to this discussion. I wanted to avail of the opportunity to indicate my strong support for developments of this kind.  I also want to close by emphasising how important the political aspect of these decisions is.  There have been attempts to turn it into a legal wrangle &mdash; obviously I will not attempt to enter that debate because I am not a lawyer and because I do not believe that is at the heart of the matter.  Many of these legalistic points are really a reflection of the underlying attitudes of people. People who want to support progress towards European union can find the arguments to justify their position in the same way as opponents of European union have been able to trot out various technical points.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day it seems to me that the two key speakers here today, Senator Dooge for Fine Gael and Senator E. Ryan for Fianna Fáil, have both said that this is a political decision.  I agree with them.  I thought it was useful and interesting that, in the course of his speech, the Minister quoted from the remarks of a former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass.  He also quoted from the Government White Paper of 1972 &mdash; one that I would be more familiar with.  It was stated quite clearly in that White Paper that, as a member of the Community, we shall participate fully in the work of shaping its future political development. There was a recognition at that time, contrary to what anybody tries to say now, that membership of the Community did entail political implications.  There is no way in the modern world in which you could divorce the whole range of economic issues which arise and try to pretend that they did not have political implications or political consequences and that decisions about them were not, <Col N="1008" /> in the best sense of the word, political decisions.</P>
    <P>The European Community is a community of political economy.  It may have had, in its early phases, a heavy economic content but we must never lose sight of the fact that its ultimate goal is, and always has been, some form of union of the European peoples.  That is the ultimate question, the ultimate attitude which we in Ireland always have to bring to bear on these issues as they arise.  At the end of the day are we committed to the idea and the ideal of trying to construct some form of union of the European peoples or are we not?  If we are so committed then, whenever any difficulties or problems arise they should be tackled in this positive sense of approaching the bargaining table with the aim of helping to construct the sort of consensus decision which can accommodate all member states rather than, at the drop of a hat, reaching for the veto instrument. It would be a useful step forward in the construction of Europe as we gradually reduce and eventually eliminate that veto concept.  I would go so far as to say that, of course, now that we have substantial interests and problems in the areas of tax harmonisation, it will not be too long before we can get away from the notion of having to exercise some form of veto in that area.  I am happy to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Senator Michael D. Higgins, for allowing me to speak before him. Senator Higgins is our spokesman on foreign policy but he is aware that I have another task to fulfil after this and he has kindly allowed me to speak before him. The Single European Act makes an important step forward in the long process of achieving greater union of the peoples of Europe in the course of economic progress, social advance and the search for peace.  Yet it is not a dramatic change.  It is not a huge step beyond the Treaty of Rome.  It is too small or too limited or too lacking in vision and challenge. Whatever view one holds, the <Col N="1009" /> Single European Act does take the Community forward into new territory and in some important areas it provides the framework within which further advances may be planned and implemented.  I refer Senators in this House to some recent remarks of the Commissioner Mr. Peter Sutherland which for me summed up the whole question quite clearly and succinctly I quote:</P>
      <P>... I believe that the Single European Act constitutes a modest but important step in the direction of improving the functioning of the European Community.  It contains new procedural arrangements which should make it possible for the Community to decide more efficiently and more effectively.  It involves a commitment to the completion of the internal market by 1992 and it enshrines in the Treaty a number of very important areas of Community activity which has hitherto been conducted on a rather <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  For these reasons, I believe that it is crucial that the Single European Act should be ratified by all member states before the end of the year so that it can enter into force, as planned, on 1 January and provide the basis for a new departure in Community activities starting next year.</P>
      <P>However, I have already had the occasion to point out that the Single European Act is not a magic panacea for the difficulties which we face in the Community.  Indeed, some of the most important problems facing the Community are not directly addressed by the Single European Act.  This is not surprising since the purpose of the Single Act is to provide a modification and the supplement to the legal framework set up by the Treaty of Rome. The key question, of course, is what use is made of this legal framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should quote the Commissioner Mr. Peter Sutherland &mdash; a man of understanding in this area &mdash; because I was very taken by what he had said.  The use made of the framework is quite a critical one whether we are talking about neutrality, of regional cohesion, of <Col N="1010" /> the environment, of the powers of the European Parliament and, most important of all, of CAP and the reform of CAP and the creation of a single European market.</P>
    <P>In every case the Single European Act provides a framework and an opportunity rather than a set of ready answers.  The Act challenges us to argue constructively and, in the Community spirit, for new Community policies in the areas of social, economic and regional development to work with others of similar interests and needs for proper balance within all Community policies and to make full use of all the Community's institutions to promote good policies and to protect our interests, and to establish and then to implement a genuinely independent foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supported the Single European Act, not unanimously but by a majority, in the forum in which we had discussions on it.  As Senator M. Higgins is quoted as saying: &ldquo;The real debate on the Single European Act and on our relationship within Europe always takes place within the Labour Party&rdquo;.  The party give their support in the full awareness of the very real concerns which many individuals and groups within our party legitimately hold about various aspects. What is now at stake is not a constitutional wrangle or a pursuit of various compromise theories, rather it is time for a fresh, positive and well planned approach to the whole range of our relationships within the Community.  The resolution adopted last week by the administrative council of the Labour Party very clearly sets out our party's position.  The resolution is founded on the basic view that the Single European Act in itself does not present any threat to our neutrality or to our economic well being.  In fact, the Act puts it up to us to promote our own neutrality and to work and to plan for our economic development within a set of rules and regulations which will be clear and more open in future.</P>
    <P>The working of the resolution adopted by the party was that the administrative council of the Labour Party accept that the ratification of the Single European <Col N="1011" /> Act is in the national interest both economically and politically and I quote:</P>
    <P>It provides, for the first time, Treaty status for effective regional cohesion within the European Community.</P>
    <P>It protects the neutral status of the country and its right to pursue an independent foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It provides for more efficient decision making while preserving the safeguard of the veto.</P>
    <P>It enhances the role and influence of the democratically elected European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The administrative council further recognises that the Single European Act creates a new and potentially more effective framework for policy development within which Ireland must.</P>
    <P>Pursue with like-minded member states and with the democratic socialist movement, a comprehensive and properly funded regional policy.</P>
    <P>Efficiently and democratically plan its own economic and social development while availing of the extended market.</P>
    <P>Evolve and implement a strong, independent foreign policy line in favour of peace and disarmament while seeking common policy positions within the European Community on matters of mutual concern.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the administrative council resolves that the Parliamentary Labour Party, having clearly stated party policy on all of these crucial matters, support the ratification of the Single European Act in Dáil and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The administrative council directs that the party now pursue actively.</P>
    <P>The creation of a positive socialist response at Community level to the jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>The support of the Democratic Socialist movement within the European Community for regional policy initiatives.</P>
    <P>A genuinely independent foreign policy and the establishment of an <Col N="1012" /> Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael D. Higgins and I have already moved a resolution in this House and he will deal with it at greater length in his reply to the debate.  We are anxious that this will come about.  The document accepted by the administrative council continues:</P>
    <P>Continued informed debate on the implications of the Single European Act and of Irish membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The administrative council further directs that the Parliamentary Labour Party immediately table, in Dáil and Seanad...a resolution in connection with Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>That has been done by the Government in the Dáil and Seanad and, indeed, has been tabled by the Labour Party members of the Seanad in an expediency motion setting up an Oireachtas joint committee.  The parliamentary party on a number of occasions have discussed at length the Single European Act and its implications.  Indeed, we have adopted formal policy positions on the EC on three different occasions.  In 1971 the party decided to oppose Ireland's application for full membership of the Community and to fight against the consequent proposals to amend the Constitution to permit Irish accession on the terms negotiated by the then Fianna Fáil Administration.  The party campaigned vigorously on the themes of economic vulnerability, regional underdevelopment, loss of sovereignty and a possible threat to our neutrality.  The option of associate membership was strongly advocated by us.  In the event the referendum of 1972 resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of accession, by 83 per cent to 17 per cent. The Labour Party at once indicated through our leader, Brendan Corish, our acceptance of the clear political will of the Irish people.  Labour stated that we would work at all times and at all levels of Community life to protect and promote legitimate Irish interests and to seek the <Col N="1013" /> development of the Community in a positive and progressive direction.</P>
    <P>In 1978 our party adopted a comprehensive policy statement as the basis for our campaign in the first direct elections to the European Parliament held in June 1979.  The statement was adopted following a thorough discussion throughout the party branches, constituency councils and otherwise.  A unique policy development programme introduced at that time indicated our party's acceptance of membership while outlining a wide range of policy considerations which we felt required change.  We aligned ourselves firmly with the Democratic Socialist movement within the Community.  On that occasion we were fortunate to elect four members of the Labour Party to that Community and to join with our socialist colleagues to serve the interests of Ireland.  That was confirmed by the members at that time.  I am glad that we have in the Seanad at this time my colleague, Deputy Séamus Pattison, Minister of State, who served as a member of that Socialist group within Europe.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the Labour Party adopted two further major policy statements in preparation for the second direct elections. The first of these updated and clarified the positions taken in the 1978 document. The second dealt specifically with the controversial issue of European political co-operation stressing the possible dangers for Irish neutrality and demanding full transparency for this increasingly important process.  In 1984 the party cooperated also in the preparation of the manifesto of the Confederation of Socialist Parties in the Community.  I personally participated in those discussions in trying to reach a common manifesto in Europe among the Socialist groups.  Among other matters this document, adopted by the 14 members at the time, dealt in precise terms with the question of Irish neutrality. I remember late one night ensuring in Luxembourg that Ireland's positive role on neutrality would be maintained. The manifesto published at that time stated unequivocally that the Community <Col N="1014" /> had no competence in military matters, that matters of a military nature were to be dealt with in the NATO ambit and not within the Community structures, and that Irish neutrality must be fully represented. I am quoting from the common manifesto of all the Socialist groups within the Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the 1984 elections the Labour Party lost all their seats, unfortunately.  People did not listen to the message we had. Since then everybody is expressing concern as a result of the Single European Act.  From its inception in 1967 to the mid-seventies the EC has enjoyed almost uninterrupted progress with rapid economic growth, high employment levels and a remarkable political development in terms of overcoming the long history of Franco-German confrontation and war.  If anything, the Community has achieved peace for the first time in its long history.  Barriers to trade were significantly dismantled and a common external tariff institution and the Common Agricultural Policy were established. Institutions of decision-making were developed and, in the seventies, applications from the four countries, including Ireland, to join with them were on the table.</P>
    <P>The first enlargement brought Ireland, Denmark and the UK into the Community in 1973, the year of the Yom Kippur war and of the first oil crisis.  From then on the Community was confronted with the recurring problems of coping with the new member states and their needs, including the needs of Ireland, with a devastating socio-economic crisis as unemployment and inflation soared and economic growth, so long regarded as automatic, stagnated or went into reverse.</P>
    <P>In 1976 we went into the second oil crisis.  This added to the Community's difficulties and unemployment rose further. Today unemployment figures in Europe are staggering.  Our own unemployment figures are extremely bad, probably a higher percentage than average in the Community.  Taking the average within the Community, it is obvious that Europe, as a community, has been <Col N="1015" /> unable to tackle some of the problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>Today our Minister for Agriculture is fighting and initiating the veto to try to protect the Irish national interest in relation to beef.  These are some of the problems that have arisen in Europe.  We stated originally, in our opposition to the terms of membership, that these problems would arise.  Nobody believed us. The Labour Party were a minority party of very little significance to many people. Today many of the problems we foresaw happening in Europe have happened. The prolonged failure of the EC to come to grips with the economic crisis &mdash; and above all the jobs crisis &mdash; has led to public alienation which was most dramatically exemplified by the very low turnout in the 1984 direct elections to the European Parliament, when no more than 59 per cent of eligible voters exercised the franchise.</P>
    <P>It has become increasingly recognised that the Community was not meeting the impact of world recession with as much success as the United States, Japan or other developing sectors.  The Community, in relation to them, has failed.</P>
    <P>In the face of the many great problems of the economy and of society in general it was more and more open to question whether the Community possessed the appropriate legal and structural mechanisms to enable it to maintain and enhance its economic and political decisions in a world of harsh competition and rapid technological advance.  It is that kind of failure which has led us into a situation where a change is needed.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge guided the Single European Act through most of its deliberations within the Community and brought forward what is now before us today &mdash; an opportunity for the first time for the Community to address itself and to decide where it is going, how effective its decision-making policies are, and how appropriate the cohesion and development of the market would be, into the next decade or beyond.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised by most people that up to now the Community seems to <Col N="1016" /> be in a crisis because of its restrictions on its own resources and the fact that two or three members are the main contributors to it.  They can actually dominate policy. As a major beneficiary nation our bargaining position within the Community is extremely weak.  Even in the face of opposition at times it is important to be able to respond with a veto or a threat of a veto.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Single European Act does not in any way remove from Parliament, in the national interest, the operation of the veto if such drastic action is required.  Nowadays, with the changing face of Europe, it is imperative that we hold the ultimate power of veto.  It is appropriate to recognise that it is not a legal instrument within the Community. It was never part of the original treaty and is a political decision between the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers also have the problem that they almost find they have a veto on their decisions or lack of decision.  The Community, through the Commission, has the ability to freeze prices or to alter prices which in effect is almost using a veto on the Council of Ministers.  It is appropriate that Europe should look at itself in this regard.  We have had concern expressed, particularly in the Labour Party and in the trade union movement, about Ireland's neutrality.  I do not think anybody has a clearer stance than the Labour Party on what we mean by neutrality.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a speech of our party leader, the present Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, which spells out the central elements of our policy in relation to the development of the EC at this stage of its history.  He stressed the following points at a meeting of the Socialist groups in Madrid in 1985.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The priority is the fight for jobs, the need to combat the policies of the new right.  Approaches to economic union are unacceptable unless Community policies are so designed as to prevent growing regional imbalances and to promote convergence in living standards and in levels of employment. <Col N="1017" /> Regional policy must contain a commitment to extend the concept of integrated programmes to the north west of the Community, including Ireland. The decision making structures of the Community must ensure that in no circumstances will the legitimate and vital interests of any member state be overridden. Part of the Community which has a world political responsibility is neutral Ireland.  Irish neutrality is not conditional; it is fundamental.</P>
    <P>Those are the words of our party leader on the question of neutrality.</P>
    <P>Certain key points then arise from the consideration of the Act and its detailed contents.  It is appropriate that I should list the following five points for concerted national action in the period immediately ahead of us.  One is action to enshrine the principles of neutrality in our Constitution. This is a longstanding Labour Party policy, as I have said, and the party leader clearly restated this in the other House last week in the debate on this Act.  It has already been referred to by Senator M. Higgins and myself in our discussion on our Private Members' Motion.  Action is also required to establish an effective and properly resourced Oireachtas committee on foreign policy which is quite essential if there is to be a truly independent foreign policy, subject to real democratic control, public understanding and support contained also in our resolution.  We must have action to build the necessary network of policies, initiatives and supportive measures within the range of Community institutions to ensure that the cohesion objective will be translated into meaningful policies provided with fully adequate funding.</P>
    <P>We must have action to create a proper framework of economic and social planning with full democratic involvement to avail of the opportunities provided by the developing internal markets and to ensure maximum protection against the inherent threats, and also action to participate fully and positively in the fleshing out of the important provisions in the Single European Act in the areas of the <Col N="1018" /> environment's social policy and other developments within the Community. Action is what is now required.</P>
    <P>We have heard of all the negative reactions and all the arguments going back to 1972, refighting the referendum of that year.  We should put all that behind us now and go forward with all like-minded people in the Community to use the Single European Act and to demand that the positive things it promises will be delivered.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are fully prepared to participate in all aspects of this campaign for meaningful European development and for a really effective Irish foreign policy.  The Single European Act does not create or make any demands for these desirable things.  We feel it is not contradictory to any of these things.  It simply challenges us to bring our policies into line with the real needs of the future, the needs of Ireland within the Community with its member states and in complete support of actions that can be taken to address many of the major problems such as economic problems, unemployment problems and many other market problems we have within the Community. Ireland has always played a role in this regard.  I hope the Single European Act will set up structures to enable us to do that in a much more positive way than in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in this debate which is extremely important.  It is a debate on an Act which has been discussed at length at meetings of political parties and of interested groups such as trade union meetings and employer meetings right throughout the country.  There probably has not been any other single Act of Parliament before us which has created so much dissention. The debate has shown that there is a lack of knowledge to a large degree.  It is not until a very late stage of the debate that the Government, on the advice of my party, decided to bring out a document which gave the broad outline of the Single European Act.  The Government were singularly irresponsible in not giving the <Col N="1019" /> people of this country the opportunity to discuss this Act over quite a long period.</P>
      <P>The joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities addressed themselves to this legislation in 1984 and indeed, produced an excellent document in that year which was discussed in the Seanad.  A major debate took place on the Spinelli report and on the subsequent Dooge report.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately those debates were not addressed by the press to any acceptable degree.  If the press had taken note of what was said in the Seanad debates in 1984 and 1985 the public would have been more knowledgeable about the implications of the Single European Act.  Of course, apart from <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and occasionally the <i>Independent</i> group, the press ignore this House, but when they wanted to make hay in terms of the Single European Act and its implications they blamed legislators to a large degree for not bringing the implications of this Act before the public.</P>
      <P>The press did not avail of the opportunity to listen to the contributions from members of the joint committee and, in particular, the deliberations of Senator Dooge, who was one of the people involved in the preparation of this legislation. The work that has gone on over the years was ignored not alone by the press but also by the Government.  There was a singular lack of interest in the Department of Foreign Affairs and if there was not a singular lack of interest in that Department they were very reticent about sending out information.  We have had information from every group in this country about this Act.  There is no Member of the Oireachtas to whom I have spoken who has had a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disgraceful that the Department of Foreign Affairs, who are so involved in this Act, should not have seen fit to brief Members of the Oireachtas.  It is disgraceful that the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to sit in their ivory tower in Iveagh House and not address themselves to the needs of the <Col N="1020" /> Oireachtas.  I am not suggesting that Members of the Oireachtas should not, at times, get in touch with the Department of Foreign Affairs, but if the Single European Act can be of major concern to people throughout the country and to groups who have never appeared in public before, I feel the Department of Foreign Affairs should have had at least the courtesy or the diplomacy to brief Members of the Oireachtas on the implications of this Act.  We cannot say we are a jury and suggest to them that they did absolutely nothing.  We cannot be judgmental in real terms on them, but the country is being judgmental on them.  We can criticise the Minister for not doing his job, but apparently we cannot criticise the Department of Foreign Affairs who have not briefed Members of the Oireachtas on this Act.  It is not, as I said, the total fault of the Department.  There is fault also on the part of the Members of the House for not continually getting in touch with the Department.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in the newspapers over the past number of weeks about the fact that 300 laws would have to be changed as a result of the bringing in of the Single European Act.  This created problems for a number of people throughout the country.  When one went to find out what these laws were, one had to refer back to a White Paper produced by the European Commission in 1985 which listed 300 items which would have implications for the completion of the internal market.  I was trying to get information about the implications of these 300 regulations.  The Department of Finance were extremely helpful in giving the details as to where we stood in regard to the items for the completion of the internal market in that Commission report.  The Department of Agriculture replied.  Other Departments did not know what I was talking about when I contacted them.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that a White Paper could be produced by the Commission and that Departments are involved in the bringing in of regulations which will have an impact in this country and yet in certain Departments of State, when there is <Col N="1021" /> supposed to be constant contact between the civil servants in Europe and here at home, when a Member of the Oireachtas telephones requesting specific information, he or she may not get the information quickly.  A Member of the Oireachtas should not be shifted from one Department to another with civil servants saying they do not know, and it is not within their area.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act will have a major impact on Ireland when it is enacted.  It could be said equally that the completion of the internal market is the area in which the most impact will be felt. Unfortunately, the concerns which have been expressed by many interest groups about the internal market have not been addressed.  A major debate has taken place about what will happen in terms of our neutrality.  There is no doubt, whether the Government like it or not, that this is the area of most concern to the Irish people.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Single European Act does have implications as far as our neutrality is concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to the fact that his Leader and his party have been proponents of neutrality and that they have always stood by our neutrality.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some of the Government Ministers.  I refer in particular to the Minister, Deputy O'Toole.  He said over the past number of months that neutrality is an issue which we fudge on and that we cannot be neutral in all situations.  We are talking about positive neutrality.  We are not talking about sitting on the fence in terms of international affairs.</P>
    <P>When we speak of our neutrality, it is accepted throughout the world that we are a nation which does not get involved in power blocs; we do not want to get involved in power blocs; and we never will get involved in power blocs.  We will not get involved in power blocs from the point of view of joining one such bloc to gain power or to be supported by power. Equally, we do not want to be protected by a particular power bloc.  In terms of a worldwide conflict between major powers, we would have no impact in the <Col N="1022" /> wide earthly world, whether we were involved on one side or on the other. There are military significances involved. If we have the old type of war we are a significant nation to a small degree.  If we are talking about a major conflict, such as could arise at present with high powered technology in warfare, we could be wiped out overnight.  Whether we were involved on one side or the other would make no whit of difference to us.  We would just be wiped out.  The fact that we were on one side or the other would have no significance.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Toole, was wrong in what he said.  I said this last week.  I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs are taking cognisance of what he has been saying in terms of our involvement with the peacekeeping troops in the Lebanon.  He suggested that, because of incidents in the Lebanon, we should withdraw our troops if it comes to the situation where there are dangers for us. There are always dangers for us because of our interest in keeping peace in the world.  At present the greatest number of our troops are in the Lebanon where they are doing an exceptional job.  Anybody who would suggest that they should be withdrawn from the area in which they are should have his head examined.  I sincerely hope the Department of Foreign Affairs will tell the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, that the troops must be kept there and that he should keep to his Ministry of Defence and speak on defence matters, and not speak about foreign affairs matters.</P>
    <P>The joint committee, as I have said, have been working extremely hard for more than two years.  As has been indicated, they presented two major reports which are central to European Union &mdash; the report on the European Parliament Draft Treaty, establishing the European Union, and the report on the Commission's White Paper, on completing the internal market.  I would like to acknowledge publicly the major work which has been carried out by this committee, including that of their technical experts, the clerical staff and the very many <Col N="1023" /> publicly-minded people who made representations to them and who appeared before them.</P>
    <P>The joint committee regard the Single European Act as a most unorthdox amending instrument.  It has been seen in this light also by many concerned individuals and groups throughout the country. The joint committee rightly pointed out the possibilities of conflict which might arise when the Act is ratified as it has been shown that member states have exploited in the past uncertainties in existing treaties which are lucidly drawn up.</P>
    <P>The Government have been telling us for some time that the Single European Act had to be ratified by the end of the year.  I heard Senator Ferris refer to this. Indeed, there is no truth in the suggestion by the Taoiseach or any Minister that the Act has to be ratified before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Article 33 (2) of the General and Final Provisions of Title IV states:</P>
    <P>This Act will enter into force on the first day of the month following that in which the instrument of ratification is deposited of the last Signatory State to fulfil the formalities</P>
    <P>The date for the Act coming into force is the first day of the month following that in which the instrument of ratification is deposited by the last signatory State.  It does not have to be 1987 or 1988; it is the first day of the month following the signature of the last signing State.  There is no truth in the statement that this legislation has to be on our books before the end of December.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of weeks the impression has been given that, unless we ratify this legislation, we will not be good Europeans and that we cannot appear not to be good Europeans.  The joint committee suggested &mdash; and from what has been said to them by the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; that we must appear to be good Europeans and that there should not be any amendments or the annexation of reservations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the opinion held by many <Col N="1024" /> people that the Government should accept any amendment put to them which would strengthen our position on neumajor issues which are of concern to us and, in particular, our position on neutrality. If there is no fear by the Government that our neutrality will not be affected, why not allow an annexation of my party's reservations in this area. There is no doubt that the fragmentation of the European market has been one of the major inhibitions to economic growth in Europe.  We have watched for the past number of years economic growth in the developed world slow down.  Nowhere has this been more obvious than in the EC.  For the past four years, however, we have seen America and Japan prosper in economic terms again and the SEATO countries, which were considered to be barely Third World countries up to a few years ago, are now major competitors in terms of the European market.  The growth has taken place, not alone in America and Japan but in the SEATO group of countries and we have seen stagnation in Europe caused by a lack of will to address the problems we are facing.</P>
    <P>We have watched the European area decline in economic terms and in social terms at a time when other areas were growing.  We see industries here closing down every day and there is an unprecedented rise in the number of young people unemployed.  There does not seem to be enough teeth in current legislation to ensure that Europe can compete with the rest of the world.  We get on a bi-annual basis a report of happenings in the EC.  Year after year, except for the change in terminology, change in words, the 1984 report, the 1986 report, the 1979 report could all be read and one would see the same things are being said &mdash; that more emphasis will be put on the creation of jobs and more emphasis will be put on social equality, more emphasis will be put on the equalisation of economies throughout Europe.  Nothing happens; the reports just come out.  I reckon the same man writes them and just changes the dates.  They have no more significance than that.  When we debate them in this House, all we can do is raise matters <Col N="1025" /> which are of current importance and continue to harp on the major problems which are confronting the people of Ireland and the people of Europe each day.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market would seem to be the correct instrument which might give impetus to economic growth in the EC and a resultant benefit would be a growth in employment.  The completion of the internal market will not be the panacea for all our troubles but there is no doubt that we should eliminate as many barriers to internal trade as possible and that the harmonisation of taxes especially VAT should take place and paper work be eliminated.  I would like to see VAT and taxes eliminated.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that if harmonisation did take place the Department of Finance would lose quite a large amount of revenue. Harmonisation should not be read as bringing the lowest tax regimes in the Community into being.  If, on balance, harmonisation costs us some money, these revenue losses could be financed from a major growth in economic activity, ensuring more revenue from the growth in extra spending on consumer goods and in extra tax taken from PAYE, PRSI and the indirect taxes that would follow the stimulus the internal market could provide.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the figures given to us by the Albert and Ball report in terms of barriers and technical, fiscal and bureaucratic situations which amount, it is suggested, to £8 billion a year or 2 per cent of the European gross national product.  As a small country, exporting 66 per cent of our products of manufacturing industry, of which 80 per cent goes to the European Community, we have enormous financial benefits to gain from the elimination of barriers in a market of what is considered to be around 320 million people.</P>
    <P>According to the Irish Council for the European Movement there are 850 foreign owned companies in Ireland, employing 80,000 people directly.  These companies are giving indirect employment to a further 80,000 people in the <Col N="1026" /> services sector.  It is suggested that, because over 400 of these firms have parent companies located in other Community member states, if there was a harmonisation within the regimes in Europe there would obviously be scope for attracting new investment in a more economically integrated Europe from within the Community as well as from Third World countries.</P>
    <P>The elimination of barriers is a major block and this has been recognised by companies who want to do business within Europe.  If a company operating out of New York want to send goods 4,000 or 5,000 miles across America, they can get to their major areas of trade without any customs barriers, without any paper work.  They just fill up their vehicles and they travel with no barriers. This has given an impetus to their trading. We do not have the same.</P>
    <P>We must attempt to have the same type of regime, or as close to it as possible, for transferring goods as there is in the States.  We must be as hard on goods coming in from outside the EC as are the Japanese.  Over many years the Japanese have allowed their exports to grow at an enormous rate.  Their imbalance of trade is enormous.  It is virtually impossible to export from Europe into Japan even though a certain small group of companies have been successful in the market.  In terms of the usage of foreign goods, Europe is way behind when we look at countries like America or Taiwan.</P>
    <P>The Republic of China and Taiwan have an imbalance of trade with America and Japan.  They export a larger amount of goods into America and Japan than they import from them.  Why cannot we do the same, as a Community of 320 million, with supposedly what is the best technology in the world?  There has to be a reason because the same import restrictions are placed on Taiwanese goods into Japan as are placed on European goods going into Japan.  Let nobody for a moment consider that Taiwanese goods are going in because they are cheap.  They are selling high technology goods into Japan; they are selling high <Col N="1027" /> technology goods into the United States of America.</P>
    <P>In the consideration of this Act, if I tend to talk more about the internal market than any other area, it is because it is important that we address ourselves to the internal market as it is the only area in this Bill which is of potential significance to us.  There is no other part of the Act that will be of any great benefit to us.  The other parts of the Act have inherent in them areas which could be potentially areas of conflict.  We must attempt to establish close working relationships and joint ventures with other companies in production, research and marketing activities from within Europe.  We must get to the stage in Europe that we have a common market in the real sense and in which there would be a joint opportunity within the states of the EC.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council for the European Movement are correct when they suggest that there should be a new chapter in the Treaty dealing with economic and social cohesion of the Community to reduce disparities between the various regimes. This insertion will strengthen Ireland's opportunities within the EC.  As I have said before the Single European Act does not prohibit reservations or permit only specified reservations.  This is brought forward in the report of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>We should have an insertion into the Act, a declaration which gives us protection under the terms of Protocol 30 of the Act of Accession of Ireland to the European Communities.  The declaration that my party want just parallels the principles which govern our economic relations with the Community and our special situation which was recognised at the time of our accession and which is enshrined in Protocal 30.  The declaration states that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military aspects of security and that co-ordination of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or <Col N="1028" /> refrain from acting in any way which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned our peacekeeping efforts abroad.  There is inherent in our peacekeeping efforts the knowledge of foreign countries that we are a nation which is neutral in military terms.  If we were in any way to be associated with any power bloc, we would not be acceptable in countries which need our military expertise in terms of peacekeeping. There is the expertise which our Army have in their peacekeeping role.  They are well trained, well disciplined and they perform exceptionally well in difficult situations. This House should be proud of the job our Army do abroad.  On all occasions we should protect them.  We should forget about the fact that implicit in our accession there is a declaration that we are neutral.</P>
    <P>It is no harm at all that we put into this Act a declaration of our neutrality.  The declaration states that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military aspects of security and that co-ordination of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in a way which might affect Ireland's international status in military neutrality.  Government spokesmen have suggested that there is an implicit recognition of Irish neutrality in the provisions of Title III of the Single European Act.  We do not accept implicit recognition as being valid.  We must have the question of our Irish neutrality spelt out in the Act or as an addendum or reservation to the Act.  Indeed, there has been only one reservation expressed by the Government so far, that is, in the area of protecting the Irish insurance industry. The protection of the Irish insurance industry is important.  It is an area which needs protection from major companies from outside.  Nevertheless it is not as important as the issue of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>We have been an excellent member of the EC each year since we became a member and Fianna Fáil have been to the fore at all times in progressing the <Col N="1029" /> cause of a united Europe for the unity within the Community which would bestow on the member states an equal treatment, each according to their needs and each according to their aspirations. Unfortunately, over the past number of years it would appear as if there has been growing a two tier type of Europe and that the old catch phrase that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer is a definite statement of fact.  The Irish economy has been helped in many ways by the EC but I am afraid in its social policies and in its attempts to divide the cake equally in Europe Ireland has fallen far behind. Now with the accession of three countries which could be considered to be poor countries, Greece, Spain and Portugal, Ireland's position will not be enhanced. We will be competing still on the periphery with countries which have similar economic problems to ours.</P>

    <P>I wanted to have that letter written into the record so that we can have an answer from the Department to the questions raised by the Gaelic League in this case. <Col N="1031" /> There are other groups who have written. All of their submissions have been taken into account but that was the only one that came in Irish and it should be replied to in Irish by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the Community has had a major impact on our economy. This impact has been particularly visible in the area of high technology industry. Some of our traditional industries have suffered badly as a result of the limited free trade area of Europe.  There is a continuing downturn in these areas of traditional industry.  Our agricultural industry has been transformed by our membership of the Community.  There is no doubt but that our farmers have benefited from our membership and that there is a continued benefit for certain sectors of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The operation of the CAP is coming under excessive scrutiny and it is being blamed for all the ills of the Community. Even if CAP were, as traditionally operated, held to a reasonable level, because of the change in emphasis in farming in Europe with the arrival of Spain, Portugal and Greece, there will be a greater effort by these countries to have the northern European products eliminated from the CAP.  They will be suggesting that the Mediterranean products be helped.  These include fruit, vegetables, wine growing and so on.  Statistics in relation to the benefits we are getting out of Europe indicate we are getting them legitimately.  We are one of only four countries in Europe who has not fiddled the books to gain economic benefit from grants-in-aid from the Community.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this is a good or a bad thing.  If other countries are milking the system in Europe and getting away with it, if that is what has to be done then we should join those who reap the benefit rather than sit back and delight in the fact that we have not been involved in the illegal usage of Community funds.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander and this gander is not getting very fat on the benefits that are given to other countries.</P>
    <P>In today's news we heard of changes in <Col N="1032" /> the agricultural sector in Europe.  The Minister for Agriculture voted against the regimes being brought in particularly in the dairy area.  There can be short term benefits gained by people who want to get out of milk.  This means that for the next seven years they will be paid 28 pence per gallon for their milk quota. This would seem to be a crude instrument in the sense that people will now be paid for doing nothing.  I do not know whether it is better to pay people to do nothing than to subsidise people for overproducing. There could be an argument made on either side as to which is the better way of doing it.  The effect of this ruling from Brussels will be to drive a large number of small farmers with low quotas out of farming.  Of course their quotas will be taken up and will be for sale.  Apart from giving up and getting 28 pence per gallon, it did not say that the quota would be taken away from these farmers.  A milk quota system is of major benefit to farmers.  I am not too sure where the balance of advantage will come.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that what has happened in terms of a reduction from last January of 8½ per cent in Ireland's milk quota will mean the loss of approximately 2,400 jobs in the agri-business area over the next two or three years. These 2,400 jobs will not directly go in terms of one co-op going out of business but it is the equivalent of one major co-op group and their suppliers going out of business.  The question has to be asked now, where will those farmers who opt out of dairying go?  Into which area of farming can they go?  What will happen to their land?  There is no room for these farmers in cereals or root crops.  There is no wish within the EC to have an increase in dry stock because there is an overproduction of beef as well as an overproduction of milk.</P>
    <P>In the short term there is a possibility to go into intensive market farming but that is an area which is also limited because it has a high capital content. There could be possibilities in the long <Col N="1033" /> term of investment in forestry.  The Community should look positively at the situation regarding small farmers who will opt for the 28 pence a gallon for getting out of milk and possibly subsidise them to get into afforestation.  Over the next seven years they will have an income as a result of giving up the milk quota and in that time there will be a certain amount of growth in their forests.</P>
    <P>They will not get an income after seven years from afforestation but the EC will benefit considerably.  If after the seven years they then subsidise these farmers for a further period so that they would have an income, this could be offset against the very high returns they would get when the trees mature.  When we consider the amount of timber imported into the EC we should look at a major afforestation programme for Ireland.  We have the ideal climate and land for afforestation. The importation of timber and timber products into Europe is at a very high level.  There is an area of timber more than double the size of Ireland being taken from forests in Brazil and other countries and there will be a famine of timber and timber products by the turn of this century.  If we started an afforestation programme with help from the EC, instead of being an importer of timber and timber products we could be an exporter of such products to mainland Europe which could have an enormous benefit.  We should look at the possibility of giving aid to people who are getting out of the dairying sector in Ireland to get into forestry and to give them an additional seven years of subsidy until the timber matures.</P>

      <P>I was speaking before the break about the impact forestry could have on our economy and I saw it as an area in which the EC could get involved, particularly as a result of the decisions taken in Brussels last night.  I suggested that, since there is to be subsidisation of farmers who get out of milk production for the next seven years, they should be <Col N="1034" /> encouraged to get into forestry.  Seven years is not a long enough period within which trees would come to maturity and become profit-making but at least the trees would be seven years into maturity. Farmers should be allowed very cheap loans against the profits they would make on the maturing of the trees.  At all times there would be an income.  One of the problems in afforestation has been the fact that in the initial stages income is a problem.  I am glad to see that in certain areas it is being addressed.  I would like to see further progress in this area under the aegis of the EC.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural area we have been perceived by some of the economic &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; of Europe as being a drag on the EC.  Of course, we have not been a drag on the EC because we are small fry in terms of input into anything in the EC. We are small fry as regards our contributions and we are small fry in terms of surpluses we create, whether it be in beef or milk.  Nevertheless, we have had a political impact which was above and greater than the financial impact we have had.  The effects we have on the cultural, social and economic scenes have been of benefit to the Community.  We must ensure that this growth is not stultified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems in the EC which must be confronted and the greatest one of these problems is unemployment.  As I said earlier, these problems have been highlighted in every report we have got from the EC since we started getting the half-yearly reports.  Unemployment is one of the things these reports have suggested should be confronted.  The problems have not been confronted.  I am not too sure whether this is because there are a group of civil servants in Europe who spend most of their time travelling around Europe and they have not got a knowledge of the problems confronting the majority of people within the EC.  I am not too sure about that but obviously they have not been confronting this major problem.  I spoke earlier of a market place of 320 million people.  This sounds good in terms of numbers but it does not take into account the fact that there are 16 million unemployed in Europe of whom, <Col N="1035" /> according to the Young Ireland Movement, 235,700 are Irish.  I am not sure if this is an accurate figure.  At this stage it is probably closer to 250,000 rather than 235,700.</P>
    <P>I was looking today at statistics in the motor trade which is my business.  As a small trader in terms of business I looked deliberately at these figures this morning and saw that I have lost 79 customers in the past five years.  I did not lose one of those customers for any reason other than that they went out of business.  The reason for this was stultification of growth, the lack of interest in business in Ireland by Europe and the lack of interest by civil servants and the majority of people in Europe, I was confronted with a situation which could have closed my business if it were not for certain things I was given time to do.</P>
    <P>Every businessman in this country is facing these problems and Europe is not helping us.  We are facing them in small businesses every day of the week.  There are three Members here who are in what I would term the &ldquo;non-manufacturing&rdquo; area of business, or who have been associated with service industries.  It is disgraceful that not one solitary penny of State aid goes to industries which are in the service area.  We get no help from Europe.  This is an area which supports manufacturing industry.  We have to pay for the training of our people and we have to educate them.  I guarantee that all of the people who are in small business are in the tax net and are not being supported by the Revenue Commissioners or anybody else in the same manner in which State-subsidised industries are allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that in the future there will be no people to go into service industries. Nobody will go into a service industry because there is no impetus to help small businesses who are not in the area of industrial production for export.  There is no impetus in the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Foreign Affairs to get the European Community to realise that the service industries which are to be helped are not service industries <Col N="1036" /> in the high tech areas.  These are the only areas in which help can be given to service industries.  When the EC talk about service industries being helped and grants being available, they are talking about sending our highly trained people abroad.  That is the only area in which there is help.</P>
    <P>The situation at present is that there are probably 250,000 people unemployed in this country.  The Young Ireland Movement have attempted to highlight this. Equally there should be a highlighting of the fact that many thousands of jobs are being lost in Ireland because of the lack of rationalisation in the tax regimes.  When I listen to people on the radio and watch people on television justifying the fact that they go over the Border to shop because it is much cheaper to shop there, I get very annoyed.  They do not realise how many jobs are being lost in Ireland because of the fact that they are going over the Border to shop.  There is a need for rationalisation between ourselves and Great Britain with regard to tax rates.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me that we are one island and why not shop on the one island?  I agree that we should shop on the one island but the major spending done in the North of Ireland is not done in shops owned by Irish people.  Those shops are owned by people who come from New York, Canada and the United Kingdom.  Another major group are going to take advantage of this cross-Border exodus to set up a major shopping complex to cater for the cross-Border traffic.  Again it is owned by a British company so that the benefits are not going to stay in the Irish economy, in the Thirty-two Counties, but they are going to be repatriated to Great Britain.  I appeal to anybody who is considering going across the Border to buy a television, a fridge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The VAT rate in the North of Ireland on goods of the type I mentioned is 18 per cent whereas it is 25 <Col N="1037" /> per cent in the South.  There are other areas of tax in which there is a need for rationalisation.  The British VAT rate is not the lowest in Europe but because of our closeness to the UK scene we must get closer to their VAT rate.  There is a system where B &amp; I are shipping people across to England and giving them free bottles of whiskey.  You can get a trip to England and a bottle of whiskey cheaper than you can buy a bottle of Irish whiskey in Ireland.  That is crazy.  The Minister is suggesting we should not have tax-free shops at the point of entry into the country. That is a crazy idea.  Tax-free shopping should be available at the point of entry from a safety point of view if not for anything else.  If one were flying to Britain in a plane, I can guarantee that the most volatile fuel in the plane will be the whiskey that practically everybody is carrying.  Why not allow people to buy it when they arrive back?  We would do much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have benefited from our membership of the EC and I have suggested ways in which we could possibly have a continuing benefit.  There is no doubt that because of regimes which were brought into the EC to curb farm profits there has been a flight from the land.  Unfortunately this has not alone been a flight from the land in Ireland to cities in Ireland but it has been a flight from the land in Ireland to countries outside the EC.  Education is subsidised to a large degree as a result of our membership of the EC.  There are huge numbers of courses which are subsidised by the EC but, unfortunately, even Europe is not getting the benefit of this subsidisation. Because of its high unemployment at present, quite a number of our people from farms and colleges are going to countries outside the EC so the benefits are going outside the EC.  If the EC is subsidising education and we cannot provide jobs for people in Ireland, I would like to see the benefits of the subsidisation from Ireland and Europe being of benefit to Europe and, therefore, of indirect benefit to the State.  That is not happening. We have an increasing flight from the land and from the country and Europe is <Col N="1038" /> not able to take those people into its employment sector.  There are 100,000 fewer people working on the land now than there were when we joined the EC.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs have not spelled out the dangers to Ireland which might arise out of the implementation of the Single European Act.  The harmonisation of indirect taxes will create definite problems, particularly for us as a small country on the periphery of Europe.  We have huge problems in terms of the cost of transferring goods from our shores to mainland Europe. Harmonisation of indirect taxation will involve an estimated loss of £1 billion. There is no direct link between the completion of internal market and this figure of £1 billion because so many of the factors which will be involved in the rationalisation programme of taxes have not been confronted yet.  There is much talk about cross-Border, trans-border rationalisation but committees have not met.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Commission suggest that 1992 is the date for final harmonisation of tax regimes within the internal market. There is no hope that 1992 will be the date by which harmonisation can be achieved. Unless people confront the problems resulting from rationalisation it could be 2092 before there is a complete rationalisation. Unless other countries get involved more thoroughly then it would appear our Government and Departments are involved, the year 2092 would be a more realistic date for the completion of the internal market than 1992 as is suggested.  Regimes that were to be brought in in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 have not yet been addressed in Europe. They talk about the completion of the 1987 regimes in 1987 when we have not even completed the 1983 proposals.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Bill it might appear that I have been negative, but I see positive aspects in it.  I am very worried about our neutrality.  There is no short statement a Minister can make that will give me confidence that we will not be sucked into some form of anti-neutrality position. The Taoiseach was wrong to stay <Col N="1039" /> at the meeting of Ministers the other evening when military matters were being discussed.  He should have left the meeting and returned when they had finished discussing military matters even if, as he said, they were being discussed in an &ldquo;informal&rdquo; way.  The formation of thoughts happens in an insidious way.  If you listen constantly to people talking about something, the thoughts they are expressing can be transmitted to you.</P>
    <P>I have no time for people who say you should not listen, you should not learn, you should not read, you should not watch, but in a sensitive area such as our neutrality and the increasing pressures being put on us by the Americans on the one hand &mdash; and it would appear by the Americans in collusion with the Russians in another situation &mdash; a Taoiseach has to be very careful who he listens to.  I say the Americans and the Russians.  Look at the lies President Reagan told in terms of his supply of arms to Iran when he made his address to the people of the world and said the only arms transmitted would have fitted into a small plane. Under the Single European Act we have not got a single European passport.  We have not got a European passport, but McFarlane and North and his two other advisers had four Irish passports and a small plane load of arms for Iran.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw the remark that the President of America is a liar.  It is time we realised that there is an attempted manipulation of us within Europe by the very fact that Maggie <Col N="1040" /> Thatcher is a friend of President Reagan. If this Act is implemented, Britain will have a more major role to play than they have had in the past.  Mrs. Thatcher has attempted and succeeded to a large degree in stultifying comment about major areas of European policy.</P>
      <P>The Act has positive aspects and we go along with these.  We will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage which will say what the Irish people want us to say regarding our nuetrality.  They will be no more or no less than that.  I hope the Minister will give an assurance on a number of points raised during the debate.  I hope that at some stage a member of <i>The Irish Press</i> group will come in to the Seanad and report what is happening rather than, as they do at present, suggesting that there was not enough debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on this legislation.  <i>The Irish Press</i> group are a disgrace in their attitude towards this House.  I sincerely hope that in future they will take a more positive attitude to debates in the House which have a national interest rather than criticising the Houses of the Oireachtas for not taking cognisances of the implications of the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a short contribution to make and I will confine myself to general terms.  I welcome and support this legislation.  In the early seventies the Irish people were faced with a very clear choice.  They were helped in making their minds up with regard to that choice by many months of debate.  They were armed with adequate information supplied by those who wanted this country to be part of the European Community and also by those who felt that our future best lay outside that Community. Having assessed all the information available to the electorate the voters made their choice.  By a large majority they gave a clear decision &mdash; they decided that the future of this country best lay within the European Community.  The feeling was that the best prospects for the development of the nation and its people lay in being part of a growing and progressing community of nations.  During <Col N="1041" /> the years a number of surveys have shown that, if the same choice were put to the people again, perhaps at certain times not by the same massive majority, they would make the same decision.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act is a natural progression along the road to European unity and to the more effective operation of the Community.  Events have shown the wisdom of the decision that this country made in 1972.  I concur with certain points made by Senator Lanigan especially with regard to unemployment not being confronted and lack of support for the small businessman.  Once that kind of question is posed, it suggests that somehow or other unemployment and the success or the well being of the small businessman would be tackled better in alternative circumstances.  I am not aware of any alternative circumstances which would be available to us in which these two issues could be confronted better than they have been to date.  I admit the Community has not done all that I would expect it would have the capacity to do in relation to these two problems.  But I know of no alternative position that this country could have occupied which would have afforded it better opportunities to deal with what are pressing matters.</P>
      <P>It has not been a bed of roses all the way.  There have been difficulties.  There have been disappointments.  Nevertheless, I feel the balance has been very conclusively one of advantage.  The economic advantages and the benefits that have come to this country as a result of our membership have been very substantial. We must recognise that we are an economy depending on exports.  I understand that 70 per cent of our exports go to the other member states of the EC.  We can visualise the difficulties our economy would be confronted with if trade barriers existed between ourselves and the rest of Europe or the markets to which 70 per cent of our exports go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record also shows that the financial benefits to this country have been very substantial since 1973.  Having read the debate in the other House &mdash; I was not here for the Minister's speech but perhaps it is contained in it &mdash; I understand <Col N="1042" /> that approximately £4.7 billion has come to this country from the EC since 1973. In the year 1985 alone about £900 million came to this country.  Indeed, as other Senators have said, there is a market there of 320 million people.  We have access to that market.  If we did not have access to it the difficulties we would have to contend with would be enormous.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and the debate has been intense with regard to the measure now before the House.  I do not wish to be cast in the role of a reluctant European.  I also feel that it would be to the disadvantage of this country and its people if we were cast in that role &mdash; the role of reluctant Europeans &mdash; or, as somebody else put it, conditional members.  It is to our advantage that the Community should function effectively.  This measure which, I expect, we will, in due course, endorse is a means of ensuring that there is a more effective and improved functioning of the Community, a Community which has increased in membership from six to 12 member states since we first joined it.  I accept and believe that the Single European Act will also enhance the role of the Parliament.  I accept that the principle of consensus will be largely retained and I believe that at the end of the day we will have a more effective decision-making machine in place.  There are still adequate safeguards for the interests of member states concerned.  I believe &mdash; and Senator Lanigan accepted &mdash; that there is a need to strengthen the Community.  I am satisfied that it will be to our benefit to do so and I am satisfied that this Act is an effective way of doing that.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of our relationship with Europe which often concerns me.  Our history has somehow bred an inferiority complex into many of us.  To our detriment, we still carry that to this day.  Because of that complex &mdash; I hope it is receding and I hope it will shortly disappear &mdash; we are prevented from expressing ourselves or utilising as effectively as we could the opportunities that are often presented to us in many fields, in particular this field.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about neutrality.  I <Col N="1043" /> accept what the Minister said in his opening speech as follows:</P>
    <P>Our neutral position, therefore, is totally unaffected by the terms of the Single European Act.  Dáil Éireann has already recognised that this is so by approving a motion reaffirming Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances and nothing that this position is unaffected by the Single European Act.  I urge the Seanad to adopt a similar motion, put forward by Senator Dooge which, I am convinced, meets fully the concerns expressed in the Joint Committee's report.</P>
    <P>That says enough to satisfy me.  In relation to the matter of neutrality I believe it will remain intact for as long as the majority of the people of this country wish it to be so.  I fully support and endorse the measure before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Howard, and for much the same reasons, I will be comparatively brief in my contribution to this important debate.  Because I am physically unable to be here when the debate resumes tomorrow morning I will say what I have to say this evening.</P>
      <P>I begin by referring to a sentence in the Minister's speech, introducing the Bill to this House.  He says:</P>
      <P>The Single European Act has been the subject of extensive public debate a debate which the Government have welcomed and encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's view that the Government have welcomed and encouraged debate on the Single European Act.  Regrettably, the debate began very slowly in this country.  I do not blame the Government entirely for that.  There is an important role for Opposition parties, and indeed those not of the Government parties, in drawing attention to an extremely important measure.  In Denmark they had a referendum at the beginning of this year on the Single European Act.  Here we are in the Seanad, in the last week of this parliamentary session &mdash; perhaps in some sense the last <Col N="1044" /> week of the life of this Parliament &mdash; debating an extremely important measure, and doing so under undesirable constraints. It is undesirable that an important Bill of this kind should be debated at the last minute in the Seanad, in an extended Second Reading with a Committee Stage and other stages tomorrow as I understand it.  That is not in the public interest.  It is regrettable that we are examining and teasing out the economic, social and constitutional implications of this Bill up against that sort of deadline.</P>
    <P>I would like to begin &mdash; because it is my natural habitat &mdash; by looking briefly at the constitutional implications.  I note that the Minister, in his speech introducing the Bill to this House, dwelt at some length on the constitutional implications. I welcome that and it is a due recognition of the concern that is felt in political circles, by the general public, and, to a considerable degree, in legal circles.  There is a concern.  We have &mdash; this is a richness rather than anything else &mdash; a complex constitutional framework. We amended our Constitution to enable Ireland to accede to the three Communities. Ireland not only adopted the constitutional amendment but went ahead and became a member of the three Communities.</P>
    <P>We provided quite a tight formula that nothing in the Constitution would prevent us from taking any measures necessitated by our membership of the European Community.  Serious questions have been raised by lawyers and others about whether the two separate components of this Single European Act &mdash; first, the proposed amendments to the three treaties which are really the part we are concerned about in the Bill before the House and also the other part of the Single European act which contains the treaty provisions relating to European political co-operation &mdash; fit into the parameters of the constitutional amendment and enable the ratification by Ireland to be achieved by a resolution of the Dáil &mdash; this House does not require to provide a similar resolution &mdash; and the Bill which <Col N="1045" /> proposes to make the amendments to the treaties part of our domestic law.</P>
    <P>The Government did not give very adequate and full leadership in promoting an informed debate on the Single European Act.  That informed debate, therefore, was not generated at an early stage on the constitutional implications. It was only because the Government were forced into it that the explanatory memorandum on the Single European Act was produced in November, a month before the deadline for completing the ratification by Ireland and the other member states.  The debate, therefore, on the constitutional legal issues grew in a climate where there was not a very clearly set out position by the Government or by legal advisers on behalf of the Government.  As a result, there have been a number of articles written by law-years, and a number of letters written to the newspapers which is one way in which lawyers can seek to communicate on an issue of public importance.</P>
    <P>As it happens, I was one of those lawyers who in a sense felt constrained to enter the debate because it seemed extremely important to tease out in public and in adequate time the ramifications of the single European Act.  In a two-part article which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 and 25 November last I examined the two separate components of the Single European Act and noted as a personal conclusion that the ratification process does conform to the constitutional requirements and the constitutional framework.  I concluded that on balance, and I stand over it.  It is my view and that is the advice I would give if asked.  I do not feel that this is a black and white issue on which it is possible to say that this is the case and there cannot be any doubt about it.  I think it is my extremely difficult issue.  It is only when you look at the situation that the complexity of it is brought home.</P>
    <P>First, I would like to summarise briefly the core reasons why I came to that conclusion and to reiterate one point which I made in that article.  That was that we have a mechanism for obtaining an authoritative view on the constitutionality of <Col N="1046" /> this Bill and, therefore of an important part of the ratification process, and that is by the Bill being referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution in order to have a determination by the Supreme Court of its compatibility.  That is ultimately a decision for the President acting on the advice of the Council of State.  If at Government level a view is taken that there may be some doubt a matter can be referred to the Supreme Court.  For example, the proposed amendment to the electoral laws to enable British citizens to vote was referred to the Supreme Court who concluded that the Bill was not compatible with the provisions of the Constitution and, therefore, that Bill could not be signed by the President.  It did not proceed.  The alternative approach which was adopted, and which was carried successfully, was that we had a constitutional amendment because we required to amend our Constitution to achieve the objectives.</P>
    <P>As an individual I remain of the view that if the Bill were referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26, that court would conclude &mdash; and there is only one judgment of the Supreme Court on a reference &mdash; that the Bill is constitutional but that would have a significant number of positive factors for our society.  It would be an authoritative view.  Any view expressed either by the Minister, by individual Senators or even by those of us who are lawyers and Senators, is only an individual view.  It actually does not carry any more weight than the degree of knowledge or the degree of time and effort that the individual has put into looking into it or, in the case of the Minister the quality of the legal advice, which he has available to him, which I have no doubt on this occasion would be quite significant.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter on which it is prudent to have a dogmatic view.  I have not read the text of the Official Report of the Dáil as I do not think the debate is available yet but I was interested to read the contribution of Deputy John Kelly, an authority on constitutional law.  It seemed he <Col N="1047" /> was sounding a somewhat similar warning, that this is a very difficult area and we have a mechanism for being able to invoke the authoritative, interpretative ruling of the Supreme Court.  It seems to be politically desirable that we would do so.  The only reason not to do so is because of this time scale where it is politically desired, and politically aspired to, that the Twelve member states would complete the ratification process by 1 January 1987.  Can there be the slightest doubt that other member states would, and must, respect our ratification process if it is part of that process that the Bill in question be referred to our Supreme Court for an authoritative ruling on its constitutionality?  Not another member state would dream of criticising us for taking to the fullest extent necessary the ramifications of our sovereign constitutional process.  There would be no criticism politically, there could be no criticism politically because it would be recognised that this was a responsible and proper step to take.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that these are extremely complex areas &mdash; not a black and white situation, it is valid or it is not valid, it is constitutional or it is not constitutional. These are quite innovative areas which require a unique consideration of issues which have never arisen before.  This has never been determined in this way before.  At present the Government are acting on the advice available to them, others are expressing concern on the basis of their advice and that is the height of it.</P>
    <P>What I pointed out in that article &mdash; I note that a somewhat similar approach was adopted in the Government's explanatory memorandum &mdash; which was not available when I was compiling the article &mdash; was that the test of whether the Bill was compatible with our Constitution appeared to be along the following lines and I quote from my article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 25 November, 1986, as follows:</P>
    <P>... are the proposed amendments within the existing framework of the three original treaties, or do they go <Col N="1048" /> beyond the &ldquo;four corners&rdquo; of those original treaties and/or contain provisions that are inconsistent with our Constitution?  If so, a new constitutional amendment to enable Ireland to participate in the same manner in which the Third Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1972, enabled us to participate in the original treaties.</P>
    <P>The question requires a determination of whether the amendments as they are contained in Title II to the Single European Act, as summarised in the explanatory memorandum, are within the context and framework of the original treaties, or whether they go beyond.</P>
    <P>To some extent a judgment on that is a political judgment rather than a legal one.  It depends on what a person's understanding of the commitment to the European Communities is.  The commitment is one which is understood by those who are supportive of Ireland's participation in the European Community as being an evolutionary process, one which is a step towards political union.  It may take some time but that is the road we embarked on.  Others do not necessarily see it in that light.  In assessing whether Title II and the specific amendments to the decision-making process, qualified majority, a co-operative role for the Parliament in legislation, how a two-tier court structure will fit in, is to some extent as much a political as a legal judgment.</P>
    <P>There is the other part of the argument as to the relevance in this context of the clause in the constitutional amendment of 1972 that it would have a saver that nothing in the Constitution would be invoked to invalidate any measures adopted which were &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities&rdquo;. It will be recalled that the Bill to amend the Constitution, introduced in late 1971, or early 1972, had the wording &ldquo;not necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities but consequent on the obligations of membership of the Communities.&rdquo;  The debate on Second Stage in the Dáil at the time showed a concern about the phrase <Col N="1049" />&ldquo;consequent on&rdquo;, that that was broad enough to open up a kind of political development which we might not envisage, which might lead on to a political commitment which would cause concern. It could lead to a developing European Defence Community provided it was consequent on our membership of the European Communities.  It was because of that that the wording was tightened by way of amendment so that nothing in the Constitution could be invoked to invalidate any measures adopted which were necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>Those who are concerned about constitutionality have pointed out that the Single European Act is not necessitated by membership of the European Community and I would accept that it is not necessitated.  It is a political decision for us whether we ratify it.  We are not legally obliged to ratify it.  Ratification is not necessitated by our membership of the European Communities so there is a difficult assessment to be made of what is the scope of constitutional immunity of a kind for measures taken.</P>
    <P>In analysing it, it appeals to me that whereas the Single European Act is not necessitated by the obligations of membership if we decide to ratify it in this way and include the components of the Single European Act in Title II as this Bill proposes as part of the original treaties, then it will become part of the domestic law of the State and any steps supsequently taken by Ireland on foot of amendments to the Treaty would be necessitated by the obligations of membership.  Is that what was intended by the constitutional amendment?  I have expressed a view on it and I stand over that view.  However, I would not like to have it put out that this is easy and obvious and that there was no doubt about it.  There is doubt among lawyers about it.  The general opinion is probably that the Single European Act and the ratification process of the Single European Act is compatible with our constitutional framework and that the approach adopted is one which conforms to the obligations under our <Col N="1050" /> Constitution.  That would only be a dominant legal view.  There would be a strong minority within that.  There is a process for ensuring that there would be an authoritative ruling on it.</P>
    <P>In my very limited time on this Bill I have found it necessary to focus a little on the issue of constitutionality because that is where I started my own assessment of the Bill.  There is a separate issue, which is the development of accountability for what steps are taken under the Single European Act.  In this regard I would like the Minister when replying to the debate to give a clear assurance to the House that the provisions of the Single European Act in relation to European political co-operation will be fully covered in the bi-annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That report which is fairly regularly debated in this House covers developments in the European Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the report on the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  There is a chapter on European political co-operation.  I have found that that chapter is not as detailed or as revealing as some of the other provisions.  I would be keen to see that incorporation of European political co-operation in a treaty format would result in a much more explicit and overt accountability.  One of the means of doing that would be through a further development of the limited reference which takes place through European political co-operation.  This is an area which gives rise to very acute concern in Ireland.  I share the concern at a political level in that I take very seriously our commitment to neutrality.  It is one of the most positive aspects of our foreign policy.  I hope we will grow and develop in our approach to what it means for us as a member state, its potential both within the European Community and in particular in our relations with other countries and, in that regard, especially our relations with developing countries. I would hope to have another opportunity to speak on that in the context of the <Col N="1051" /> motion to establish a committee on foreign policy which will be resumed in this House tomorrow evening because I think it is a very relevant time to be considering such a committee.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Treaty provisions in Part III of the Single European Act it appears to me, because like anyone else who has not been directly involved in the process it is very difficult to know what goes on at the moment on European political co-operation, that we are dependent on the extent to which either Ministers or civil servants are prepared to comment on what are basically private and very inaccessible sessions.  Title III of the Single European Act appears to represent the state of the art of European political co-operation.  I can understand why some of the provisions, particularly Article 6, give rise to acute concern.  My view is that it is too late for us to disengage from a process which we have been thoroughly involved in since we became a member of the European Community. It is far better for us.</P>

      <P>Before Committee Stage begins I want to inform the House that Amendments Nos. 69 and 70 have been ruled out of order on the ground of involving a potential charge upon revenue.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 18 to 20, to delete the definition of &ldquo;archaeological area&rdquo; and to substitute the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo; `archaeological area' means an area which the Commissioners consider to be of archaeological importance but does not include the area of <Col N="1052" /> a historic monument standing entered in the Register;&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is being introduced for the purpose of clarity.  There is a danger that the present wording could be interpreted as meaning that an area which contains a national monument could not be an archaeological area.  Nearly all archaeological areas such as the mediaeval cores of our towns and cities would contain structures which are by definition national monuments.  However, as the Bill provides different types of protection for archaeological areas than it does for monuments, it is necessary to exclude historic monuments from the archaeological areas in which they are situated. In other words, an archaeological area will be the entire area of archaeological importance less the area of any protected monument within its bounds.  The revised wording clarifies this intention.</P>
      <P>There are two provisions in the Bill relating to archaeological areas, namely, section 2 which provides that possession of a detection device in an archaeological area without a consent is an offence and section 5 which provides that an archaeological area may be entered in the register and that owners of the property within the areas are required to give two months notice of the intention to carry out works.</P>

      <P>I am not altogether clear regarding this amendment.  The only difference, as I understand it, is that the wording has been changed around: &ldquo;standing entered in the Register&rdquo;, has been added.  That is the only effective change.  The Register of Historic Monuments is dealt with in section 5.  The amendment defines an &ldquo;archaeological area&rdquo; as &ldquo;an area which the Commissioners consider to be of archaeological importance but does not include the area of a historic monument standing entered in the Register&rdquo;.  With regard to the matter of being considered by the Commissioners, would it not be necessary to tie this in to section 5, for <Col N="1053" /> example, to phrase it in such a way as to say &ldquo;as set out in section 5&rdquo;, or &ldquo;as detailed in section 5&rdquo; in order to make it clear that there is more to consider than just a determination by the Commissioners that it actually refers to section 5.  That is the important question I want to ask.  Secondly, I am not clear why the area of an historic monument is excluded.  Presumbaly it is for some technical reason.  I wonder is it necessary to exclude the site.  I take this to mean the actual site of an historic monument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just a definition and we will be redefining it here, to apply to any section of the Bill specifically sections 2 and 5.  The Senator's concerns in that area, I feel, are adequately taken care of.  I referred to them just a few moments ago and I accept what he is saying.  This is needed for the purposes of clarity because, as the definition is at the moment on page 3 section 1 (1), it is possible to interpret what is already there in the Bill as meaning that an area which contains a national monument could not be an archaeological area.  This is our draftsman's advice to us and we are accepting it.  There is nothing involved other than clarity in ensuring that we achieve what we are setting out to achieve. The definition as we now redefine it will apply to all sections, particularly section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I paused for a moment actually.  In relation to Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 there may be some confusion about the purpose of including the phrase &ldquo;and also includes all monuments in existence before 1700 A.D.&rdquo;, in the definition of an historic monument.  The intention is that all monuments which were in existence before that date will be historic monuments by reason of their age and without regard to whether they have any architectural or historical interest.  This does not mean they must necessarily be preserved, but it does mean that they are worthy of note and of being recorded and that consideration should be given to any proposals to remove or to destroy them.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the National Archaeological Survey in the sixties it has been accepted that any monuments which were in existence before 1700 A.D. should be recorded and the survey of urban archaeology which was commenced in 1982 and which is now nearing completion also takes 1700 A.D. as the cut off point.  The selection of any date is arbitrary but it will be seen that the year 1700 A.D. is now well rooted in archaeological practice in this country. Of course all monuments post 1700 A.D. which are associated with the commercial, cultural, economic, industrial, military, religious or social history are also historic monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimon's amendment substituting &ldquo;1900 A.D.&rdquo; for &ldquo;1700 A.D.&rdquo; would bring a very large section of the existing building stock of the country within the ambit of the Bill.  Post-1700 A.D. buildings, as I have said, are not excluded but our protection of these has to be selective.  For these reasons I cannot accept either of these amendments. <Col N="1055" /> Amendment No. 5 is suggested also by the National Monuments Advisory Committee. It will go some way towards meeting the wishes of Senators that a later date than &ldquo;1700 A.D.&rdquo; should be specified. This will allow the Minister for Finance to revise the dateline in the course of time.  However, I am convinced that the task of identifying all the pre-1700 monuments should be more or less complete before a later date is set.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is to substitute &ldquo;1900 A.D.&rdquo;for &ldquo;1700 A.D.&rdquo; The Minister said the date is an arbitrary one.  It does seem that 1900 A.D. is a more realistic date considering the fact that an historic wreck, is determined as being 100 years old or more.  From that point of view it is more realistic to have the date 1900 A.D.  By retaining 1700 A.D. we exclude many important monuments. I mentioned the workhouses which were erected before the Famine in, 1845.  Very few of them are in good condition.  I specifically mentioned one of them in Dunshaughlin as an example of a building more or less in its pristine state externally, and it could be easily restored to what it was originally.  That type of building is excluded.  The workhouses in Dunshaughlin, may be the only example of its kind extant.  Also the sites of confrontations in the 1798 insurrection would be excluded.  I refer to one in my own area where the final battle took place, Rathlin Hill.  The insurgents took their places in a field of corn and the soldiers on the hill were able to pick them out, mark them and defeat them very easily. That is an historic site and it is worth retaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I made myself clear.  Quite honestly we are not excluding all post-1700 A.D. buildings.  I apologise if I am not clear enough.  It could save a lot of cross discussion if I repeated what I said.  Post-1700 buildings are not excluded but our protection of these will be selective rather than on a blanket and automatic basis.  Any of those monuments Senator Fitzsimons mentioned will <Col N="1056" /> be and could be included.  There is no blanket exclusion for everything post-1700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not include a date that will be a blanket protection for them as well?  The Minister dealt with this when the Bill was introduced on Second Stage in this House.  I am tempted to quote the Minister, but the quotation might be too long.  In replying to the Second Stage debate, the Minister again dealt with this matter and reiterated that the year 1700 A.D. was adequate.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 31 December the Minister is reputed to have stated in London that under current legislation national monuments are limited to buildings of historic interest that pre-date the year 1700 but the new legislation will include buildings of historic or architectural interest, regardless of their age.</P>
      <P>My question is: if the Minister is so sure the year 1700 is sufficient, why introduce an amendment to insert &ldquo;or such later date as the Minister may appoint by regulations&rdquo;?  I presume this amendment, if agreed by the House, would be sufficient to give the Minister power to make regulations.  I cannot see this power in the Bill except in relation to fees.  If the Minister is absolutely sure 1700 A.D. is an appropriate date it would not be necessary to include this amendment.  In tabling this amendment, the Minister is admitting that, to leave the section as it is with the date 1700 A.D., is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>In discussing this amendment I would just like to explore it a little further.  The question of 1700 A.D. puzzles me.  I understand what the Minister has said.  &ldquo;Historic monument&rdquo; includes any monument associated with the commercial, cultural, economic, industrial, military, religious or social history of the place where it is situated or of the country and also includes all monuments in existence before 1700 A.D.  Am I to take from that, that every monument prior to 1700 A.D. will be listed and that other monuments post-1700 A.D. which have a commercial, cultural, economic <Col N="1057" /> industrial, military, religious or social history attached to them could well be included in the list of historic monuments?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That brings up a number of questions for the Minister and the Office of Public Works.  The Minister's appointment is recent &mdash; I hope she will be there for many years to come.  She has been there for a relatively short time. Ministers come and go and I am not talking in particular about the Office of Public Works.  This is part and parcel of the way in which we manage our affairs. These Bills are meant to last much longer than Ministers or Governments, Taoisigh or whatever.  In the greater Dublin area, the city of Dublin &mdash; I am taking the boundaries as they existed prior to the 1985 local elections &mdash; the following monuments are listed by the Office of Public Works: Grange Abbey Church, Raheny and St. Audeon's Church in High Street.  I played a major part in getting funds for the restoration of that church. Some parts of it date back to the 6th century.  The Casino in Marino, the Chapter House in Mary's Abbey, Howth, and Wood Quay are there as well.  I understand that when a question was posed recently to the Office of Public Works they did not mention Wood Quay as one of them.  Perhaps there is some difficulty with the construction or buildings completed on the site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are familiarly known as the bunkers around this town. Will we get movement in the Office of Public Works and a recognition of monuments, buildings, sectors of our architectural heritage which have been ignored by the Office of Public Works to an extent which is unbelievable in international terms.  Large parts of this city &mdash; I am speaking of 18th century Dublin &mdash; have been denied recognition by this State.  There is a form of recognition under list 1 of the city development plan. <Col N="1058" /> I realise that what is in the minds of the Office of Public Works, the commissioners and, the chairman of the commissioners is that, if they recognise a building as an historic monument and list it as such, inevitably those who own the structures will be looking for funds from the State to restore, rehabilitate and keep it in good order.  Merrion Square, in my view, should be treated as a national monument.  It is not a national monument and, as far as I can see from the way the Bill seems to be falling into place at present, it will not be a national monument in living memory.  It is not just a problem of not having funds to spend on these squares.  I grant the Minister this in relation to the question of funds &mdash; funds are scarce for conservation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the point I am trying to make.  Many buildings post-1700, squares, parts of the fabric of the city in Dublin and towns through the country will not get recognition from the Office of Public Works if they get away with this.  I do not trust in the Office of Public Works to actually start recognising buildings, or terraces of buildings, or squares that have some value, historical and architectural, but so far have got limited attention.  The Office of Public Works are going for cover.  They do not want to release money.  They have not got the money to give historic monument status to an area like Merrion Square.  If they would move, we could give it a status well and truly above the status it has at the moment under list 1 of the development plan.</P>

      <P>Where are the Senator's priorities?  I reiterate the various points I made in relation to what I feel are really unfounded fears about the inclusion of the date 1700.  Everything pre-1700 will automatically be included and be deemed to be an historic monument. Anything post-1700 that should be included on the register under the various categories we have, commercial cultural, economic, industrial, military, religious or social history, can be included and the provision and the mechanism will be there for inclusion.</P>
      <P>For pragmatic reasons really the year 1700 was taken and also because that has been well tried and practised in this area previously on other archaeological issues and one thing and another.  We could not include everything up to 1900. I do not think it would be pragmatic and I do not think at this point it would be necessary.  The reason we are allowing the Minister to move the date forward from 1700 to any other date he may see fit in the future is that, as time marches on, in the year 2010 or 2020 when we are looking at this legislation, perhaps 1800 will be a better reference date to have blanket inclusion in relation to our Register of Historic Monuments.</P>

      <P>If it takes as long as it has to get here today to get to the next one, I am not sure that we should have it.  I really do think the fears are unfounded and I hope I can convince the Senator that that is the case.  I would just <Col N="1060" /> like to refer again to the point Senator FitzGerald made and his very genuine concern about groups of buildings not having been protected.  They have never been protected because, up to now, our definition of a national monument, or now as we redefine as an historic monument, has been in the singular, a building or a structure above or below the ground. Amendment No. 59, if the Senator cannot be with us when we get it, will broaden that definition to include groups of buildings so we can protect our streetscapes and our urban scapes and all these other areas that we all have tremendous concern about particularly in our bigger cities and here in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to wrecks we are taking the datum line of around 1900, give or take 14 or 15 years.  From that point of view it seems to me realistic to more or less keep to that date.  I have followed very closely what the Minister has said but, at the same time, an historic monument is defined here in this section as a monument in existence before 1700 A.D. Section 5 deals with the Register of Historic Monuments.  So clearly, a monument on the Register of Historic Monuments will be protected.</P>
      <P>I am not clear whether the Minister is saying there was scope within the Bill before this amendment to include a monument that came into existence after the year 1700 but it seems to me that there must have been serious doubt in the Minister's mind when this amendment was moved.  In giving the Minister power to make regulations to update the period, the Minister will not be updating one particular monument, in other words, later on if it is changed to the year 1800 it will not be for a specific monument; it will cover a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore from the point of view of consistency with regard to wrecks and monuments, with regard to the special protection given to historic monuments, I really feel 1900 should be <Col N="1061" /> included.  I agree that this amendment gives the Minister power which can be exercised presumably when representations are made by the Office of Public Works and by other bodies as well. At this time it can be amended to bring it up to the year 1700 A.D. and it seems to me that that is the proper course to take.</P>
      <P>I have to agree with Senator FitzGerald's and Senator Connor's amendment because, in effect, that does widen the scope to bring the time up to the present if necessary.  It is a reasonable amendment having regard to all those facts.  I do not understand the definition of historic monument where it says, &ldquo;where it is situated or of the country ...&rdquo; Does that mean it belongs to the country?  I am not too clear about that. With regard to a pre-historic monument, I understand that means before the formal writing of history.  I am not sure what period that applies to.  It would be before the year 1700.  It seems unnecessary to include this definition, seeing that all monuments of this kind before the year 1700 are included anyway.  Pre-historic times go back much further than 1700 A.D.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to find myself at variance with my fellow Senators.  I think to advance this from 1700 to 1900 is a retrograde step in regard to getting on with the work of trying to deal with our national monuments.  The Bill says every monument before 1700 is an historic monument.  I look back to section 2 of the original Act to find out what is a monument, and it includes &ldquo;any erection whether above or below the surface of the ground.&rdquo;  I think what we now say in the Bill unamended is that every scratching stone standing in the middle of a field that has been there since before the year 1700 is an historic monument and must be taken account of by the Board of Works.  During the Second Stage debate we heard that they are finding difficulty reaching on all the work that has to be done on historic monuments. An undue burden has been already placed on those who have to carry out <Col N="1062" /> the work by talking about &ldquo;everything&rdquo;. Every erection that has been there since before 1900 is a monument and according to this is an historic monument and, therefore, must be taken into account in the inventories, in the lists and eventually in the surveys.  It would be disastrous to bring that up to 1900.  It might be better to shove it backwards.</P>

      <P>I do not entirely agree with Senator Dooge.  I wonder whether in introducing the year 1700 we are isolating all the protection of the Office of Public Works to buildings or structures prior to 1700.  I would have thought that it would be much better obviously to be protecting our early civilisation and then to be taking care of buildings of architectural importance through the ages, including the eighteenth century when the highest points of craftsmanship in this country were achieved on such buildings that merited attention by the State.  Can we expect the Office of Public Works to begin to include squares, terraces and buildings post-1700 A.D.?</P>

The Minister mentions in the Bill, under the heading of &ldquo;historic monument&rdquo; the religious or social aspect.

I understand there may be some constitutional difficulty with it.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Senator Fitzsimons was wondering why we had the 100-year rule in relation to the wrecks, and the year 1700 was mentioned in relation to other historic monuments. In relation to the wrecks and underwater archaeology generally, we are being said, as it were, by the Council of Europe's committee of experts on this.  This is, the year or the figure A.D. that the Council of Europe recommends and is the one we are following in line with.  In fact, we are ahead of some of our European partners but we are falling in line with what the experts in Europe feel we should be doing and that is why we are taking a pre-100 year rule on this occasion.  Anything later than 100 years old in relation to wrecks can, and will more than likely, if there is historical, archaeological or artistic importance attached to them be deemed to be historic monuments in the same way as will any particular wreck less than 100 years old.  The year 1700 still seems to be troubling some of the Senators.  Our archaeological survey has been based on the year 1700 A.D. and with blanket coverage for anything before that year.  As Senator Dooge pointed out, there is an enormous amount of work.  There are <Col N="1064" /> pragmatic and logistical problems involved in bringing any year forward and taking any arbitrary year but we need not fall out over it.  We would weaken the work we are doing with our older monuments if we bring in all the newer, important structures.  We are not denying their importance.  The more important under the various categories we have mentioned can be selectively included as historic monuments.  Nothing important post-1700 A.D. need be excluded.  There will not be automatic inclusion of structures post-1700.  There are good pragmatic reasons why we should not bring that year forward but we have left the provision there for any future Minister to choose another year, if needs be.  If our archaeological survey is complete and we have done our work as we should on everything pre-1700, there is no reason why we should not come forward in steps, but we will take that as it comes.  As of now, I think 1700 is a reasonable year.  It has been well tried in the archaeological area generally as a reasonable year to cut off in terms of blanket coverage, but selective coverage will be done where necessary, on any monument post-1700.</P>
      <P>Churches and various other issues were mentioned.  There are constitutional problems in relation to subventing religion which is where the churches are being actively used, and so on.  There is also an enormous problem with our embarrassment of riches in the area of churches and all of this heritage.  If we once put our foot in the door, I do not think we are in a position to be able to help realistically, except perhaps we could consider some listing or protection in that way, but that is not as it is at present, or it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator A. Fitzgerald mentioned the point we will be dealing with in amendment No. 59 in terms of streetscapes. Under the UK law they operate conservation area orders which I would love to have in this country.  That would come under planning Acts and the Department of the Environment legislation.  We cannot afford to wait until we have a Bill that will protect our streetscapes and our conservation areas.  There is a mechanism <Col N="1065" /> by which we can include protection by extending our definition of historic monuments from the singular to the plural.  I think we must do that while waiting for our planning law and the planning Acts to be amended and further broadened in relation to this area.  That is why I have requested that we put it somewhere in our Statute Book so that at least we have requested that we put it somewhere in our Statute Book so that at least we have a vehicle in case we need to get in and protect an important streetscape or area. We will then be able to do it.  That is long awaited.  I hope I have covered the various points.</P>

      <P>I want to ask about State-owned buildings, buildings that are presumably in the care of the Office of Public Works.  Occasionally the Office of Public Works takes a decision.  The commissioners meet or the Minister meets the commissioners on a Friday morning behind closed doors.  They decide they will put a building that has been in the protection of the State for public tender and they dispose of it.  This does happen occasionally.  Now, are these buildings protected, whether they are before 1700 or after?  Obviously if they are before 1700 they are but if you have a building after 1700, would the State not decide to put it on the market but not to give it any recognition as a national monument because that would complicate things from their point of view or from the market point of view.</P>

I come from a county that is fairly rich in historic monuments, as you know, apart from the controversial recent one which was discovered.  There are historic monuments at Cashel and Clarecastle, and other sites around Carrick-on-Suir. The State has expended a lot of money in my county and it would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge it.  Apart from the dates chosen here, I think it is appropriate to put on record the appreciation of people in South Tipperary for the tremendous work done, particularly on the Rock of Cashel, on Cormac's Chapel and the Vicar's Choral, which I <Col N="1067" /> used, with the permission of the Constitution, for an act of worship.</P>

With regard to our county development plan I want to pay a tribute to our retired County Development Officer and Planning Officer, Eamonn McLoughlin.  He has listed every particular monument, whether the Office of Public Works have it in charge or whether they might in the future take it in charge.  Anything worth nothing in the county has been listed.  I would suggest that if the Minister wanted to extend the date or to bring in other dates she should refer to the county development plan.  There she will find every conceivable scratching stone and everything else listed and documented historically and otherwise.  That is a tribute to somebody like Eamonn McLoughlin, who managed to do that as part of his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Ferris comes from an area that has an abundance of historic records and historic monuments.  Indeed, I do as well. No matter what part of Ireland one comes from, there is an abundance of very important monuments.  With regard to what Senator Dooge has said, that even scratching stones which were erected before 1700 will be preserved, I am not sure what category they would come into, whether commercial, cultural or economic. At the same time, I accept the point he is making that monuments which pre-date 1700 are well catered for generally. I understand him to be making that point and I accept that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 18th century was a very important time for this country and we have very important monuments dating from that period.  I appreciate what the Minister has said, that for the monuments which pre-date 1700 there is this automatic inclusion of protection.  The point is that there are many people who feel that a hundred years later, in the 18th century, <Col N="1068" /> there were many monuments which should automatically be protected.  I will just make this final comment.</P>
    <P>Take for example, the graveyards, cemeteries or whatever we like to call them around the country.  I know quite a few of them that have very important remains from the penal times such as thatched churches.  There is a little graveyard within two miles of Kells at Dulane, which has a national monument.  It is the remains of a very important structure. The Minister will correct me on this if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is no prohibition on anybody with a metal detector going in to those graveyards and within the sight of an old church to excavate and see what can be found.  There are many such areas.  In that period when we had the famine we had the workhouses built, as well as some wonderful bridges and thatched houses, all things are worth preserving.  They are worthy of automatic protection and inclusion.</P>
    <P>In tabling this amendment, the Minister also concedes the point that there are many monuments which are worthy of protection.  That facility is available to the Minister but I do not think it should be left as a choice to the Minister.  I think it should be incorporated in this Bill. By getting a datum line which is more realistic &mdash; which is a possibility and I accept what the Minister has said &mdash; will improve the Bill.  That important period I mentioned should be included and it should not be left to the decision of the Minister or for somebody to make representations to a Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Ferris for his kind remarks.  I will convey them to the relevant sections in the Office of Public Works.  Indeed, I am very aware of the enormous amount of good work we do.  One of the big problems with the Office of Public Works is that they have been in the front-line for criticism for some minor issues &mdash; and even major issues &mdash; but the enormous amount of good work they have done consistently in the area of protection of our built-in natural heritage has gone unlauded.  It is time we recognised and <Col N="1069" /> got our perspective correct in relation to this most important work that is going on.</P>
      <P>Pre-historic versus historic &mdash; I forgot to comment on that aspect.  I think it was Senator Fitzsimons in his second last contribution who mentioned it.  The word &ldquo;pre-historic&rdquo; is being included here also on the recommendation of the National Monuments Advisory Council, lest any purist would take us up on the definition of what is actually historic or recorded. You could have a very old monument, artefact or structure that would be pre-historic. If anyone wanted to be purist, they could perhaps say it is not historic, it is pre-historic, and could try and make a difference between both of those.  It is on advice to ensure that we do not leave ourselves open for challenge in relation to the definition of what is historic that we have included the word &ldquo;pre-historic&rdquo; there also.</P>
      <P>I will not go into the argument again about the datum line of 1700.  I made my point reasonably clear, I hope, in relation to it.  I have listened carefully to what the Senators have said.  I would like to say, however, to Senator Fitzsimons in regard to his mid-18th century graveyard and metal detector scenario that it would be illegal to go into that graveyard with a metal detector searching for any archaeological object regardless of whether it was listed as a national monument or not. As long as it is your intention to search for archaeological objects you would be out of order, according to this Bill.  That situation would be protected under this Bill.  There is nothing to stop that graveyard being selectively included as a historical monument or, indeed, any other structure or building or group of structures or buildings above or below the ground if they are post-1700 A.D. on our register of historic monuments.  That would be as I intend it to be.  I intend it to be fairly thoroughly done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine an enormous amount of pre-1800 structures of any kind would be included because of their status in terms of what we are talking about.  Pre-1900 you would have a lesser amount, but more selective.  As the next century gets closer, <Col N="1070" /> we are talking about a vernacular architecture and it would be even on a more selective basis.  We would have to preserve as monuments the best examples of each generation's built heritage and, indeed, natural heritage to some extent, too, and that is what we are about.  The blanket coverage would only date pre-1700.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 10, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall not own or use a detection device without licence and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people feel detection devices should be licensed.  There are very few areas in which a metal detector is used apart from searching for buried treasure. I know the Minister has referred to somebody using a metal detector to locate an underground pipe or an underground cable but, to my knowledge, such cases are few and far between.  The majority of people who have a metal detector have it for the purpose of searching for buried treasure, artefacts and other items buried under the surface.  Therefore, no matter what legislation is introduced a metal detector is a danger in most circumstances. Perhaps when this Bill is enacted and becomes law there will be less sale for metal detectors because there will be less use for them.  From the point <Col N="1071" /> of view of potential damage to archaeological sites by people with metal detectors, it would be a simple matter to provide that those who purchase, have or own a metal detector are obliged to take out a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what Senator Fitzsimons said, would there be a danger that if people had a licence they would feel completely free to go all over the place, as distinct from people who at the moment are going all over the place, perhaps feeling they are not legally doing so, but chancing their arms?  I would be afraid if you licensed people to have these detectors they would have a sense of freedom and would feel they were within the law almost and that you could not stop them.  I see that difficulty about what the Senator has just said.</P>

To be in possession of one at a certain place is a clearer definition.  The Senator may have in mind that nobody should legally own a detection device except with a licence. This would be going further than intended.  There are many legitimate uses for metal detectors.  They are used for tracing pipes and cables.  It was not the intention to extend the scope of this section to cover such uses.  Neither was it the intention to completely outlaw treasure hunting as a hobby.  In fact, we are going further than any other country in the restrictions we are imposing in relation to metal detectors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 20 to 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Senator Harte in this amendment is suggesting the removal of the words between lines 20 and 23 on page 4 of the Bill, in section 2 (1) (b) to delete, &ldquo;use, at a place other than a place specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a detection device for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects&rdquo;.  This suggested amendment would make it much simpler for the parliamentary draftsman.  The effect of the section is to restrict the use of metal detectors.  Apparently infringing the prohibition involves a fine of £1,000 or six months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) is open to challenge on three grounds: on the propriety of its policy, on the uncertainty of the offence, and because the penalty is excessive.  It could be readily accepted that the unauthorised use of metal detectors at known archaeological sites should be prohibited. This is the intention of section 2 (1) (a).  The presumption in that, if the sites are in State care or are sites of which the new register will have cognisance, the authorities are perfectly capable of organising their own searches and will not welcome help or interference.  In Great Britain the proposed section 2 (1) (a) has a counterpart in section 42 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act, 1979, which makes it an offence to use a metal detector in a protected place involving a fine of £200.  The British Act does not, however, make it an offence to search for archaeological objects at places other than the known protected sites.</P>
    <P>This leads one to ask why a person should be forced to obtain permission to look for archaeological objects, or why he should be penalised with a fine of £1,000 or six months imprisonment if he had neglected to obtain permission.  On the balance of probability, the enthusiast would spend his weekends searching for archaeological objects with a metal detector and would be doing something no official or professional agency would be attempting.  The Minister has confirmed that in her contribution.  On the same balance of probability it can be suggested that the enthusiast will, in the <Col N="1073" /> unlikely event that he finds something of value, give news of it to the world, as has happened.  In any case, there is no harm in searching for things because if harm is done it will be through inexpert excavation. To discourage searching, however, is to place obstacles in the way of the increase of knowledge.  The right policy is surely to encourage people to report what they may find.  This is a principle that the draftsman has obviously recognised in dealing with wrecks in section 3 of the Bill which states:</P>
    <P>A person who finds a wreck (being a wreck which is more than 100 years old) or other object (being an archaeological object) that is lying on, in or under the sea bed or on or in land covered by water, shall, within 14 days after such finding, make a report of the finding to a member of the Garda Síochána or to the Commissioners...</P>
    <P>The fine for failure to comply with this section is £1,000.  There is no threat of imprisonment.  It may be observed that if the draftsman had sought to protect wrecks in the manner in which he proposes to protect objects in the earth, he would have prohibited diving with intent and made the possession of an aqualung in the vicinity of a wreck an offence akin to that of being equipped.  It is respectfully submitted then by Senator Harte, however, that the draftsman has got it right with regard to wrecks and that the proposed section 2 (1) (b) should be deleted in favour of an obligation to inform the Commissioners of any find. The Minister has already responded to the previous amendment to this section, which covers the point made by Senator Harte.  I believe Senator Harte would accept what the Minister suggested as moving towards what he was worried about.  For that reason the amendment will not be pressed unless the Minister has any comment to make on Senator Harte's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mr. A. Doyle Mr. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are interrelated and I will take them together.  These deletions cannot be <Col N="1074" /> accepted without seriously weakening the Bill in an important way.  The object of these provisions is to make use of metal detectors for archaeological purposes subject to the consent of the Commissioners in the same way that excavation or digging for such purposes is subject to licence from the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>When the Bill becomes law the register of historic monuments will be opened but at that date it will contain no entries. Therefore, the effect of Senator Harte's amendment, as moved here by Senator Ferris, would be that the restriction on the use of metal detectors would be enforced only at the 1,000 or so monuments in ownership or guardianship of the Commissioners, or of local authorities, or where preservation orders are in force.  The making of entries in the register will be a gradual process commencing with those monuments which are already listed under the present legislation and continuing with the monuments which are at present being recorded in the National Archaeological Survey.</P>
      <P>It is expected that within a decade or so a very large percentage of the monuments in archaeological areas throughout the country, which total around 80,000, will have been entered in the register but the register will never be closed as new monuments and archaeological areas will continue to be discovered.  Likewise, in the case of restricted areas which, as Senators will see from the definition in section 1, are areas designated in historic recorders, it is expected that such areas will continue to be discovered and to be protected by orders as the years go by. Accordingly, I feel that Senators will accept that it is necessary to retain the provision in the Bill for making the use of metal detectors for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects subject to licence no matter where this search is intended to take place.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) advertise for sale or otherwise promote the use of detection devices for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has, to some extent, referred to this.  The purpose of my previous amendment was that if damage was caused it would be done by a person who was licensed to have a metal detector and therefore could be traced.  I do not accept Senator Browne's contention that that would more or less encourage them to do it because the same could be applied to a licence for a gun.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that when we are talking about searching for treasure it is invariably archaeological finds that are involved.  I know many sites that are not identified as of great archaeological significance. I know one particular site, for example, in the wilderness of a bog near my home which was the site of a church in penal times.  It is marked by a cruciform building on the first six inch map of the area.  That was in the 1830s.  The local people are unable to identify the site.  In fact the site is identified some considerable distance from the actual site shown on the map.</P>
    <P>I would like to take a person with a metal detector to that area, go over it and see if there is something important there.  No archaeologist will ever excavate there to find out what is there.  It is an important site.  I am quite sure something of significance could be discovered there.  There may be many other such sites which are not easily identified but by use of area maps it is possible to trace them.  Those sites can be plundered because most of them are in very remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>When advertising the sale of metal detectors it should be unlawful to promote the sale by recommending that a particular metal detector is more suitable for the tracing of important objects, that a particular detector is more sensitive than another.  At the end of the day it depends on how sensitive the metal <Col N="1076" /> detector is.  The more sensitive it is the more costly it is.  I do not know what proportion of the more sensitive ones are sold.  A Bill of this kind should endeavour to prohibit excavation in any area of archaeological significance that is not easily identified.  If the Bill does not do that it will be a failure.</P>

      <P>I want to make a brief comment on this.  It seems to me that following the Derrynaflan case it may very well be that there will be a sudden rekindling of interest in metal detectors. Sales may reach new records, particularly in view of Christmas.  During the course of my Second Stage contribution I adverted to the fact that I had seen advertisements promoting metal detectors specifically alluding to the fact that they would, of course, be extremely valuable, useful and functional in the area of uncovering and discovering archaeological artefacts and items of interest.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the publicity attaching to the Derrynaflan case, I can very well see that there will be redoubling of that type of commercial hype in relation to the sale of metal detectors.  I am concerned about this.  At the same time I see the Minister's point that the Bill does not want to rule out totally the notion of treasure trove.  It is legitimate in certain areas to happily pursue what is a very pleasant hobby.  I wonder, in the light of recent events, if it is not necessary to have a fresh look at that.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in reply to this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 10, subsection (2) (d) (ii), to delete &ldquo;any time&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one week's notice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are self explanatory. Consent under this section should not be capable of being revoked at any time in the sense that it could be revoked immediately.  It would be reasonable to give one week's notice.  The same applies to the revocation.  It should take effect seven days after the person named in the consent is notified of the revocation.</P>
      <P>In theory I could envisage a situation where somebody who had got this consent could make an important discovery. It might be in the interests of archaeology and research to revoke the consent but I feel that under this section to be able to revoke immediately is unjustified.  The same applies to amendments Nos. 20 and 21.</P>

      <P>I do not think that a week's notice should be given of the revoking of consent to use a detection device.  If such revocation is deemed necessary the circumstances might well indicate that the holder of the consent would do damage to an archaeological site.  A week's notice might give him or her time to do further damage in that case.  It might be then necessary to revoke consent without notice.  I, therefore, cannot accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what situation is envisaged with regard to revocation of consent.  It seems to me that if permission is given that certain excavations may be carried out, at a particular point something of importance may be discovered.  Presumably, there would be no overseeing of the excavation by somebody from the Office of Public Works.  In <Col N="1078" /> general, it seems to me that the only way somebody in authority would know that an important discovery had been made would be where the person or persons report this situation.  Clearly, somebody who would go to the trouble of making an application and getting consent would be concerned about the archaeological treasures and would be a person whom the Minister or the Commissioners of the Office of Public Works could trust.  Could the situation arise in reality &mdash; I know it could arise in theory &mdash; if where somebody who had got permission to excavate found some important artefacts or treasure in the archaeological sense, the commissioners would be in a position to know that and to act by giving instructions to cease the excavation immediately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister on this point.  The country is full of people who now have metal detectors.  We are not doing anything to stop that.  It is probably something to be condoned if used in the way the vast majority of people use these things, on beaches and on footpaths at rivers, etc. It is a weekend pastime with a lot of people.  Some people can make a living out of it by finding coins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place when they apply to the Minister for a permit they tend to go out with no fixed purpose in their search. The probability is that they will only find tin cans, tops of bottles or debris from our present era deposited with abundance around the country.  They are usually deposited by people who have very little feeling for the environment.  That is usually all they will find.  They might even find coins, buttons or old cartridge cases which apparently react strongly to these metal detectors.  No doubt, at the back of their minds they would hope against hope and offer an occasional rosary that they might find another Derrynaflan Chalice.  We do not know if that will ever happen again.  The next man to find a treasure like that will have to convince the court that he had no interest at all in archaeology, that he had <Col N="1079" /> set out only to collect the tops of milk bottles or something like that.</P>
    <P>We are trying to define also what is an archaeological object.  It is defined specifically in the National Monuments Act, 1930.  For the record I quote section 2 of the 1930 Act:</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo; means any chattel, whether in a manufactured or unmanufactured state which by reason of the archaeological interest attaching thereto or of its association with any Irish historical event or person has a value substantially greater than its instrinsic (including artistic) value...</P>
    <P>The same expression includes &ldquo;ancient human and animal remains&rdquo;.  It does not include &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo; in which the rights of the State may have been waived. I am extremely concerned that if somebody who innocently went out for pastime or otherwise came across something of archaeological importance or suddenly discovered something that was of interest to the State, because he had already got a licence which allowed him to do whatever he is doing as a pastime he could not be stopped from continuing to search in that particular area if the Minister did not have the power to revoke the consent immediately.  That is, as I understand it, the object of the section.  It is the only reservation I have.</P>
    <P>Many innocent people use these machines and really enjoy themselves. If they come across something now of tremendous importance it is inevitable that they will report it since there has been so much publicity.  I hope that the publicity will not stop people from reporting finds of articles which are of importance. If my constituent had gone home, put the find in the cupboard and said nothing think of how much poorer the State would be.  It is important that the Minister, if she issues a licence, should have the power to revoke it but it should only be revoked in the event of something extraordinary happening which would involve the interests of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one point with regard to what Senator Ferris has said.  I do not disagree with him but I feel that with regard to an archaeological object, disturbing the site itself should be condemned.  In many instances where no treasure or archaeological object is found the history which is written into the layers of the soil is disturbed.  In many instances archaeeological would regard treasure, artefacts or the archaeological objects of less importance and less consequence to the story that is told in the actual layers and composition of the soil at a particular place.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that somebody with a metal detector can go to some of the places I mentioned, for example, the site of an old church which is not considered a site of archaeological importance.  He may not necessarily find any worthwhile archaeological objects but he will have destroyed the story that is written into the layers of the soil.  I am disappointed that, to a large extent, people with metal detectors will still be free to roam around the countryside. Under this Bill they will be prohibited from entering historic sites so it appears that they will have to concentrate on other areas outside those sites.  Therefore those sites are in imminent danger.  With that in mind I moved that amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I find Senator Fitzsimons's last contribution to be somewhat contradictory to the amendment.  He fears for certain old churches and graveyards which date back to the post-1700 problem and what a metal detector might be used for.  As I stated earlier, if there is any intention at all of looking for archaeological objects, or any reasonable assumption that they are looking for archaeological objects in such an important or historic site, it is an offence.  Even if there is a consent to use a metal detector and if there is an abuse or misuse or even a fear of abuse or misuse, the Senator in his amendment is saying we must give seven days notice before we revoke it.  I cannot marry those two viewpoints. I must stand by the point I made <Col N="1081" /> in rejecting the Senator's amendment earlier.  It is in the interests of the nation and in the interests of the common good that if we fear abuse or misuse or if we are aware of abuse or misuse of consent that we act immediately without giving seven days notice for people to continue their action to the eleventh hour and then withdraw.  It is in our interests that we do not take the Senator's amendment on board even though I realise his concern and what motivates him in relation to it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) In deciding on an application for a consent any training or experience by an applicant in archaeology or historical research shall be taken into account.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is self-explanatory.  Indeed, in relation to the previous amendment and what the Minister said was my feeling, that in a situation where somebody has got a consent and consideration has been given to his application, he must be considered trustworthy, he must be considered competent, it was from that point of view that I moved the amendment.  In this situation I would be happiest if the individual were a trained archaeologist but the next best person is somebody who has considerable experience and above all considerable concern and, therefore, somebody who has studied archaeology. A person who has engaged in historical research should be a person who would be capable of carrying out a proper investigation. In the area of adult education it would be very desirable that courses would be available for training in archaeology because this is an area, as Senator Ferris said, in which there is great interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the viewpoint of our concern for this archaeological heritage, anybody <Col N="1082" /> who would get a consent would have to be a person who would be reliable.  In relation to my last amendment, if that person came on an artefact or some situation of great importance he should immediately report that to the commissioners. The commissioners would be dependent on getting that information from the individual concerned.  Anybody who is granted a consent, should have training or experience in archaeology or historical research.</P>

However, I see no need to provide for this in the Bill.  It would in any case be inconsistent with existing provisions for the issue of licences for archaeological excavations.  We do not insist on this provision under the present situation for issuing licences for archaeological excavations under the National Monuments Act, 1930 and it is done in practice. Before a licence is issued we ask the relevant questions and ascertain the relevant facts.  Therefore, we feel there is no need to provide for it in this Bill, as suggested.</P>

This is a reasonable point and I am introducing this amendment to provide that possession of a prospecting licence under the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act, 1960, will be a valid defence for a purpose charged under section 2 of the Bill.  In effect, this will mean that a person will not be charged with the illegal use of a metal detector if he produces his prospecting licence to the Garda.

      <P>This is a simple amendment and it may not be of any great significance.  It is regarding provisions which shall apply in relation to historic records.  Section 3(2) (d) says: &ldquo;a copy of the order shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be deposited.&rdquo; It should read: &ldquo;a copy of the order shall, as soon as may be after it is made and in any event within a period of twenty-one days.&rdquo; A period of 21 days is reasonable.  It might be desirable to tidy up the section to confine it to a maximum of 21 days.</P>

      <P>I find myself not convinced by these arguments and rather unhappy.  I thought when I read the &ldquo;100 years&rdquo; that probably we were managing by doing this not to engage in any conflict with maritime law with the question of when ownership of a ship ends.  If you are going to come down to something like &ldquo;50 years&rdquo; we are really courting danger in regard to a conflict of law because after all it may well be that the ownership of a wreck may be governed by a law other than the law of this State and there could be a serious conflict of international law. I would be happier leaving it at 100 years which, as the Minister has already indicated, has the sanction of agreement by the Council of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 18, which is to simply delete the words &ldquo;being a wreck which is more than 100 years old&rdquo;, would be that every wreck even the one that occurred last week in West Cork, the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> would come within the provisions of the national monuments legislation.  It may well need to come under stricter legislation than we have now but I doubt if it is the national monuments legislation at <Col N="1088" /> this stage.  This is obviously unacceptable. With regard to the proposals to substitute &ldquo;50&rdquo; for &ldquo;100,&rdquo; the 100 years date was set as it can be assumed that wrecks which occurred before that date will tell us something of our history which cannot otherwise be told.  In the case of more recent wrecks it is probable that the circumstances in which the wreck occurred and details of the ship and of its equipment will be well recorded.  Whatever date one chooses can be said to be arbitrary. The figure of 100 years is reasonable and is in accord with the consensus view of the Council of Europe's committee of experts on underwater archaeology as I pointed out some time ago.  As I said on Second Stage this does not mean that wrecks of more recent age which have particular significance cannot be protected under this legislation.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 23, the deletion of words in brackets as proposed in these two amendments would mean that every wreck, including recent wrecks would come within the ambit of this Bill. It would mean that in effect nobody could touch any wreck even one of recent date without a licence from the commissioners or <i>Kowloon Bridge et al</i>.  As I said already the section as it stands can apply to any wreck which is considered to be of historical, archaeological or artistic importance whatever its age but there is blanket coverage of wrecks more than 100 years old.  The figure of 100 years is reasonable in this regard and I repeat that it is the consensus used at the Council of Europe's committee on underwater experts in relation to underwater archaeology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Senator pointed out that it may be difficult to know how old a wreck is the law has to specify some criteria and the onus will be on the person discovering a wreck to establish as best he can whether it is 100 years old; and it must be reported and not tampered with.  If he does not take these precautions he may run the risk of prosecution and heavy penalties.  There is the whole area of maritime law which Senator Dooge referred to and we would be really incurring the wrath of many far beyond our <Col N="1089" /> shores if we tampered or tread on toes in this area too seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it seems logical that most wrecks would be documented for dates but I could envisage a situation where somebody might discover a wreck that would not be documented. It might be very difficult to determine the date of a particular wreck and it seems in a sense unreasonable to put the onus on somebody who discovers a wreck to determine the exact date.  Somebody could quite innocently come to a conclusion that the wreck was of a later period and under this Bill if somebody makes that mistake they would be guilty of an offence and would be liable to very heavy penalties.  I am not familiar with the workings of the situation where somebody would discover a wreck but in this Bill, as Senator Ferris said, we are concerned that with regard to the discovery and reporting of a wreck, a person might find it more discreet not to report it in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>There is little I can add to what I have already said on a couple of occasions in relation to this except to point out that there is blanket coverage for wrecks over 100 years old and selected coverage of the more important wrecks that are this side of 100 years old.  There is also the fact that we have the recording and know more or less where to find or where to expect to find in relation to the younger wrecks.  The more important ones of those will be deemed to be historic monuments regardless of their age. To delete 100 years and leave no datum there in relation to wrecks is not pragmatic; it makes no sense.  I reiterate that despite all the hardship this country and the environment has suffered from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> we are hardly about to designate it a national monument or historic monument which is effectively what the Senator's amendment says.</P>

      <P>I am taking amendments Nos. 25 and 62 together.  These amendments are proposed by the National Monuments Advisory Council. Fourteen days was the time allowed for reporting archaeological finds under the National Monuments Act, 1930.  In today's situation this amount of time appears excessive and since reporting to the local Garda station involves no inconvenience I think that we can agree to the four days proposed here for reporting historic wreck finds or other archaeological objects in lakes, rivers or on the sea bed and to the adjustment of the provision in the 1930 Act so that the same time scale applies to all reporting of finds. Particularly in the case of wrecks, this amendment may be important.  Once an historic wreck is discovered its position will tend to become known and while the finder may not intend any damage, other persons could avail of the 14 day period to remove much of the valuable material from the site.</P>

I would like to see some control with regard to this because under the section as it is the expenses submitted would have to be accepted.  That may not be so and if the Minister confirms that I will accept it.  There should be some control, to limit it to reasonable expenses.  That would improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>It would be more desirable and more appropriate that an offence would be dealt with in an area reasonably close to the place where the illegal act was supposed to have been committed.

      <P>&ldquo;(c) a representative of the Minister for Education nominated by the Minister for Education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has made the case that the membership of the Historic Monuments Council is big enough and that perhaps to add more to it would leave it too unwieldy.  Nevertheless, in this area the Minister for Education should have some input.  Therefore, I simply make the case that a representative of the Minister for Education should be nominated by the Minister. This should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> Amendment No. 29 states:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(d) a representative of the Minister for the Environment to be nominated by the Minister for the Environment,</P>
    <P>(e) the Chairman, for the time being, of the General Council of County Councils&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Environment certainly should be in a position to nominate somebody to the council because of all the work done in this area by the Department of the Environment and by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;the Chairman for the time being of the General Council of County Councils&rdquo;, public representatives have a major part to play in this area and this should be recognised in the Bill.  This would be one very tangible way of doing it so as to get the interest of the elected representatives.  If the Minister agrees to accept those amendments, it will improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much attracted to the idea that the Minister for Education would figure in this as one of the nominating Ministers because the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications are listed.  I am not the slightest bit prejudiced in this field but in the country many teachers down through the years have done much in this line. One could argue that education is well represented by Trinity College, the university colleges, and so on &mdash; I regard those as the experts on defining many things &mdash; but the workers who have done much to preserve many of the monuments are not represented.  On Second Stage I mentioned the number of people not involved with education who are in societies such as the Old Carlow Society and who have done tremendous work and have given much of their time to preserving monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill uses the following wording: &ldquo;such other persons not exceeding five in number as the Minister may determine from time to time&rdquo;.  People who are very much involved in much of this work for <Col N="1094" /> many years should be officially recognised. It would be an acknowledgment of the amount of work they have done on the ground in saving many monuments. I would be sorry if my colleague Professor Dooge thought the university people were not representative of the teachers of Ireland; they probably are but I am talking about the nitty-gritty of digging and carrying out preservation work. People may be actually destroying things when they are excavating or opening drains.  The Minister for the Environment should be very much involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I feel those two points are very reasonable but I have to differ with my colleague, Senator Fitzsimons, because I have a certain hang-up about chairmen of bodies being appointed to select groups.  If the chairman is interested in this it is fine, but very often the chairman for the time being may be a marvellous person directly concerned with what is going on but his successor may not have the slightest interest in it.  I hate having people who have no interest in the work nominated to go on to sub-committees. People who know me at council level will know exactly how I feel about this.  I ask people, unless they are interested, not to go on these sub-committees.  At our council meeting when we were reorganising our own national monuments committee I said that unless people were interested in the work it was no place for them.  If you nominate somebody simply because he holds a certain position, you can often put a square peg in a round hole and it does not work to the benefit of anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the proposal to have representatives of the Ministers for Education and for the Environment on the council, the Ministers concerned have not sought this representation. It will be recalled that the transfer of the National Museum from the Department of Education to that of the Taoiseach likewise transferred the representatives from the Minister for Education to the Taoiseach.  It is, in my view undesirable to have too many civil servants on the council, particularly at <Col N="1095" /> the expense of the representatives of learned bodies or persons with a particular interest in the area.  I would not favour having the chairman for the time being of the General Council of County Councils on the Historic Monuments Council for a number of reasons.  I understand this is an annual appointment and this would offend against the principle of continuity which the six-year term of office establishes.  Furthermore, the elected chairman has, no doubt, many calls upon his time without adding to these &mdash; as Senator Browne pointed out &mdash; and he might be a person whose main concerns were with issues other than national monuments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent legislation which has come before the House we have many instances of reserve functions introduced by the Minister and I welcome those warmly.  My concern in this regard was to recognise the importance of the elected representatives and to give that recognition in the Bill.  I accept that a particular Chairman of the General Council of County Councils might not necessarily be interested in national monuments but provision could be made where he could nominate somebody who was interested in national monuments.</P>
      <P>He could have that power and in that way recognition would be given to the elected representatives.  I accept the point raised by the Minister, that it would interfere with the continuity of office which lasts for a term of six years.  At the same time, there is a deficiency in the Bill in that recognition is not given to the part that can be played by the public representatives and, therefore, to encourage a greater part to be played by them.  An opportunity has been lost in this instance.</P>

      <P>The trouble about appointing politicians, who could be experts, is that the Minister would be accused of doing it for political reasons.  Do not let us shelter behind that accusation and appoint civil servants, because then the Minister might be accused of not being motivated.  I do not want it to be inferred that civil servants are not capable of serving in an excellent capacity in these areas, but I want to defend the point made by Senator Fitzsimons that publicly elected representatives in various constituencies throughout the country already serve, on a voluntary basis, on national monument committees of their own county councils and otherwise, and they make a major contribution.  The only co-ordinating body I am aware of which brings all elected councils together is the General Council of County Councils.  It is not inappropriate to ask them to choose from their members a particular person with <Col N="1097" /> an expertise in the matter.  It does not have to be the chairman.  Indeed I would not give the power to the chairman.  I would prefer to leave it to the whole general council to pick out somebody who would have a proven track record in this area.  From my knowledge of public representatives I would much rather see a public representative on this council than I would anybody else and I do not mind what might be their political affiliations.</P>

      <P>If the nomination is left to the general body, it may be made on the overall on a political basis depending on the majority but at least the Minister would allow the nomination procedure to take place at the general body and formally make the appointment.  That has been done in the past by other Ministers and I can see the argument in its favour. I was a bit shocked when the Minister confirmed that civil servants had been appointed in the past and would be appointed again in the future and that these nominees, if any, might be civil servants.  I do not want to rule out either them or public representatives; we just want to allow the facility to be there for a public representative with a specific commitment, to have the opportunity of serving on what is a very important national body.  I will deal with amendment No. 30 in a moment and give Senator Harte's reason for including somebody else.  I know there is a limit to what you can do in this area, but it is important that we put in on the record the kind of people we feel should be on this body.</P>

      <P>Yes, I confirm my interjections to Senator Browne that the Taoiseach's nominee and the Minister for Communications' nominee <i>et al</i> were the civil servants &mdash; excellent civil servants in this case, but it was the general principle I was referring to rather than the specific, I hasten to add.  I am in greater sympathy with the idea of allowing the Minister <Col N="1098" /> for the Environment to have a nominee. That could well be the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils if he so wished.  I am worried about that particular one because I think continuity is essential if this is going to be a work-man-like body; that will advise, research and help the Commissioners of Public Works in this most important area.  I will come back to the Seanad on Report Stage, having considered again the implications of extending the Historic Monuments Council, now that we fixed on a figure of 18.  I will not give any commitment and I do not want to be dishonest and pretend that I am accepting the amendment.  I am very much in sympathy but not in the other areas for reasons I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for the Environment's nomination might kill two birds with the one stone.  As far as I know, there will be nothing to stop him appointing a representative of members of local authorities, whatever the status of that member may be, or indeed another civil servant.  He has excellent people; I can put on my Minister of State's hat at the Department of the Environment and say there are excellent people in the Department of the Environment with wonderful knowledge in this area in relation to listing, planning Acts and various other things that are very akin to some of the areas here.  The bottom line appears to be that the Minister for Communications and the Taoiseach and others requested a nomination. The other Ministers did not.  I ask the Seanad to leave it with me and I will come back on Report Stage.  I am not giving any guarantee at this stage but I will certainly look into it in depth between now and then in relation to the Minister for the Environment's nomination.</P>

      <Col N="1099" /> In page 10, subsection (3) (d), between lines 20 and 21, to insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(xi) the Military History Society of Ireland,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte is anxious that the proposed Historic Monuments Council which is to be set up under this section would be charged with the task of compiling a register of sites and he considers it would be the stronger by the inclusion of a nominee of the Military History Society of Ireland.  Ten bodies including universities and the maritime institute are given the right to nominate members of the Historic Monuments Council.  The Military History Society of which the President of Ireland is a patron, has long devoted itself to the study of the battlefields and military monuments of the country and is the repository of considerable expert knowledge.  It is a society which should be considered for inclusion among the bodies listed in section 4 (3). Senator Harte was anxious that the Minister would actively consider it between now and Report Stage if she cannot accept it in its present form.  That society has a keen interest in what the national council will be doing.  We are anxious that they would be given active consideration by some of the Ministers if not in their own right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with amendment No. 30.  I see that there is a problem in this area because there are so many important societies on which the Minister would like to have representatives. Amendment No. 31 states:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (3) (d), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(xi) An Foras Forbartha,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We know the important work that is being done by An Foras Forbartha.  Their most recent survey deals with the state of the environment, which was a major task. There are many experts in this area which I think should be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 has been taken <Col N="1100" /> care of with regard to the General Council of County Councils.  Senator Ferris has made suggestions in that regard with which I agree.</P>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (3) (d), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(xi) the General Council of County Councils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most of these monuments will be located in rural areas.  Obviously farmers and the farming community are very important. To have representation from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture would give recognition of the important role which the farming community have to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 states:</P>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (3) (e), line 22, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is proposed on the assumption that the Minister will accept some of the previous amendments, therefore the council could become unwieldy. For that reason Senator Mullooly and I felt that if the Minister did accede to our requests with regard to the other areas perhaps there would be a counterbalance by reducing the numbers nominated from &ldquo;five&rdquo; to &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to accept all these amendments the effect would be to increase the number of the committee by five at the maximum.  All the proposals are good but there is a much longer list of representatives of other organisations which would feel equally entitled to be represented and which could be drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on Second Stage a total of 12 additions to the list were proposed by Senators.  The line has to be drawn somewhere.  A number of approximately 18 as proposed in this Bill is the optimum number.  I would not be in favour of reducing drastically the number to be selected by the Minister for Finance, certainly not from five to three. In considering a nomination from the <Col N="1101" /> Minister for the Environment I will look at the logistics of reducing the number from five to four in future councils, perhaps one from the Minister for Finance, and including one for the Minister for the Environment.  I will come back to all of this on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there should be good balance on the council between specialists in the relevant disciplines and members of the general public who have a particular interest in the field.  The Minister for Finance, on this occasion, has included a practising farmer who has a particular interest in historical and archaeological matters which is a good balance.  We cannot have all academics just as we cannot have all civil servants. We have to have people that represent Joe and Mary Soap as well as higher academia.  This is what the whole purpose of giving the Minister for Finance five nominations is all about.</P>
    <P>The balance can best be achieved by the Minister for Finance nominating a sizable proportion of the membership.  I also feel strongly that a too large and unwieldy council would not achieve the effect we want.  If we could try to facilitate the suggestion that the Minister for the Environment had a nomination it could be someone representing An Foras Forbartha, someone from the General Council of County Councils.  It could solve some of the difficulties or accommodate some of the wishes of the Senators as articulated here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It could also include the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. Although they are under the Department of Agriculture, part of their nominating process to the county committees of agriculture are from the elected representatives of the councils.  I agree with Senator Fitzsimons that the land on which most of this excavation is going on is in the ownership of farmers and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture would have a direct input through ACOT and An Foras Forbartha as they work hand in hand.  If the Minister for the Environment was specifically responsible for nominating from either <Col N="1102" /> the General Council of County Councils, county committees of agriculture, An Foras Forbartha and so on he could meet some of the problems we have in this area.  All these areas are represented by public representatives who have specialised interests in this subject.</P>

      <P>In page 10, subsection (4), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the Council shall, at its first meeting, appoint a vice-chairman from among its members.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is provision for the election of a chairman.  There are some committees who do not appoint a vice-chairman.  I think it is a mistake not to have a vice-chairman. If the chairman cannot attend then somebody has to be elected for that day.  The Minister has emphasised the importance of continuity by making provision for the election of a vice-chairman, which would ensure greater continuity.</P>

      <P>Subsection (9) provides that the council shall regulate, by rules or otherwise, the procedure and business of the council.  It would be undesirable to impose restrictions on the council.  No doubt they will appoint a vice-chairman from among their members, as well, presumably, as a secretary, but they may not wish to make the initial appointment at their first meeting.  It should be borne in mind that the council will be a continuing body.  They will have one first meeting only and will be free to set the period of office of the various officers, apart from the chairman, and make arrangements to fill the vacancies as they fall due.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(c) Appointments as member of the Council shall be made strictly after three years and thereafter at regular intervals of six years.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to drawing lots to see who is lucky or who is unfortunate to be left off the council is unsatisfactory. There is no provision in this Bill for members who might voluntarily wish to resign from the council after three years. My amendment is to overcome this unsatisfactory position of drawing lots.  To accept this amendment would overcome that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is presumably trying to ensure that in future, a hiatus does not occur in the life of the council.  The arrangements proposed will prevent this happening.  As time goes on, members will be due to retire and will be re-appointed and replaced at different times.  There will not, therefore, be a complete re-appointment of the entire council at any time in the future as the Senator seems to think.</P>

      <P>If somebody is elected, say, after a vacancy occurs, could provision not be made that the appointment would cease at the end of three years, or six years, or whatever and not six years from the date of the appointment? Presumably this council will be set up on a particular date and after three years half the membership will resign or the appointments will be terminated either by lot, agreement or otherwise.  Is it not possible, within the terms of the Bill, to ensure that when a vacancy occurs, the six years will not apply but the time will coincide with the end of that six-year period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a feeling that all of this has been adequately taken care of in the section as it now stands.  Basically, what we envisage happening is that once this legislation is enacted, the existing National Monuments Advisory Council, <Col N="1104" /> as reconstituted only in the last month or so &mdash; indeed I chaired the inaugural meeting &mdash; would <i>de facto</i> become the Historic Monuments Council.  It was set up along the lines we have outlined in this Bill before us today.  Now, at their first meeting, when they become the Historic Monuments Council &mdash; when this Bill is enacted &mdash; lots will be drawn among them and eight of them will be drawn on lot to retire after three years and the other eight will continue for a six-year period so that after three years half the Historic Monuments Council will be replaced.  They can be re-appointed from among them and others can be replaced depending on the nominating body or the nominating person.  We will have no hiatus where all 18 go out and a new 18 come in.  At any one time up to eight will be continuous.  If someone resigns, dies or retires they can be replaced at that particular time so it will not be a two-step &mdash; one at three years and one at eight years &mdash; replacement.</P>
      <P>Given the nature and the make-up of the council, it is quite likely that there will be a few coming and going over the six years for different reasons.  So I envisage no hiatus or gap, as it were, or no possibility as happened with the last National Monuments Advisory Council of everyone's term coming to an end for whatever reason, good or bad, and not being replaced, so that we could end up without an Historic Monuments Council. It will be continuous now, with no hiatus. I really do not feel that the Senator's amendment adds anything to the provisions that already exist in this particular subsection.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(12) The Council shall hold an annual meeting and publish an annual report.  This report shall be laid within twenty-one days of its <Col N="1106" /> publication before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition to the valuable work which the council will do, it is important that the council should hold an annual meeting.  It is very important that an annual report will be published.  This report should be laid, within a reasonable time of its publication, before each House of the Oireachtas.  As well as encouraging the council and giving an impetus to their work and by being subject to some kind of scrutiny would enhance the work of the council and certainly improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I have already said, I do not think it would be a good idea to prescribe times at which the council would meet.  There would be little point in the council meeting just to fulfil such a requirement in the Act.  In any event, I do not foresee any danger and the council may wish to meet at frequent intervals. An annual report would be useful. However, we must remember that the <i>raison d'être</i>, of the council is to advise the Commissioners of Public Works and any such report would have to be submitted to the commissioners in the first instance.  It has been the practice of previous councils to prepare reports at intervals. Sometimes, however, the council felt it more important to prepare reports and submissions relating to particular matters.  In general, I would favour giving the council as much discretion as possible as to how they will proceed.  No doubt they will take cognisance of the Senator's view and, if they find it practicable, they will furnish periodic reports.</P>

      <P>I would like to press the Minister a little more and ask her to consider this particular point of the annual report between now and Report Stage.  I think there is not only the question of the professional operations of the Commissioners of Public Works and of the advice that they do receive, but I think if the work is to be successful, we do need quite a degree of public education. We do need to do everything within our power to make sure that public <Col N="1107" /> opinion realises the importance of what is being done, and one way in which to carry out this function of public enlightenment is that there should be an annual report of some type.</P>
      <P>It may well be that it might not be this particular report.  It may well be that the Minister would like to put in a section on Report Stage saying that the Commissioners of Public Works would produce an annual report but I feel that an annual report on what is being done in regard to historic monuments could well generate an enthusiasm that could not be otherwise than be helpful.  I raise the question and ask the Minister to consider it between now and when we come to the matter again.</P>

      <P>I agree fully with the point that an annual report in relation to the works being done by the Office of Public Works and by the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to our built and natural heritage generally would be most useful particularly in raising public consciousness.  It has been one of my priorities in my short term in office and I will look to that between now and Report Stage.  Whether it would be exactly as the amendment before us indicates as demanding an annual report of the Historic Monument Council or through another vehicle I will discuss and come back to the Seanad.</P>

Molaim dá réir an tairiscint seo: &ldquo;The need for the Minister for Education to reconsider the case of the three All-Irish Primary Schools, namely, Ring Mahon, Parklands, Cork City, and Cnoc Theas, Limerick, which have been in voluntary operation since last September, with a view to sanctioning all three schools to full recognition under the Department of Education.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cé gur i mBéarla atá an tairiscint, tá sé i gceist agam í a phlé i nGaeilge, mar ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé de réir céille é a dhéanamh ar aon bhealach eile.  Mar is eol do gach duine, tá spéis mhór á cur i scolaíocht trí mheán na Gaeilge le cúig bliana anuas.  Dá thoradh sin tá 52 bunscoil lán-Ghaeilge ag feidhmiú taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht faoi láthair.  Is le cúig bliana déag anuas a bunaíodh 27 díobh siúd.  Cuireadh naoi n-iarratas ar Ghaelscoileanna a bhunú isteach chuig an Roinn Oideachais i mbliana.  Tugadh aitheantas do thrí cinn acu agus diúltaíodh do na sé cinn eile.  Ach níor fágadh an scéal mar sin.  In ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí a bhí le sárú bheartaigh trí choiste dul ar aghaidh agus scoileanna a <Col N="1109" /> bhunú, i Ringmahon, i bParklands i gCathair Chorcaí agus ag Cnoc Theas i Luimneach. Tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil na scoileanna sin faoi lánseol ó Mheán Fómhair seo caite.</P>
    <P>Ní mór a rá anseo, is é sin más gá é a rá, nach bhfuil pingin rua faighte ag na scoileanna sin ón Stát ach tá siad ag feidhmiú go gairmiúil agus le héifeacht, mar sin féin.  Ní miste a rá freisin nach bhfuil siad gan tacaíocht.  Tá muintir na dtrí scoil ag bailiú airgid agus tá achainí náisiúnta déanta ar a son ag Comhchoiste Ghael scoileanna i gcomhar le Conradh na Gaeilge.  Ach tuigtear go bhfuil costas an-mhór ag baint le reachtáil scoile.  Tá tuarastal na múinteoirí, cíos, árachas, teas agus trealamh le híoc.  Ba mhaith liom a thabhairt le fios anseo nach bhfuil táille ar bith, beag nó mór, á ghearradh ar na mic léinn.  Meastar go gcosnóidh sé £12,000 ar a laghad le scoil amháin a reachtáil ar feadh bliana.  Sin figiúir aníseal, ar ndóigh.  Is léir as sin go bhfuil na múinteoirí ag obair ar bheagán airgid faoi láthair.  Is léir freisin nach beag é a ndiograis i leith na Gaeilge.  Ní féidir a shé anadh gur fada ó bheith sásúil an scéal seo maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an Ghaelachais i gcoitinne.  Is iad seo a leanas na coinníollacha atá leagtha síos ag an Roinn Oideachais do scoil lán-Ghaeilge le haitheantas a fháil: (a) go mbeadh móide fiche dalta den aoisraon ó 4-6 bliana sa scoil; (b) go mbeadh suíomh sealadach agus cíos réasúnta le trí nó ceithre bliana; (c) go mbeadh pátrún ar an scoil féin.</P>
    <P>I bhfianaise a bhfuil ráite agam ba mhaith liom anois focal gairid a rá faoi na scoileanna ar leith a bhfuil aitheantas diúltaithe ag an Roinn dóibh.  Tagróidh mé i dtosach don scoil i Rinn Uí Mhathúin. Níl léiriú is fearr a d'fhéadfaí a thabhairt ar chás na scoile seo ná an achainí a rinne baill an choiste ag lorg cabhrach.  Scríobhadh an litir atá anseo i mó láimh ar an 23ú lá de mhí na Samhna 1986 ón seoladh &ldquo;An Ghaelscoil, Ring Mahon House, Blackrock, Corcaigh&rdquo;. Léifidh mé an litir, agus léireoidh a bhfuil sa litir an dílseacht agus an dáiríreacht atá ag baint leis na daoine seo maidir leis <Col N="1110" /> an teanga.  Luaigh mé an seoladh agus an dáta cheana féin.  Ní gá iad a athrá.</P>
    <P>The parents of Ghaelscoil earnestly appeal for help and support.  Our case is very simple.  We are not Irish speakers. The tragedy is that we came through the Irish educational system without a knowledge of our own language. We certainly do not want the same for our children.  We organised a Ghaelscoil in this expanding working class area in Cork.  We obtained a suitable premises and we even made our own furniture only to be refused by the Department of Education.  The excuse given by the Department is that the children could go to the model school in Cork city.  The distance between Ring Mahon House and the model school is one and three quarter miles.</P>
    <P>Last year the Department had no problem in approving a new all-Irish primary school in the middle class area of Douglas which is only one and three-quarter miles from the model school. However, there is another aspect to our problem.  The model school is in the city centre and children of four and five cannot go to the city centre and cross dangerous roads.  If we the parents were able to travel and collect them it would cost £12 per week in bus fares, that in a poor area where most of the people are unemployed.  We have made tremendous and heroic sacrifices to keep the school open.  We feel we are entitled to sympathy.  We believe we are fighting for a most important principle, the right of Irish children of all classes and creeds to Irish medium education in their own area.</P>
    <P>Sin í an achainí a tháinig ón gcoiste atá i gceannas ar an scoil sin agus a bhfuil baint acu lena cur chun cinn, agus ní dóigh liom gur féidir le duine ar bith a shéanadh go bhfuil dáiríreacht agus dúthracht taobh thiar den iarracht atá ar siúl acu.  I dteannta a bhfuil sa litir sin tuigtear dom go bhfuil an scoil lán-Ghaelach i nDúghlas lán agus nach féidir leo a thuilleadh páistí a thógáil.  Ní raibh na tuismitheoirí sásta a gclann a chur go dtí an Mhódhscoil de thoradh an dainséir a <Col N="1111" /> bheadh ann dóibh ar na sráideanna.  Tá na gasúir ag freastal ar an nGaelscoil ag Ring Mahon House.  Tá beirt mhúinteoirí scoile agus 24 dalta faoina gcúram.  Ina theannta sin tá cabhair dheonach á tabhairt ag múinteoir breise atá ar phinsean &mdash; arís, dílseacht don Ghaeilge agus do pholasaí na hathbheochana.</P>
    <P>Focal gairid eile faoi Parklands &mdash; sin Gaelscoil Pharklands i gCathair Chorcaí. Is í seo an chéad scoil lán-Ghaeilge a lorgaíodh don taobh ó thuaidh de Chathair Chorcaí.  Tugadh an chúis chéanna nuair a dhiúltaigh an Roinn Oideachais aitheantas don scoil.  Is é sin, go bhféadfadh na páistí dul chuig an Mhódhscoil &mdash; atá ar an taobh ó dheas den chathair. D'aontaigh na tuismitheoirí i Parklands ar an scoil a oscailt go neamhoifigiúil ón Luan, an 18 Meán Fómhair, agus tá siad suite ar leanúint ar aghaidh leis an rud atá ar siúl acu.  Ar an 12 Nollaig bhí naonúr déag de naíonáin ag freastal ar an scoil, i bhfoirgneamh Chumann Lúthchleas Gael, is é sin Craobh an Phiarsaigh. Tá fadhb an-mhór acu teacht ar an airgead le síntiús a thabhairt do oidí láncháilithe.  Níl amhras nach bocht an scéal é seo i gcúrsaí oideachais níos mó ná trí scór bliain i ndiaidh bhunú an Stáit.</P>
    <P>Focal anois faoin scoil i gCnoc Theas i Luimneach.  Eastát tithíochta dhá mhíle ó lár na cathrach atá anseo, a bhfuil daonra idir seacht agus ocht míle ann, agus an scéal go dona acu maidir le dífhostaíocht. Diúltaíodh aitheantas don scoil lán-Ghaeilge seo ar an gcéad lá de Mheán Fhómhair.  Is í an chúis chéanna a tugadh, is é sin go bhféadfadh na páistí freastal ar an Mhódhscoil i lár na cathrach, is é sin, Cathair Luimnigh.  Páiste amháin a chuaigh chuig an Módhscoil, de réir fianaise. Tá an scoil lán-Ghaeilge neamhoifigiúil ag feidhmiú ón 18 lá de Mheán Fómhair.  Dá mbeadh a scoil aitheanta féin acu bheadh dhá chéad páiste ag fáil oideachais trí Ghaeilge i gceann ocht mbliana.  Cláraíodh 37 sa scoil, ach tharraing cuid acu siar nuair nár ceadaíodh an scoil ag an Roinn.  Aon naíonán déag atá ag freastal faoi láthair.  Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach, is ceantar bocht é seo agus is deacair do thuismitheoirí ann airgead a <Col N="1112" /> chur ar fáil le tuarastal cuí a thabhairt do oidí cáilithe.  Ní acmhainn dóibh a dhéanamh ach síntiús a thabhairt nuair a bhailítear airgead.  Ní luide sin a misneach agus a ndíograis.</P>
    <P>Is follas go bhfuil éagóir á déanamh ar an nGaeilge le aitheantas a cheilt ar na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge seo.  Tá sé dochreidte nach dtabharfaí tacaíocht don éileamh suntasach seo ar oideachas a chur ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge do dhaoine óga.  Is tuar dóchais é go bhfuil an t-éileamh ann agus ag neartú.  Ná loicimis ar an bpobal atá ag lorg go dtabharfaí deis dá gclann oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge a fháil sa chaoi go mbeadh líofacht agus cumas labhartha acu sa teanga. Tá Gaelscoileanna á n-éileamh agus éileamh mór orthu.  Tá trí hachainí á ndéanamh ag Comhchoiste na nGaelscoileanna: (1) go dtabharfaí aitheantas do na trí scoil neamhoifigiúla; (2) go dtabharfaí aitheantas do aon scoil nua ina bhfuil mian scoile, agus má chomhlíontar na gnáthchoinníollacha, is é sin, dóthain páistí, cóiríocht shásúil, agus pátrún; (3) go ndéanfar scolaíocht lán-Ghaeilge a phleanáil mar chuid larnach de phleanáil scolaíochta i gcoitinne sa tír seo feasta.  Impímse ar an Roinn agus ar an Aire athbhreithniú stuama a dhéanamh ar na hachainíocha agus beart dá réir ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus le saoithiúlacht ár muintire ar fad a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé agus mé ag tosú go labhróinn ar fad i nGaeilge.  Mheas mé go mba chóir dom é sin a dhéanamh ar ábhar mar seo a bhí ag plé riachtanas agus ceist na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.  Sin é an fáth gur labhair mé i nGaeilge, mar measaim go mbeadh sé míloighiciúil agam labhairt in aon teanga eile.  Tá mo chuid ama caite, is dócha, nó gar dó, agus fágfaidh mé an scéal mar sin, ag impí arís ar an Aire agus ar an Roinn aitheantas a thabhairt do na scoileanna seo chomh fada agus is féidir leo agus chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Seanadóir de Brún as an deis seo a thabhairt dom cur síos go mion ar an ngnó seo os comhair an Oireachtais.  Is <Col N="1113" /> ceist achrannach é, ceist a pléadh go forleathan ins na meáin chumarsáide, ceist atá i mbéal an phobail le roinnt míonna agus a pléadh ag Comhchoiste Gaeilge an Oireachtais.  Spreag sé ceist nó dhó san Dáil freisin ach níor tugadh an deis dom cás an Aire san scéal a chur i láthair go n-uige seo.</P>
      <P>De réir na Rialacha le haghaidh Scoileanna Náisiúnta, is féidir scoileanna faoi leith a aithint ina múintear gach gné den chlár trí mheán na Gaeilge seachas an Béarla.  Tagann éileamh ar scoil dá leithéid ón phobal áitiúil i gceantar ar bith.  Tá sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas freastal ar éileamh ar scoileana lán Ghaeilge agus, lena chois sin, an t-éileamh a chruthú agus a neartú pé áit is féidir. Chuige sin cuireadh buntáistí áirithe ar fáil chun spéis agus éileamh a mhúscailt i measc an phobail mar a gealladh sa Phlean Gníomhaíochta Oideachais 19841987 inar dhúradh go bhféachfadh an Rialtas chuige go leathanófaí úsáid na Gaeilge agus go neartófaí sa chóras oideachais í.  I measc na mbuntáistí atá ann chun na críche seo tá deontais céad faoin gcéad chun láithreáin na scoileanna a cheannach, foirgintí a thógail agus troscán a chur isteach iontu.  Ar an bhfoireann iontu bíonn múinteoir amháin sa bhreis ar an méid a bhíonn ag an líon céanna daltaí de ghnáth.  Tá liúntas speisialta le haghaidh teagasc trí Ghaeilge á íoc leis na múinteoirí.  Faigheann siad deontais chaipitíochta ag ráta de 150 faoin gcéad. Faoi réir choinníollacha áirithe, cuirtear seirbhís iompair ar fáil go dtí an scoil lán-Ghaeilge is gaire do dhaltaí ar mian leo freastal air.</P>

    <P>Is léir go bhfuil ag éirí go geal leis na greasachtaí seo óir bunaíodh 40 scoil lán-Ghaeilge ó 1971 anall sa chaoi go bhfuil leath-chéad acu ar an saol anois i 15 chontae lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Bhí dhá scoil nua sa bhliain mar sprioc ag Plean Gníomhaíochta Bhord na Gaeilge, a foilsíodh i 1983.  Nach breá a bheith in ann a rá go bhfuil dea-thoil an phobail don Ghaeilge chomh mór chun tosaigh ar an sprioc sin gur bunaíodh ocht scoil nua in 1984, seacht gcinn i 1985 agus trí cinn i 1986.  Dar ndóigh, is ar na scoileanna nár bunaíodh i 1986 atá rún an tSeanadóra <Col N="1114" /> De Brún dírithe ach ba mhaith liom a dhearbhú gur caitheadh leis na hiarratais ar scoileanna nua díreach mar an gcéanna ó bhliain go chéile.  Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí nach bhfuil athrú polasaí nó athrú meoin i réim.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible to forecast whether an expressed inclination for education through Irish will develop to the point of supporting a viable school for the foreseeable future.  Initial recognition of an all-Irish school is usually provisional, to be reviewed later in the light of enrolment trends.  For this reason schools are normally first established in rented or temporary accommodation with a grant towards the rental charge, if there is one, available from my Department. During the provisional period, recognition can be withdrawn if progress is not satisfactory in terms of pupil numbers or the availability of suitable accommodation. However, this has not happened yet.  The conditions for the establishment of an all-Irish school are similar to those for the establishment of any type of school and are listed in the Rules for National Schools.  I am prepared to confer provisional recognition on an all-Irish school on the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That a school is deemed necessary by reference to facilities for education through Irish in the general area;</P>
    <P>2.  That I can be reasonably satisfied that the prospective enrolment will be sufficient to maintain a viable school. This means about 20 pupils to begin with, who would start in infants classes and, in the long term, an enrolment of 70 pupils, enough to employ a staff of three teachers;</P>
    <P>3.  That a suitable patron is obtained;</P>
    <P>4.  That suitable accommodation is made available by the school promoters in temporary but suitable premises for the period of provisional recognition;</P>
    <P>5.  That the school is managed in accordance with the Rules for National Schools by a properly constituted <Col N="1115" /> board of management to be nominated by the patron &mdash; tá fhíos ag na Seanadóirí na coinníollacha seo ar fad.</P>
    <P>Condition No. 1 above is the first consideration governing an application for a school.  As it is crucial to the cases under discussion it is desirable that I elaborate somewhat on it.</P>
    <P>Rule 39(i) of the Rules for National Schools states that grants are not sanctioned for the provision in any district of a school which, in the Minister's opinion, is not required to meet the demands and the needs of the district. On receipt of an application for an all-Irish school, this rule obliges my Department to survey the general area to see whether facilities already exist therein for education through Irish which could be put at the disposal of the applicants.  Such an arrangement may necessitate the provision of transport.</P>
    <P>Four of the nine applications received for recognition of new schools in 1986 had to be rejected on the grounds that the areas for which they were proposed were within reasonable distance of existing all-Irish schools in which places were available.  Of the remaining five applications, three resulted in new schools being set up in Portmarnock, County Dublin, Kilcock, County Kildare and Cóbh, County Cork.  One application was withdrawn and the other resulted in the establishment of an Irish stream within an existing school.  The Ballycragh area of Tallaght, County Dublin, proved to be <Col N="1116" /> close to the long-established Scoil Santain. In Cork city, Ring Mahon and Parklands can be served by the Cork Model School &mdash; I appreciate the difficulties the Senator has raised in that context &mdash; and, in Limerick, the new Model School is within close proximity of Cnoc Theas.</P>
    <P>The promoters of these projects were fully informed of the reasons for the rejection of the applications.  I am aware that, in the areas mentioned by Senator de Brún, the schools came into being in the expectation that official recognition would be conferred at some later stage. No utterance or action of mine should ever have encouraged such expectations. In particular, it should be clear from the account I have given that, as I have stated, no change in policy has taken place, as has been alleged on occasion lately, in relation to the recognition of all-Irish schools.</P>
    <P>Tá machnamh doimhin déanta agam ar na himeachtaí seo agus tá mé sásta gur cóir cloí leis an gcinneadh atá déanta cheana.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil fios fátha an scéil léirithe go glinn agam don Seanadóir de Brún.  Is féidir liom a gheallúint dó go gcuirfear fáilte roimh tuilleadh iarratas an bhliain scoile seo chugainn agus go gcaithfear leo chomh báúil agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 December 1986.</P>
