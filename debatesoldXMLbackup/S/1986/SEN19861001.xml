      <P>Before the commencement of business I would like to propose a vote of sympathy with the Honan family, in particular with Senator Tras Honan, on the death of her husband, former Senator Derry Honan. The Honan family have played a major part in politics and the social, economic and cultural life of this country. The contributions of the late Senator Honan, his father and Senator Tras Honan have been of inestimable value to this country. I do not want to eulogise the Honan family but it is appropriate that the House should pass a motion of sympathy with the family and express thanks to them for the work they have done for this country and, in particular, the work they have done for this House.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in this expression of sympathy to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Honan family. There are few of us left who served with Derry Honan in Seanad Éireann but anyone who did so could not but admire the quiet, determined way in which he made his contribution to this House. He certainly was of the spirit of the Seanad and in this way he made a contribution which was, perhaps, more lasting than that of what I might call some noisier Members. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition will not mind if I join also in this expression of sympathy, another former Senator, Tom Kilbride, for some years a Member of this House who died since the Seanad last met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to be associated with <Col N="3" /> the expression of sympathy by the Leader of the Opposition to our colleague, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Tras Honan, on the death of her husband, Derry. Those in public life at the level we are at recognise the contribution of the Honan family, not alone to the Fianna Fáil Party but to public life generally. They have been associated with the institutions of the State for many years. Those of us who were fortunate enough to have known Derry in his heyday will always remember him. Those of us who have been on the road canvassing will have experienced the hospitality of the Honan household. I had the privilege of knowing him. He canvassed me and, and in my day, I canvassed him. That is as he would want it. He was an extraordinarily interesting man to talk to. He had a tremendous involvement in public life and it is good that his name is continuing in this House.</P>
      <P>I also want to be associated with the leader's comments and expression of sympathy to the Kilbride family on the death of the late Senator Tom Kilbride. I had the privilege of serving with him in the House and found him to be a perfect gentleman. It is sad that during the summer recess we have lost two former Members of the House and it is appropriate that today we should remember them before we commence a new session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own behalf, and with the consent of my colleagues, I should like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of the former Senator Honan. I am long enough in this House to remember him well as a colleague. He impressed those of us who worked with him by the seriousness with which he treated this House and its role in the parliamentary process and his enormous courtesy and generosity of mind and spirit. I would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy on the death of the former Member of this House, Tom Kilbride. It is sad to hear of the passing of former Members <Col N="4" /> of this House. On behalf of the independents I should like to be associated with the comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Senator Brid Rogers, and myself, the two Independents from the other side of the national divide, I would like the House to know that we wish to be very sincerely associated with what has been said. Someone from a different tradition should acknowledge the great role which the Honan family played not only here but also in Ennis and in the history of the origins of the State and, in particular, in their association with the late President de Valera. I know &mdash; I now speak personally &mdash; how much it meant to me when I arrived here as a complete stranger to receive a very warm and gracious welcome from the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I will always remember that. I also speak for Senator Rogers when I say that the Leas-Chathaoirleach established a way of welcome which is typical of the family from which she comes. We join with the other Senators in offering our sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleagues, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House in expressing sympathy with our colleague, Senator Tras Honan, on the death of her husband. I, too, had the honour of serving in this House with both Derry Honan and Tom Kilbride and I regret their passing. It has been an enriching experiencing over the years to have worked with Senators from different parts of the country and it is nice to have fond memories of all of them. I offer deepest condolences to both families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice here that only one Member from each party speaks in the case of an expression of sympathy. On this occasion, however, when the Leader was speaking he was not aware, nor were any of us on this side of the House, that Senator Kilbride had passed away. In associating myself with the expression of sympathy to the Honan family I wish to be associated, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, with the <Col N="5" /> expression of sympathy to the Kilbride family on their bereavement.</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Tras Honan, on the death of her husband, a man whom I knew and respected in my early years as a Member of this House. I should also like to join in the tribute to the late Senator Tom Kilbride. As a public representative he gave great service to the people. He was a member of Longford County Council, Granard Town Commission and a Member of this House. I should like to convey to his widow and family my sincerest sympathy.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Senator Honan to reply I should also like to express my personal sympathy to Senator Honan on the death of her husband. I knew Derry Honan exceptionally well. He was a Member of the House from 1965 to 1973 and one can only describe him as a real gentleman. I should also like to offer my sympathy to Mrs. Kilbride and her family on the death of ex-Senator Tom Kilbride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never happened before in this distinguished House that the wife of somebody who had passed on should be present for the tributes. My few words are not easy but it was a view that Derry and I shared that duty had to be done. Whether sad or not, like today, one carries out one's duty. We shared very positive thinking and the view that one always said &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; whether for the kind remarks just made about Derry or anything else. He would expect that I should do this and not let him down. I warmly thank everyone for their kind remarks about Derry. I want to thank the Cathaoirleach, my colleagues on the Government side, my own party and, indeed, my close friends, the Independent, Senator Mary Robinson, and her colleagues Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Robb. There was a golden rule, that one said thanks and on behalf of Derry, our son, Ann, and myself I do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> Before I sit down I should like to put on record again that it is not often noted by outside critics of us that serve unselfishly in public life how rough the going is and how hard it is on family life. Through Derry's ten months of illness, and the three awful days in July, and since then, one would have to be a member of the party I am honoured to serve in, and of this House to realise that there is a bond, a closeness and support when one needs it. I certainly got it through the awful year that is behind me. I should like to put something on record, because my late husband would want it done.</P>
    <P>My husband's commitment to this House was referred to and I should like to point out that Derry was always quite clear in his mind about the important role of the Seanad to this nation and its people. He was always specific about how important the Seanad was and in recent years the Seanad has proved as important as Derry always saw it. If I was only half as good as Derry was as a Senator I would, indeed, be a good Senator. My warm and sincere thanks to everyone.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the House that under the arrangements for radio broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad by RTE, approved by the House on 12 June last, RTE are to begin edited broadcasting on Wednesday next, 8 October. Senators will recall that these arrangements provide for edited broadcasts for use in radio and, television news bulletins and current affairs programmes and in a &ldquo;Today in the Seanad/Oireachtas&rdquo; type of programme. Occasionally live broadcasting of major debates in the Seanad may also take place with the prior approval of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in each case.</P>

      <P>I have notice from <Col N="7" /> Senator Michael Lynch that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the progress to date in the renovation work to the Garda Barracks, Oldcastle, County Meath, since the matter was raised in the House on 20 November 1985.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme in west Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the speed limits on roads.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mark Killilea of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to have investigated the withholding of the payment of a mortgage subsidy from a person (name supplied) in Galway and to arrange for the payment to be made as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the building of a new vocational education school in Castlepollard.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State for the Arts to consider reversing the decision to introduce admission charges for the Treasury Gallery in the National Museum.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Alexis FitzGerald of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to review the decision to close the Royal City of Dublin Hospital, Baggot <Col N="8" /> Street; the Adelaide Hospital and the Meath Hospital.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The widescale practice of requiring members of the travelling community to sign on at labour exchanges for social assistance at a fixed time.</P>
    <P>I also received notice of another matter from Senator Donie Cassidy:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Communications to ensure that RTE covers the 10th International Cavan Song Contest which is scheduled for Saturday, 7 February 1987, thereby ensuring that the province of Ulster gets at least one live TV light entertainment broadcast each year.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Lynch, Kiely, Daly, Killilea, FitzGerald, Fitzsimons, Brendan Ryan and Cassidy on the school in Castlepollard as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I regret I have to rule that the other matter raised by Senator Cassidy on the Cavan song contest is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of Ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>I have selected Senator Lynch's matter for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senators Kiely, Daly, Killilea, FitzGerald, Fitzsimons, Brendan Ryan and Cassidy may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and to take them in that order. Item no. 1 is purely formal. We have merely to fix the sitting day. Nos. 2 and 3 will be discussed until 5.30 p.m. It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m. and to take No. 4 from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. For the information of Senators I might indicate that it is proposed that the House will sit tomorrow and, in view of the large amount of legislation being introduced <Col N="9" /> directly into the Seanad that is on the Order Paper, it is proposed to take legislation tomorrow morning. If Nos. 2 and 3 have not been concluded by 5.30 p.m. this evening they will be taken tomorrow morning. Items Nos. 5 and 6 will be ordered tomorrow and they will be taken after lunch, unless taken earlier because of the completion of the legislative items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure why No. 1 is being ordered. I imagine that every Member will agree that there are a lot of problems more urgent than item No. 1. If we are to deal with priorities I would imagine that items Nos. 7 and 8 would be of much more relevance to the people in general than items Nos. 1, 2 or 3. I can agree that we have to continue the debate on the Control of Clinical Trials Bill and I recognise that there are problems attached to it, but the problems attached to that and the Control of Dogs Bill, 1986, are of very little relevance to the people when compared to another piece of legislation on the Order Paper, the Air Pollution Bill. Anybody who has been addressing themselves to world problems recently will recognise that the problems created by pollution from Chernobyl, the problems associated with the Nirex problem in Britain and the problems associated with Sellafield, are of major importance and should be given priority this week. The Status of Children Bill is of greater importance than item Nos. 1 and 3. The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill is of much more relevance to our people than item No. 3 and I should like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a change in order of priority so that legislation of immediate relevance to the country is taken before legislation which in itself is useful but not of major importance to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal when there is a change in personnel in ministerial office that a message is sent to the Seanad and I should like to ask why in this case when there was a change the matter was not brought to the Seanad as usual. Secondly, I should like to support our leader, <Col N="10" /> Senator Lanigan, in his call to ensure that when this House is sitting, particularly at a time when the country is faced with many problems, that matters discussed be more relevant. Some few weeks ago a Fine Gael Deputy said that the Government were like a juggernaut hurtling down a hill with no brakes. We have a number of controls as far as Bills are concerned but we do not seem to have any real control. We are anxious to see the business of the House reflect the national problems that are out there and be seen to attend to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the content of the Order Paper before us. The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill seeks to dilute the powers of Dublin Corporation while the Control of Clinical Trials Bill and the Control of Dogs Bill, are important in their own right. On the Order Paper interspersed between the first 27 items there are a few Bills buried such as the Status of Children Bill and the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill. It does not appear that there is any urgency placed on the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill or the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill. This Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill has been with us for a long time. It appears to me to be the intention of the Leader of the Seanad that we should sit more days than any Seanad.</P>
      <P>The only reason why the Seanad has been recalled is so that it can be said that we sat on more days than any Seanad. I could name a number of necessary Bills that should have been before us to deal with the problems that are confronting the Irish people. I regret very much that the content of the Order Paper today does not relate to the problems that confront the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, I raised that issue on the Adjournment in December last and I wonder if it has not been overtaken by events in that I understand the Minister is bringing in a <Col N="11" /> different Bill altogether. Is the Department working on that? I cannot see the sense of that Bill remaining on the Order Paper if the Minister intends introducing a Bill. One of the problems with an Order Paper is that from time to time we do not have a look at it and see what we can take off it and put something more important on it. If individuals responsible for putting down a motion, find that events have overtaken it, it is up to them to get that motion taken off the Order Paper. In this case, this is not a question of individuals tabling a Bill, so I would like to know exactly what the Leader of the House is implying: what is happening about the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill? Is there in fact a new Bill coming in? If there is not a new Bill, can we either deal with this Bill or take it off the Order Paper?</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that farmers' incomes have dropped so drastically during the past 12 months and also that agriculture in general has been affected so adversely because of the inclement weather of the past two summers, and in view also of the proposed changes that have been made, or are being talked about regarding the CAP, would it be possible to have a debate on this very important issue here in the near future so that we could make the views of Irish agriculture known to the bureaucrats in Brussels, and tell them in no uncertain manner that we are not prepared to accept the changes that have been proposed by the EC Commision?</P>

      <P>This is now the third year that I have been involved here and I would like to know when it is proposed to take No. 28 on the Order Paper. The Leader of the House assured me on a few occasions that he would speak to the Minister in charge and come back and let me know about it. Maybe the Minister has not made him any more aware than anyone else around the country. I know that problems exist between the parties in Coalition and there seems to have been further secret talks during the Summer <Col N="12" /> Recess. Maybe he could give the House an assurance that he will let us know within the next week or two what the situation is going to be in relation to No. 28.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters have been raised. First, let me deal with the question of the Private Members' Bills. A particular Private Members' Bill was raised and also in the listing of legislation Private Members' Bills were raised. It must be realised that my main responsibility is in regard to Government legislation but it is also part of my responsibility to give as much of an opportunity as possible to private Members to raise matters which they wish to raise. That is being done in the present Seanad to a greater extent than in any previous Seanad. This evening we will be taking Private Members' Business from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. We will be taking it again next Wednesday from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. It is the turn of the Independent group to choose the topic for discussion. There was nothing to prevent the Private Members' group from designating any of the Private Members' Bills that are on the Order Paper as the Private Members' Business for this week and next week. According to the existing arrangement, that would then have been the business that I would have ordered. I have ordered as Private Members' Business this evening the particular item which I was given to understand was the chosen priority topic of the Independent group and that is why it is there. In regard to No. 28, the Wireless Telegraphy Bill, I could make a record of my reply to this because I am sorry to say to Senator Cassidy I have only the same reply to make as I have made before, that discussions are continuing, that the Minister is hopeful that the discussions will shortly come to a successful conclusion and that I will be informed when this is done. That is a reply I have given many times before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reply I <Col N="13" /> give today. I want to deal with the broad issue that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the Government Business that has been put down here for discussion. First let me clear a point; No. 1. is on the Order Paper today because this Bill was circulated to the Seanad rather than to the Dáil. We have to make an order today when we want to discuss it. I am not going to propose when item No. 1. is called that we discuss it today. Possibly we will designate it for next week. It may not be discussed next week. This is a matter that remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we have in this House six Bills directly introduced into the Seanad. All I want to say is that this House should be very grateful for that circumstance. I cannot remember an occasion on which six Government Bills were standing on the Seanad Order Paper at one time. Of course I had the problem looking at those six Government Bills introduced into the Seanad and deciding in which order they should be taken. If I consult the Ministers as everybody knows, to every Minister his own Bill is the most urgent Bill that ever went through each House of the Oireachtas. I have listed those Bills in the order in which they came to the Seanad subject to the constraints of Ministers being available to take them and not being out of the country on official business. The Control of Clinical Trails Bill which has been put down for discussion here today was introduced on 16 April 1986. We are now here in October, almost six months later, and we have only had one speech on the Clinical Trials Bill; the substantial Second Stage debate has not begun at all. It was my view as Leader of the House and it is a proper view that it is no use for me as Leader or anybody else as Leader or the leader of any group in this House going to Ministers and asking them will they please bring legislation directly into the Seanad. Will they give us the position of being an independent House of the Legislature equally entitled to receive legislation of the Dáil if, when Ministers having done so find their Bills lying undiscussed for six months or longer in this House? We would very rapidly get <Col N="14" /> back to the position whereby Ministers would adopt the old easier habit of automatically letting everything go into the Dáil. We would be here in the Seanad attempting to run after the Dáil waiting until things have finally come through the log jam in the Dáil and we would be asked to pass them rapidly.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to discuss these Bills at our convenience. By coming back here on 1 October we have an opportunity to have a mature discussion on six Bills which the Government decided to introduce directly into the Seanad and in my view we should take that opportunity. While I believe there can be adjustment in regard to the order and there will probably have to be an adjustment in regard to the Order, nevertheless I think six Bills having been introduced into this House which is not a debating Chamber, is not a debating society but is part of the Legislature with six Bills on the table, our job is to discuss those Bills thoroughly and show that Seanad Éireann is a real House of legislation that can take Bills before it, and given due time, can make a job of commenting on these Bills.</P>

      <P>I join with the Chair's expression of appreciation for the job that has been done here. I was intrigued by his comment that it was necessary to work over the weekend to achieve what has been achieved here, bearing in mind that there was a ten week period during which this work could have been accomplished. In fact, people were working here to a very late hour last night, moving in certain pieces of furniture and locating seats in what is little more than a large room. If any of us were to endure a wait of ten weeks in our homes for the movement of furniture to a room of similar size, I wonder what our reaction would be. A satisfactory job has been done within limits but my concern is growing at the absence of progress in the repair of the roof of the Seanad Chamber. I understand that as late as last evening investigatory work was still taking place. To put that in context, it is now 16 months since this investigatory work began on that ceiling. In layman's terms, we are asking a competent contractor or an architect to trace the extent of a crack in the brickwork. Can we honestly, as legislators in this House, stand over a 16 month investigation of a crack in the brickwork in a two storey building. It defies logic that that amount of time has been devoted to it and absolutely no progress has been made in repair work. Repair work will not commence until the investigation is completed &mdash; the investigation of a crack in the brickwork in a two storey building. I am alarmed and concerned that this situation has developed and is being allowed to develop further. I ask the Cathaoirleach <Col N="17" /> to reassure this House that when we reassemble next week we will have some sort of a reasonable timetable. I am concerned that we can justify to the taxpayers a period of 16 months to try to arrive at the end of a crack of possibly 30 feet long in brickwork.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Cathaoirleach has said in thanking the Office of Public Works for having provided us with this mini-Seanad for the time being. It is not fair of Senator Howard to say that they have spent ten weeks putting in seats and desks here. We all know that there was a lot of other work involved including quite a lot of electrical work that one cannot see under the floor. We are always inclined to knock the Office of Public Works. They may be slow but they do a good job and any job they ever did had not to be redone. I do not see why work on this House should be singled out by Senator Howard as being a job which is taking long years to complete. Maybe the Office of Public Works cannot afford to employ the number of people who should be employed here. We should be thankful for what we have, and I hope there will be no further criticism of the Office of Public Works in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept the need for legislation to control clinical trials on new drugs. The public have shown concern in regard to this for quite some time, going back to the thalidomide disaster of the 1960s which resulted in a widespread public demand that pharmaceutical companies be compelled to ensure the safety of their drugs, and more recently in 1984, on the unfortunate death of the young man who was undergoing a phase 1 healthy volunteer study. Clinical drug trials involving the use of human subjects are emotive and controversial. Many people find the notion of people being paid to put their bodies and minds at the service of drug companies objectionable, but the reality to be faced is that such tests are essential if new drugs are not to be released on to an unsuspecting public without having been properly investigated for possible health risks.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of medicine is the alleviation of suffering and the control of disease. As we all know, dramatic advances in the control of diseases which in the past were incurable or resulted in chronic ill-health, have been made. These advances have been directly dependent on drug research which has resulted in the production of much more effective and safer drugs. Indeed much of the modern surgical procedures have been successful because of the availability of new safe drugs. Today there is an ever-increasing demand from the medical profession and from the general public for more effective and safer drugs. Despite a degree of unwillingness to accept the necessity for research, by many people, clinical research and drug research must continue so that people who now suffer can be afforded the hope and relief which is their just right. It is regrettable that many of our existing drugs fall short of what is required, so the good work of medical research must continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been almost two and a half years in the course of preparation. I would have thought that we would have received by now a Bill that could have been welcomed by all interested groupings. Apart from the fact that we have a <Col N="19" /> Bill which most people believe to be very much out of line with other countries, we have a Bill which has been prepared without real consultation during the drafting stage, with concerned, professional representative bodies. The major weakness of the Bill lies in its title on which I will comment later. The general opinion is that it goes too far and it is almost certain to impede medical research progress here.</P>
    <P>There is the use of the words &ldquo;substance&rdquo; or &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; without any positive or firm definition. These are the key words in the title. It is regrettable that further definition has not been available within this Bill. As currently drafted, it would appear too that ministerial approval is required for all studies involving not alone new or existing drugs but substances and preparations. We must assume that this will include studies of dietary manipulation. Where the words &ldquo;substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; are, this interpretation seems to include normal dietary constituents. Normal dietary studies were always considered safe and desirable and they should not form part of this Bill. The Bill is all-embracing Bill and is not what was expected by the public and the concerned medical profession.</P>
    <P>The title of the Bill refers to &ldquo;medical or harmful effect&rdquo;. This is a negative approach, because the purpose of drug testing is to produce safer and more effective drugs rather than to determine their harmful effects. What was expected was a clear distinction between drugs in ordinary routine clinical practice and new drugs that are not fully recognised for clinical purposes. The Bill seems to me and to many other people to encompass not alone new drugs, but all established drugs which are in every day medical use including those which can be bought without prescription and to include normal food substances, things such as vitamins and fibres. What is required is a Bill restricted to the investigation of phase 1 drugs and not all aspects of medical research including normal dietary <Col N="20" /> constituents. It would seem that the Minister wishes to have his finger in everybody's pie and this is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Amazingly there is no mention in the Bill of the National Drugs Advisory Board. They are referred to in the explanatory memorandum. They were referred to in the Minister's Second Stage speech, but they are not mentioned in the Bill. I do not have to tell the Minister that the National Drugs Advisory Board are a tried and trusted organisation appointed by the Minister for Health and loaded with expertise in this field. They are not referred to in the Bill. It seems to be a vote of no confidence in that grouping. I regret this.</P>
    <P>The work of the National Drugs Advisory Board over the years has been well known and well acknowledged. I can remember reading of a drug called Opram which was withdrawn from general use sometime ago in the UK and other countries, where it had been approved. But this drug was never allowed into this country because of our experts at the National Drugs Advisory Board who were alert, competent and were about their business. We all know they enjoy a worldwide reputation, yet we ignore them in these formal discussions, we ignore them in the Bill. That they are not mentioned in the Bill must be a matter of concern. Ministers' statements and explanatory memoranda are all right but what counts is what is in the Bill. That is what becomes the law of the land.</P>
    <P>The omission of any reference to the board, I stress, must be seen as very serious. Without clear recognition of the board's importance in the future of scientific evaluation of clinical trials they will have a much reduced role. This would create many difficulties for that body. At this stage I would have to urge that the position of the board in relation to clinical trials should be made crystal clear by a formal mention &mdash; a clear intention within the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>We all know that the National Drugs Advisory Board are the only competent, independent body in this country to adjudicate on difficult, complicated drug <Col N="21" /> research protocol. This expertise is not available in the Department of Health. It is the Minister for Health who appoints the members of the National Drugs Advisory Board because of their obvious knowledge and expertise. Why he should choose to ignore them by not mentioning them in the Bill certainly baffles me and I am sure baffles many others also.</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister is well and truly defined. The absolute power sought by him is referred to in very many places in the Bill. Again, this must be a point of concern. It is true to say that it has been a feature of Bills from the present Minister for Health that his role should be well and truly defined, going back to the Nurses' Act and the Dentists' Act. However, this is a totally different type of Bill. It is a Bill which involves very complex and very scientific matters. Why the Minister seeks to have such power in such a very complex area is difficult to understand. Reference to the Minister in the Bill is made in subsection 2 (1). Subsection 2 (2) mentions him in the application of the conduct of the trial. Section 3 states that the Minister shall as soon as is practicable grant permission or otherwise. Section 6 states right through that he may revoke a trial. Section 7 mentions his satisfaction with the competency of the ethics committee and so on. I would agree with some of the points but there is too much ministerial intervention in this legislation. Right through, the Bill is riddled with ministerial mention and for the type of business about which we are talking, ministerial or bureaucratic structures in general almost certainly cause delays. Delays in this kind of business can be very important and have very far-reaching effects on the industry.</P>
    <P>There must be reason to feel concerned. I referred briefly to section 3 and to the four words &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. In relation to a proposal to arrange for the conduct of a clinical trial, the application has to be made in accordance with section 3(1). The section goes on to say that</P>
    <P>the Minister shall, as soon as practicable &mdash; (i) grant permission for the <Col N="22" /> proposed clinical trial to be undertaken in accordance with the application or, (ii) grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken in accordance with the application subject to such modifications or conditions as he may specify, or (iii) refuse to grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Those four words can mean anything. At the moment, clinical trial protocol is dealt with by the ethics committee and by the National Drugs Advisory Board in a matter of weeks. The use of the four words I referred to are not at all satisfactory and they should certainly be replaced by a more specific, definite period. Obviously, this would be longer in the case of phase 1 trials but for the other trials a period of 40 to 45 days would seem to be reasonable. Anything above that could cause problems. For obvious reasons, phase 1 trials would take a little longer and this I would accept. These delays can cause problems for companies engaged in clinical trials. They could cause them to move elsewhere, which would result in obvious job losses. Clearly, the growth of bureaucracy within the area of clinical trials will cause many problems and delays in reaching decisions regarding approval for a particular study.</P>
    <P>It is vital that specific time limits be imposed and be specifically referred to in the Bill rather than the vagueness that is there at present. I cannot stress sufficiently the fear engendered by those four words. I want to stress that delays can cause havoc, that they can have serious implications for companies and, indeed, for persons engaged in clinical trials. We know that international markets rely on efficient and speedy decisions and delays and impaired efficiency could well force clients of companies engaged in this subject to relocate their custom in a more realistic, scientific and economic climate.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a quick comment on subsection 3(iii) as it deals with refusal. May I assume that the Minister will give reasons for a refusal? This would <Col N="23" /> be very important because for whatever reason a future Minister of Health might take a dislike to a person or persons or to a company who are undertaking this business. Without any reason, he might decide not to give approval and there appears to be no appeal procedure in the Bill. There is no redress. It is a matter entirely for the Minister to say yes or no. This lack of redress is somewhat unfair to the companies concerned and to the people who are engaged in this business. The Minister may revoke permission for a trial. How is this going to happen? It is well known that within the Department of Health there is not the necessary expertise to judge a complicated research protocol. How will the Minister or any future Minister or officials of the Minister's Department be able to monitor a trial in such a way as to determine that it is not being carried out in accordance with the actual permission? I cannot see within this Bill provision for Department inspectors or officials to monitor this work and thus come up with the conclusion that a trial permission should be revoked.</P>
    <P>In section 6 in order to revoke permission the Minister ought to have some form of record available from an independent source or from his Department. Again, this is not provided for in the Bill. If there is no independent or departmental inspector to examine records, if the expertise is not available and there is no Department inspector to monitor the work, how is it proposed to come to the conclusion that a trial should cease? Obviously, a full definition is required and a full explanation.</P>
    <P>The title of the Bill provides also for the setting up of an ethics committee, the major role of which is to be to consider the ethical or moral aspects of the proposed studies. The ethics committee's review and approval should be mandatory prior to the commencement of any study. In this way, it is possible to facilitate medical research in the interests of society and, indeed, to protect from possible harm the participating subjects &mdash; to preserve the subjects' rights and, to <Col N="24" /> provide reassurance to the public that these objectives have been achieved. The committee must also ensure that the responsible investigator is appropriately experienced and has at his disposal facilities and staff to ensure that all aspects of work will be undertaken with utmost care and utmost consideration. Prior approval of research protocol by this committee is also necessary to protect investigators from possible comments &mdash; unjustified or otherwise &mdash; in the future.</P>
    <P>The ethics committee must also concern themselves with the protection of vulnerable groups and avoidance of volunteer over-utilisation, to ensure that a minimum period elapses before they go from one trial to another. Obviously, the ethics committee should approve studies which would be of good scientific value and should not hesitate to make use of expertise where they think it necessary. We know that this committee will have the authority to reject an application on the grounds of inadequate scientific content or unnecessary risk to the participant. As it now stands, the approval of a protocol by the National Drugs Advisory Board is not in itself sufficient to permit a study to proceed. The power to make this decision lies with the ethics committee alone. Therefore, the ethics committee are a very powerful and important group, which need to be considered in great depth.</P>
    <P>In section 7 (1) the Minister should have set out guidelines for an ethics committee which would have been helpful to them. This was an area where he could have got involved in assisting further the area of clinical trials. This would have been welcomed. People to whom I have talked over the past few months regarding this Bill, particularly the Social Policy Action Group, have very definite views on this and, indeed, other matters also. They are seeking an independent or ministerial appointed ethics committee. I am not sure that that would be practicable, or necessary. Having said that, I want to make it quite clear that I found the Social Policy Action Group extremely concerned but, unfortunately, for reasons <Col N="25" /> which I will give, I could not see eye to eye with all their suggestions.</P>
    <P>I know some of the members of the ethics committee of ELAN in Athlone. These include three medical practitioners, a World Health Organisation retired nurse, a Garda sergeant, a solicitor, a priest and a medical director. Of the committee in Dublin, I know of Mr. J.P. O'Riordan who is a retired national director of the National Transfusion Service Board and in my one meeting with him I found him to be an extremely responsible person. I also know a little about a Mr. Dunne who, I think, was a former Lord Mayor and was a public representative and there is also Mr. Ben Briscoe who is a Member of Dáil Éireann. All those are independent, responsible people who would not be influenced by any decision, but by their own consciences. We know that from time to time these committees have refused to approve of trials. We all know that Mr. Briscoe is an independent person who would not take chances, a man of integrity. He and his colleagues that I know will not take chances and will not cut corners. Why should they? They are answerable to their own consciences and any other attitude or frame of mind could not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from section 7 (1) if the Minister intends to have a new ethics committee for each clinical trial. If this were the case, it would not be feasible. The call from the Social Policy Action Group for a totally independent ethics committee is not feasible either, for the reasons I have given. It is important that at all times there should be medical personnel on these committees, who would understand the medical wording. I find it somewhat unusual that under this Bill members of the ethics committee should be individually responsible for consideration of all the matters which are listed, some of which will certainly be beyond their own personal experience. In section 7 (2), the Minister seeks approval in this area also.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill must be the protection of participants, those who are engaged in clinical trials. This is <Col N="26" /> the very kernel of the Bill. In practice, these investigations involve &mdash; certainly in the case of phase 1 trials and ones at ELAN &mdash; what are hoped to be healthy, young, male adults. Two factors are most important in regard to this area, first that they should be healthy and, secondly, that informed consent be freely available.</P>
    <P>The defect in section 8 is that no provision is made to require full disclosure by the participant of his past medical treatment, or medical history. It is well known that, before a participant goes on one of these trials, he is medically examined from the start and right through the trial and in all cases, I would hope, non-disclosure of past treatment should be found out, but it is very difficult to legislate for emergencies. I have found, not just in this area but in areas generally, one makes the best rules in the world and they may not come out right. This aspect of the non-disclosure of vital information by a volunteer, is one of the single greatest problems in clinical trials, while every effort is made to find out the full extent of the medical background and past treatment. This could be very serious, indeed. The old insurance principle of <i>uberrima fides</i>, utmost good faith, could nearly apply in a case like this, not just from the volunteer to the investigator but the other way as well. Nonetheless, I think there is now a greater awareness of the full extent of the investigation. All aspects of the health and the treatment of the volunteers should be checked out and this is usually done.</P>
    <P>Informed consent has been well defined. It is properly proceeded with before a trial is commenced. Informed consent is essential before any subject may be permitted to participate in a research study. The requirements for informed consent have been well and truly defined. The World Medical Association have indicated their stand in the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent amendments to that. They say that in any research on human beings each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, the methods, the anticipated benefits, the potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail; <Col N="27" /> that he/she should be informed and he/she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he/she is free to withdraw his/her consent to participation at any time. The physician should then obtain the subject's freely given informed consent, preferably in writing. That Declaration of Helsinki uses simple and practical language which everybody can understand.</P>
    <P>The American counterpart, the Food and Drug Administration say: that legally effective, informed consent must be obtained, either from the subject or his legally authorised representative, prior to recruitment into any research study. Consent must be obtained under circumstances that allow sufficient time for the subject to consider whether or not to participate and to minimise the possibility of coercion or undue influence. Information must be given in language comprehensible to the subject. Again, that is very simple, practical language, not the heavy medical phrases that might be used. Everybody can understand exactly what is meant.</P>
    <P>Informed consent is, and must be, basic to any trial. As part of getting a better understanding of this Bill, I arranged to call to both ELAN and the ICP, on my own, independent of the staff, to talk to the volunteers, to see what they had to say and to talk to them freely about different aspects of the trial. I cannot help feeling that this facility would be available to any other interested persons or groups. They should be able to go out and talk to people in this way, too. Most of the people I met on these trials were young healthy men. I would have to say &mdash; and I was on my own &mdash; that they understood the trial fully, they knew of the side effects, of their rights and what the trial was about. One trial involved arthritis and another was for a heart condition. They knew of the matter of consent, of the aims, of the benefits and they knew that they could come off the trial at any time, if they so wished.</P>
    <P>All these healthy young men would admit that the financial reward was the single most important factor for them. <Col N="28" /> Yes, of course, they were happy that they were playing a role in medical research, but I would have to say that the cheque at the end of the trial &mdash; whether it was to pay an electricity bill, arrears of rent or for a piece of extra furniture &mdash; was the single most important factor. Most of these people were not at work; they were in receipt of social welfare payments. Some were on low wages, some were on holidays. One or two wer Army personnel who had three weeks holidays and decided to spend four or five nights doing a trial and getting paid for it. I know many of these people, they come to me at my house as a public representative in Athlone.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the person be capable of totally comprehending the full nature of the trial. People who are of a very low IQ should be excluded from these trials. Perhaps a register of volunteers might be prepared so that it could be circulated. That might help in some way. Without doubt, to the volunteer the reward or recompense was the attraction.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7.4 (h) of the functions of the ethics committee makes the point that they should be satisfied that the reward is appropriate and realistic. In a perfect society, payment or reward might not be necessary. It should not be necessary in a perfect society but, unfortunately, we are not living in a perfect society. Ideally all those who volunteer should do so in the knowledge that they are helping old and sick people to get better. Whilst that knowledge came across in some way, I stress that the kind of money received was the principal criterion for most, if not all, to whom I spoke. Any attempt to restrict volunteer remuneration to unrealistic, low levels will positively result in widespread non-participation and probably the eventual termination of all essential studies. I would love to think that these people would go there for £25 or £31 a week, but I have no doubt that this suggestion would positively end the trials that now take place.</P>
    <P>The very concerned social policy action group suggested a figure that would not <Col N="29" /> exceed the supplementary welfare allowance. I would love to think that could happen and since my meeting with them I went out of my way to meet many of the young men who go on these trials. Every one of them made it quite clear that they would not spend four or five nights a week or five days a week away from their families or sweethearts for that kind of money. On the other hand, the rewards cannot &mdash; or should not &mdash; be pitched too high because caution might be thrown to the winds by some volunteers in an effort to get on a trial at any cost. Clearly this might increase the risk factor. To put it another way, the high recompense would reduce the value of informed consent freely given.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill deals with the question of insurance of volunteers and states that this should ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of the trial. The concept of no-fault insurance is quite unfair and, indeed, unacceptable because if the product tested conforms to all required standards and if no negligence occurs in its administration to a volunteer, or in its prior assessment or subsequent care, then it cannot be accepted that there is any liability on the part of those conducting the clinical trial. A volunteer agreeing to enter a trial, accepting a recompense for so doing, having been fully briefed on the risks of any discomfort involved and the possible side effects of the trial, should be entitled to compensation only if the product under test is shown to be defective or if the conduct of the study has been improper. The Bill is seeking to ensure that no-fault insurance will be available here. If it was available it would command huge insurance premiums and would effectively put an end to clinical trials here.</P>
    <P>An informal inquiry was made from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Irish Insurance Federation to find out if this cover was available and they were informed that it was probably not available. Yet it appears in the Bill <Col N="30" /> as if it were freely available. The consequences of that section could create problems for research in the future.</P>
    <P>I got in touch with the Irish Insurance Federation and they said with regard to availability of cover for this risk, that initial investigations indicated that there is a very limited market for this type of insurance. They indicated that certain bodies who carry out clinical trials hold insurance which provides the organisation with cover up to an agreed level of indemnity for personal injury claims made against them. This cover is of a very restricted nature and normally excludes indemnity for medical malpractice by the doctor or consultant.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to be precise in regard to costs. It is normal for a policy of insurance like this to have a claims excess in the region of £10,000 or £50,000 with the higher excess reducing the insurance premium. There is an element of vagueness about the whole area of insurance in the Bill. The word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; is not defined. It certainly is not precise. I saw an insurance policy, a kind of group volunteer policy, giving cover up to £10,000 for capital benefits, at a huge premium. However, a figure of £10,000 almost certainly would not satisfy the &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; clause attached to this policy. &ldquo;Adequate&rdquo; for a single unemployed volunteer might well be £10,000 or £25,000 but for a married volunteer with a large family, employed or unemployed, it might be ten times that figure. A clear definition and more thought must be given to this section. I mentioned what &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; is in two cases. If a volunteer suffers brain damage in a trial and becomes a vegetable, what is &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; in that case? A sum of £10,000 or £50,000 would not be adequate.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the insurance industry is in a chaotic state at the moment, particularly in regard to liabilities. Joint committees of this House discussed different aspects of insurance in regard to small shopkeepers or large builders. The kind of cover now sought in the Bill will not be available and will cause great harm to this industry. An article on medical negligence in the Irish <Col N="31" /> Insurance Brokers publication makes the point that negligence has been defined as the omission to do something which any reasonable man, guided upon the considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do, or doing something which a prudent or reasonable man would not do.</P>
    <P>This basic formula has been accepted for over 100 years but we are now changing the rules. It can be said that a clinical trial is, indeed, a medical matter. Medical negligence involves a breach by a medical man of his duty, of care owed by him to his patient or, in the case of clinical trials, to the volunteer. This section will certainly cause problems. I am not sure that this kind of premium or cover will be available, which is far more worrying. Somebody told me in England that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment might be inserted in the Bill. That would be an out of grace payment, which might be preferable to the &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; position obtaining at the moment. As it stands, failure to get the required adequate cover will effectively end trials in medical schools, hospitals, health boards and universities. Section 9 states that before a clinical trial can go ahead that the Minister must be supplied with a copy of the policy of insurance.</P>
    <P>What about research, for example, to improve the care of the dying? What about an insurance policy in that area? Patients with terminal cancer, obviously with a limited life span, are used in trials. In the knowledge that before this trial can commence the Minister must see a copy of the policy, does he really think that before this trial commences the policy can be produced to him? Cover like that would never be received.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (b) states:</P>
    <P>upon becoming aware of or suspecting any adverse reaction affecting a participant as a consequence of the trial being conducted, forthwith report that fact to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This needs more clarification. I spoke to many volunteers &mdash; perhaps as many as 25 at different times &mdash; who were on trials. They were aware of the side <Col N="32" /> effects. The requirement to report any adverse side effects to the Minister is not practical. The lads I met on those trials were told well in advance that they might get a headache or a dizzy spell. It will be very difficult to report every side effect to the Minister. Is the Minister talking about the side effects known to take place during a particular trial?</P>
    <P>Section 12 (2) (a) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to paragraph (b), where an offence under subsection (1) is committed by a body corporate, every person who at the time of the commission of the offence was a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate shall, as well as the body corporate, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>That is an unacceptable paragraph. Why not include the janitor, the hall porter or other people? A clearer definition is required of &ldquo;manager&rdquo; in that section. Does it mean &ldquo;general manager&rdquo;, &ldquo;sales manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;stores manager&rdquo;? Who is the secretary? Is it the secretary to the managing director or the secretary to someone else? Does an officer of the body corporate mean a laboratory technician or a pharmacist? The whole section seems extremely vague and needs a clear and positive definition.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board are not mentioned in the Bill. The Minister is taking unusual powers for himself in this complex clinical area. Clearance of a clinical trial involves ethics committee approval and National Drugs Advisory Board approval. One individual will not have the power to grant or revoke permission for a clinical trial as we now understand it. To do so would involve an individual in responsibility for the study. In this section of the Bill it seems that the Minister for Health is taking such responsibility by virtue of his absolute power within the Bill. In the event of an accident, because the Minister seeks to take absolute power to himself obviously then he must live with the legal consequences which could follow. I have no <Col N="33" /> doubt that because the Minister is taking unto himself so much power, if something did go wrong he could be cited as a codefendant. This section could also frighten off voluntary, independent, well-meaning people from acting on ethics committees in the future. The section, by implication, sets out to incriminate too many well-intentioned people. Certainly I visualise the legal people making a meal out of this section if anything goes wrong although, naturally, we all hope nothing will ever go wrong.</P>
    <P>Section 13 seems to reverse the usual legal understanding that a person is innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with fees payable in respect of applications made under the proposed Act as well as other charges considered appropriate by the Minister for Health. It is stated that these fees shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister of Finance. While it is stated in the Explanatory Memorandum that it is intended that the level of fees and charges will be such as to cover the cost of this statutory scheme, it is not stated that the level will not cover this particular cost. There is much concern about this section. We all know what happened with the Youth Employment Agency &mdash; moneys that were intended for specific use went into other areas of Government. You could argue that this is a blank cheque to the Government in this area of concern. The formula for deciding the fee to be charged is not mentioned in the section. There is vagueness about this and a fear as to who will decide on the level of fees. There is a debate going on in regard to the size of the fee, will it be £100 or £1,000? At what stage of the proceedings will this information emerge? Will we have more bureaucratic delays? The expertise does not seem to be available in Government Departments for this kind of work. I do not object to a fee but, provided the fees are not excessive, the big concern is that it will take weeks and weeks to decide on a fee. Who will decide a price for each trial? Certainly it needs further clarification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The Minister in his Second Stage speech referred to consultation but from what I understand, very little worthwhile, round the table consultation took place. Did the Minister or his officials sit around the table with very important people who have the interest of this industry at heart? Did they criticise them or explain the problems as they saw them in this vital, complex matter? It is very important to have around the table consultation with such groups as the National Drugs Advisory Board, the Medical Research Council and many others who have a legitimate concern in regard to medical research and patients welfare. This consultation would have enhanced the Bill so that the very important objective of protecting the volunteers is achieved but in a climate in which much needed medical research can continue.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to the Bill is quite strong. I stressed during the debate the importance of strict controls for volunteers. If the Minister had insisted on extra medicals before, during and after a trial we would support him. If he had asked for extra controls for ethics committees or subcommittees we would also support him. A number of things are wrong in the Bill. It is an all embracing Bill with an all embracing title beyond what was ever considered or dreamed about. There is an inadequate definition of the meaning of a clinical trial. There is the question of the absolute power the Minister for Health seeks in this difficult area. There is no mention of the National Drugs Advisory Board within the Bill itself. There are very serious problems in the area of insurance for universities, medical schools and groups like that as distinct from other corporate groups.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of definition about fees and the resultant bureaucratic delays in the Bill. Major delays are inevitable, causing serious problems for the industry. The Bill seeks to treat all clinical trials in the same fashion. There has been a lack of formal consultation.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not have a Committee Stage on this Bill because it is so wrong, so vague. There is a lack of consideration <Col N="35" /> and understanding of the problems and knowledge of clinical trials.</P>
    <P>I saw one ray of hope in the Minister's speech on the Health Estimate. He said that he would entertain all reasonable suggestions for improvements in the Bill. There is so much wrong with it that the Minister should consider not bringing it any further and prepare a Bill that everybody can accept. I hope the Minister will not proceed with this Bill and that he will have the necessary discussion with knowledgeable, concerned, interested groups and prepare a Bill that will not affect the future of medical research. This Bill as it stands will almost certainly do so.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill is very much out of line with legislation in other Western countries. I urge the Minister to introduce a Bill that will have the vital important objectives of protecting participants with the strongest controls in an environment in which much needed medical research can continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution is provoked rather than being an ordinary response to legislation that is before this House. I qualify that by saying that if this Bill had been in operation 12 months ago, I would probably have been speaking from the point of view of someone who had lost a member of his family. Had it not been for the fact that drugs without restriction were available at all times to expert medical persons without delay, a member of my family would probably have died. It is for that reason that I forcibly express deep reservations about this Bill. From representations that have been made to me. I am firmly convinced that the Minister should have another look at the Bill. If he were to take on the task of redrafting this Bill, much of its content would be changed and many of the sections would be more direct. They would give a clear indication of the confidence of the Minister and the Department in the medical profession. Much of the correspondence that has been sent to Senators from all the various medical schools, colleges, universities and health <Col N="36" /> boards has confused us to a certain degree. I have read it with great care and given it much consideration and underlying all of it is a deep opposition to this. It has been given coverage by all aspects of the media, but because it is a field where expertise and professionalism are necessary, there has not been much comment by lay people; it has been left to the professional people, to the experts in whom I have the utmost confidence to make that comment. Hence it is today that we Senators have volumes of material before us which we cannot treat lightly or dismiss. If we glibly dismiss some of the comments, we do so at our peril.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this at the outset because of my very strong personal feelings, while acknowledging that my understanding of the medical contents of the Bill is limited. But the general tone of the Bill is to assume that all medical research in new drugs is commissioned by multinationals and it is as a response to that that we have it before us. Indeed, the haste with which this was brought before the House is, I believe, a response to the very tragic death in 1984, of Niall Rush while taking part in a volunteer study in the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology. I appreciate the Minister's concern to bring forward legislation to control such studies. At the same time, it must be agreed that the fact that we have no statutory legislation does not necessarily mean we have no control. That is not the answer to it and that is not the response I would expect from any source. What I am saying is that in the National Drugs Advisory Board we have a competent organisation that down the years has shown itself to be expert in this field and has done a very good job on what it was intended to do. I believe the various Ministers through the years have appointed to that board people whose expertise in their particular fields cannot be questioned. We must give credit to the various Ministers for the quality and calibre of persons included on that board. But has the Minister available to him within his Department people of similar experience? The Minister may have people with certain qualifications in his <Col N="37" /> Department, but what I am asking is if he has the personnel within his Department with the expertise to make the decisions heretofore made by the people on the National Drugs Advisory Board. I do not believe he has. I do not blame him for that because of the financial and other restrictions on him in these crucial times. In introducing the Bill the Minister is showing a lack of confidence in the National Drugs Advisory Board. I regret that very much because he has the opportunity to place on that board people with the expertise whom he himself can approach and ask to volunteer or whatever is the usual protocol with regard to appointments to that board.</P>
    <P>The other aspect which frightens me is that it would appear from the volumes of correspondence all of us have had, that there has been no consultation. The Minister, in his Second Stage speech to this House, said there was consultation. But I ask him, can a simple request from the Department of the Minister of the day to respond by means of letters and papers be described as consultation? I believe it cannot and I believe that, as a result of that, the expertise and the goodwill that are abroad may be distanced at this stage from a very serious commitment to the Bill. Professional people cannot at all times give credence to any personal slants because their priority over anything else has always been the health and welfare of the people of this nation and it is to their eternal credit that we have a standard of medication in this country today to compare with other countries and with the level of financing in the Department that is a credit to them. There is no doubt about that. The level of financing for the health services in this country today compares very favourably with that in other developed countries. At the same time, whatever may have been the history and relationships of personalities in the past, I believe it is not too late for a new Minister, as Senator Fallon has said, to request consultation across the board. I believe that when all Senators have spoken, &mdash; and I would not like party politics to enter into this debate &mdash; the number of amendments <Col N="38" /> which will be proposed to this Bill will render it such a changed Bill that the Minister should seriously consider withdrawing and redrafting it, having consulted with all the interested groups who now seem to have a legitimate concern but have not had an input, not simply because of their own personal egos but because of general concern for the welfare of our people and the development of medical attention for those requiring the services. The Minister should reconsider. I believe that the complaints which abound with regard to consultation are justified in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>The other aspect that concerns me is that the Bill vests total control in one person, the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a vital role to play in the whole proceedings. But I believe that the actual running of this aspect of control of drugs should be left with, if the Minister so decides, a revamped National Drugs Advisory Board with the people who are now absent from it incorporated into it and their experience availed of. But when whole systems become authoritarian not only is it difficult for the Department to administer them but it is even more difficult for the people involved, the practitioners and so on. If we are tied up in cumbersome technicalities and procedures I believe the tragedy we had in 1984 will be far surpassed by the numbers of tragedies that will be laid, rightly or wrongly, at the Minister's doorstep if people die, as inevitably they will, because of delays in procedure and protocol.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to take total responsibility for the trials of all drugs. Here, I come to one of the other problems I have with this legislation. Included in the legislation are all drugs, not necessarily new drugs that have to be tried before going on commercial sale and being made available to the practitioners. The fact that the Minister has incorporated ordinary everyday drugs makes it ever so much more cumbersome and there is widespread concern that the Minister has done that rather than sending the new drugs for clinical trial. I ask the Minister to seriously consider that and <Col N="39" /> I look forward with hope. I know the Minister has responded very favourably to criticism in the past and is open to amending legislation. I hope that when concluding on Second Stage, the Minister will consider the wisdom of including everyday drugs already proven and shown to be effective. I hope he will omit that particular clause and include new drugs for trial.</P>
    <P>Tied up with that is the fact that the Minister will have the power, without appeal to refuse or approve, naturally enough on taking advice available from within the Department. But at the same time he has that sole right without appeal and that is an unnecessary inclusion in the Bill. It is taking on far too much and it is unnecessary. I do not believe it is acceptable to the general body of medical people and I do not think the public at large expect the Minister to go that far. All of us realise that, no matter what regulations, or what committees, or what safeguards exist, drug testing is liable to go wrong on some occasions; it is not 100 per cent effective and safe in all cases. The paramount concern is that the patients' welfare must be safeguarded always. With that as the background we have an inbuilt safeguard without interfering with the Bill as it is.</P>
    <P>The only other major concern that I have is in regard to the subjects who undergo the trials, their recruitment and, as Senator Fallon mentioned, the monetary compensation or reward that is given to them following the trial. Much of the media attention has homed in on this aspect. We have seen programmes on television and have seen articles by various sections of the media about the findings resulting from the unfortunate tragedy that we have had. In the greatest proportion of cases we see that most often the subjects are young people, very often unemployed and, even more often, homeless. It is a vulnerable section of society that comes forward. That is a general classification of the group. As Senator Fallon said immediately prior to me, the overriding factor seems to be the <Col N="40" /> monetary aspect; in so far as the type of subject coming forward is concerned, the reward is the dominating influence.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister has included in the Bill certain provisions which will bring these trials under scrutiny. But what is in the Bill is too vague. The recommendations of various groups that the reward would be below the supplementary welfare allowance for any person is welcome but therein is another problem: many of the participants need the money because they have no other source of finance; they have to get money some place and they do this rather than break the law. In many other cases still it is used as a supplement for incomes. As Senator Fallon said it might be an added bonus in a household or for a particular item of clothing or food. The people who present themselves are very often vulnerable people in society and as such are unsuitable for trials. There is, as the provisions of the Bill provide, the necessity for some screening prior to accepting subjects. The Minister's demands there are reasonable. That that has to be done by a general practitioner before the trial is undertaken is very welcome. That area of vagueness that might have existed in some people's minds before is clarified and there will be no misunderstanding as to the quality of persons undertaking those trials. To tackle it simply in the light of the social background and standing of that person in society would be difficult and it would be difficult to be absolutely confident as to the reward to be given in particular instances.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, as Senator Fallon said previously, that clinical trials and the advance of medical science in this country are given over to inducements. It is sad but real. Indeed, some of the multinational companies mention in their literature the contribution they have made by way of inducements to subjects to participate in clinical trials. That is a dangerous area. The ethics committee play a central role in overseeing the conduct of researchers. The major role of the committee is to consider the ethical <Col N="41" /> and moral aspects of the proposed studies. The committee's review and approval should be mandatory prior to the start of any study. That is an aspect that all the people who have read the Bill should welcome.</P>
    <P>The new requirement for a person wishing to arrange for the conduct of a clinical trial to supply particulars and get prior approval will undoubtedly lead to a cumbersome and costly operation. The Minister, as Minister for Health, will always be conscious of costs. But the Minister should reconsider his introduction in this Bill of an unnecessary additional cost into a simple procedure that has worked well in the past by way of the work of the Drugs Advisory Board. To conclude, I would, on Committee Stage have to bring forward a number of amendments which I see as absolutely necessary, and I am sure that all the other Senators, and many of the professional people directly involved with many aspects of this Bill, will have many other amendments to suggest too. This will render the Bill unworkable as it is drafted at present. I look forward to the Minister's comments at the end of Second Stage as to the final outcome of this Bill. Will he, in the light of the response that it has got, consider redrafting it or will it be possible to include the necessary amendments to make the Bill effective? Many people might say that a simple money Bill might have been sufficient to prevent the original reaction in so far as that would have been sufficient. If the Minister had limited that, would he have excluded by that simple method, many of the problems that could have arisen in the past? I await the Minister's response on Second Stage. Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of a Bill in this area because it is important that we have adequate controls and proper protection of the public. I have listened with considerable interest to the contributions of Senator Sean Fallon and Senator Ulick Burke and they seem to be agreed in their approach. They both think the Minister should withdraw the Bill because they believe that it <Col N="42" /> has a number of defects. The Bill needs considerable amendment and improvement, but I do not urge the Minister to withdraw it. Rather I intend and hope that the Minister will adopt the approach which he has indicated that he is open to discussion of and acceptance of amendments which would improve the scope and the shape of the Bill. That is what we would do on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I listened with great attention to what Senator Fallon and Senator Burke said about the Bill. They both seemed to agree that we need a Bill dealing with this area. Neither of them said we did not; indeed they both for various reasons urged the importance of having a Bill to deal with the principle of proper protection and adequate and balanced control in this area. We have a Bill before us and many of us would welcome the fact that the Bill has been introduced into the Seanad. Now we have a constructive role to play; we have a task before us of ensuring that when the Bill has completed its passage through the Seanad it will reflect the proper concerns both of the medical profession and of other interests who have made representations to Senators, that the Bill will be a much better Bill.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with that. I see nothing wrong with the Bill being substantially amended during its passage through the Seanad but I would greatly regret any hesitation on the part of the Minister with his commitment to this Bill or indeed that he would in anyway listen to those who urge that it might be withdrawn, because if a Bill of this kind is withdrawn it will lose any parliamentary pecking order it has; it will lose momentum and it is much less likely that we will see any legislation introducing proper controls in this area.</P>
      <P>Therefore, from the Independent benches I urge the Minister to stand firm but I will be seeking with others to impress upon him the strong grounds that there are for quite substantial amendment of and hopefully improvement of the structure of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been made aware personally for some time before the tragic death of Niall Rush of a very serious problem in this <Col N="43" /> area, a problem concerning volunteers participating in clinical drug trials. A number of social workers who are involved in the inner city area in Dublin had drawn the problem to my attention, indeed had in a general way sought legal advice as to whether any steps could be taken to protect what is very often a vulnerable group, as has already been mentioned, the unemployed, those who may already be using drugs, those who are disposed to participate purely because they need the money often for the basic amenities of life, often to pay for basic food and shelter. What was emphasised to me at the time, and what I feel is a very real cause for concern, is that a number of these very often young volunteers were used over and over again in these drug trials and that there was no adequate supervision, no adequate monitoring and no care taken, in some instances, to ensure that the drugs being administered as would be required for the purposes of the particular trial. We have a very serious problem and we must address that problem.</P>
    <P>The detail of the administration and the shape of the Bill is a matter for Committee Stage and if we are agreed, as I feel the House will be, about the principle of the Bill then it is extremely important that we take time to consider the serious representations which have been made on various sides to Senators, and to the Minister, about the possibility of improving the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the representations I have received as a Member of this House and I am sure a number of the representations I will refer to have also been received by other Senators. These representations are informed and they raise issues which merit extremely serious consideration. I am supportive of a number of the points made and I hope either to table appropriate amendments or, better still, to welcome ministerial amendments reflecting the acceptance of the points that are being made.</P>
    <P>I will name my sources because it is important in considering representations <Col N="44" /> about a Bill of this kind that it be known what the source of the particular criticism or the particular comment is. It is like a declaration of interest; we should know who is saying it so that we may weigh what is being said.</P>
    <P>The first set of representations I want to consider comes from the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals/St. James' Hospital Research Ethics Committee. They were prepared by Professor John Feely and by my colleague in the law school, William Duncan, senior lecturer in law and contain a number of specific comments about the Bill which I want to put before the House and comment on. First, under the heading &ldquo;The Position of Ethics Committees under the Bill&rdquo; they say:</P>
    <P>Procedures for the approval of Ethics Committees within the scheme of control proposed in the Bill are unsatisfactory. Some of the rules appear to be based on an erroneous assumption that Ethics Committees are <i>ad hoc</i> bodies constituted to approve particular clinical trial proposals. The procedures are likely to give rise to excessive delays and involve giving the person proposing a clinical trial an improper degree of influence over the membership of Ethics Committees.</P>
    <P>They go on to raise a number of specific objections which I will come to. There is a certain point in that initial overall comment. Reading the Bill as it stands it does seem to characterise ethics committees as being <i>ad hoc.</i> Indeed, the applicant for the trial seems to have a very substantial role in relation to proposing and, in the Bill as it stands, to objecting to a member or members of the ethics committee. That is something that warrants serious consideration. As the Minister is aware, ethics committees function at the moment and they function in a different way. We should examine how they function before we approach the whole concept of ethics committees in a quite different way which is what the <Col N="45" /> Bill is proposing to do. Ethics committees, such as this particular committee, the FDVH/St. James' Hospital Research Ethics Committee, or the St. Vincent's Ethics Committee, or the Mater Ethics Committee, or committees in any of our major hospitals function as bodies whose members generally serve for about three years on the ethics committee. They are representative of different interests, medical, non-medical, both sexes and a broader desire to be representative of the wider public interest.</P>
    <P>The advantage of a body that has members serving on it for a number of years is that it builds up its own expertise and evaluation over time. It would seem that this is preferable to having in all cases an <i>ad hoc</i> body in relation to each clinical trial which is proposed. I tend to share the construction put on the Bill in that at the moment it does seem that for each clinical trial there has to be prior approval of an <i>ad hoc</i> ethics committee which is the committee for that proposed clinical trial. In his reply to the Second Stage debate the Minister may wish to clarify that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>I will come now to some of the specific comments or points made about the role of ethics committees as proposed in the Bill. A question is asked as to why it should be the applicant who, in all cases, would propose the names, qualifications and so on of the members of the appropriate ethics committees as in section 2 (1). I question that. That does not seem to me to be the appropriate role and relationship between an applicant body or an applicant individual proposing to carry out a clinical trial and actually proposing the members of the ethics committee. I see much greater merit in the existing system where there is a standing ethics committee quite independent of who would come along at any point and apply to carry out a clinical trial. On the face of it that seems to be a question which the Minister should respond to. Why give the applicant any role in proposing the names and qualifications of the membership of the proposed ethics committee? Should not that committee <Col N="46" /> be already there <i>in situ</i> quite independently?</P>
    <P>Another comment made is that the Minister will have to give prior approval to a proposed ethics committee no matter how frequently he may have approved that ethics committee before. This is another aspect of this question, of whether, as it appears to be proposed in the Bill, ethics committees have to be <i>ad hoc</i> bodies or whether it could be, as the existing practice is, that these would be bodies which would serve for a period of time. It would be proper and reasonable that the Minister would approve the composition of an ethics committee but that that ethics committee would have a certain duration and during that time deal with the clinical trial applications which came before them in the normal way. The research committee of the FDVH St. James' point out the delay and bureaucracy involved in having to clear an <i>ad hoc</i> ethics committee for each proposal for a clinical trial. That is a valid comment and I would like to hear the Minister's view on it.</P>
    <P>Another criticism which they make, and which I share at this stage, is that the Bill provides that a person arranging to conduct a clinical trial can request a change in the composition of the ethics committee. That seems to be the wrong relationship between the person carrying out the clinical trial and the ethics committee. Why should they be able to recommend a change in the ethics committee? That would seem to undermine the independence, impartiality and distance between the ethics committee and the person proposing to carry out the clinical trial.</P>
    <P>The last specific point on the ethics committees made in this representation concerns the fact that although there is mention of the broad concept of competence of members of ethics committees, the Bill is curiously silent about membership of and representation of such committees. It may be that the Minister did not feel it appropriate to write in provisions in any detail and in that way seek to standardise the composition of ethics committees, but it might be helpful <Col N="47" /> to have some guidelines and standards in that regard.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report in January 1986 on the use of drugs in biomedical research and appendix B to that report considers the whole question of ethics committees. It first of all considers what the objectives of an ethics committee should be and it also considers the kind of composition of an ethics committee which would be viewed as being balanced and rounded and reflecting what should be in mind. I should like to quote the two passages, first of all on the objectives of ethics committees and then on the kind of composition which these ethics committees should have. On the objectives of ethics committees the report recites as follows:</P>
    <P>The objectives are as stated earlier to facilitate medical research in the interests of society, to protect subjects participating in research from possible harm, to preserve their rights, and to provide reassurance to the public that this is being done. Committees also protect research workers from unjustified attack. The Ethics Committee should consider the following points:</P>
    <P>(a) Is the intention of the research to increase the understanding of some of the fundamental aspects of human structure or function in disease, or in health, or to test the effectiveness of various forms of diagnostic technique or the prevention or treatment of disease?</P>
    <P>(b) May the required information be obtained from animal models and has the study been designed with a view to obtaining this information from as few subjects as possible who will be exposed to a minimum of risk and inconvenience?</P>
    <P>(c) Is the responsible investigator appropriately qualified and experienced, commanding facilities to ensure that all aspects of the work will be undertaken with due discretion and precaution to protect the safety of the subjects?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> (d) Has every effort been made to inform prospective subjects of the objectives and consequences of their involvement, and particularly of identifiable risks and inconvenience?</P>
    <P>Ethics Committees should only approve studies which are of good quality and should feel free to refuse an application on grounds of inadequate scientific quality. They should not hesitate to make use of external advisers for difficult and technical problems.</P>
    <P>The other area I want to refer to is the membership and appointment of ethics committees. On the question of membership the report proposes:</P>
    <P>Membership should comprise at least:&mdash; (a) Medical, both those occupied chiefly with clinical care as well as experienced clinical investigators.</P>
    <P>(b) Para-medical: a nurse who is in active practice with patients or other non-medical professional health care workers, e.g. physiotherapist, social worker.</P>
    <P>(c) Lay: i.e. one, or perhaps, better, two persons not trained in or practising any medical or paramedical discipline.</P>
    <P>(d) Both sexes should be represented.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the question of membership when I deal with some of the other representations but it is important that we are aware of the kind of role and composition which would fit the role for an ethics committee.</P>
    <P>The other issue which is dealt with in this representation concerns the review of applications. As I understand it the present approach in most cases where there are standing ethics committees in the larger hospitals is that if an application is made and is refused then the person who has been refused can, and very often does, reapply. There may be some slight modification but at least they can apply again to the same ethics committee and, if they are refused again, that is it. The ethics committees at the moment work under the National Drugs Advisory Board guidelines and, as has <Col N="49" /> been mentioned by Senators Fallon and Burke, the board play a valuable role in relation to advising on and being supportive of the work of ethics committees. As I see it, and I do not claim to be a total expert in this area, it does not seem to me that the National Drugs Advisory Board are an ethics committee or are a potential review ethics committee. They have a particular role and expertise in relation to advising on drugs and, therefore, between the alternative of the structure proposed in the Bill, it is the Minister who will be the reviewing person or an official in his Department or the National Drugs Advisory Board. It does not seem to me that either of those represents the best approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I would not be of the view that this type of review or appeal of a refusal by an ethics committee should be to an official of the Department of Health. I do not think it is fair on an official to presume that they would have the knowledge, the sensitivity or the evaluation that an ethics committee would have. How could an individual have knowledge in different areas? This is a highly specialised field and it does not seem to be a proper approach. I understand that in Scandanavia they have addressed this problem by establishing a national ethics committee which acts as an appeal body from local ethics committees in hospitals and so on. I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of establishing a national ethics committee which could act as an ethics committee for small institutions or private institutions which would not have easily within their reach or available to them a broad based ethics committee which could be established. They could use a national ethics committee which could also be the appeal or review body from the refusal of a standing ethics committee in one of the larger hospitals or other bodies which have standing committees. That would seem to be a way of ensuring that the public interest is safeguarded. I am strongly concerned about the public interest. The Minister should be directly represented on the national ethics committee. There <Col N="50" /> is a public interest which the Minister has to ensure is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I do not see the value of internalising and centralising this into the Department of Health as is proposed in the Bill. The way in which that would function is not spelled out in the Bill. There is no criteria for saying how that process of review will operate. It is clear that this is something we will have to come back to.</P>
    <P>The third point made in this representation is in relation to the scope of the Bill, something which has already been commented on by Senators Fallon and Burke. The view is that the scope of the Bill is too broad. The report states:</P>
    <P>Ministerial approval will be required for all studies involving any &ldquo;substance&rdquo; or &ldquo;preparation&rdquo;. In our interpretation this may include studies of dietary manipulation involving normal dietary constituents and even water. Furthermore, the inclusion of established drugs, those that are licensed for sale in the Republic of Ireland, is seriously out of line with legislation in this regard in Europe and North America and will, we feel, place unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles in the way of normal research and academic activities. Thus the taking of simple drugs such as aspirin by patients or by students in their practical classes will require to go through the lengthy bureaucratic and possibly expensive process of receiving Ministerial approval. Currently such studies are considered by an appropriately constituted, competent ethics committee.</P>
    <P>The concern expressed here relates to the drafting of section 5 (2) of the Bill as it stands. Having looked through the section I am concerned that it is very broadly couched. Initially it is not intended to interfere with the normal practice of, for example, a registered medical practitioner or a registered dentist in a dental practice but the last words of section 5 (2) state that there should be no exclusion if it is not exclusively for the welfare of the patient. That wording gives <Col N="51" /> rise to concern because that means a general practitioner &mdash; and hopefully more and more practitioners are doing this &mdash; who carried out ongoing empirical research on his patients in the sense of noting the effects of drugs etc., is not doing it exclusively for the welfare of the patient. That wording can legitimately give rise to concern. Perhaps Senator Robb can give us the benefit of his experience on whether this is a greater worry than we need have or whether, in fact, it would cause concern to medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>The fourth point made in this representation relates to the status of placebo and non-therapeutic research and this relates to the interpretation of section 8 of the Bill as it stands. The concern is that it might not be possible to perform these kinds of studies using inert substances, or harmless substances for the purpose of monitoring the effects of drugs. These may not be possible and yet these placebo controlled studies are in many instances the only means of assessing the true efficacy of the particular therapy. That is another matter which the Minister should comment on in his reply.</P>
    <P>One concern that has been expressed very forcibly to me is that this type of testing is standard for drugs that have been licensed for use here and that, therefore, it could lead to a fairly absurd situation where the Bill would prohibit the tests necessary to have drugs registered here.</P>
    <P>A fifth major point raised in these representations related to the question of insurance. I am as concerned about representations from the medical profession about insurance as I would be concerned if I had representations from the legal profession about some matter related to their position. Therefore, I tread very warily when I am told that the provision in relation to insurance, as framed at present in the Bill, would be quite impracticable and not possible. Nonetheless, it was a matter of some concern to me to learn that insurance as a general rule is not carried by doctors practising <Col N="52" /> in Ireland, that they would have malpractice indemnity, but that would be the height of it, that it would be &mdash; and I think there is some argument here&mdash; extremely difficult to get insurance on terminally ill patients in relation to clinical drug trials for the very reason that obviously the insurance risks would be too high. These are important issues which the Minister must address in his reply. It is not an area on which I have very strong or already formed views but it obviously is a matter which is causing concern.</P>
    <P>The final matter raised in this representation from the FDVH St. James' Hospital Research and Ethics Committee is the whole question of bureaucracy, the fact that there is no time limit placed on the Minister's consideration of either the composition of the ethics committee or the result of its deliberations. The phrase, &ldquo;The Minister shall as soon as practicable&rdquo;, is one of these elastic phrases that can run for weeks or even months and it may still be &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. The view is that this would potentially cause very serious problems and there are various ways in which it could be dealt with. A fixed time could be inserted, such as three or four weeks and if within that time no objection had been raised then the matter could go ahead. That would be one way of doing it and the onus, in effect, would be on whoever was the approving body to do so within a definite time.</P>
    <P>I deliberately started with these representations because they cover a number of the points which are the areas which may and, indeed, in a number of instances will require amendment on Committee Stage. I hope when the Minister is replying to this debate he will take the time to address these issues and these areas and indicate what the ministerial response is to them.</P>
    <P>Another representation which I received, and which I am sure other Senators received, was from the academic institutions, from the deans of the medical faculties in a number of institutions. It is not all that often that one has such unanimity in the profession, and <Col N="53" /> there does appear to be a wide degree of unanimity on some of the major worries about the Bill. I will quote from this statement which is signed by a number of the deans of the faculty of medicine and representatives of the Royal College of Physicians and the faculties of medicine in Ireland. I quote:</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned at the scope of this Bill which encompasses not alone new drugs but all established drugs in everyday medical practice, including those that can be bought without a prescription, normal food substances and vitamins. Not alone will ministerial permission be required (on the payment of a fee) for normal medical and dental student educational practical classes but also for studies involving simple dietary changes.</P>
    <P>They go on to seek a distinction between drugs in routine clinical practice and new drugs. This is something that seems to be strongly emphasised by those who are informed and are aware of the need to draw a distinction between already licensed existing drugs and new drugs where much greater concern and much greater issues would require to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The other representation which I wanted to deal with is from a different source, not from the academic or medical side but from people on the ground who are closely aware of the problem I identified at the beginning of my contribution, that is, the representation of the Social Policy Action Group. Senator Fallon referred to a number of points which were made in the representations from this group but I would like to deal with some of them in considerable detail. They refer to the criteria in section 2(1) (d) of the Bill to be used for the selection of participants and say that this must take account of their medical and social background. It is worth reflecting on the type of volunteers who tend to be drawn into these clinical drug trials. They tend to be young, unemployed, short of money and socially deprived. Are they necessarily or even clinically the type of persons who would <Col N="54" /> be likely to reflect the indications of problems of those who might be using the drugs? Those drugs might be used on geriatric patients. Is enough care being exercised? I am concerned that there is not. Vulnerable helpless volunteers who are inadequately informed are sucked into the system. They do it purely for the money and are exploited in some instances by those who are carrying out the research for the purpose of increasing the profitability of their enterprise. Therefore, the Social Policy Action Group are concerned that details of any proposed inducements or rewards, whether monetary or otherwise, should be made known. I understand that this is already a function exercised by existing ethics committees &mdash; certainly by the ethics committee with which I have been in contact. They require to know if monetary inducements are being handed out and, if so, the level of those monetary inducements and so on.</P>
    <P>The Social Policy Action Group say that such payments should not exceed the rates as laid down for supplementary welfare allowances. I would like to reflect on that. They should be at a modest enough level not to be, in themselves, a strong inducement. I am not sure if it is necessary, at the same time, that they should be kept inflexibly to the level of social welfare allowance. It is more important to ensure that there is no exploitation. The social policy action group talk about the composition of the ethics committees and make the very valid point that those appointed to ethics committees must have no involvement, financial or otherwise, with the testing agency or any drug company. The Minister should be concerned to ensure that nobody with a financial stake in or no employee of a drug company would be a member of the ethics committee approving or considering a proposal for a clinical trial and that they would have no financial stake or financial involvement at all in the matter which they were examining.</P>
    <P>The Social Policy Action Group refer to the composition of ethics committees and that has been dealt with in the report <Col N="55" /> prepared by the Royal College of Physicians, a report from quite an in-house and rather conservative source. In relation to ethics committees, we should try to ensure that they actually represent in a broad way, in some measure at least, those who are likely to be the volunteers or certainly are likely to know of the problems on the ground. I strongly advocate that the membership of ethics committees should be of both sexes and that there should be substantial lay participation as well as medical participation.</P>
    <P>The final point made by the Social Policy Action Group which we must consider on Committee Stage is the whole question of the informed consent, of the person being either capable or not of comprehending how they would consent. Their view is that where a person is incapable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of a consent that person should not be a participant in a clinical trial.</P>
    <P>They were the substantial representations I received on this issue. There were other representations which repeated some of the points I have made which were made to me in my capacity as a Senator, knowing that this Bill was introduced into the Seanad and that we would have the first opportunity &mdash; and I hope a very full opportunity &mdash; to consider it.</P>
    <P>One matter which did not form any substantial part of the representations made to me and on which I would like to hear the views of the Minister is the extent to which there should be monitoring of the carrying out of clinical trials when they have been approved. As I understand it, in the United States they can provide for inspectors who have a right to go and see whatever they want to see in relation to the carrying out of a clinical trial. They can go in at any time. Under the World Health Organisation there is support for the idea that an inspectorial role should be played. I do not see that written in to the provisions of the Bill at this stage and I wonder if it should be included so that there is a right, <Col N="56" /> which need not be exercised in a manner that is unduly intrusive, to inspect and look at books. The Bill provides that a report should be made and that information must be supplied by the person carrying out the clinical trial but it is important, given the nature of the matter and the significant need for the protection of the public, that there should be some form of right of inspection as such during the conduct of clinical trials. I would also like to see some method of follow-up on former volunteers, some way of ensuring that even if they did not suffer any ill-effects during the course of a clinical trial, that they have not, perhaps a year or six or seven years later, suffered indications that would be worrying and that might be attributable to their participation in a clinical trial. These are the main points which I want to deal with at this stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, both Senator Fallon and Senator Burke criticised the lack of consultation before this Bill was introduced into this House. From what has been said to me in relation to various representations, I believe there probably was inadequate consultation. It would have been preferable if more time had been taken for consultation with various interested and informed parties. That is not a serious defect in a Bill of this kind if we now enter a flexible and constructive process of amending and improving the Bill. Now is the time when it would be very relevant to have consultation in relation to any proposed amendments so that proposed approaches to amendments can be discussed. Those who have considerable knowledge of the existing system, are aware of the difficulties, are aware and concerned about the need to further and foster research in Ireland should be involved, just as representatives and Members of this House would wish to be involved in considering amendments and in putting forward various detailed improvements to the Bill. I hope that we can have Committee Stage arranged on a timescale to allow full consideration of possible amendments and that there will be a process of consultation in the interim. I would then be confident that the Bill will emerge as an improved <Col N="57" /> Bill dealing with a very important social area.</P>

      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Leader of the House for giving me that amount of leeway. I will not keep the House too long, but it is important to throw into the debate the sum of my experience, particularly when I was working in academic surgery over ten years ago. I was very heartened to hear Senator Robinson's approach to this subject because, in supporting the thrust of the Bill &mdash; which I will also do &mdash; she requested the Minister to leave himself open to amendments. I am quite sure that this Bill, like so many others coming through this House, will be greatly improved by amending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start by holding up for the attention of the House a £10 cheque which I was sent in 1977 and unlike those from Seanad Éireann it has not been cashed. That £10 cheque was sent to me with an accompanying letter from a drug company saying that as promised, they had despatched to me free of charge 4×10 one ml. ampules of a particular drug, together with a supply of coded patient record cards, that these had been sent to the hospital pharmacy marked &ldquo;for your attention&rdquo; and that they had asked the pharmacist to let me know when they arrived. They went on that they had pleasure in enclosing a cheque for £10 in payment for my registration fee, and confirmed that for every ten completed patient cards received by them <Col N="58" /> between then and 31 March, a further payment of £15 would be made to me.</P>
    <P>That is inducement of the worst sort. No matter how well disciplined, no matter how professional we try to be, that is temptation handed to one on a plate. I was not subjected to any ethical committee, nor was there any suggestion that there should be an ethical committee, had I chosen to accept the cheque and get on with receiving the £10 notes in rapid order. The irony is that that drug has now turned out to be a very successful drug and is in wide use. Here, is the dilemma. How does one obtain the research in order to ensure that drugs are safe, and while one is doing this research, how can one ensure that the motives of the researcher and of those that are promoting the research are such as to ensure that the target of their research is going to have the research done on him safely? That is what we are discussing here.</P>
    <P>In order to do some research in my much younger days &mdash; something I look back on now with some apprehension &mdash; I felt it would be useful to determine the value of pentegastral stimulation on the acid juice of children. The results had been well known in adults but this required the passage of a nasal gastric tube into the stomach, the injection of pentegastrene and over a period of an hour or two hours, the collection of the child's gastric juice. At that time, 16 or 17 years ago, this was not subjected to any harsh or stern scrutiny by a committee. As a result, I could speak to the parents, I could discuss what I was doing. Although it depends what emphasis one puts on it, it is very easy, as a professional dressed up in a white coat in a clinical situation where the dependent mother and nervous child comes with a longstanding problem, to persuade them that if this is not to their benefit it may be to the benefit of many children in the years to come, when in fact one knows, it is primarily of benefit to one's own research project, to one's own acquisition of papers in the whole business of what was known in the fifties and sixties when I was going through the research machine as a publish or perish mentality. There is <Col N="59" /> another reason why we need to scrutinise what is going on when it comes to research on fellow human beings, be they fit or be they ill.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing awareness among people, particularly among those who are earnestly pro-life in reaction to the pro-death nuclearism in which we find ourselves, of the quality of life of animals and they are much more insistent that standards of research and standards of experimentation on animals are under the most severe scrutiny. In another research I tried to develop an operative technique for people who suffer from portal hypertension as a result of liver cirrhosis, whereby one diverts the blood going to the liver into a vein which takes it on to the heart. This involved 50 to 100 greyhounds. Those greyhounds were subjected to at least three operations in the course of their lives and, as a result of this, had a deplorable existence. In any case I am mentioning animal research, investigatory research, and therapeutic research. I would very much support the general thrust of the Bill because we need to promote safeguards in relation to what is being done. Senator Mary Robinson's suggestion of standing ethics committees is an excellent one. The idea of a national ethics committee is also excellent.</P>
    <P>Taking the point that has been raised this afternoon by Senators Fallon and Burke and also by Senator Rogers, we have also got to consider that if we are going to have effective research and if our research is to remain well motivated, and if we are looking for results which can be of benefit to the health of the people, then the people who are doing that research and who can stand over that type of research must not feel that they are lumbered with unnecessary bureaucracy and must not feel that they are applying for permission to remote Departments in which there is not the expertise or understanding to respond positively, quickly and constructively to their application.</P>
    <P>I was rather alarmed that Senator Burke has such a tremendous faith in professionals. Certainly, professionals <Col N="60" /> have their role to play. They have had a training and they are there to respond to specific social needs. But professionals are human beings like anyone else. When one looks at the pressures put on our young and not so young, men in the medical profession today in order to train themselves, to establish themselves, to meet the criteria of colleges, general medical councils, teaching hospitals, universities and so on, to churn out papers, to do higher research degrees, post graduate degrees, in order to get that thing they are all after, the ultimate job, then we must realise that, being human, they will endeavour to produce the goods in order to achieve what they want. Ask many of them, and they will say that their prime object is not the point of the research, but to do research in order to get where they want to go. I am not exaggerating, that is a general feeling. Look at the institutions; in order to get capital to keep them funded, in order to get the grants for staff and equipment, they must keep churning out the research material. It is vital that we have an up-to-date, responsive, effective and broad based means to scrutinise what is taking place in the name of research on human beings, and in particular on human beings who are not able to fend for themselves. Therefore, I support the general thrust of this Bill but, without going into detail because time is short. I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss it further when it comes to Committee Stage and that the Minister will be able to take on board many of the recommendations which I am sure will be made at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Report of the Legal Aid Board 1983 and 1984; deplores the severe limitations of the Civil Legal Aid and <Col N="61" /> Advice Scheme operated by the Board; and calls on the Minister for Justice immediately to review the Scheme in the light both of the Pringle Report and of the Airey judgment by the European Court of Human Rights and to introduce legislation, establishing a comprehensive Scheme of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion I am conscious that this is not the first time I have spoken in the Seanad on civil legal aid and it is probably not the last time. I welcome the presence of the Minister. I am pleased that the Seanad is to devote time this evening and next Wednesday to this important subject.</P>
    <P>Legal aid is about justice. It is the mechanism by which we seek to ensure that people who cannot afford to pay for legal services have access to them. This motion has been tabled by Senator Catherine McGuinness and myself because of our deep conviction that the present scheme for civil legal aid and advice is inadequate, underfunded, badly structured and denies justice to many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>As Senators will have noted there are several related issues raised by the terms of the motion: first, the report of the Legal Aid Board for 1983 and 1984 which was only published on 21 February 1986, secondly, the severe limitations of the civil legal aid and advice scheme presently operated by the board, thirdly, the need to review that scheme in the light of the Pringle Report and of the Airey judgment delivered by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and fourthly, the need for legislation to establish a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>I would like to start by referring to the fourth point &mdash; I want to emphasise it and I will be concluding on it &mdash; the importance of establishing by legislation a scheme of civil legal aid and advice. The present scheme is non-statutory. It is an administrative scheme which was introduced in December 1979 following the judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the Airey case. As Senators will recall the court had found that Ireland <Col N="62" /> was in breach of two articles of the Convention, article 6 on access to a court and article 8 on protection of family life. When there was a debate in the Dáil subsequent to the introduction of that scheme, in April 1980, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins indicated that it was his intention to place the scheme for civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing as soon as it could be done. In other words in the interest of having a scheme up and running it had been decided to introduce it on a non-statutory basis. It is interesting to look at the first report of the Legal Aid Board, which is required to report annually. The first report in 1980 refers to the question of the introduction of a statutory scheme. I quote from the report, page 15, paragraph 13:</P>
    <P>The present Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice is non-statutory. It was introduced on an administrative basis in order to get a Scheme into operation with the least possible delay. Another consideration was that if experience suggested the need for change, the non-statutory Scheme would be easier to amend. The Board was informed, however, that the Scheme would be put in statute form at the first suitable opportunity. The Minister for Justice has asked the Board for its views on the question of introducing a statutory Scheme and these views will soon be conveyed to the Minister. The Board considers that the time is now opportune for putting the Scheme in statute form. The present arrangement gives rise to some uncertainty &mdash; for example, as regards the Board's own status &mdash; which will be removed only if legislation is introduced. For avoidance of any doubt, the Board would like to stress that the absence of legislation has had no bearing on its independence in dealing with individual applications for legal aid. The independence is built into the Scheme and has never been in question.</P>
    <P>In the report we are considering in this motion the chairman of the board comes back to, and repeats, that request by the <Col N="63" /> board. The chairman, Mr. Nial Fennelly, Senior Counsel, states in the foreword:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, what the Board has to acknowledge above all else, after five years of operation, is that the Legal Aid Scheme is still very far from providing the type of comprehensive national service that was envisaged at its introduction.</P>
    <P>The problems with Civil Legal Aid are not confined to the issue of resources. This report adverts to various other matters such as a very restricted means test, with no proper periodic revision, and the embargo on recruitment of staff, both of which continue to depress the level of legal aid services provided.</P>
    <P>Another matter of considerable concern to the Board &mdash; and one which has been repeatedly voiced by my predecessors and myself &mdash; is the need to put the Scheme on a proper statutory basis. It was certainly not the intention that it would still be a non-statutory administrative measure five years after its inception. The Board strongly urges the Government to give priority to the long promised legislation.</P>
    <P>When we have finished our discussion of the detail of the problems in relation to the scheme of civil legal aid, I hope that there will be very strong support on all sides of the House for legislation to establish the legal aid and advice system. This is absolutely fundamental. It has been called for. It was promised in 1979 and early 1980 by the Minister who established the scheme. As yet it has not happened.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to a more detailed consideration of some matters in the report to try to summarise my assessment in the time allotted to me for this motion. Clearly, the board identify that the central problem still facing them is inadequate funding. We must understand the importance of committing funds in this area, if there is to be such funding. Nobody is under any illusions that this is a very difficult time. We heard today a depressing announcement in relation to <Col N="64" /> an overrun on expenditure this year which means that anything that requires funding from the State must be justified on very cogent grounds. I am encouraged by previous debates in this House that there is a very real awareness among Senators of the importance of having a properly based scheme of civil legal aid. Indeed, I would argue that in many ways it could be cost saving because it would take away from strains on other sectors and on other professions, in particular strains on the medical and psychiatric resources of the State, if people have access to and can avail of legal advice and services.</P>
    <P>The scheme of civil legal aid we have at present, as Senators are aware, operates through Government appointed law centres where solicitors give legal advice and will take cases on behalf of clients. Clearly, it only operates effectively to the extent that there are centres and the commitment of resources to centres is crucial to the expansion of the existing scheme. There has been some improvement in that area. For example, in May 1985 the Government authorised the establishment of law centres in Tallaght, Athlone and Tralee and also an additional centre in Cork. These were to be funded from the money allocated out of the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984. Senators may recall that there was a provision in that Act for part of the money to be used for these centres. Even allowing for this development there has been a gradual expansion of a network of centres and clinics. These are completely inadequate to deal with the demand for legal services. The report of the Legal Aid Board points out that from time to time throughout 1984 and 1985 it was found necessary to discontinue taking on clients. I have had the problem of people saying they cannot take on any more for six weeks, for two months, of law centres turning away people, unable to deal with a client. In these law centres provision is usually made for what are regarded as totally emergency, usually family law, cases where a protection or barring order is required. Nonetheless, that has been one of the real problems. <Col N="65" /> One of the issues which was raised in this House not so very long ago by Senator McAuliffe and I was the question of the means test which had not been changed from the time the scheme was introduced until it was revised recently by the Minister. I think he did so on 29 May 1986 where he increased the upper limit for eligibility to £5,500. He has also made provision for a special reduced contribution for legal aid payable where the claimant's disposable income is less than £3,500. There have been also some increases in some of the allowances which are taken into account in calculating disposable income. It may be a little soon to have a clear knowledge of what effect that raising of the ceiling will have had. I would be interested if the Minister has any actual figures on the accessibility to law centres and the numbers attending them. The problem was brought out in the report we are discussing. The 1984 figures for both the total number of applications considered and the number of persons who received services under the scheme was down on the 1983 figures. There was a decrease in numbers of people applying and numbers availing of legal services under the scheme.  We will have to wait to see if that trend is in fact reversed by the raising of the ceiling. Certainly &mdash; and this is something we did discuss so I am not going to deal with it in any great detail &mdash; we had got to the absolutely absurd position where somebody totally dependent on social welfare was ineligible, in certain instances depending on the size of their family, for legal aid because they were outside the terms of the means test at that time.</P>
    <P>The statistical profile revealed in the latest report of the Legal Aid Board is much the same as in earlier years in that it shows that a preponderance of the cases are family cases. There is the difference that since the operation of the Courts Act, 1981 these cases are now taken in the Circuit Court or the District Court. Far fewer cases are, therefore, being taken in the High Court. I will refer later to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown but there is a concern about the operation <Col N="66" /> of legal services in family cases and, in particular, a concern about the court structure for the hearing of family cases. Given that matrimonial cases account for approximately 75 per cent of the total case load before these law centres, it is extremely important that we do have proper family tribunals and a broad based system of access to legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>What are the main problems, structurally, with the scheme for civil legal aid and advice which was introduced in December 1979 and which still, as I have emphasised, does not have a statutory basis? The main problem is probably that the scheme was a response to the finding that Ireland was in breach of its obligations under the European Convention because Mrs. Airey did not have the resources herself and could not get access to a remedy for her marriage breakdown problem. The emphasis was on providing resources so that people would have access to legal services. That is only one part, albeit an important part, of the overall problem and challenge of ensuring access to legal services for those who would not be able to afford to have that access.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is very well dealt with and analysed in quite a detailed article in the most recent issue of the Dublin University Law Journal by Gerry Whyte who lectures in law in Trinity. He makes a very compelling point that too much emphasis has been placed on providing law centres staffed by lawyers to provide in a narrow sense legal services to those who happen to get to those law centres. He points out that much of the cost now in servicing the existing centres is travel costs &mdash; I am sure Senator Durcan will be aware of this &mdash; in more rural areas where the law centre has to travel their solicitor quite a long distance to be available on certain hours for a limited period so that people can come along to the outpost, if you like, of the law centre in those areas. That is very different from an approach which sees the importance of law itself to people, particularly those who are disadvantaged in our society. I should like to quote from part of this article where <Col N="67" /> Gerry Whyte calls for an alternative approach to civil legal aid as well as a statutory basis for that approach. I quote from page 127 of the Dublin University Law Journal:</P>
    <P>It is submitted that one of the ways in which the problem of poverty can be tackled is through the use of the law on behalf of the underprivileged. In this context, the law can operate at a number of different levels. At a very basic level, individuals need access to the law in order to vindicate existing income-generating rights, e.g. right to redundancy pay, right to monetary compensation for injuries suffered in road accidents, etc. Obviously an award of money following on legal intervention can alleviate poverty in individual cases, and the impact of the law at this level can be enhanced through the use of class actions and test cases on behalf of underprivileged litigants sharing a common problem.</P>
    <P>But the law is also capable of tackling the problem of poverty at a more profound level by redressing the imbalance of power which exists between the haves and the have nots through the creation of substantial rights for the underprivileged. One of the most subtle, and yet most disturbing, aspects of poverty is the powerlessness of the victims, the manner in which their plight deprives them of any control over their destinies. Legal aid will allow such people to vindicate such rights as they already have under the law. Furthermore an effective legal aid scheme should be able to identify those areas where reform is needed to build up a corpus of rights inhering in the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>On that philosophical basis he argues for the kind of community law centre which the Pringle committee had argued was an important part of an approach to providing genuine access to law and to legal services. There is a fundamental difference between the kind of Government law centres operating under this administrative scheme and genuine community <Col N="68" /> law centres operating for and in conjunction with their own communities. We have one or two examples. We have the Coolock Community Law Centre which, for the hinterland of Coolock, for the women's and tenants' organisations and other groups involved, can be a most important educational process, a way of providing access to power through access to information and, where necessary, legal services either to further individual cases or to bring about broader reforms where a recurring problem is detected in the law centres.</P>
    <P>Our existing law centres operate narrowly on a one to one solicitor-client basis. People can come from wherever to an individual law centre. There is no identification with the broader context in which they live, with their community, with delving a little more deeply into the incidents which have provoked the actual need for specific legal advice.</P>
    <P>I join with Gerry Whyte in calling very strongly for that kind of approach when we get the long promised legislation for civil legal aid and advice. We need to build up not simply this narrow type of law centre but the genuine community resource of a law centre which also is closely related to other groups and other expertise in the community and works closely with other bodies providing either care or expertise in the medical and other areas. This is absolutely fundamental to the kind of approach which will demonstrably improve the situation on the ground. That is in the sharpest contrast with the present structure of the legal aid board. In a more limited way, I should like to refer to the limitations on the present scheme, matters which must be picked up, addressed and reformed in the hope, which I trust the Minister will indicate in his response to this debate, of placing the scheme on a statutory footing and broadening the access to and the kind of legal advice and legal aid which would be available.</P>
    <P>There are certain exclusions from the operation of the scheme. One of these, which is causing increasing harshness and problems on the ground, is the exclusion of legal aid for those appearing before <Col N="69" /> tribunals. This now increasingly excludes people from legal advice and expertise in an area which may be of extreme importance to the individual but which is excluded by the scope of the scheme. The fact that the scheme operates simply through law centres employing solicitors to operate the scheme excludes other solicitors from being accessible for this type of work. It creates a number of different kinds of problems.</P>
    <P>Because so many people either cannot get to a law centre or are ineligible under the means test for advice from a law centre solicitor, they come to other solicitors. There is on the ground a certain resentment and the resentment generally does not work to the benefit of those people in need of advice. They are told that if they are not able to pay, the law centres are there, that the Government have provided those law centres, that they have not involved the other solicitors in any way in them. If they are not able to get advice there, they are told to complain to the Government that the scheme is inadequate. This is a great pity because the whole movement for greater access to legal advice grew out of the FLAC centres, the Free Legal Aid Centres. It was the law students who were involved, law lecturers to some extent and also legal practitioners at the time, who were aware of the need for greater access. I believe that the legal profession should be much more involved in the provision of broader legal services and to some extent they are not pinned to that responsibility by the fact that we have this very limited, very narrow approach of having law centres.</P>
    <P>It is true that the scheme provides for legal aid certificates for counsel to be involved in the scheme. It is of much greater importance that access to the scheme would be broadened by involving legal practitioners and then, as well as a person being able to go with a legal aid certificate to a solicitor and get the services of the solicitor as recommended by the Pringle committee, there would be this network of community law centres which would perform a much more educational role and which would break <Col N="70" /> down the barriers of lack of knowledge, of helplessness, of defensiveness and which would provide for a genuine change and a substantial difference in the perception by certain categories, certain groups, certain areas, of their own rights and their own needs in the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the things that concerns any of us who have been involved closely with certain groups who are deprived of access to legal advice is that the problem is not so much that they are going around actively looking for legal advice but that they have not perceived the nature of their problem and that it is one that should be dealt with by having access to legal advice. If they have got to the stage of perceiving that they need legal advice, then they are often extremely defensive, extremely vulnerable, intimidated and unable to look for that advice and they may come up against many problems in availing of that kind of advice.</P>
    <P>The Seanad must take very seriously the initial commitment in April 1980 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins, who had established the scheme. He said he would bring in legislation at the first opportunity. The first report of the legal aid board made it known publicly that they wanted legislation establishing a system of civil legal aid and the present report repeats the necessity for this legislation.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to the way in which the problem was summed up by Gerry Whyte in that article to which I have referred in the Dublin University Law Journal. He says:</P>
    <P>The present Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice was a reaction to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, Airey. As such it is only concerned with one aspect of the problem of securing access to the law viz. the expense involved. Even at this level it has not proved very successful. But if we are to take the question of access to law seriously we must abandon the current Scheme and resort instead to a community based model which identifies itself closely with the <Col N="71" /> needs and wishes of the underprivileged, rather than the power-brokers of our society.</P>
    <P>We would need to go back more closely to the Pringle report model &mdash; broad access to legal services, a choice of solicitor for the person looking for those legal services and this network of community law centres which constitutes a resource to that community which provides genuine access to legal aid.</P>
    <P>There was a unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, of which the Leas-Chathaoirleach was also a member, on the issue of legal aid. The committee did not deal with it in any great detail because it was not a substantial issue which they were considering but paragraph 9.19 of the report under the heading of costs states:</P>
    <P>No matter how much legal costs are reduced people will still exist who cannot afford to pay from their own resources for legal help. Access to justice must be available to all irrespective of their means. For this reason there must be a comprehensive system of civil legal aid in respect of family matters. The present system of Government Law Centres is quite inadequate to meet existing needs. The deficiencies in the legal aid scheme are particularly noticeable in country areas. A fundamental reassessment of the legal aid scheme and its means of operation is now urgently required. The experience of its operations since its establishment suggests that the present structure is grossly inadequate, in that it certainly does not assure equality of treatment for all. The committee is also of the view that there should be no stamp duty on court documents in family cases and that VAT should not be payable in respect of legal fees incurred in family law cases.</P>
    <P>That represents the view of members of the committee across the political spectrum. They are aware that the scheme for civil legal aid has not provided a <Col N="72" /> response to the problem of access to legal services and that it is necessary to evaluate and to come up with legislation introducing a comprehensive scheme called for in this motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that the Seanad should have the opportunity of considering the report of the legal aid board for 1983 and 1984. In so far as the motion before us gives us the opportunity of doing that I welcome it. I also welcome the motion as it gives us the opportunity of considering the development of civil legal aid in this jurisdiction. It is unfortunate, however, that the framers of this motion used the word &ldquo;deplore&rdquo;. It is regrettable in the context of this motion. It is right that we should consider the development of civil legal aid but to deplore the severe limitations of the scheme is an unfortunate phrase. I will indicate in a moment why it is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points to make in relation to this motion. The first is to consider briefly the nature and scope of the scheme and secondly to consider briefly the existing framework of the civil legal aid scheme as it operates in this jurisdiction. I agree with Senator Robinson that the scheme as it operates currently is restrictive. If one examines the statistics attached to the appendix of the report we are considering, one can see that the great majority of cases dealt with by the law centres fall within the matrimonial area. There are many people on the other hand who are in need of legal aid and legal advice and who do not get that advice due to constraints of finance in other areas. For instance, in social welfare appeals there is a whole corpus of law which has not been properly attacked by lawyers. The reason for that is the simple fact that people who have to deal with that area of law are very frequently not in a position to retain the services and advice of lawyers who are competent in that area. Therefore, the civil legal aid scheme should encompass <Col N="73" /> most tribunals with which citizens have to deal. I specify the whole question of all types of social welfare tribunals.</P>
    <P>Another point in relation to tribunals which is mentioned indirectly in this report is the question of rent tribunals. The point is made that the statistics show a drop off in landlord and tenant cases since the arrival of the rent tribunal. That is understandable. Civil legal aid should be available to all persons who have to deal with the rent tribunal and within the financial confines of the tribunal that type of assistance should be available. People who have to deal with tribunals which exist by virtue of the corpus of labour law legislation existing in this country or indeed who have to deal with tribunals established by virtue of the health Acts should have civil legal aid available to them. Senator Robinson said we are talking about justice being available to all. People cannot avail of many of the statutory tribunals which the Houses have established for the very simple reason that the financial assurance which is necessary when facing a tribunal is not available.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to mention is the whole framework within which civil legal aid operates in this country. It is interesting to examine the essential difference between civil legal aid and criminal legal aid. Civil legal aid operates within a very definite framework. A person will approach a law centre but a choice of lawyer is not necessarily available. On the other hand, so far as criminal legal aid is concerned the person has choice of lawyer but within civil legal aid there is elaborate machinery. We have the civil legal aid board, law centres and the bureaucracy existing within the entire system. On the other hand so far as criminal legal aid is concerned we do not have that type of bureaucracy. This debate should give us the opportunity to consider whether, in relation to civil legal aid, choice of lawyer would be available to the citizen who would be applying for civil legal aid in circumstances similar to the operation of criminal legal aid.</P>
    <P>I did not read Gerry Whyte's article to which Senator Robinson referred but the <Col N="74" /> points made there are very interesting. So far as rural areas are concerned, it is unfortunate that people in my part of the country have to go to Galway or Castlebar to meet a lawyer whom they do not know. In rural areas people have a relationship with a particular lawyer, people know a particular lawyer and, for many reasons, may wish to have their problem dealt with by that lawyer because he may have an understanding of their area and of their circumstances. So far as civil legal aid is concerned that is not available to the citizen who would come financially within the scope of this scheme. It is available in relation to criminal legal aid and civil legal aid should be reviewed on the basis of making the scheme operate somewhat similarly to the current operation of criminal legal aid.</P>
    <P>It is interesting if one compares this to the operation of the general medical card service for people needing medical attention where a choice of doctor is available. We do not establish medical centres whereby people who come within the scheme have to go to a prescribed doctor. The same situation should operate in so far as civil legal aid is concerned. The number of cases referred to the law centres by solicitors is quite substantial. These are cases which solicitors, for various reasons, do not currently deal with. If civil legal aid were available, solicitors in general practice would deal with these cases and perhaps they would be far better fitted to deal with these cases than solicitors whose practical experience is merely within the confines of the law centre where their area of work is very limited.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a proper community based civil legal aid system then it must be based on the ideal of choice of lawyer. That is the essential point that I want to make in relation to this debate. There should be a substantial and radical departure from the existing system which is based on the law centres and clinics that operate in smaller centres out of the law centres, which is not a suitable framework within which to operate civil legal aid. Furthermore, I am not satisfied that <Col N="75" /> it is the most cost beneficial system because it establishes a substantial bureaucracy of its own. If that bureaucracy were cut out the cost saving would be quite substantial and the overall cost increase in the scheme would not be very great.</P>
    <P>One must welcome the paragraph in the 1983-84 report of the Legal Aid Board headed &ldquo;Progress since Last Report&rdquo;. One has to welcome the fact that the Government have made available moneys for the establishment of further law centres in Tallaght, Tralee, Athlone and a second centre in Cork city, and also that there is a plan to establish further law centres in Portlaoise, Letterkenny, Dundalk and Castlebar. That should be welcomed. I want to repeat again that I regret that the word &ldquo;deplored&rdquo; is used in the motion. It is good that we debate the idea of the development of legal aid in this country but it is unhelpful that that word is included.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by simply saying that the whole concept of legal aid is one that is based on justice. We must have a framework of law and justice in this country which is available to everybody. A situation exists at the moment whereby our legal system is not available to everybody, the reason being that people do not have the financial resources to face it in many circumstances. I certainly feel that the scope of the civil legal aid system should be expanded but within the framework I have mentioned. That framework is based on choice of solicitor and not on the existing law centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with the terms of this motion and with the case which has been made by Senator Robinson and which has been generally endorsed by Senator Durcan. The problems of this scheme which have disclosed themselves in the past few years are fairly obvious and the remedies that are necessary are also rather obvious. The problem of course is how to <Col N="76" /> implement the remedies that are necessary and, to a very considerable extent, I suppose this is a matter of funds.</P>
      <P>The question of civil legal aid is a concept with which almost everybody would agree. There is no point having a legal system, no matter how fair and effective, if the citizen does not have the resources and the professional assistance to avail of it. Of course that view was expressed for many years before the scheme was introduced and eventually the Legal Aid Board were set up. They were set up as a pilot scheme in a very limited way, with very limited funds and the intention was that they should become a statutory body. Everybody regrets, and the chairman of the board speaking on behalf of the board regrets, that they have not become a statutory body. That is one of the first things that should be dealt with by the Minister. The only substantial improvement, the only move forward of any consequence over the years, was as a result of a grant from the Funds of Suitors following which new centres were authorised in a number of areas. Apparently a number of other centres may be set up as well. I know that some of the speakers do not feel this is the right approach, but I suppose additional centres would be better than the present situation if the legislation which is envisaged does not provide for a different method of approaching this problem.</P>
      <P>The chairman in his report said that in spite of the improvements that have taken place the scheme, after five years, is far from providing the comprehensive service envisaged at the introduction of the scheme. I think everybody would have to agree that this is the case and that this is a regrettable fact. The inadequacy of the scheme is of course largely though not entirely due to lack of funds &mdash; lack of funds is certainly at the root of most of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems in relation to the means test but again that is probably due to some extent to the lack of funds. The means test is quite extraordinary when it is disclosed in the report that even some people who are <Col N="77" /> entirely dependent on social welfare for their income are still not within the means test. It is almost inconceivable that a situation like that should arise. The position, far from improving, has become worse because 15 per cent of those who applied in 1982 were ineligible whereas 20 per cent of those who applied in 1984 were ineligible. This was mainly due to the means test.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty which has arisen is a difficulty in relation to staff, the embargo, the method of recruitment of the staff and the fact that there is a very rigid approach to the situation which arises from time to time when even the limited number of staff which is provided for is temporarily unavailable. This has given rise to many of the irritations and difficulties which have arisen over the years. This, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, has led not merely to difficulties in dealing with cases but, on a number of occasions, to a complete suspension of dealing with new cases, a situation where people are told quite bluntly that the resources are not there to deal with their cases. Any scheme which sets out to deal with the problem is welcome. The problem in this case being the provision of legal aid and where the scheme has reached the stage where people who need that help are told, &ldquo;we are no longer in a position to even talk to you about your problem&rdquo;. This is a very serious situation and quite clearly the scheme is on the point of breaking down if people are told that they simply cannot even be considered for advice and help. This problem must be dealt with. It is due to inadequacy of staff which in turn is due of course to inadequacy of funds.</P>
    <P>In regard to the number of applicants who are dealt with and who eventually appear in court, the statistics are quite interesting, because over the three years 1982, 1983 and 1984 approximately only 18 per cent of those who applied to the board and were dealt with appeared in court. The remaining cases were disposed of by other methods. The report does not deal with how this was done and it would <Col N="78" /> be unfair and unhelpful to ask an overloaded staff to provide very complex statistics. It would be interesting to know very roughly how cases were disposed of or, to put it another way, how many cases there were where simply no progress was made and no solution was found.</P>
    <P>Another statistic which is given is the fact that 75 per cent of the cases which were dealt with, dealt with matrimonial and family cases. It was pointed out, and this is a very important point, one which should be looked into, that many of these cases are ones which should not have had to be dealt with by the board but which should have been referred to marriage counsellors who could have dealt with such cases much better and allowed the solicitor dealing with them to move on to other cases with which he could deal more successfully and more effectively. This is something which I believe is being looked into and I hope it will be looked into in such a way as to remove a problem there which really should not exist.</P>
    <P>In looking back on this question of legal aid we must give credit for what has been done because a substantial improvement has taken place. We must give credit to all those who over the years crusaded and advocated action in this matter because it took a long time to even get to the position we are in today. We must give credit to those who advocated this, to those who immediately before the scheme was introduced gave their help freely and voluntarily to those who needed advice. I should like to point out that over the years, going back for a long, long time, it has been a tradition in the legal profession to sponsor those who appear to have a deserving case, a case which is a stateable case and one which deserved to be brought to court. In most cases they were brought to court even though there were no fees available to pay for them.</P>
    <P>To look back for a moment, quite clearly what has been done is not anything like enough. Additional resources must be provided whether to improve the scheme as at present operated, or provide a choice of legal advisers. Obviously, the <Col N="79" /> latter would be the better one but whether it is feasible from a financial point of view I do not know. When we reach the stage where people are being turned away and told they simply cannot be dealt with, something radical has to be done. That is the greatest shortcoming in the present scheme and is something which must be dealt with. Additional funds are needed and I am very conscious of the financial constraints the Government have to operate under but, nevertheless, in this case the amounts involved are not huge. They are relatively small and the additional amount needed to make very important improvements in the scheme would not be great. In those circumstances I should like to ask the Minister to endeavour to provide extra funds to make the scheme into one which would be far more successful and effective than it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have much to say on this matter because I am not a lawyer. I have no expertise in this area but I agree with Senator Robinson and other Members when they say it is a very important subject. It is an area where lawyers best qualified to speak are those who are involved in the area of social justice. I was interested to hear Senator Durcan say he disagrees with the verb &ldquo;deplores&rdquo; in the motion because, apparently, he considered it too severe. Senator Robinson said it was the strongest verb she could use. It seems that, perhaps, a little compromise between the two of them would fit the bill.</P>

      <P>In any event we all agree with the motion. I should like to pay a tribute to the lawyers. I agree with Senator Robinson that the legal profession should be much more involved but it seems from my experience over the years that lawyers have payed their fair share where clients were not in a position to pay full charges. Indeed, at present anybody in a professional capacity <Col N="80" /> encumbered with fairly high overheads will not find it easy to reduce fees.</P>
      <P>In this regard we are talking about justice or, as Senator Robinson said, denying justice in some cases. My concern as a lay person is that in certain circumstances there may be a miscarriage of justice. From reports it appears that that is the position in many cases. In the area of social welfare where many people might have legitimate complaints there seems to be a problem about getting legal aid. That is unfortunate, and it is an area the Minister should look at. Can something be done to bring that area within the ambit of free legal aid? I realise that great work has been done by the Ombudsman and when we consider his report for 1985 tomorrow we will be in a position to go into that matter in greater detail. However, while the Ombudsman in all the cases I was involved in gave total satisfaction and went into all the cases in great depth before arriving at a satisfactory conclusion I consider the procedure to be too long. That is my main complaint. In the area of social welfare it is a pity that many people who seem to have legitimate complaints find difficulty in getting legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the publications referred to in the motion were very helpful. The most comprehensive one is the report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice, published in 1974. However, bearing in mind the changes that take place from year to year, indeed, from month to month and week to week, I wonder if that report should be updated. For example, I note that one recommendation is that members of the legal profession who are willing to provide legal aid or advice services should have their names placed on legal aid or advice panels. It seems, not being familiar with the legal procedures, that having the names of lawyers in different towns and centres throughout the country on a panel and available for consultation would be more satisfactory than the present position. I note in the report for 1983 and 1984 of the Legal Aid Board &mdash; this has been referred to &mdash; that there are three law centres in Dublin, two in Cork, one <Col N="81" /> in Limerick, one in Waterford, one in Galway and one in Sligo. There are part-time centres in Carlow, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Kerry, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Louth, Mayo, Tipperary, Westmeath and Wexford. My main complaint in that regard &mdash; it is a legitimate one and one the Minister will understand &mdash; is that, for example, in the town of Navan, a growing town with a big population, there is no centre. As Senator Durcan said, in situations like that it is necessary for people involved to get a bus or hire transport to those far-away centres. This is unfortunate and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on some of the points raised in the report of the Legal Aid Board for 1983 and 1984. We are told that the board has been the subject of severe criticism from a wide variety of individuals and bodies on the basis of the inadequacy of the service provided. The report states that this criticism is unfair in that it fails to recognise that the central problem is inadequate funding, a matter outside the board's own control. This is unfortunate. It should be seen that if the board are to improve and to perform their function adequately more funds must be provided. It is acknowledged that the constraints on public finances are a serious problem for the Government and stated that they are strongly of the view that a high priority should be given to the provision of civil legal aid services, the need for which is felt by the poorest sections of the community. This highlights the failure of the free legal aid system in that it is the poorer sections that suffer, and presumably this is the section that the board were set up to help. There are many areas, as this report points out, where they are unable to help.</P>
    <P>The problems of the Legal Aid Board are not confined to issues of resources. The report refers to restricted means tests with no proper periodic revision and the embargo on recruitment of staff, both of which continue to depress the level of legal aid services provided. The Minister has made some concessions with regard to the means test and certain provisions <Col N="82" /> have been made with regard to the embargo on staff but these are still inadequate and something further should be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to the necessity for putting the scheme on a proper statutory basis. Apparently this was the original intention. After six years it is difficult to find any justification for not proceeding to have it on a statutory basis. Perhaps the Minister in his reply would tell us if it is intended to do this and if it will be in the near future because the Government have promised to give priority to legislation. Although there was some criticism of the Order Paper today and of the priority given to certain items on the Order Paper nobody could object if this Bill was brought forward. I look forward to debating it further in the near future.</P>
    <P>Eleven thousand people were provided with legal aid in the two year period 1983-1984 covered by the report. This is a considerable number. The tables in the back of the book show us, in addition, the number of people who were refused. Many of those concerned would have been unable in practice to secure access to justice but for this scheme. When we talk about justice, it is unfortunate that so many cases end up in litigation. Many of them could be dealt with without going to court. The advice centres are intended primarily to deal with that situation and they do so to a large extent. Justice is not easy to get. I remember one occasion about ten years ago when there was a dispute between neighbours. One very elderly man came to me and told me he had left his old thatched house and a small plot of land half a lifetime previously, and calling back at some time he felt his neighbour had moved the fence a foot in on his plot. As everybody knows, it is very difficult from a 25 inch map to decide if a fence has been moved but my advice to him was to forget about the problem. He said to me that if his neighbour did not move the fence a foot back he would take his life. That was his idea of justice. He wanted total justice, the total pound of flesh. It is unfortunate that everyone is inclined to look for that total pound of <Col N="83" /> flesh. In society we want a certain amount of give and take. The whole emphasis of advice should be concentrated on trying to avoid that total confrontation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Legal Aid Board for the work they have done. The report refers on the means test to the disposable income ceiling of £3,500. That is an inadequate figure and I wonder if it varies from year to year. I had wished to refer to different points very briefly but obviously my time has now expired.</P>
    <P>I am in total agreement with the motion and I look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope it will be a very positive one.</P>

      <P>The concept of access to civil legal aid is one of these things that is almost tucked away in the back of the public mind. We do not have the same enthusiasm for access relatively inexpensively to the protection of the law that we have for access, for instance, to education, to health services, housing or anything like that. Yet the whole basis of parliamentary democracy is that we are at the base, a society of law and that we regulate our relationships between each other and the relationship between the State and the individual on the basis of law and that the adjudication of how that law is to be operated between individuals and between individuals and the State is a matter for the courts. All that sort of thing is taken as part of at least the rhetoric, if not the experience, of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the reality of the rhetoric of our society of law were to be actually taken seriously, then any citizen would be able to approach the legal system and use the law to vindicate his or her rights in the way that citizens approach our education service, with the presumption that their children's necessary education is a right to which they have access or in the way their children's access or their own access to health services is a right or indeed even within the inadequacies of our existing structures in the way people feel that <Col N="84" /> there is at least some presumption of a right to access to housing. We would have a society in which people took the use of the law to protect themselves for granted in the way that we take the health services for granted or in the way in which we take education for granted.</P>
    <P>The rhetoric about our equality before the law and about the significance and centrality of the law is in protecting us not in controlling us. That is the great rhetorical theme that we get time and again: that the law is not something that controls or restricts our freedom; it ultimately vindicates and underpins our freedom. If it is such a fundamental part of the structue and foundation of our society one would assume that citizens would have ready easy access to it and that citizens could take that sort of ready easy access for granted. It is not something that you would go looking for in a moment of high domestic crisis or high personal crisis; it is something that becomes part of your normal experience.</P>
    <P>I can only contrast that with my own experience as a relatively articulate and educated individual the first time I visited the Four Courts to attend a civil case in which somebody else was involved. It is a profound shock to the system of the layman to walk into the magnificent open space and see bewigged individuals who carry an image of superiority, of difference and of an almost unbridgeable gap between you, the ignorant layman, and these high priests of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator does not want to drag me into the issue of priests and priestesses. We will leave that to the Minister for Social Welfare. I am sure the Minister will pass on the Senator's message to the Minister for Social Welfare. There is a sense of difference and of being outside, something that has almost surrounded itself with a mystical aura. You have the feeling of being one of the plebs in the company of the elite. That is the way the law is experienced by ordinary people which is by way of contrast with the theory of what the law and the <Col N="85" /> courts should mean to the citizen. The sense of alienation I described would intimidate most ordinary people from contemplating the use of the courts and the law. I know from recent personal experience, not in my own case, that people in domestic difficulties find the prospect of having to go to court, even in <i>in camera </i> situations, overpowering and difficult. It is a totally new experience, totally different from the idea of going up to the school to talk about education, or going into a hospital or a doctor's surgery to talk about health. There is the sense that the procedures of the law are different, difficult and painful and you are liable to suffer a lot in the simple process of trying to get what is your right under the law.</P>
      <P>When you compound that initial alienation with the huge expense perceived by people to be involved in vindicating your rights, you create a society which is not really equal before the law. Those who can afford to pay can have everything that is needed. You only have to look at the proportion of cases before our superior courts about property law and finance law and contrast them with the absolute paucity of cases in the areas of social welfare law, housing law and areas like that. If it had not been for the great work of my colleague on the Independent benches, Senator Robinson, a considerable part of what has been done in the areas of housing and welfare law would never have been done at all. I hope she has been paid in the cases where she defended the State but in the other cases I am sure she will never see much in the line of cash. I would like to congratulate her and put on record the indebtedness of many people in our society to the work she has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once we have a combination of cost and alienation we no longer have a society in which people are equal before the law. The theory may well exist but the practice confirms to people that it is no more than a theory and it does not work like that at all. The Legal Aid Board is a limited access to the law which was grudgingly handed out and was forced upon us by the European Court of <Col N="86" /> Human Rights. We resisted it all the way until it was finally imposed upon us. What we have is a means tested scheme. Bishop Birch, the late and lamented Bishop of Ossory made the point about means tested services that, almost by definition, a service for the poor becomes a poor service. That, at bedrock, is the problem with any means tested service. Added to that are the ludicrous means tests involved in the operation of the Legal Aid Board and the even more ludicrous fact that every time we set up a new means tested service we seem to set up a new means test so that the same people have one means test for a free school transport, another means test for housing, another means test for their medical card and a different means test for something else. We have a society awash with different means tests for different services. Nobody has grasped the idea that it might be feasible to have one means test for all the services people are deemed to need. It would do an awful lot to eliminate the humilitation of people who are conventionally called poor but whom I would prefer to describe as oppressed in our society.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that people cannot afford to use legal procedures to vindicate their rights the law centres that are set up are means tested and therefore are inadequate. Added to that is the fact that their physical locations separate them from many of the people who need them most. The one law centre in Cork is located on the north side of the city where most of the people who are least well off live. It is marginally on the north side of the river. In other words, it is on the northern bank of the northern channel of the river Lee. It is a long walk from there to where most people who would need legal aid and legal advice are situated. It is not a criticism that one would address exclusively to the law cnetre. It is also true that out of the presumably close to 100 legal practices in Cork only one that I know of is located on the north side of the city. The rest of them are located in the comfortable ghetto on the South Mall where most of the legal practices associate comfortably with each other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> The law is separate from people. The means test and the law service we have produced are still separate from people. We have to de-mystify the law in the way we have begun to de-mystify health and education. It is something to which people are entitled. They should not be intimidated or frightened away by expense. When we look at the restrictiveness of access because of cost, the restrictiveness of the means test, the separation that the form of the law centres creates together with the fact that there is no sense of a community involvement by the law centres and the extraordinary restrictions that are imposed on the law centres, an area of life which is particularly important to poor people in our society is completely excluded. That is the area of tribunals. If you do not see a conspiracy you see a fairly clear intent to avoid any concerted effort to vindicate what limited rights the people who depend on social welfare have under the law and the determination to preserve that area of law from the detailed scrutiny of the courts. This will only come about when somebody forces this legislation to be considered by the courts. There seems to be a certain amount of evidence that, when people succeed in bringing these issues to the courts, they take a fairly dim view of the traditional accepted official interpretation of what this legislation means.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the area of social welfare appeals which is probably one of the running sores of injustice in our society, particularly now that we have to live, apparently for the indefinite future, with the best part of a quarter of a million people unemployed. The tragedy is that the law centres are effectively precluded from what might be understood to be test cases and this excludes a large amount of work in the area of social welfare law. I do not say this was done deliberately but the actual consequence of that sort of exclusion is to operate as a controlled mechanism. It is extraordinary the looseness of language that surfaces in what might be described as legislation which is directed towards the benefit of the poor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> The example that immediately comes to mind is a Bill currently before the other House called the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, in which many things that would intimately affect the housing rights of poor people are dependent on the opinions of the housing authority and things like that. If that sort of vaguely written legislation operated in the area of taxation, in the area of companies and in the area of property rights, the whole courts system would be clogged up by a mass of legal actions to determine what was meant by the opinions of various bodies and what was meant when somebody was said to regard somebody as eligible or otherwise. If the Revenue Commissioners had that sort of flexible right to form opinions on which decisions could be taken about people's futures, the courts would be swamped with legislation. But we can do it in the case of poor people because we can presume that, in the vast majority of cases under our present system of legal aid, they will not be in a position to challenge these things. therefore, the process of restricting access to civil legal aid is not just an incidental consequence of the impoverishment of the public finances. It is, whether deliberate or not, a necessary condition for control and regulation of those who depend on the State for their income and support.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that even if we did have full access, properly funded through legal aid, we would still have to confront the fact that as our society is organised the Judiciary does represent very much one class perception and its conclusions and judgments will still represent one particular view of our society for a long time to come, even if people have equal access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Senators in complimenting Senator McGuinness and Senator Robinson who tabled this resolution. On behalf of the Labour Party, I strongly support the spirit of this resolution and, indeed, the letter of it as well. Towards the end of the preceding speaker's speech I noted a certain amount of doubt as to whether <Col N="89" /> the law can ever be an instrument of the poor or an instrument of those who suffer in society. I certainly subscribe to that view. I do so as somebody who every year has people who will go into the legal profession among my students. I will make my point very clearly. There are those who would suggest that the law in any society is an instrument, a social construct if you like, that reflects the structure of power and influence in society. There is no doubt at all in my mind that the normative content of law, the procedures of law, the ritual of law and the practice of law in themselves are concrete social expressions of the structure of a society's basis.</P>
      <P>Those who have examined the procedures of law in courts know that there is an enourmous distance between those who are placed in positions of authority and decision making and those who may be at the receiving end of the scrutiny of the law. Many people get irritated by this view. It is not a view that I absolutely accept. I think the law also reflects an evolution towards an egalitarian tendency in the society. I might say that I have detected over the years in the traditional conception of law the view that law itself is almost removed from and above any kind of social scrutiny rather like the absolutist versions of religion.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is interesting to know that in the history of civil legal aid, and legal aid in general, it was younger more socially concerned members of the legal profession who pioneered the establishment of the concept of general access to the protection of the law as an equalising force in society. That is a matter of fact that cannot be denied. Therefore, when this question of access is evaluated, we will have to realise that what is necessary is not an adjustment, even an adjustment forced upon us, but a turning around of the nature of the law so that the citizen's relationship to the State is a qualitatively new one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion correctly makes reference to three sources. The report of the Legal Aid Board draws our attention to the sheer impermanence of both the form and the provision for such legal aid as <Col N="90" /> exists, its marked inadequacy and the whole arbitrariness almost of selection of both location and terms of access themselves. Most important, it makes reference to the Airey judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. I think it is terribly important for us to be seen not to offer something that is a very cosmetic response to the establishment of what was a right. That is the political significance of the motion. It is a matter of whether you are, in fact, happy with an adjustment that meets the minima of what you are required to do, or whether you are interested in taking on the debate that exists about the nature of law in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I am far from being optimistic that the existing structure of law and its procedures in any of its forms can be turned around or accommodated towards a more egalitarian conception of the law itself. I have many reasons for saying that. Law, like anything else, in terms of its expression is a carrier of the deep authoritarianism of the culture. When people ask me about the connection between law and society they are often less enthusiastic about making the form practice of law an object of study in itself but would like to suggest that the inner professional practices of practitioners constitute an adequate study. Such a study is as relevant as whether a study of the instruments of plumbing is an adequate substitute for the subject of hydrolysis. The nub of the matter is that poor people and people without adequate means have been advised in the report of a board that there is such an inundation of applications for the limited assistance available that their applications cannot be considered. We equally know that there are far more who know that is the fact who will be deterred from applying. We know, an even more appalling fact, that family cases are being deferred and left as if in a society like ours that has told people who are in the unfortunate position of being in marriages that are unhappy, that they must wait for some future period of enlightenment before we bring in the question of divorce, that even <Col N="91" /> in terms of access to the courts themselves they will have to be delayed and their cases cannot be heard.</P>
    <P>Then there is this appalling notion, no more than existed at the beginning of the debate on the welfare state in Britain, that you have to establish a level of poverty before you become entitled to access to civil aid. It is an appalling indictent of the slow evolution of social concern about access to the law itself. I am very worried about points that have been made in previous speeches concerning the implications for family cases of the implementation of the Courts Act, 1981, and the changed jurisdiction of lower courts with the apparent result that even fewer family cases are being heard in the new circumstances. How can it be regarded as adequate so long after a promise was made by the Minister of the day that a statutory basis for civil legal aid has yet to be established. Civil legal aid and all forms of legal aid in general are a marvellous source of information, should a reforming administration want it, of the kind of troubles which afflict certain parts of our society and certain groups within our society. However we are in the position where the sheer transient nature of the schemes that have been established and their inadequacy mean that professionals within them have to rely on their heroism rather than on an adequate basis of support. They are not rewarded properly, have no permanence of appointment, are far from having fellow professionals in the social and psychological sciences, the therapeutic sciences and all of the other intervention agencies that could very valuably prop up their work.</P>
    <P>We are, unfortunately, as we listen to the debate on this resolution, thinking about how poorly and inadequately we have moved after we have been found to be in breach of adequate provision. The board who felt responsible for the supply of that provision have asked us to take note of how an even inadequate and limited service cannot be provided. We must be grateful for the reminder which the <Col N="92" /> movers of the resolution have provided for us of our responsibilities, certainly to take note of the civil legal aid and advice scheme and to take a note of the Pringle reports and the Airey judgment by the European Court of Human Rights. We are also asked by the thrust of the resolution to consider the implications of there being limited access to the legal process in our country. There is nobody more pretentious than the Irish legislator on his or her high horse talking about the force of law and order but if all of this provision is not there and if all of these barriers and gaps are there, the question can reasonably be asked &mdash; whose law and whose order? It is like a person being upset about something and being asked whether they could go to law, but having it pointed out that that would cost a fortune. That is sufficient to deter someone from that line of action. Even when people prevail in circumstances that they know can hurt them and when they cannot easily and reasonably expect access to the civil law, there arises a question about the realm of the civil law itself, the kind of material with which it deals, the decisions at which it will arrive and the almost casual manner, after sometime, that those who can afford the civil law can move on to this partial version and can almost transact it the same as if one was exchanging money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue once again in this House and I thank the Minister of State for coming here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue regarding Oldcastle Garda Station was first raised by me in the Seanad on 20 November 1985. On that occasion I outlined the extremely bad condition of that Garda station and the urgent need to carry out the necessary structural repairs to alleviate the problem there. I will not go into details with regard <Col N="93" /> to those structural problems. The Minister received a report of 20 November 1985 which outlined these problems in detail and I will not delay the House by repeating them here tonight. However, I would like to refer to the reply of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy J. Bermingham on that occasion:</P>
    <P>I preface my remarks by saying that I sympathise with the gardaí who have lived in such conditions since 1922. I accept that the accommodation is inadequate for the needs of the gardaí. I am pleased to be able to say that the Office of Public Works have prepared a modernisation scheme for this station which has been accepted by the Department of Justice and the necessary funds have been allocated to it. The scheme involves the amalgamation of married quarters and the station proper will provide (1) a sergeant's office, (2) an interview room, (3) a doctor's room, (4) a cell, (5) a kitchen, (6) toilet and accommodation, (7) storage, (8) improved electrical and heating services and (9) complete internal and external redecoration. I claim with some pride that this is the first time any improvements have been made to Oldcastle Garda station since 1922.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works expect to place a contract for the scheme early in 1986 and complete it by August or September of next year. Regrettably, the planning of the scheme was delayed due to the shortage of architectural staff. The money has been allocated. The contract will be placed early in the new year and it is hoped that it will be finished by August or September.</P>
    <P>The Minister was there referring to August or September of 1986. I want to bring to the notice of the Minister of State that a contractor moved in to commence work in October 1985. One month's delay seems fair enough, knowing what is involved in a contract. All that was done by the contractor at that time was to break an entrance into the official accommodation and erect a back wall <Col N="94" /> and gate. Then he left the site for some strange reason. I wrote to the present Minister early in 1986 and I received a reply from her in May. I will quote from that letter now:</P>
    <P>Dear Senator,</P>
    <P>I refer further to your recent representations regarding a proposed scheme of works to the Garda Station at Oldcastle, Co. Meath.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that while tenders were invited recently for the scheme in question the placing of a contract for the execution of the works has had to be deferred as there are not sufficient funds available to finance the works at present. The project will be re-activated as soon as money becomes available.</P>
    <P>According to the reply from the Minister of State's predecessor in June, 1985, funds had been allocated for the modernisation scheme of the Garda station in Oldcastle. The present Minister's letter to me seems to be a complete contradiction of a statement given by the former Minister. Tonight I want to know where the original allocation of money went, where it was transferred to. I say with no animosity that there are rumours that a promise was given that a similar amount of money was to be allocated to a Garda station elsewhere. Will that rumour be contradicted tonight? I want to place on record that I am not accusing the Minister of anything here tonight. However, I am now giving her the opportunity to either confirm or deny that the money allocated to Oldcastle Garda station has been diverted to a station elsewhere. It is rumoured that it went to a Garda station in Wexford which would be of much lower priority than Oldcastle and that is why I want the Minister to confirm this for me.</P>
    <P>Having set the record straight and our minds being set at rest on that aspect, I want to know exactly what is the situation regarding the future of the Garda station in Oldcastle. It is completely uninhabitable at present and its condition has not improved in 12 months. Will the work <Col N="95" /> commence and if so, when? Is there a contract and, if so, what is the position with regard to the contractor? This station was given top priority in the State. It is the most dilapidated Garda station in Ireland. It is inhuman to ask any garda to work in the conditions which prevail there at the moment. I was given a commitment in good faith by a former Minister which has not been honoured by the Government. What commitment can the Minister give me here tonight? Will it be honoured? I thank the Minister for listening to my plea and I eagerly await her reply to my question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Office of Public Works (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Lynch's concern regarding Oldcastle Garda station, a concern he first voiced, as he reminded us this evening, when speaking on the Adjournment debate in this House on 20 November last. Having gone into this matter in some detail I am fully aware that the physical condition of the Garda station has deteriorated to the stage where it can only have a detrimental effect on its efficient operation. I sympathise with the gardaí who have lived and worked in these conditions and I am also particularly conscious of the poor impression such accommodation must make on citizens transacting business in the station premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Joe Bermingham, had hoped &mdash; and indeed so stated in this House in November last &mdash; that the Office of Public Works would place a contract for a scheme of modernisation works to the station early in 1986 to be completed by August or September of this year. The scheme involved the amalgamation of married quarters and the station proper and would provide, as Senator Lynch pointed out, a sergeant's office, an interview room, a doctor's room, a cell, a kitchen, a toilet and accommodation, storage, improved electrical and heating services and complete internal and external redecoration. Indeed, the Office of Public Works had progressed to the stage where they had invited and processed the <Col N="96" /> tenders for the work and had on standby a suitable contractor. The contractor to whom the Senator referred earlier is not the one to whom I am referring now. That was a separate issue.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of the very stringent financial situation, of which we are all too well aware, the Office of Public Works found it necessary from May 1986 to avoid entering any new contractual commitments in relation to Garda stations and indeed in a number of other areas in which they operate. I took office in late February 1986 and from early May the money under this subhead was exhausted, so I hope there was no implication in the question asked by Senator Lynch that something improper might have happened in relation to a Wexford Garda station. I am totally unaware of what he is alluding to and I underline again that as I was only three months in office it is quite unlikely that I would be able to turn on its head the set of priorities laid down for the Office of Public Works in this area very strictly by the Department of Justice. I reiterate that we operate strictly according to the priorities as laid down by the Department of Justice in relation to the work we do on Garda stations. Their priorities are taken by us in the order they give them to us. The Senator correctly states that Oldcastle is top priority with the Department of Justice and, accordingly that matter is with us at the moment.</P>

      <P>The contract for the work to Oldcastle Garda station was hampered by the fact that we could not enter any new contractual commitments since last May. That position has pertained. The Department of Justice, the Office of Public Works and I have agreed that the work to Oldcastle Garda station ranks as top priority and throughout the last few weeks we have been endeavouring to find some way by which it would be possible to allow this work to proceed. I am delighted, therefore, to be <Col N="97" /> able to say that following further examination it has now been decided that the Office of Public Works will be placing a contract for this scheme next month. I know this news will be most welcome to those people in the Oldcastle area but particularly to those members of the <Col N="98" /> Garda Síochána who have served us so well from there.</P>
