      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay by the Department of Health in extending the provision of Circular 6/85, dealing with the discharge of homeless persons from hospital; to cover the discharge of such persons from general hospitals.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order. It is proposed to adjourn for tea from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and it is proposed to take No. 3 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, with reference to your ordering of the motion for the Adjournment, I want to bring it to your attention that there is an anxiety to try to get as much as possible of the Committee Stage of the Control of Clinical Trials <Col N="1648" /> Bill, 1986, completed today and so I propose to the House that, after Private Members&rsquo;Business is completed at 8 o'clock or earlier, we might commit ourselves to another hour to try to make more progress on that Bill. There are quite a number of amendments and it is quite an important piece of legislation. I have had discussions with Senator Willie Ryan to try to reach agreement on this and the Minister is available so, if the House will agree, we could sit for possibly another hour after the normal adjournment time to make more progress on the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 4 and 5 in that order commencing at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. The first item, No. 4, is a report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: The Milk Cessation Scheme, and then we will deal with the Third Report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries: Apartheid and Development in Southern Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Debate on the Third Report of the Joint Committee on Cooperation with Developing Countries is very important and I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be available to the House to take this motion. On the last occasion on which we discussed South Africa, and there was an all party motion down to discuss sanctions against South Africa, total discourtesy was shown to this House by a junior Minister. He came into this House and put his foot up on the ministerial seat, not alone in the presence of Members of the House, but in the presence of very important visitors from Southern Africa. I would not be satisfied if this debate were to take place <Col N="1649" /> in the presence of that junior Minister. The speech he made that day was a disgrace to the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am not sure if the Minister for Foreign Affairs is back from Egypt but, if he is not back, I would like this debate to be delayed until he is back. The matter is urgent and important. I would not be satisfied to have the debate taken by the junior Minister who was in the House on the day of the last debate.</P>

      <P>The first item we will take is the milk cessation scheme report. I am not sure how long that will take. From my information last week quite a number of Members of the House want to contribute to the debate on this very important joint committee report. I am not sure when we will reach Item No. 5 tomorrow but it has already been communicated to me from the Department of Foreign Affairs that it is intended that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs will take it. I am not sure whether the Minister is back from his official trip to Egypt. However, I will contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and bring the points raised by Senator Lanigan to their attention. It is outside my control but I will certainly convey Senator Lanigan's comments to the Department.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Senator Ferris has just said, I appreciate that the milk cessation scheme motion is a very important matter and that it may very well be taken, but I am in absolute agreement with Senator Lanigan that the second motion is an extremely important one. I would be very concerned lest it be taken at a late hour tomorrow afternoon when, perhaps, there would not be a full attendance in the House and, apart from the fact that the Minister does not seem to be available, we might not get an opportunity to have as full a debate as <Col N="1650" /> we would like. I would like to be assured that, if it is taken late, further time will be allowed for it and, if the Minister cannot come tomorrow evening, he will come here at a later stage for further debate on this motion.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to accommodate everybody who wishes to speak. If Senator Robb and other Senators are not here for the completion of No. 5, if we take it, we will certainly postpone the final debate on it until the following week and then we will try to facilitate everybody. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not available for the earlier part of the discussion, I will try to ensure that he is here to reply to the debate.</P>

      <P>Before we go on to deal with the amendments to the Control of Dogs Bill, 1986 &mdash; it might be advisable if Senators would listen to me &mdash; amendment No. 5 does not arise out of the Committee Stage proceedings and is not appropriate to Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise there is a problem under Standing Orders about this Government amendment which arose since the Committee Stage debate but to overcome the difficulty I propose that the House should now agree that when we reach amendment No. 5 the Bill should be recommitted in respect of amendment <Col N="1651" /> No. 5 to allow the normal procedure to take place.</P>

      <P>Government Amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 30 to 33, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;local authority&rsquo;means &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in the case of the administrative county of Dublin, other than the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the council of the county of Dublin,</P>
      <P>(b) in the case of the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the corporation of the borough,</P>
      <P>(c) in the case of a county borough, the corporation of the county borough, and</P>
      <P>(d) in the case of any other administrative county, the council of the county,</P>
      <P>and references to the functional area of a local authority shall be construed accordingly and local authority shall, as the context may require, include any other person with whom a local authority has entered into an arrangement pursuant to section 15 of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically the Borough of Dún Laoghaire has traditionally exercised the functions which in the case of other boroughs are exercised by their respective county councils. The result is that the writ of Dublin County Council does not, for most services, run in the Dún Laoghaire borough and it would, accordingly, be inappropriate that the county council should be given the task of operating the dog <Col N="1652" /> control service there. The effect of the amendment will be that Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation will be responsible for operating the Act in their functional area. The borough will, of course, form the nucleus of one of the new administrative counties which will emerge from the proposed reorganisation of the Dublin local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 6 and 7, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) which is a greyhound and is purchased for export and which is exported from the State within thirty days after the date of purchase;</P>
      <P>(i) which is kept by such other class of person as may be prescribed by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment arises out of representations made by Bord na gCon in relation to the greyhound industry. The export trade in greyhounds is a valuable one. In fact, 7,599 greyhounds with a value of £1.7 million were exported in 1985. As the Bill stands, the purchaser of the dogs for export would, by virtue of section 6, have to license the dogs on the transfer of ownership. This would create an impediment to the trade. The amendment, therefore, will exempt from licensing greyhounds purchased for export within 30 days.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 2 to 19, and to substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) (a) Where any part of the <Col N="1653" /> boundary of the functional area of a local authority is a line of high water of the sea, or a tidal river, or a tidal lake, the local authority may, in making by-laws under this section, extend the area of operation of such by-laws to the foreshore, or to such part of the foreshore, as may be specified in the by-laws.</P>
    <P>(b) Where the area of operation of by-laws is extended pursuant to this subsection, such extended area may be defined by reference to a map or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(c) In this subsection &lsquo;foreshore' has the meaning specified in the Foreshore Act, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The functional areas of local authorities generally extend to high water mark only. Consequently a local authority wishing to make by-laws for a beach adjoining their area would be unable to do so. Consequently, subsections (6), (7) and (8) of section 17 were inserted to provide the procedure to solve this problem. On reflection and as a result of some discussion the procedure proposed &mdash; that of extending the functional area for the purpose of the by-laws by way of a ministerial order &mdash; seemed unnecessarily bureaucratic and the amendment provides instead that the extension of the functional area, where desired, will be contained in the by-laws themselves. In other words, the by-laws will not be effective unless they are confirmed by the Minister for the Environment pursuant to section 221 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, which by virtue of subsection (4) of the section applies to the by-laws. Therefore, the Minister will have the final say in the matter of by-laws. Consequently a separate ministerial order on the extension of the functional area is not considered necessary. Basically what it means is that if in the areas of a certain county council or borough council, there is a beach that is not under their direct jurisdiction and if nobody else can be made responsible <Col N="1654" /> for it, they have the right to make a bylaw to include that beach in their area of jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 36 to 40, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In a prosecution under this Act in relation to the keeping of an unlicensed dog, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that, at the time the alleged offence was committed, a licence was required in respect of the dog and that the defendant did not, at that time, hold a licence for that dog.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>While subsection (2) of section 30 places in a prosecution for an unlicensed dog the onus of proof on the defendant in relation to three specific matters, it is felt that the subsection is not tight enough to ensure successful prosecution of persons who keep unlicensed dogs. As the section stands it might be found necessary to provide evidence from each of the 33 local authorities involved that the dog was not licensed and this would place an inordinate burden of proof on the prosecution. The amendment provides a different approach by deleting the three specific matters where the onus of proof lies with the defendant and substituting a presumption that the dog requires a licence and that a licence had not issued until the defendant can prove otherwise.</P>
      <P>The change relieves the prosecution of the onus of proving that the dog was not licensed and places the entire onus of proof in any defence he might make on the defendant. In other words, it simplifies the whole matter in that one presumes the dog is not licensed and then one puts the onus on the dog owner to prove it is rather than chasing around 33 local authorities. A similar situation, incidentally, exists regarding driving licences where under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act there is a presumption that the defendant does not have a driving licence until he can show that he has.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has already decided that the Bill is to be recommitted in respect of amendment No. 5. This means Senators may speak more than once but in doing so should confine themselves to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete lines 13 and 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the House for being responsible for this mix up. We were rushing to a vote and this is how it occurred. The reappraisal of the provisions of the Bill indicates that section 33 is not necessary in view of existing statutory provisions. For instance the Local Government Act, 1946. Sections 8, 9, 16 and 17 provides that receipts and expenses of a county council and a borough corporation are channelled through a county fund or a municipal fund respectively. A similar provision governs the receipts and expenses of county boroughs. Consequently, the making of regulations by the Minister is superfluous. On the question of moneys accruing to a body which has been delegated the functions of dog control under section 15, such as the expenses of keeping seized dogs under section 11, of on-the-spot fines under section 28 the arrangements made between the local authority and the body exercising the delegated functions will cover financial aspects. Each local authority will be free to negotiate its own terms as a body to which it is delegating functions. In simple language all that means is that a local authority when it is collecting rates and refuse collection payments and that sort of thing channel them into one fund and it is administered as a single fund. It is proposed that this collection of moneys, mostly from dog licensing, will be channelled in the ordinary way through the funds of the local authority.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because we have already gone through this Bill in detail. Without blowing our own trumpets we have done a reasonable job in trying to make the Bill more effective. I should like to thank the Minister for agreeing to some of the suggestions we made and incorporating them in the Bill. I hope the Bill will be put into effect as soon as possible and that it will not be like other Acts that have been put on the Statute Book and never put into effect. I would hate to see that happen to this Bill. If it is enforced properly it is good legislation and it will be a very effective way of collecting the dog licence fees because they have not been collected up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with Senator Hussey in complimenting the Minister and his advisers on the way they responded to the debates initiated here on Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill. The Bill is all the better for the amendments the Minister has agreed to. It is a useful piece of legislation. It can now be operated on the ground in the manner in which we want to have it operated. It is a complex Bill and removes responsibility from the gardaí for the collection of dog licence fees. The money will be channelled into a fund to ensure that proper dog wardens can be provided in each county council area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been very forthcoming in his response to all sides of the House. I want to compliment Senator Hussey. Senator Hourigan, Senator Howard and others on this side of the House on their contributions to the debate on the legislation. I understand agreement has been reached to deal with <Col N="1657" /> it fairly quickly in the other House. I hope it can be put into law before the lambing season of 1987 when we hope some of the major beneficial effects of the legislation will be seen. I hope the problems that have been created in the past by unwanted and uncontrolled dogs have been addressed by the Government and by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I want to thank everyone for their participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on matters that arose out of our discussions on Committee Stage. Senator Durcan suggested on Committee Stage that the definitions of &ldquo;Dog licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;general dog licence&rdquo; in section 1 should contain the words &ldquo;or have in his possession&rdquo;. That would leave the definition reading &ldquo;a licence entitling a person to keep or have in his possession a dog&rdquo;. I have had another look at the matter and I am happy that the existing phraseology is correct.</P>
      <P>The licence entitles a person to keep a dog by virtue of the fact that in section 2 it would be unlawful to keep the dog without a licence. If the Senator's suggestion were adopted, it would seem to be necessary to follow it through with an amendment to section 2 making it unlawful to keep or have in possession a dog without a licence. Such a provision would be rather imprecise. &ldquo;Keep&rdquo; certainly includes &ldquo;have in possession&rdquo; in the context in which it is used in this Bill, when one looks at subsection (2) of section 2 where the occupier of the premises where the dog is found is deemed to be the keeper. Consequently by using &ldquo;keep&rdquo; there is no need to add &ldquo;have in his possession&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator is suggesting that &ldquo;have in his possession&rdquo; be used as an alternative to &ldquo;keep&rdquo;, thereby creating an offence of having possession of a dog without a licence, I think we would be creating a monster. In that situation, any temporary possession of an unlicenced dog could make an unwitting offender of the possessor. For instance, if you were <Col N="1658" /> to walk out somebody else's dog and the dog was not licensed then you would be in trouble. Literally, if you were left holding an unlicensed dog, you could commit an offence. Therefore the offence, in my view, must be confined to the keeping of a dog, which means more than just having the dog in one's possession. Sections 2 and 6 make use of the word possession, but they do so merely to denote the act of passing possession of the dog from one person to another.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators and, indeed, the Advisory Council on animal health, have made pleas for the exemption of dogs owned by the Irish Guide Dogs&rsquo;Association from the payment of licence fees. These dogs form the nucleus of the stock from which careful selection is made to produce suitable guide dogs. The guide dogs when being used by blind persons, are, of course, exempt from licensing.</P>
    <P>The dogs are, I am informed, owned by the Irish Guide Gogs&rsquo;Association but are kept by various people throughout the country. The keepers are, therefore, liable for the licensing and if an exemption were to be given it would have to be extended to all these people who could not be easily distinguished and who may, indeed, have other dogs. The operation of what is a simple, straightforward licensing scheme would become very complicated. I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accommodate the association, which, I must say, performs a most praiseworthy role in helping the blind.</P>
    <P>As promised on Committee Stage, I have had another look at Senator Hussey's suggestion that a lower age limit of 16 years might be considered in relation to exercising greyhounds. As I stated on Committee Stage, an age limit of 16 years was originally included in the Bill for the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, but was deleted by Government amendment at the request of Bord na gCon and others. That Bill, incidentally, was sponsored by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and, after a thorough debate in the Seanad, the consensus was that the introduction of special controls over greyhounds <Col N="1659" /> by requiring them to be kept on a leash in public places and limiting the maximum number to be exercised in public places by one person to four was as far as the Oireachtas should go in the matter.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a lower age limit would highlight the need for an upper age limit and possibly different age limits for men and women, because what is involved essentially is physical strength. The difficulty of ascertaining people's ages also presents a difficulty. On the ground, where these greyhounds are bred and reared, it has been traditional for teenagers to walk the greyhounds after return from school. Invariably the route, or some part of it, would be in a public place. I would leave it to the good sense of the owners to judge their teenagers' capacities. I do not want to introduce something that might not meet general acceptance and I think the 1965 controls, which are merely being repeated in this Bill, judged the matter properly and struck a correct balance between what was being sought and what was acceptable by the industry. The 1965 controls have had widespread acceptance and have been generally successful. For these reasons, I am convinced that we should stick to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey raised a point on section 25 relating to the person to deal with in regard to excessive barking of a dog. The Senator suggested that, where the occupier of the premises where the dog is kept and the owner are not one and the same person, the owner should also be notified of the intention to make a complaint to the Court. As promised I have had another look at this. I have consulted with the legal people and I am happy that the existing provision is adequate. If the owner, as well as the occupier, had to be notified a difficulty might arise for the person aggrieved by the excessive barking, if he or she could not ascertain who the owner was or his-her address. Furthermore, if an occupier had dogs from more than one owner, it would be difficult to know which owner's dog was barking. The intention of the <Col N="1660" /> section is to provide a simple and effective procedure for an aggrieved party to obtain redress in Court and that, I think, can best be achieved by proceeding against the occupier of the premises in which the offending dog is kept.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like very much to compliment my friends here in this House on their helpful contributions to this quite lengthy and very important legislation. I assure the House and I assure Senator Hussey that it will not be allowed to rest here. I am hoping to get it into the Dáil next week perhaps and certainly I hope to have it in ample time for the lambing season.</P>

      <P>We will deal with amendments Nos. 1, 5, 8 and the amendment to amendment No. 8. Amendments Nos. 9, 11, 12 and 22 are related. Amendments Nos. 10, 14, 15, 16, 19, 23 and 38 are consequential on No. 9. Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23 and 38 may be discussed together. If No. 9 falls, Nos. 10, 14, 15, 16, 19 and 38 cannot be moved. All these have a bearing on the National Advisory Council. I can go through them again and again.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Chair's dilemma because of what has happened, but we have a Bill with 18 sections and 59 amendments. Some of us, including myself, were saying to the Minister that he might withdraw the Bill and rewrite it, but the Minister decided he would not do that but amend it. I will have to give credit to the Minister. He has come a long way to meet many of the problems raised in the Seanad; he has endeavoured to meet the criticisms made of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own case, many of the amendments from the Government side will meet my aspirations. I wish to thank the <Col N="1661" /> Minister for that. Much of what is in the Bill now is acceptable, which was not the case when the Bill came into the House first. I congratulate the Seanad on the great effort, work and interest shown. There was an astonishing amount of interest in this Bill right across the board. Obviously, the medical people helped but the general public, too, are aware of the importance of this Bill. I have a vested interest because I had cardiac surgery and I am riddled with arthritis. I am interested in anything that will produce good drugs and good medical research in the future which will help my own individual cause.</P>
    <P>Every man, woman and child in Ireland should have an interest in the Bill. It will affect their lives in some way because medical research is vital to this nation and this Bill is vital to medical research. The Minister has gone a long way and for that I am grateful.</P>

      <P>Briefly, on the section, I appreciate the points made by Senator Fallon and I have endeavoured in recent weeks &mdash; and this has been one of the reasons I have not had the opportunity to meet individual Senators arising out of the Second Stage debate &mdash; to accommodate to the greatest extent possible the incorporation of the NDAB in the framework of the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to deal with the reference to the NDAB made in amendment No. 1, which has been withdrawn, and which was mentioned by the Minister. Many of us were very complimentary about this voluntary organisation, a non-statutory body. I am concerned about giving this organisation statutory powers. Like Senator Fallon I am pleased that they are specifically mentioned in legislation. It will give them a consultative role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister. They will have a useful role to play in the future in the area of clinical trials. From what the Minister has said in discussions I take it that the board we will be referring to in the future will have statutory powers vested in them by this legislation and because of that members of the National Drugs Advisory Board will be on the new board. I take it the new board will be a statutory board and not a voluntary board as is the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have consultations with them and they will advise him. When we talk here about a board we are talking about a new control of clinical trials board as opposed to the non-statutory role the National Drugs Advisory Board play now in a very capable manner. I am anxious to ensure that they should have a responsibility, apart from the Minister, in various areas, that they will have a <Col N="1663" /> statutory role and will be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to make a general comment on the bringing forward of the amendments by the Minister? I think it is true to say the Bill was initially too comprehensive and that the amendments have been very welcomed by all the people who have been keeping a very close eye on this Bill. The Bill has excited not only national interest but international interest, and the vested interests in particular were to be found with ruffled feathers when this Bill was first published. The amendments that have come forward from the Minister, even though they will cause us some confusion as tabled, will have the net effect of strengthening the Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Bill was originally drafted, academic medicine was most apprehensive about the application of the provisions to its work. In general those interests will be very pleased, indeed, with the amendments which have been brought forward. The National Drugs Advisory Board, who played a key role, have been very firmly brought into the Bill, as Senator Fallon said in his opening remarks. I would like to say how very much I welcome that and I think it strengthens the measure before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain to me the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board prior to the introduction of this Bill? They have a specific role of making recommendations to the Minister, though when we went through the original draft of the Bill on Second Stage, I suggested that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted. I think that there was and still is a legitimate reason for my saying that on that occasion, and the answer is here today: it would have been easier for all involved if that had been done. On that occasion I said the Minister has always been favourable to amending legislation but what I am asking the Minister on this section is: what change is there now in the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board as against the role they had prior to the introduction of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a statutory assurance formally written in which did exist but is now a statutory assurance that the role of the NDAB is enshrined in the Act and the Minister, being the competent authority, in future will consult with the NDAB prior to exercising that authority. Heretofore, the NDAB operated a voluntary scheme of regulation. After this, the controls will be formal but will be substantially based on the voluntary scheme. However, the board will be given statutory authority. The only person who can exercise authority is the Minister for Health of the day, and he will do so now after consulting with the board.</P>

      <P>I cannot see what it will do for the Bill but it will help possibly to make progress in the discussion here and if the Chair wants me to leave it in for that purpose I will do so. The Minister gives the board their full title. Is he satisfied that it is not necessary to insert in section 1 the type of amendment I put down? If he is he might like to do it later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>2. &mdash; (1) (a) The provisions of this Act shall not apply in respect of any clinical trial which is being conducted at the commencement of this Act.</P>
      <P>(b) Where any arrangements to undertake or to conduct a clinical trial were or were being made before the commencement of this Act and where paragraph (a) does not apply, then such arrangements shall, for the purpose of an application under section 3* or of section 10, be treated as if they had not been made otherwise than in accordance with section 3 or 10 (as the case may be).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where a person proposes to arrange for the conducting of a clinical <Col N="1667" /> trial or to conduct a clinical trial and there is in force in respect of the substance or preparation concerned a product authorisation granted under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984 (S.I. No. 210 of 1984), then the provisions of section 3 to 11 shall not apply where &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the National Drugs Advisory Board&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) have been notified in writing of the proposal, and</P>
    <P>(ii) have received such information, evidence, documents, samples or other materials that they may have, not later than 4 weeks after being so notified, requested in relation to the proposed clinical trial, and</P>
    <P>(b) the conditions under which the product authorisation was granted are complied with in respect of the substance or preparation concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to insert a new section before section 2 of the Bill as published. I am introducing this amendment to take account of some points made in representations received since the publication of the Bill and to take account of the contributions of some Senators on Second Stage. The purpose of this new section is to provide for an exemption from the controls in the Bill of clinical trials actually in progress prior to the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an overlap. We do not propose to cover the overlap at this stage because there are considerable statutory problems. It also ensures that arrangements for clinical trials which had not started before the commencement of the Act are not invalidated. The Bill provides that such arrangements, so to speak, should be preceded by the granting of permission to undertake a trial. The exemption of trials where the drug being tested has a product authorisation, provided that the NDAB have been notified of such trials, is to meet objections that the Bill would otherwise make it impossible to carry out any studies which are <Col N="1668" /> important in the public interest because of the procedures required, including unrealistic insurance fees, cumbersome and protracted consideration of applications and the possible setting up of the medical practitioners involved for claims in respect of alleged harmful effects. I use the phrase &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; advisedly.</P>
    <P>It is maintained that the ordinary ethics committees and the general insurance arrangements take care of those matters as it is. However, while it is accepted that there is a case for relieving such trials from the full controls envisaged originally in the Bill, it is important to ensure that the authorities are aware of the details of such trials. It is with that in mind we consider this new section necessary. It may be suggested that we are watering it down. We are not; we are trying to avoid an overlapping with trials, currently in operation, and these could not be brought within the framework of the Bill. That point has been made in a reasonable way in relation to the Bill as first published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (b) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) Where the conditions under which the product authorisation was granted are not complied with the National Drugs Advisory Board may if it considers necessary attach modifications or conditions under which the trial may proceed in respect of the substance or preparation concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those following this debate either by way of report or in the press gallery today I should make it clear that my amendment relates not just to the original Bill but more directly to the Minister's amendment. I propose to add a subsection dealing with the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board in situations where modifications or conditions could be introduced under which a trial may proceed in respect of a substance or preparation. I would like to read a short portion of a letter which I received today from Professor John Feely, Professor of <Col N="1669" /> Pharmacology and Therapeutics in the University of Dublin, Trinity College, on behalf of the Joint St James' FDVH Ethics Committee. TCD Health Sciences Faculty Sub-Committee on the Control of Clinical Trials Bill.</P>
    <P>The letter relates in particular to section 2 and to the amendment to the amendment we are discussing. I might add that this letter is directed to the Minister of Health. He may not have had an opportunity to see it. It only arrived in the post to his Department this morning. Dealing with section 2, the letter states:</P>
    <P>We welcome the exclusion of drugs that have a product authorisation from the full rigours of the Bill. While this amendment would make it unnecessary to receive Ethics Committee approval for such studies we feel that all such studies should have Ethics Committee approval and, irrespective of the legislation, undoubtedly our institutions will insist that all clinical research will have Ethics Committee approval.</P>
    <P>There will, however, continue to be some problems with regard to drugs that have a product authorisation where their use in research will be in keeping with everyday clinical practice but different from the original product authorisation. The difficulty here is that product authorisations when initially granted are understandably extremely restrictive. With more clinical experience the use of a drug increases considerably and sometimes in a more practical manner. Product authorisations may be 5-10 years behind clinical practice and frequently pharmaceutical companies do not update the Data Sheet. Take for example the beta blockers.</P>
    <P>A study involving propranolol in mild portal hypertension (as used by some gastroenterologists for a number of years) or a study involving the use of a beta blocker following a myocardial infarction but commencing treatment on day 3 or 4 (authorisation indicates commencing treatment between days 5 and 21), or using propranolol in combination <Col N="1670" /> with verapamil (as is often done nowadays) or a study in thyrotoxicosis giving propranolol in adequate dosage (rather than the small doses recommended in the initial authorisation) would all have to undergo the full rigours of the Bill. We suggest that such studies should instead require approval from the National Drugs Advisory Board who may attach to that approval any modification or conditions under which the trial may proceed, and that such studies will require Ethics Committee approval. Thus all studies involving drugs that have a product authorisation could be processed by the NDAB.</P>
    <P>What I am saying in everyman's language rather than in the medical terminology used in the letter from Professor John Feely is that I understand propranolol, if I have the word correctly, was originally given authorisation under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984. That drug was originally authorised for the direct purpose of dealing with heart disease whereas it is being used nowadays in relation to controlling blood pressure. It is being used widely in medical practice for this purpose. We want to minimise the extent to which doctors in medical practice will have to go for detailed approvals and long periods of doubt about a drug currently in use, or where medical science has seen that it could be effective in another area of handling patients in a hospital. For that reason I suggest that the amendment to the amendment makes sense and tidies up the Bill in the interests of those involved in the treatment of patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some who would water down the situation to the extent that they would feel free to develop new processes, new clinical trial procedures without reference to the NDAB. There is nothing to prevent anybody who has received an authorisation from going back and having additional criteria added on in certain circumstances. <Col N="1671" /> It is open to the persons conducting the trial. It is essential that we should have this. The new section 2 is quite explicit. It allows a clinical trial to proceed involving an authorised drug which is being used for specific purposes. I can see the reluctance of some people, including those involved in well established drugs, to vary the trial or vary the purpose therefor. To loosen it out in this way would, in effect, negative the general purpose of the controls. Our view, shared by the NDAB, is that when they attach conditions which relate to the use of an authorisation, they are usually framed in such a way that if the professor or the clinician concerned wants to come back and have additional uses in certain circumstances added on, he can come back within the framework of the authorisation. He does not have to go through the whole new procedure again.</P>
      <P>For that reason it is important that the Senator should have raised the point. We have received representations regarding this aspect but it would open it up unduly and I am not so sure te NDAB would want that. That is my feeling. I am always chary of one letter from one academic who understandably has a particular viewpoint which might not necessarily be shared by the members of the board. It is in that context that I appreciate the point being made. Additional use in certain circumstances can be added on to the authorisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we talking about the need for the Minister to expound on the up-to-date position of doctors in medical practice &mdash; clinicians &mdash; in relation to drugs in a hospital rather than dealing with drug companies exploring new drugs? I am talking about an existing drug approved by the registration process and being used for a different purpose. Does this mean in the case of propranolol that all those involved or the company manufacturing this drug, will now need to go to the National Drugs Advisory Board to get the product authorisation changed to allow for the application that deals with controlling blood pressure? Is <Col N="1672" /> that what the Minister is saying to the House? When this Bill is passed this will be a necessary step for those engaged in producing this drug or for those using it to ensure that the drug company, or whoever is responsible, does it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential for the safe housekeeping of the NDAB and the knowledge of the NDAB that they should acquaint them with the additional uses to which this authorisation is being put. I have a problem in the context of litigation on the use of drugs and I have to protect the NDAB. The Minister for Health of the day has to ensure that he does not finish up with massive litigation against him because he takes a degree of statutory authority to himself and could finish up in a few years' time in dire trouble if he were to loosen it out unduly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the established position the user concerned would be obliged within the framework of the Act to notify the NDAB office of all traditional usages and I do not see, once they have that acquaintance, that they would require it to go through a new clinical trial because of the established authorisation there already. As the Senator is aware we propose to exempt trials involving authorised drugs provided they are being used in accordance with the condition of the authorisation. That is our change at this stage of the Bill. It is a very substantial and reasonable change and is one which, by and large, they have welcomed.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything I have said, there is still nothing to prevent a medical practitioner using his own clinical judgment and taking it upon himself as a matter of personsl decision to use a particular drug or substance in a particular way, and he must take the responsibility for it. If he is involved in a trial then the role of the NDAB comes in and within the framework of the Act, he would be obliged if he is using a drug not covered by the authorisation to notify the NDAB of the proposed additions. I think he would be exceptionally well advised to so do knowing the concept of litigation these days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things I should like to explore further. The Minister talked about the user. The user, I presume, means the medical practitioner. Perhaps the Minister does not want me to explore this point much further. I asked earlier whether the drug company would have to get involved in ensuring that the authorisation was changed or altered, or whether it falls on the medical practitioner. I do not know whether it is important to get this matter defined further. The Minister talked about the trial. Presumably there is a grey area between the patient suffering from an acute illness in bed in a general hospital and the person presenting himself for a clinical trial, presumably paid for by a drug company. Is there any way of measuring &mdash; or who measures &mdash; the distinction between one exercise and the other? There probably is an element of drug trials in medical practice, particularly in dealing with terminal illnesses in hospitals where it is decided there is a drug that just might do what is required. I lived in a medical household for a long time.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that one often hears about a new drug which may do what is required. These people are racing against time in trying to save the life of somebody in an acute stage of illness. I wonder where the line is drawn between actual medical practice and trials in a hospital. I see no difficulty when one is dealing with the establishment of a new drug and a drug company's involvement in trials. In the area of medical treatment I wonder &mdash; I mean medical treatment in relation to patients who are suffering a great deal, who are perhaps terminally ill, where doctors have almost given up hope of saving the life of the person concerned &mdash; if there is a drug that just might do the trick, having been tried successfully in Canada or the US, can it be used? That is the question I would like to pose to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have a great deal of difficulty in replying in this framework. If the patient concerned has a terminal condition and the practitioner <Col N="1674" /> concerned, using his clinical judgment, decides to avail of a complex range of drugs in a last ditch effort and he does not succeed, full stop, he does not succeed. If he does succeed, he does succeed. If he is in consultation with a drug company and simultaneously he is completing a trial charge and, as happens very frequently, he is being paid when he uses that drug, he puts himself into a trial situation and then the role of the NDAB comes into play, in so far as an authorisation is concerned. In relation to acute arthritis &mdash; I am familiar with rheumatoid arthritis as a member of my own family had the condition for many years &mdash; he would avail of the most up-to-date substance and, provided he does not embroil himself or involve himself in a trial situation, he is totally exempt from the rigours of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is important because we could not impinge on ordinary medical practice to a major degree. Therefore a doctor, practitioner or consultant has virtually unlimited authority for the use of a drug in that framework. He may report back to the drug company that it looked like being the wonder drug for acute arthritis and at that stage the company would have to apply to the NDAB for additional usages. It would be incumbent on them, and that is why it has been a very difficult Bill to frame. Now that the pre-occupation of Professor Feely, whose competence I would in no way question, is met within that framework, our elaboration here today should put that to rest. They are understandable fears which may academics have. They want academic freedom and I am in favour of academic freedom in a responsible way.</P>

      <P>Arising from what the Minister and Senator FitzGerald said, is the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board a positive role? Have they not got a positive role to play? From what Senator FitzGerald has said I understand he is talking about a drug that might come from England, America or wherever, and a medic might decide to use it for acute arthritis. At that stage has it not in some way been investigated and passed by the <Col N="1675" /> National Drugs Advisory Board because they have done so in the past? We know of certain drugs which were in use in England and other countries and were withdrawn, but were not allowed into Ireland by the National Drugs Advisory Board because they were aware of what was happening. They were on the ball, anxious, competent and so on. In the case referred to by Senator FitzGerald and by a previous speaker, have the NDAB a positive role, even at this stage, to play in a situation like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted in the Minister's previous comments that he drew a very clear distinction, which was not made prior to the Government's amendments being put down, between the question of a trial being in progress and the question of a particular drug under trial in a specific situation. A private doctor may decide to use drugs in, as the Minister said, a last ditch effort to save a life. In my Second Stage contribution I mentioned drugs used for terminally ill patients suffering from leukaemia and cancer.</P>
      <P>The previous restrictions, according to the original draft, would have prevented the use of drugs which had a product authorisation and had been recognised by the World Health Organisation and had been used elsewhere outside the country. It was felt at the time &mdash; perhaps the Minister will clarify the position &mdash; that the use of such drugs would have been prevented had they not got the clearance from the National Drugs Advisory Board. That would mean there would be huge delays involved particularly in dealing with acute illnesses. The delay in some instances would have prevented efficient effective treatment. Therefore I welcome the Minister's inclusion of the amendment. I agree with what he said in regard to the opening up of the floodgates and the free administration of drugs. If my interpretation of Senator FitzGerald's amendment is correct it makes it more easy for medical practitioners to use drugs in a hospital and in treatment rather than in a clinical trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few brief comments to make. Senator FitzGerald's amendment to section 2 is to be welcomed. It is a very sensible provision because it means that trials already in progress will not be subjected to any stop-start breaks which would not be in the interests of the patients who are undergoing the trials and, indeed, would cloud or mask or, in some ways, completely obviate the academic who was perhaps engaged in the trial and the end result would be of no value whatsoever. Given the safeguards that are part and parcel of the Minister's amendment it is a perfectly sensible, sane provision to allow what is already proceeding to continue.</P>
      <P>The concerns raised by Senator FitzGerald in his amendment are very interesting ones. I listened keenly to the Minister's reply. It seems to me that the reply meets the concerns expressed by Senator FitzGerald in that it is possible to go back to the National Drugs Advisory Board and to look for an extension of the conditions of trial if an application for the drug can be given to treat something tangential but still different from the provisions of the original authorisation. In addition, it does not cut across the freedom of the medical practitioner to intervene promptly particularly in a terminal situation and to use a drug which it is felt will alleviate pain or prolong or give an added quality to the life which is in the care of the practitioner. All in all, this measure has been intelligently and sensitively dealt with given the amendments that are before us today. Certainly I found the Minister's reply adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening and it took me quite a while to adjust to the complexities of the way our amendments are falling together. I would have thought that Government amendment No. 18 regarding the redefinition of the conducting of a clinical trial covered a large part of what has been discussed here. Where a drug is being administered the principal purpose of that administration is the welfare of the patient. We are not talking about a clinical trial at all and <Col N="1677" /> a large part of our concerns would be covered by that.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that this is not as simple as one might imagine. There is a hard sell being conducted by drug companies, often to the delight of medical practitioners who are entertained to my knowledge in luxurious restaurants in what are generally described as drug do's. They are frequent and very much a part of hospital medicine. People are not saints. We are not saints in this House. We have to operate under regulations. I would not like to leave the politics of the operation of this House to the feelings of the Members at a particular moment about what would be appropriate. We have to operate according to Standing Orders because they establish the framework within which we operate.</P>
      <P>Similarily it is not just in the case of terminally ill patients that drugs are widely used. In the area of psychiatirc medicine there are profound ethical questions about when, where and under what circumstances drugs should be used. There are suggestions, quite legitimately made, that drugs can be a substitute for proper clinical care and can be a substitute for the time of a medical practitioner in many cases, particularly in psychiatric illness. These are drugs that are not used on a short-term basis; they are drugs that often have to be prescribed for life. This layman has a view that some of the side effects of some of the alleged wonder drugs in the area of psychiatric medicine would be a worthy area of study for the sort of high-minded medical practitioner being presented to us here as being somehow restricted by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much more to this. Part of the problem the medical profession have is the problem all the professions have: a certain resentment that the ordinary unqualified laity should claim any right to make them accountable for the manner in which they do their business. It is proper and right that there should be accountability by all professions. The only profession that is totally accountable is this profession we are involved in here, <Col N="1678" /> because ultimately we lose our right to practice this profession if we are not deemed to have done it properly. There is no other profession which has that degree of accountability. Other professions are perfectly free to practise incompetently as long as they are not negligent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am happy with this part of the Bill. I regret, and I will say it in stronger language later on, that the lobbies on behalf of the people who may well have to undergo these trials have not caught the Minister's ear to the extent that perhaps the lobbies of the professions have done so, but that is for a later part of the discussion. The Minister has done a fine job. For a variety of reasons I have had a lot said to me about the problems that the medical profession would have about this Bill. The Minister has done a reasonable job in meeting those concerns. He has shown that he is a man of great flexibility and is prepared to listen to other people's opinions and he has amended the Bill quite satisfactorily. I would not for one second allow the sensitivities and, indeed, often the vanity of a particularly vain profession to carry us too far in that direction.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what Senator Ryan has said, I would be the last person to wish to protect the vanity of any profession. I share his concern about psychiatric patients and the use of drugs in this aspect of the profession. I have done so for years. In former times it is true to say that psychiatric patients were put in strait-jackets and nowadays there are many people who feel that the use of the strait-jacket has been replaced by that of the chemical strait-jacket. In my former capacity as a member of the South Eastern Health Board when going into psychiatric hospitals on hospital visits &mdash; and indeed I lived on the campus of St. Brigid's Psychiatric Hospital in Ardee for a couple of years &mdash; I had an opportunity to observe this chemical strait-jacketing of psychiatric patients. It is disturbing and I would agree with Senator Ryan that very often it can be a <Col N="1679" /> substitute for person to person therapy and a convenient way of dampening down facets of the psychiatric patient's personality disorder, which is questionable. I do not think it acutally arises in the context of this Bill because it is not necessarily a clinical trial. It is perhaps a subject for another discussion on another Bill on another occasion. That is really a comment I felt I would like to make arising out of what he said.</P>

      <P>The first part of the amendment, the new section 2 (1) (b), is necessary to ensure the completeness of the dossier to be submitted in an application. The second part of the amendment, new section 2 (1) (c), is to take account of the contention of quite a number of persons that it should be possible for a hospital which carried out trials regularly to refer to its ethics committee a particular application without having to name the members each time. There would have to be an assurance that the ethics committee was constituted on an impartial basis required of such a committee in accordance with the guidelines recommended by the NDAB. This could be arranged administratively. I understand the preoccupation regarding hospital trials and the endeavour on our part not to build up a bureaucratic structure within that framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very interesting that in his reply on Second Stage on the question of ethics committees the Minister's response to the idea of a national ethics committee &mdash; which is effectively what amendment No. 21 proposes and which would consequentially necessitate amendment No. 4 &mdash; was: &ldquo;Can you imagine what I would be accused of if I suggested a national ethics committee?&rdquo; I can imagine what he would be accused of and I can imagine all the problems. It is worth recalling that, even though the medical profession do an enormous amount of wonderful work and an enormous amount of work to advance the cause of suffering humanity, this does not give them a sort of infallibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of clinical trials the history in Ireland is that many groups who have had reason to observe their operation from the bottom upwards are singularly unhappy that the ethics committees appointed by the clinics, in particular, did not function as they were allegedly intended to. They failed in many cases to protect vulnerable people from exploitation by these clinics and, therefore, do not seem to meet one of the criteria of justice which is that they should be seen <Col N="1681" /> to be operating in an independent fashion. The only way to have public confidence that ethics committees are impartial and independent of the clinic involved is to have the ethics committee separate from all the clinics and bodies involved in clinical trials and have such an ethics committee nominated by the Minister with the power, the right and the funds because at least two of the clinics are more than in a position to fund an ethics committee quite adequately. There need not be any charge on the State.</P>
    <P>The prospect of a number of ethics committees, or an ethics committee for each trial, will not give any sense of public confidence and will not alleviate public concern. The public have good reason to be suspicious of all the professions. They do not necessarily always operate in the interests of the public. The only structure for accountability the public have at their disposal is through the political process. It, therefore, appears to me that the only way to categorically assure the public that clinical trials are being conducted properly, ethically and without any exploitation of those who are participating in the trials, is by having an ethics committee which is independent of all the trials. The simplest way to ensure that is to have an ethics committee nominated by the Minister and that is why I put down amendment No. 21 which provides that the Minister should appoint an ethics committee to supervise all clinical trials in the State, and amendment No. 4 which follows on from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly like to be able to support Senator Ryan's amendment because I know he feels very strongly about it. When we examine what clinical trials are about, I accept the point he has made about multinationals, profit making and so on. What is wrong with drug companies making a profit? Deputy Noonan, Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the opening of an extension of one of these companies asked what was wrong with profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> I cannot see how a national ethics committee would help in any way because many people in this House and in the pharmaceutical profession are worried about the obvious bureaucratic delays we were told would follow. If there is a national ethics committee in Dublin, for example, that will delay things. It will add another delay of five or six months. How could a group sitting be expected in Dublin to examine the protocols of every company who wanted to engage in clinical trials? To whom should they be answerable? In the Elan set up we have a very responsible Garda sergeant, a priest and three medical people. Surely they are answerable to themselves. If they think there is something wrong, they are fools if they do not say so and ask for further information from the National Drugs Advisory Board, or delay the trial for further information. While Senator Ryan's proposal is beautiful in theory, in practice it would not work. It might be a different matter if he said, for example, that there should be a national supervisory ethics committee who would give guidelines and distribute information down the line.</P>
    <P>People who are members of ethics committees are answerable to themselves and to their conscience. For example, a Member of the other House, Deputy Briscoe, is a member of the ICP ethics committee in Dublin. He is one of the most independent men in the House. He is a man of integrity and concern. Certainly he will not be influenced by anybody. He has his own integrity and concern. While I share Senator Ryan's concern and know what he is getting at, if in the long term we are interested in medical research in Ireland, what he is suggesting is fine in theory but in practice I could not see it working. While I would like to support him, I cannot do so for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a comment on ethics committees. I am not so sure about ethics committees. In some instances they can work well. In other instances they can be a vehicle for particular prejudices of individuals. That is <Col N="1683" /> something we must always guard against any time it is suggested that ethics committees should be set up.</P>
      <P>In section 7 of the Bill there is a provision for the approval by the Minister of a proposed ethics committee for a clinical trial. It is true to say that a central concern of an ethics committee is to ensure that the risks to the participant do not outweigh the objectives of the trial. That is something we must keep in mind when we speak about an ethics committee. My concern in relation to this is that it is the applicant wishing to undertake the clinical trial who proposes the names of the ethics committee to the Minister for his approval. This was in the original Bill. At any later date the applicant has the right to apply to the Minister seeking the dismissal of any member of the ethics committee. I was unhappy about seeing that in the Bill because the independence of an ethics committee is a key factor and is a feature of ethics committees generally. I would be interested in what the Minister has to say in relation to the matter of ethics committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister actually scrutinise the membership of the ethics committee to guarantee that no institution will have their own membership exclusively? Will he guarantee that there will be outside participation so that there will be a balance of opinion as distinct from a unified group of people coming forward with the same purpose in mind is so far as they might be representing the same institution or a combination of institutions with the same interests in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of any ethics committee would have to be such as to require it to have a close involvement in the supervision of all aspects of any trial. On that simple ground alone it would be quite impracticable to have a national single committee to assume multiple functions. Inevitably there are multiple functions in many varying trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board will have specifically devolved on them the responsibility of advising the Minister <Col N="1684" /> for Health about the ethics committee for each trial. The board and the Minister will have to be satisfied that it is a reasonable balanced trial. The ethics committee will be sufficiently impartial in relation to that trial and will take full cognisance of the primary interests of each participant in that sense. Senator Fallon and his colleagues are correct; no one committee could possibly work for all the details of all trials. While I share Senator Ryan's concern that the ethics committees should be emphatic and independent, I do not think the setting up of a national body would be appropriate under the framework of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand some of the objections. This is not an enormous country. I am not convinced that there is an enormous amount of work that would come under the now considerably more restricted &mdash; though the Minister insists it it the same definition that always existed and is simply clarified &mdash; definition of a clinical trial. We are not talking about a huge volume of work, we are talking about two major private concerns that are commercial organisations, and presumably some of the major hospitals. That by and large is the scale of the operation of clinical trials in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The advantage of a national ethics committee is that they will develop expertise, will develop a consistent approach on a variety of issues, will develop a philosophy about the ethics of these trials. I would be concerned that an ethics committee should be there not to preserve a particular model of religious ethics, but rather to ensure that the trial in the way it impinges on the participants is ethical and that there are no short cuts in that direction. I do not believe the amount of work involved is so considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Senator Fallon, in particular, talking about the bureaucracy, it is mindboggling if the scale of the operation is so large that a single national committee is inappropriate. Can anybody imagine the volume of work that will be involved under section 7 of the Bill which says: &ldquo;Where the Minister is <Col N="1685" /> satisfied that a proposed ethics committee for a clinical trial...&rdquo; in other words, a committee for each trial. The Minister will have to be satisfied that there is an ethics committee for each individual trial. Unless I misread the Bill completely it means that ministerial approval will be needed for an ethics committee for each individual trial. I am not worried about bureaucratic bungling <i>per se.</i> There is no law in this world which says that because there is a State structure it has to be slow and inefficient or anything like that. That is a consequence of poor management; it is not a consequence of the structure. If one has a worry that a national ethics committee, expert in developing their own expertise with their own secretariat etc., will be somewhat slow-moving, can anybody imagine what it will be like when each individual trial &mdash; not each individual clinic &mdash; will have to have a separate ethics committee approved by the Minister? That is not my concern. I leave that concern to those who worry about large structures.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that it should not depend on the individual consciences of individual members of a committee that the public should be satisfied. It should be the way we set up the structures that renders bodies accountable. Individual accountability is a poor substitute for legal accountability. The real way for legal accountability is to set up a national ethics committee independent of all these bodies, nominated through the people by the Minister responsible for this area and which can quite competently do the necessary work. If we can have a bureaucratic system which assesses the competence of each ethical committee for each individual trial &mdash; not for each individual clinic &mdash; then it is perfectly feasible to set up a national ethics committee to deal with each individual trial and will probably deal with them far more efficiently than having to give approval for an ethics committee for each individual trial.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not understand why this amendment cannot be discussed in <Col N="1686" /> terms of the value I attribute to it which is the value of independence, the value that it is not nominated by anybody doing a trial but is nominated by the person who is responsible for the welfare of the community at large in this area &mdash; the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come a little late into this debate. I would like to give a case from my own experience, an experience which in some way I regret in this instance. Some 20 years ago when I was avid to advance myself in the medical profession I decided that I had an interest in the study of abdominal pain in children and that I would pursue a line of clinical research. One of the things that had not been considered in the assessment of abdominal pain in very young children with regard to the possibility of duodenal ulcer developing was what is known as the pentagastrin stimulation test. If any of you has had that done as adults, you will know that it is a passage of a tube into the person's stomach, the injection of a chemical the purpose of which is to get the maximum stimulation of gastric juice and, over a period of two hours, to assess the amount of juice that is produced.</P>
      <P>We studied some 100 or more children. In reasonably good faith I tried to explain to the parents what was involved. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, looking back on it in retrospect, that the main purpose of this was my interest in whether or not there was excess gastric juice in these children with abdominal pains. The study was not very conclusive, but 100 young children had been put through a very nasty experience. I am quite certain if I had to select an ethics committee, or if the hospital in which I worked had had to select an ethics committee, it could reasonably have been argued that there was no danger to the child's life. Nevertheless it was an assault on the integrity of the individual. It required a great indepth assessment of the motive behind the research, the purpose of the research and the effect of the research on the people concerned, in this case children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would worry me very much <Col N="1687" /> about Senator Ryan's proposal is that I imagine the national ethics committee would perhaps be remote from the scene of action of research being done in Tralee, Waterford, Mallow or wherever. There is a tremendous volume of research being done today for the purposes of professional advancement as much as for the purposes of scientific advancement. I wonder if one ethics committee would eventually come to have very different thoughts from those which, as Senator Ryan quite rightly says, could evolve were the ethics committee more closely related to the institute or the person involved in the research process.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that before this Bill becomes an Act this area needs further serious consideration. I wonder who would be prepared, who are scientifically orientated and who would spend the time required to look into all the research projects being advanced throughout the country in medical institutions and hospitals. How effectively could one committee do it and balance that against the dangers which Senator Ryan so rightly identified? There might be some case for having regional ethics committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see some merit in the proposal made by Senator Ryan that there should be a national ethics committee but I still believe that it is not practical. On a national ethics committee one would not get the range of technical competence which an ethics committee would need to have if they were to deal with every conceivable trial that might be conducted in any year. In addition to the problems Senator Robb outlined which would obtain so far as a national ethics committee were concerned, this is a further problem. On a national ethics committee dealing with every application for every type of trial that might be conducted in a particular year, one would need to have represented every type of consultant, psychiatrist and so on. I see that as a problem in the setting up of a national ethics committee. The committee would have to be so large and <Col N="1688" /> unwieldy that the suggestion is not practical.</P>
      <P>The two criteria which an ethics committee should meet are: first, they should be seen to be independent and, secondly, they should be seen to have the technical competence to deal with any application that might come before them. I would like to pose a question to the Minister: does he feel that the public would see an ethics committee nominated by the person who proposes to arrange for the conducting of the clinical trial as being independent? The public would be much more inclined to regard an ethics committee as independent if they were set up by some agency other than the person conducting the clinical trial.</P>

I would like to see that type of role because it could bring an added dimension and sensitivity to the functions of the ethics committee. I am also disappointed that there is no specific reference to the presence of both male and female members of ethical committees, although I am not in any doubt as to the Minister's own commitment in wishing to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would be particularly concerned about the points raised by Senator Robb and he may be assured that the NDAB and the Minister will look very closely at any trial involving children. In the first instance it would not be possible to carry out such trials unless they were in a particular condition requiring the trial. Indeed the Senator would concur that the criteria would have to be well established. I share the view of Senator Bulbulia that there should be a &mdash; I do not particularly like the word lay &mdash; consumer and women representation on such committees.</P>
      <P>Going back to the nub of the amendment it would be almost impossible to have a national committee sitting permanently supervising the several hundred trials which are in operation simultaneously. They would have their own committees. Some may act for particular blocks of drugs or procedures but in all cases they would be subject to approval. It is important that they would be different from the existing ones which are <i>ad hoc</i> and unsupervised. On that basis I think the Senator will see the wisdom of this. Perhaps it is a sign of old age but I am beginning to get very chary about another national committee for another national problem. We are better off dealing with it within the framework as proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not reply to Senator Bulbulia's question in relation to how the public would regard ethics committees which were in the first place nominated by the person conducting the trial. Does he think the public would see them as independent? I am also interested in how the Minister proposes to deal with what he now believes to be several hundred clinical trials. How does he propose to deal expeditiously with assessing the suitability of the ethics committee for each one of those trials which is what the Bill currently proposes he should do? If being expeditious is the issue, how is he going to deal expeditiously with assessing the appropriateness of the ethics committee for several hundred clinical trials each year?</P>

      <P>In part, Senator Ryan has stolen the word I wanted to emphasise. Senator Mullooly made a very important point when he emphasised independence. The Minister says at his years he is beginning to get worried about another national committee. I am quite certain that the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo; is not escaping his attention. The essence of this is to be found in the independence of whatever committee structure and the representation of the consumer on it, as Senator Bulbulia said. The Minister confirmed that he will be paying great attention to a broad spectrum representation of the consumer.</P>

      <P>Despite all the structures, ethics committees and so on we have or propose to have, has the Minister available to him the personnel or the structures whereby he can ascertain whether unauthorised clinical trials are being carried out within the country? As Senator Ryan said earlier, because we are in a situation of high powered commercialisation, particularly among the pharmaceutical industry, one would often get the impression that there are in progress in certain quarters unauthorised trials for which there is no medical supervision or ministerial approval within the Department. Does the Minister envisage that he will have in force some investigational structures he can implement at any time, or put into use at any time, to investigate if there are unauthorised trials in progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Senators that under the Bill the Minister of the day would have to be satisfied about the independence of the committees. Judgment inevitably comes in here, on top of the requirement that the committees be constituted in accordance with the guidelines. There will be administrative guidelines issued by the Department on the constitution of these committees. In addition, the Minister will <Col N="1691" /> have the advice and guidance of the National Drugs Advisory Board, which will have to be satisfied that the ethics committee is constituted in a balanced and impartial way. Should it emerge in any instance that there is a trial in train without a committee, that will be a statutory offence, effectively, under the Act. On that basis the Bill is reasonably framed. I concede that there will be several hundred trials on over a period but it is best that they be done within the block basis, or within the nominated basis.</P>
      <P>To set up a national body would be to set up a parallel body to the NDAB and inevitably you would have the double-barrelled bureaucracy where the NDAB would be in conflict with the national ethics committee or the national drugs ethics committee. It does not stop the NDAB setting up their own committee to deal with ethical trials. They can do so as part of the functions of the board. The surveillance methodology of those committees can be assessed by the NDAB as part of their substructure. It is best to do it that way. It would be very difficult to take on board the Senator's proposal because, apart from anything else, we would have to have a new subsection dealing with what would constitute a national ethics committee. We could spend six months arguing the toss about the composition of it and the setting up of another body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of independence has raised its head again. Senator Bulbulia, obviously rightly, expressed some concern about lay people as distinct from medical people in the composition of these boards. They are freely available. For example, in the ICP in Dublin they have &mdash; and it is right that they should have &mdash; medical people on the board because protocols are phrased in medical terminoly and it is important that there should be medical people on the board. It is interesting to refer to two people on the ICP board and what happened in the case of a former Labour councillor &mdash; I think he was a former Lord Mayor, Mr. Dunne &mdash; and Deputy <Col N="1692" /> Ben Briscoe. They were originally proposed from the local Eastern Health Board committee by Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla to act as their representatives. The Eastern Health Board did not accept them but the ICP people said: &ldquo;They are acceptable to us. They were nominated and we will take them.&rdquo; They are on the board as independent minded people who will do their own thing and will not be influenced. They will not have any connection or be seen to have any connection with the ICP people. In Athlone in Elan, we have a World Health Organisation retired nurse, a priest, a local Garda sergeant, one of the medical people is a lady doctor and there are females on the various boards.</P>
      <P>The suggestion of a national ethics committee who would look at every protocol, is not feasible. I feel very strongly that it would not be feasible or practical. I suggested a kind of national supervisory committee. Let it be part of the functions of the National Drugs Advisory Board. I would not disagree with that. They have clearly spelled out what they would like to see in regard to ethics committees. They have indicated that the following should be regarded as the minimum: three medical practitioners, a paramedical, one professional non-medical person actively and responsibly involved in administration or business, one person with legal training, one member of the lay public concerned with people and not holding polarised opinions on biochemical matters. They have set guidelines. There is an over-emphasis on the fact that people on these boards will be somewhat swayed by the companies that set up the ethics committee. I do not think that is possible. People on any of these boards who would be swayed in that way, should resign. I think that is what they would do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to withdraw amendments Nos. 4 and 21 with the permission of the House but in withdrawing them I want to make a couple of things clear. I want to make one thing clear, and that is, whatever the good intentions <Col N="1693" /> of the existing membership of ethics committees, particularly the ICP, I am satisfied that they failed to do their job. People were exploited in these clinics. There is and continues to be a disproportionate representation of unemployed and underprivileged people in the trials of these clinics. The procedure by which they recruited people for participation in these clinics was highly unethical in my opinion and the attractiveness of these clinics as a source of money to people who had no other source of money was in my view highly unethical. So whatever one may think about ethics committees and their independence and the good intentions of the membership, the truth is that they failed in their primary job in many cases of preventing exploitation.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that nasty people set out to exploit people. I am saying that the shortest distance and the easiest route to get volunteers was used in many cases and, in that process, people were exploited and people did suffer. I regret very deeply &mdash; and I accept some of the arguments about a national ethics committee &mdash; that we are going to leave the nomination of these committees, in particular in the two major commercial clinics, to people who have not managed to protect people from exploitation in the past. That is a major part of the function of an ethics committee. I have heard nothing from the Minister so far about how the new ethics committees will avoid the errors and mistakes and omissions of the existing ethics committees.</P>
      <P>In the interests of myself and Senator Robb I hope an alternative form of this amendment will be drafted which will meet the major objective of independence and perhaps by-pass some of the alleged bureaucratic problems. I propose with the House's permission to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>We are dealing in section 3 with the conduct of a clinical trial. It reads:</P>
      <P>the Minister shall, as soon as practicable &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken in accordance with the application, or</P>
      <P>(ii) grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken in accordance with the application subject to such modifications or conditions as he may specify, or</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> (iii) refuse to grant permission for the proposed clinical trial to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>I am talking about the normal request included in so much legislation. If you go for a planning permission to your planning authority and are refused, depending on which side of the fence you are on, and as the third party you feel aggrieved by the decision, there is an opportunity to go to a body called An Bord Pleanála. I heard it suggested on this amendment that we should allow for the fact that there will be aggrieved parties to decisions taken by the Minister on advice from the National Drugs Advisory Board. I have suggested that within one month evidence in writing must be furnished to the Minister and the National Drugs Advisory Board shall respond within six weeks. We should have some system of giving a second bite at the cherry, a second possible way of permitting a trial to take place and with a provision to tease it out through the appeal process to be provided in the Bill. It could be very helpful for the evidence in writing to include an explanation of the difficulties the NDAB had in advising the Minister to consent to the trial in the first place. The process of having a system of appeals in this Bill would be very helpful in the future. I suggest this amendment should be treated seriously and accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I support the view of Senator FitzGerald. The Minister has come a long way in this section. He has a similar amendment which indicates that the reason for the refusal should be given to the person or persons carrying out the trial. That is going some of the way. I support the view that there ought to be an appeal procedure and the appropriate body for such an appeal would be the National Drugs Advisory Board who are the experts in this area. It is a very reasonable suggestion and it is one I have no hesitation in supporting.</P>

      <P>I would also like to support some of the points made by Senator FitzGerald. On Second Stage I made the point that in the section, as drafted, there was no obligation on the Minister to outline the reasons for a refusal to grant permission for any clinical trial. I also made the point that there was no provision in the section for an appeal against the decision of the Minister. The Minister has met my first point in the new section as drafted and the amendments submitted by Senator FitzGerald would meet the second point I made on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I approve of your bad judgment. I support Senator FitzGerald because written into the Bill there is no court of appeal and I see that as something of a weakness. Section 3 empowers the Minister to apply whatever conditions he considers necessary for the safe conduct of the trial. It appears that, even if a study has been approved by an appropriately constituted ethics committee, the Minister has the authority to turn down such a study or revoke permission at any time. In section 6 it is stated that he can do this for any other reason. There is no court of appeal which is part and parcel of this Bill and no requirement on the Minister to justify or explain any decisions like that. It is extreme, if not autocratic, and I would like further clarification of this from the Minister when he replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I appreciate that we are, in fact, in injury time so I too will be brief in my submissions. I support those Senators who have agreed with the principle of providing for a form of appeal and I would like the Minister, in responding to the debate on this proposed amendment, to outline what is the recourse that can be taken if the application is refused. The Minister is required to give reasons for the refusal. That normally infers that there is to be some other consideration <Col N="1703" /> of it at a different level. That would be a standard provision where there was going to be some mechanism for appeal. When I was speaking on Second Stage I referred to the Scandinavian institution of a national clinical advisory body.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in these amendments is that the National Drugs Advisory Board would be a form of appeal body, but what I want the Minister to tell the House is what would happen if the application is refused. Is that the end of it as far as the applicant is concerned? How is the applicant, in effect, to move on from there? It does seem an unusual situation that, whereas the Minister can attach conditions or must give reasons for refusal, no other mind will address the issue and there is no other possibility for the applicant, in pursuing the matter, to take it further. We need to have some explanation of that. On both sides of the House there is general agreement that the House would prefer if there were some mechanism for appeal. Perhaps we could come back to that on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is prepared, in responding to the discussion about this amendment and the amendment to the amendment, to address himself in particular to academic trials as opposed to industrial trials &mdash; perhaps I should say to both &mdash; on the whole purpose of these trials? What is the priority of purpose &mdash; I was going to use the word &ldquo;motive&rdquo; but I thought that would be judgmental &mdash; because it has been my impression as a member of the medical profession and having been an academic in that profession that it is high time we addressed ourselves to the quantity of research being done in relation to the purpose behind it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is no doubt that it is very important to undertake trials in order to test the efficacy of drugs which one hopes will be of benefit, at the same time it has been my opinion &mdash; I think this is shared, although often <i>sotto voce</i>, with other members of the profession who are concerned that in recent years under the <Col N="1704" /> pressure of the publish or perish mentality, under the pressure of multiple &ldquo;diplomatosis&rdquo;, a disease that affects our profession in order to advance oneself &mdash; that a lot of research is being done where the prime purpose is the advancement of the person doing the research often through no fault of his own. I would go further and say usually through no fault of his own but through the present philosophy of higher institutional professional imperialism which dictates that, regardless of the clinical job into which the trainee will eventually be slotted he must do research which will further advance the institution in which he is being trained and will also further support &mdash;&ldquo;support&rdquo; may not be the correct word &mdash; the whole academic framework in which professionalism and institutionalism go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address himself to that when he is considering section 3 so that those who are judging whether permission should be granted, should take on board a very serious aspect of the whole dilemma of modern research, whether it is being done in order to push forward scientific frontiers, or whether it is being done in order to push forward careers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two brief comments. I have no objection to the intention that Senator Alexis Fitzgerald has in mind, but I cannot see that it will make any difference if an applicant may appeal to the National Drugs Advisory Board because all the NDAB can say is they do not agree with the Minister. It would still be a matter for the Minister to decide. The National Drugs Advisory Board are not the deciding body in this matter; it is the Minister. Therefore, an appeal might &mdash; if I can mention vanity again &mdash; heal the wounded vanity of the applicant but it will not make any difference to the permission refused. They will still be stuck with the refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robb touched on something that is of fundamental importance and which underlines the need to ensure that the controls of these areas are outside the profession and are accountable to society <Col N="1705" /> at large. One would have the impression &mdash; this is not exclusive to medicine but it happens to be medicine we are talking about &mdash; that research is something that is naturally directed to the areas of greatest human need, irrespective of any other consideration.</P>
    <P>The truth is that it is often the exact opposite. It is often that research is directed in the area of maximum human demand in terms of cash, resources, the society which can afford to pay for them. A huge volume of research is devoted, for instance, to things like coronary heart disease and cancer which are largely diseases of degeneration resulting from excessive indulgence in the good things of the affluent society while very little is devoted to the cheap mass production of basic drugs needed by two thirds of humanity who cannot afford to pay for anything. If we are talking about medical research based on need, the huge proportion of medical research ought to be based on the mass production of the basic drugs needed to eliminate the basic ailments that afflict large sections of humanity, particularly the elimination of mass infant mortality which could be done quite effectively. There are various things one could talk about here, but there is no evidence at all that medical research is based on human need and a considerable amount of evidence that it is based on crude consumer demand. In that case ethics are very important and accountability to society is extremely important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have finally determined that we are addressing an amendment to amendment No. 8 I will try at short notice to unravel some of the problems which have beset Senators all day. The Minister does not consider this amendment necessary. In practice it will be open to the applicant who has been refused a permission to discuss with the NDAB the reasons for refusal and the steps that might be taken to revise the application. I think that should answer Senator Robinson's question. There is at the moment, where medicines are being <Col N="1706" /> licensed, a means by which any applicant who runs the risk of not having his product approved by the NDAB can go and discuss it with the staff of the NDAB and that will still be open to anybody in this particular case. I sincerely hope that will go some way towards alleviating the problems.</P>
      <P>This is what happens at the moment in relation to the licensing of medicines and it is a system which has worked very well without the need for any specific legislative provisions for appeals. The Minister, on the best advice available to him, has said there is no need for any legislation in that regard to allow the appeals procedure to go on as before. Senator Robb made a point about superfluous medical research and it is well made and taken. It would be the intention to question the real need for the trial in each instance but, of course, basically we rely on the professional standards of the people in the medical profession to ensure that they are upheld and that they monitor their peers, especially young and ambitious doctors.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the idea of having some time limit on the consideration by the Minister of an application here for amendment in effect in relation to a proposed clinical trial. That is what will be achieved by this. It seems to me that it requires that the person seeking the amendment should know there would be some cut-off period. Senator FitzGerald has proposed three weeks. That seems to me to be reasonable. Even a six week period would probably be the outside of what would be considered reasonable. The whole question of time limits is very important here because it will affect how these applications are processed. In section 8 there would be what I think is a very long period of 12 weeks for the original application and then no time limit in relation to the question of amendment. This is a matter which could lead to getting bogged down while awaiting the outcome of the consideration. I hope the Minister will respond favourably to the idea of a time limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator FitzGerald's amendment and I think the Minister's amendment elaborates on section 4. Section 4 has to do with where a person with permission wants to amend the clinical trial and the procedures that must be adopted to do that. The Minister has elaborated on the procedure that must be gone through before permission can be given to amend that trial. What disturbs me is that there is no clear provision now that the individual undergoing the trial or participating in the trial shall be informed with the same detail and the same conscientiousness about the nature of the amendment to the trial as he or she was informed when they began the trial before it was amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 17, simply said, &ldquo;provided that he is satisfied that the provisions of section 8... have been complied with&rdquo;. These have to do with the participants in the clinical trial and have all to do with ensuring that the person participating knows what he or she is doing, knows the risks and is properly informed and freely consents. All of that is contained in section 8 and all of that is built into section 8 because, quite rightly, it is recognised that it is extremely important. As the Minister's amendment is stated there is no requirement to comply with section 8 where it is proposed to amend the trial. That would be fine if we were talking about minor amendments only, but there is nothing in here to suggest <Col N="1710" /> the scale of the amendments, so we are effectively depending upon the judgment of the Minister and nobody else as to whether trials can or cannot be amended. The poor misfortunate individual who has volunteered to participate in a trial could well have the trial changed and not be consulted at all about it as the current phraseology stands.</P>
    <P>The simple reference in the Minister's amendment is &ldquo;until ... the ethics committee for the proposed trial has given its approval to the proposed trial (as so amended) in accordance with section 7 (2)&rdquo;. The reference to section 7 (2) intrigues me because section 7 in its entirety covers all the duties an ethics committee must fulfil. It lists in subsection (4) a series of undertakings which an ethics committee must fulfil in order to meet their responsibilities. But it is not section 7 that is referred to in the ministerial amendment, it is section 7 (2) thereby excluding most of the duties of the ethics committee which should properly be carried out in the case of an amendment to the trial. It was very simple to meet my concerns. It would simply mean amending the Minister's amendment so that it referred to &ldquo;in accordance with section 7&rdquo;. In other words, if the ethics committee had to do everything provided under section 7 in the case of an amended trial it would meet all my concerns because that would necessitate their being satisfied about the degree of consent of the individual, the degree to which the individual participating in the trial was informed.</P>
    <P>Without that, the poor misfortunate who is at the centre of the trial, the participant, may well not be properly informed about what is being done to him, what is being amended about what is being done to him, and the possible risks to himself resulting from that. Therefore, since as I said, it is unlikely that there will be an earthquake and the amendment will not be carried, I request an elaboration from the Minister or the Minister of State or whoever wishes to elaborate on it as to why this reference in subsection (2) of the Minister's amendment is only to section 7 (2) and not to <Col N="1711" /> the entirety of section 7 which would appear to me to be the logical way to do it if we are concerned about protecting the participants in these trials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment to the amendment proposed by Senator FitzGerald and also the point which Senator Brendan Ryan has just made. The time limit is of vital importance. Taking into account all I have said about the dangers of the research model, and the purpose of it, there could be nothing more frustrating than to be doing research in the form of a clinical trial and to want to change the emphasis and then to find that the whole procedure became bogged down in interminable bureaucratic-type delay. That has to be supported, whether or not it is to be three weeks, and this is asking rather a lot, particularly if there is to be a national as opposed to a regional or further subdivisional ethics committee. It needs to be specified and it needs to be a short rather than a long time.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of clearing up whether the person understands what is being carried out, there is a simple device. After all, we are now said to be more extensively educated than ever before and I cannot see why the Minister could not encourage the presentation to the ethics committee of a simple statement either on tape or in writing of not more than 150 words by the person on whom the trial or the altered trial is being conducted of what they understand is being done to them. It would then be quite clear that there had been communication. They would have a perfect right to say what they understood was being done to them and this would be presented in their own words and in their own way and the ethics committee could judge accordingly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Minister whether, if this time limit is accepted, and whether it is <Col N="1712" /> three weeks or six weeks, as a consequence of failure to comply with it, the whole application would lapse or would the application be granted automatically without permission within the statutory time allocated? I should like to know which would be the case: whether the original application would lapse or the Minister would have to grant it automatically as is the case in certain other instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier I was not aware, or at least it was not the case, that we were also considering amendment No. 17 which we now are.</P>
      <P>I support the reasoning behind this amendment as explained by Senator Ryan. We must be concerned to ensure that where there is the process of applying to amend, that process will necessarily involve that any persons who may already be actively taking part in a clinical trial &mdash; it may be changed after it has been set in motion &mdash; would be informed for the purposes of securing a consent on their part to the proposed clinical trial as amended. It may be that the ethics committee would necessarily ensure that, but I share some of the reservations expressed by Senator Ryan about the way in which the present amendment is drafted in subsection (2) (a) of section 5. The important issue that must be ensured before the amendment is accepted is that any person who would be going to take part in the future, or who would be in the process of taking part in a clinical trial, would be made aware of the scope of any proposed amendment and would express his or her consent to that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Ryan is correct in what he is saying, he is perfectly right to raise the matter. Senator FitzGerald is proposing that, in the event of the National Drugs Advisory Board not allowing a particular <Col N="1713" /> trial to take place and if there is to be an appeal or an amendment in some form to it, the amendment should take place within three weeks. As I understand it, all of that work is done prior to its arrival in the clinical set and the trial and all matters pertaining to it, which have been cleared at that stage, are explained in detail, as they ought to be, to the participant. A trial should not change in midstream at any time. If it does, obviously the participant should be fully informed of the change. This is not what Senator FitzGerald has in mind. He is talking about where the trial was finally agreed upon and then brought to the clinical trial where the participants are brought in and you advise them in great detail of what is happening. It stops at that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator FitzGerald's amendment to Amendment No. 13, the Minister accepts the logic of providing for a time limit for an amendment since there is to be a time limit on the permissions consideration. He has agreed to come back with an amendment on Report Stage and incorporate a time limit similar to that for a permission. I thought I was coming to grips with this until Senator Ryan entered the fray and complicated things further. I must confess it is complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not consider that the amendment No. 17 is appropriate. Section 7 (4) (d) requires the ethics committee to have regard to the procedures proposed for compliance with section 8 before they give their approval for a proposed clinical trial. This is because these consent requirements give rise to many considerations of detail. It remains the responsibility of the ethics committee to ensure that the consent of the participant is based on an understanding of the significance of any amendment to the proposal if this is relevant. While the Bill outlines the responsibilities of the ethics committee, it does not purport to be an exhaustive list of the markets it must have regard to. The nature of the ethics committee's responsibility can hardly be in doubt from the context in which it is <Col N="1714" /> referred to in the Bill. Such a detail as requiring the committee to ensure that the information to the participant is updated as necessary is further required.</P>

      <P>The House agreed earlier to sit later than 8 p.m. to make progress on the Bill but it was never envisaged that we would complete Committee Stage tonight. We are making a lot of progress. It was suggested that we should sit for possibly an hour longer than the normal time. If it is agreeable to the House we will do that. The Minister is available. Senator Fallon and other Senators who have an interest agreed and the House agreed. There is no question of trying to complete it. We will try to make as much progress as possible in the amount of time available to us.</P>

      <Col N="1715" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann (a) supports the concept of wider share ownership by workers in their firms and by members of the public generally in productive industry; (b) notes that the Finance Act of 1986 contains provisions promoting profit sharing, share option schemes, the improvements in the Business Expansion Scheme; (c) calls on all Chambers of Commerce, Trade Unions, Employer Organisations, and other economic organs to involve themselves in the establishment of funds to use these tax relief provisions for job creation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;&mdash;(Senator Browne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution on this motion, not indeed because I feel I have anything original to contribute but because it is an important motion in some ways. While it is positive, I do not really think that debating it in this House, spending three hours on it, will do anything with regard to the unemployment problem we have.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to all the contributions, as well as the Minister's speech. The Minister has the capacity to sound as if he is right; it is hard to discount any part of his speech &mdash; it is hard to contradict what he said. Yet at the end of it I felt myself very much like the man in the Gospel who was blind from birth and was cured by Christ. The Pharisees tried to discredit Christ by cross-examining the man who was cured. All the fortunate man could say was: &ldquo;All I know is that whereas I was blind I can see now&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I know about this situation &mdash; I am not an expert by an means on it &mdash; is that it is getting worse all the time. Our unemployment problem is getting worse as the years go by. From that point of view I take with a pinch of salt most of what the Minister, Deputy Bruton said. With regard to some of the words of <Col N="1716" /> congratulations which were said last Wednesday, throwing out compliments is the same as congratulating a surgeon, who failed in a major cancer operation, on an operation for a pimple.</P>
    <P>We have a major cancer of unemployment, and this motion is making a minimal contribution. For that I welcome it. I fail to understand how anybody could go overboard about it. My belief is that we should aim for full employment. I know many people, scribes and others who are an authority or who claim to be an authority on the subject, say that the time of full unemployment is gone. I do not believe that. I believe in the concept of full employment. Perhaps some of the conditions will have to be changed, the hours may be shorter, other areas may be introduced, but I believe we should aim at giving employment to everybody who is fit to work.</P>
    <P>I said in the Minister's presence that I felt the Government should be able to organise a scheme whereby people over 18 years of age who are able to work would get a living wage and for that they would have to work in the various productive areas, whether it be making roads, cleaning drains, building houses, manufacturing, or whatever it is. I went into that in detail before. I do not have to repeat it. Somebody asked me how it could be done. That is a matter for the Government &mdash; that is what the Government are for. In this regard it is necessary to carry out research and I congratulate the Minister on his approach to research. Research is necessary in order to reach that target and for that reason people should be encouraged to make suggestions, not only here in the Houses of Parliament, but outside.</P>
    <P>There should be a section of the Government set aside for this, a section of a Department, or even a single officer who would invite suggestions. It is extraordinary what ordinary people can think of and what suggestions they can make. I use the adjective ordinary in inverted commas. I do not believe there is such a thing as an ordinary person.</P>
    <P>As I said many times in this House, in housing schemes and in various areas <Col N="1717" /> where I was involved I have been saved on many occasions by going to the man working the spade and shovel &mdash; the man who was not supposed to know anything. On many occasions he is the man the scheme depends on &mdash; the man mixing the concrete, the man putting in the foundation. These are the people who should be encouraged to make suggestions. I ask the Minister to consider setting up a section of a Department or an officer to look for suggestions and pay people if necessary for worth while suggestions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern in Ireland about our failure to develop the food industry and other aspects of our material resources. The real problem here is marketing. We have the raw materials. Our fresh food is better than that produced in most other countries.</P>
    <P>What we lack is sufficient investment of money in marketing.</P>
    <P>I think this is an exaggeration. There is no question whatever that there is a problem in this area, but it must be looked at in context. I could cite several instances of small businesses that failed not because of marketing but for other reasons.</P>
    <P>I can refer to one farmer who grew cabbage. One year he had probably the best crop that could be grown. He brought it to the Dublin market and could not sell it because cabbage was available all over the country at that time. There was nothing he could do about that. The next year he grew a crop of peas but they could not be harvested because of the weather. There is another instance in my county of a small businessman who erected a very large glasshouse and grew tomatoes, but he could not sell them because there was a glut at the time.</P>
    <P>I do not think marketing can do anything for that. In the Barleyhill and Ballyhoe areas we have damson trees growing wild. They could be harvested to give employment. They never have been and probably never will be. The lake of Ballyhoe is a great tourist attraction and <Col N="1718" /> is in an important fishing area, but marketing has done nothing for this beautiful area. Though I agree that marketing is necessary, to blame everything on marketing is not to understand the problem. If somebody looks at it and does not understand the real problem, I fail to understand how it can be cured. It is not marketing in every instance. It is sufficient to say that marketing is necessary. Sufficient funds should be devoted to marketing but there is a limit to what marketing in itself can do.</P>
    <P>The Minister said some of our best talent is wasted. This is so on a very large scale. The Minister referred to poverty. Paddy Kavanagh, the poet, wrote about poverty as being a condition of the mind. This may be so for an individual but, if that individual happens to be married and has children, it is different. The Minister went on to say that poverty takes many forms, the most obvious being lack of funds to support an adequate living standard. A more pervasive and equally damaging form of poverty is the sense of non-involvement in society. Those who are unemployed, sick or housebound suffer not only some material deprivation but an even greater sense of being cut off from the mainstream of society. I am in full agreement with the Minister, and yet we have conditions in Ireland in which the unemployed are better off than the employed.</P>
    <P>Some people have opted for unemployment. A very close friend of mine in Meath had two young boys working in a factory which went on a three day week and those who were in that factory were better off by about £12 a week than those who worked in an adjoining factory for a full week. The result was that those other workers tried to get on a three day week in their factory. Those two boys have gone to America and on the day those two boys left him the father called to me, a very desolate man. The father is now going to America. He gave 55 years of his life to this country and now he has to go to America.</P>
    <P>I could go in great detail into the tragedy of the 100,000 people who have emigrated. One good thing about emigration <Col N="1719" /> is that people who go are better off then they were in the past. They have education at least. This is an area where much could be done. Recently when arrangements were being made to increase the numbers of those allowed into America from Ireland the Government did nothing. That was a disgrace. They had an opportunity to make representations to see that the number allocated would be increased. I would like to develop that subject. If the Government tried and failed the people would have appreciated it. The Government did nothing and they should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>There are many more areas I wanted to go into; I thought I would get more into my time than I did. With regard to planned profit sharing this is an area that would take much longer than 15 minutes to develop. There is a very useful book by John I. Fitzpatrick called <i>Planned Sharing, Practical Profit Sharing</i> which, unfortunately, I was not able to lay my hands on. I got a review of it in a periodical. It is unfortunate when we look for some books in the Library here that most of them came from Trinity College, Dublin. I want to pay a tribute to Trinity College, Dublin, for this wonderful facility but, unfortunately, it takes some time to get a volume. I do not understand why those books are not available in the National Library. I know they may be available to Members who can go there, but I think something should be done to make those books available at shorter notice. I say that while paying tribute to Trinity College. We would have to agree to the motion, but in reality it does nothing for the problems we have. Time should have been spent discussing something of a more positive nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Browne. A valid criticism of the motion is that it is seeking to cover too wide a ground. There is too much in the motion for any Member to develop sensibly and coherently during the course of a 15-minute contribution. I noticed that in particular during the contribution of Senator Fitzsimons in the <Col N="1720" /> past 15 minutes. He usually develops his views in considerable detail and could obviously only touch on a small portion of what he felt it was necessary to say. For the same reason I will only touch on the matters that I think have not been given sufficient consideration by the House.</P>
      <P>First, it would be well if the Members who read the motion had read it carefully because there are quite a number of things covered by the motion. There is the concept of wider share ownership by people in their own firms and by members of the public generally, two separate and distinct things. While the ground work has been laid for wider share ownership by workers in their own firms I hope to deal with the fact that members of the public generally are being denied any opportunity to increase the variety of shares which are available to them as members of the investing public.</P>
      <P>The motion goes on to deal with the various beneficial aspects of the Finance Act, 1986, in dealing with the business expansion scheme, various share option and profit sharing schemes encouraged by that Act. Last, it calls on the various economic partners and economic organs to involve themselves in the establishment of funds to help to create jobs. Probably two of those five concepts are somewhat controversial. They are the methods by which the members of the public generally can be given an opportunity to expand the share ownership, and the call on trade unions, chambers of commerce, employers, etc. actually to get involved in job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will leave those two to the end and deal with the others first. I could not deny that the concept of encouraging people, by the establishment of tax and other regimes, to own shares in the firms in which they work should be encouraged. The 1986 Finance Act contains provisions which, even though there are one or two problems with their implementation, problems which we can consider during the course of the next Finance Bill in this House, nevertheless are a positive development. People should be encouraged to take up share option schemes <Col N="1721" /> that are available, and companies that have no such schemes should create schemes for the purpose of ensuring that people working in the firms can acquire a stake in the firms in which they work. That stake would add to their commitment to that firm's prosperity. The prosperity of such firms would add to the general prosperity.</P>
    <P>I referred in the House in an earlier debate to the business expansion scheme. This is a scheme, Members will be aware, whereby a sum up to £25,000 per annum can be invested by an individual, effectively tax free on an annual basis, to ensure the expansion of manufacturing and similar type business activities. This can be done in such a way as to provide new facilities or, indeed, to preserve existing manufacturing jobs. This scheme should be promoted, but a very serious problem has come to light in this business expansion scheme. It is not actually in the technical operation of the scheme which has been widely discussed and the problems associated with it teased out. It was greatly improved by changes in the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>The problem is that many of the people who have surplus money on a year by year basis to invest are very fully committed as regards time. The two things, with regard to the business expansion scheme, which you need in order to make a sensible investment are time and expertise to consider an individual investment. Quite frankly, the various funds established have not adequately met the problems of the professional person who does not have the time to investigate a business himself or herself and is afraid to invest £25,000 or any portion thereof because of lack of confidence in the investigative procedure and in the venture in which the proposed investment is to be put.</P>
    <P>Some method whereby a greater number of these funds can be investigated will be an important part of establishing the success of this business expansion scheme. I recommend that a substantial number of these additional funds should be encouraged and that the rules with regard to the timing of the investment in these funds should be relaxed to encourage <Col N="1722" /> people to establish the funds and to make a prudent investment in schemes over a period. Unfortunately, it must be recognised that no matter how you draw the rules with regard to these funds, these investment groups, there will be a residual group of people who will not feel like taking the risk associated with investing in what very often are new and high risk investments. There is a market for those people with spare money. There is a market for investment in shares in a more traditional sense. I will deal with that problem later on.</P>
    <P>No matter how we deal with the business expansion scheme I feel that there will be a residual problem because a substantial number of people will wish to invest in a more traditional way in shares.</P>
    <P>One area I think is more controversial in this motion is the proposal that the chambers of commerce, trade unions and employer organisations should establish funds to use the relief provisions for job creation to which I have already referred. Trade unions do not exist to create new jobs &mdash; that is not their purpose. Neither do chambers of commerce or employer organisations have that as their objectives. It would be a contribution towards the development of this concept if some trade unions, obviously the larger ones, or their umbrella organisations, whether they be the Congress of Trade Unions, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions or the Cork Council of Trade Unions would get involved, possibly in association with the chambers of commerce, in ventures which would increase the number of manufacturing jobs available in the community. Many of these larger organisations, like the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have been referring to expertise with which to assess the projects, the financial expertise and the time, which as I pointed out earlier, is an essential prerequisite for a sensible investment, should get involved. I recommend that should be done because that kind of investment is likely in the long run to bring about the social consensus which is an important part of the enhanced quality of life to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I <Col N="1723" /> should like to refer, that is, that portion of the motion which deals with the spreading of the concept of wider share ownership by members of the public generally. That is quite separate from the concept which is also dealt with of workers owning shares in their own firms. This motion goes a little bit further than that, and is a little controversial. It says that it seeks support for the concept of wider share ownership by members of the public generally. It is true to say that wider share ownership by members of the public generally is a policy which has gone into reverse over the past 20 years. The number of individual people owning shares in public quoted companies has decreased over the past 20 years. Certainly, the number of vehicles available to members of the general public has decreased substantially.</P>
    <P>In that regard the change in the rules of the Stock Exchange and the opening of the various second and third level systems of investments are to be welcomed as examples where members of the public generally can be encouraged to get involved in share ownership. We should not necessarily stop there but should look at the experiments that have taken place &mdash; I deliberately used the words &ldquo;experiments that have taken place&rdquo;&mdash; across the water with regard to wider share ownership and what lessons these wider share ownerships might have for us.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of many of the policies pursued by the Government of the United Kingdom in the course of the past six or seven years. That Government have taken economic decisions, including the decision not to go into the EMS, which have had very adverse consequences for this economy. That does not mean everything that Government have done is contrary to our best interests or, indeed, has been incorrect in some other way. I invite Members of this House to give some consideration to whether or not the concept of wider share ownership by members of the public generally is served by the type of developments which we have seen across the water with the <Col N="1724" /> expansion of the number of shareholders in companies like British Telecom and British Gas. Is there a lesson there for us? Leaving aside the individual companies, has that moved money from the nonproductive sector into the productive sector of the economy and, if so is it something which we should look at?</P>
    <P>The overwhelming evidence is that it is taking money in the initial stages from people who have a few thousand pounds or a few tens of thousands of pounds to invest and who do not feel confident enough to invest without additional professional advice. These people have been encouraged and have responded by investing in what were formerly companies owned by the Government. We should give serious consideration to the assets, if any, which we have which could be examined to see whether the time has come when in exchange for cash, ownership of those assets could be shared within the community at large. I am willing to discuss it in the context of there being provisions to ensure that a small number of people do not get control, and the various controls which many of us would like to see in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is an important lesson to be learned and considered by the general public and by the politicians. If we believe in the concept of wider share ownership by members of the public generally, serious consideration should be given to which of our assets can be used for the achievement of this policy objective. I welcome the motion and recognise that people might differ on its interpretation, but it was deliberately framed to ensure that a productive discussion could take place without hindering Members in the various approaches which they have to problems of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion although I find it a little bit detailed and complex for three hours of the Seanad's time. The areas with which the motion deals tell us something about the Government's philosophy, the Government's intentions and tells us in particular about some of the beliefs of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> While I welcome the concept behind this motion I think it does not go far enough. I welcome in particular the symbolism in that the Minister for Finance. Deputy Bruton, is a beacon of private enterprise in a Cabinet dominated by people who are quite happy to spend the State's money in any way that appears suitable to them at the time. In that sense I will be interested to hear what Senator Higgins says in reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In that it is a symbolic motion supporting private enterprise members of the Cabinet I will be supporting it this evening. To some extent it counters the difficulties and the absurdities of the National Development Corporation which the Labour Party pushed through the Cabinet. I also welcome it because that was possibly the biggest white elephant in the history of the State. I was sorry to see the Minister introducing it in this House because it was patently obvious that he did not believe in it himself.</P>
      <P>The measures referred to in this motion are a welcome commitment and a declaration of intent, but that is as much as they are. I believe they are limited, restricted and all they do is point us sentimentally in a particular direction.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with a point touched on by Senator O'Leary when he was talking about the benefits of wider share ownership and said that in the past 20 years shares in public companies have fallen into the hands of fewer and fewer people. That is the case in a very strict form, but where does he think the money from people's pension funds goes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually every pension fund in the country would be invested in those blue chip shares like Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Cement Roadstone, Carrolls and Waterford Glass. All those places would contain your pension money. Senator Higgins' pension money and everybody's pension money. There is a wider share ownership under the guise of <Col N="1726" /> pension fund money and Merchant Bank money.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme which was greeted and paraded as an enormous breakthrough in new investment for manufacturing industry has not been a great success in that sense because it is too restricted in its form. It is restricted purely to manufacturing industry. It is copied from the United Kingdom Act and it is not applicable in this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should sit down with those various components of Irish industry and trade unions to try to thresh out a better way to develop the business expansion scheme. It is a good idea, but in its workings it is very restricted. Indeed, the first thing that should happen in the business expansion scheme is that a market in the shares should develop, because the primary difficulty for those investing in a company under this scheme is that they are not allowed to deal in the shares in which they are invested. There is nothing wrong in withholding these shares for five years; nobody complains about that. They ought to be allowed to switch from one company to another in which they are invested which qualifies under this scheme. That would attract a great deal more money into this scheme which, in its embryo stage, is an extremely good idea.</P>
    <P>All the business expansion scheme has done, except in a few limited cases recently, is to provide big fees for accountants and lawyers. The real problem about getting investment into productive industry, which is what this motion is about, is the disincentives which exist on the taxation side. I believe that 60 per cent capital gains tax is the greatest disincentive to investment in capital industry which exists in Ireland. I deal with it day in, day out and I have people saying: &ldquo;My God, I have to pay 60 per cent on this. I am not going to bother. I will go and put my money in the post office or in Government stock.&rdquo; They do not bother to buy shares in Cement Roadstone. If they make a profit, they will have to pay 60 per cent. As a result, they do not invest in Irish industry and Irish industry suffers. This <Col N="1727" /> makes it difficult for Irish industry to expand. I see it day in, day out; it is a disincentive. We may not like it, but it is. We are not talking about large sums of money being made. We are talking about small sums of money being made.</P>
    <P>The other real disincentive is that so much money is diverted into Government stocks. This could be dealt with by cuts in public expenditure. The reason so much money goes into Government stock is that the Government need the money. If the Government get that money by offering a rate which is attractive to investors and which is more attractive than investing it in Irish industry and employment giving industry, and if there were cuts in public expenditure, that money would be released and would have to find a home. One of those homes would undoubtedly be Irish industry in its various forms. The Government and the Minister realise that. The Labour Party, unfortunately, are actually increasing unemployment by their insistence on increases in public expenditure. The money which goes into this public expenditure could easily be diverted into giving more employment in productive industry. I am sorry to have to say that.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Government should consider in order to release funds for more productive industry and for employment is privatisation of institutions like CIE and other semi-State institutions. Competition, with profit-sharing for employees if necessary, would provide a stimulus for the economy which would provide more employment and release those funds which we need to provide employment elsewhere. State companies at present are far too inefficient. This would thin them down and release money for the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy R. Bruton to the House in his new capacity as Minister of State. Indeed I thank him for responding in part to a resolution proposed by my own party in relation to credits some time ago. I think there have been significant advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found the previous speaker's remarks <Col N="1728" /> interesting, but they are not &mdash; I am afraid he will be disappointed &mdash; the full content of what I have to say. Nobody in this House understands more than Senator Ross and, indeed, presides more over the regular transfer of money into speculative purposes rather than productive purposes in the Irish economy. The history of Irish investment is one of avoiding productive abuses and, indeed, of manipulating stock exchange transfers for quite immoral gains. Let us leave it to the words of a distinguished former Member of this House, Senator Dr. T. K. Whitaker who in the seventies expressed as one of the most serious concerns facing the Irish economy what was taking place in the Irish stock exchange at the time, the rise of a new form of wealth which had nothing to do whatsoever in relation to added value in the classical sense in economics but was really based on the glorified form of gambling which stockbroking is at its worst.</P>
    <P>On the motion, I support the idea that the different investment incentives should be made more efficient. We would all like to see a response to the Finance Act, 1986, where it offers business expansion possibilities. We would all like to see different State institutions and groups of individuals deciding to take risks, but I am afraid when you read the motion carefully it tells a very sad story. Despite the most generous incentives in the world &mdash; there used to be some south east Asian incentives which were better &mdash; we cannot get people to take risks in Ireland. I have sympathy for some of these people because it involves dealing with a credit system, modelled entirely on the British credit system, which is not risk taking in orientation, requires far too high a degree of collateral and also has an investment time span which is relatively short. There is very little orientation towards investment in technology. All of these are very serious impairments towards the borrowing which in turn might lead to investment in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In the brief time available to me I want to point to a number of very fundamental contradictions. Comments which I think drew disgrace upon us in recent years <Col N="1729" /> were those offered on the company directives that came from the European Communities. I am referring specifically to the Fourth Company Law Directive commented upon in the proceedings of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. We singularly excepted ourselves from even taking seriously the suggestions about workers sharing in information in their own firms. For example, Report No. 20, from the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Fifth Company Law Directive published on 3 September 1985 paragraph 16 states:</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry and the Federated Union of Employers have both expressed to the Joint Committee their opposition to the proposals relating to employee participation.</P>
    <P>I add in my comment here. This was the idea of keeping out of the boardroom employees other than those in the elected semi-State sector where there were worker directors, but more than that, keeping them away from information that affected their daily lives. This was an outrageous, antiquated 19th century idea. I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>The Confederation believes that there is a basic misconception in seeing a board of directors as a supervisory body rather than a body with responsibility for strategic policy initiation as well as control. In its view even if a representative body had no power of veto it would have the capacity for causing undesirable delays and unless the shareholders retained the right to dismiss directors an inappropriate vote structure would be the result. It went on to say in section 18:</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has also expressed its opposition. The Department believes that the legislative imposition of rigid worker participation structures would discourage investment from abroad and stifle investment at home. It considers that if EEC companies <Col N="1730" /> were subject to restrictions from which their competitors were free their competitiveness would be affected. The present unemployment problem might well be exacerbated if companies were tempted to reduce staff to avoid the application of the worker participation provisions, or to break up or re-structure groups towards that end.</P>
    <P>What we are left with in that report is an extraordinary view. It had been decided upon at European level that there should be a move towards the sharing of information. I think it had its origins in a political basis that the rights of democracy extended beyond the political franchise into the economic realm and that, following decades of debate about industrial democracy, many would regard it as a basic right that they understood what their company was doing. The attitude of the representative voices &mdash; I am afraid in a far less strident way than the previous speaker &mdash; was that they did not want to have information as a matter of right being made available to their workers. It was one of the blackest most disastrous days when these submissions were made. It reflected a view of ownership and a view of control in Irish industry that was more reflective of the 19th century than of any developments that have taken place in the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I offer this as the context in which I have to try to evaluate this motion because, when the debate took place on similar directives in the British House of Commons, other kinds of remarks were made &mdash; Britain was going to be restructured on the basis of a property owning democracy. I laughed at that notion when I read it first because the idea was that, let us say, a postmistress in Inverness owns 20 shares in ICI and, of course, the managing director as part of his emoluments gets an allocation of equity. Before the managing director takes a policy decision he will want to hear the view from Inverness in relation to an acquisition or closure policy by Imperial Chemicals. It is a totally absurd notion built entirely on a kind of tokenism, I am sorry to say the idea being that it was good to own a share and so on. I agree it <Col N="1731" /> is good to own a share but what is the value of it unless it is translated into control?</P>
    <P>We have considerable literature on this issue and I am pleased to be able to tell the House that what I have to say is entirely drawn on that empirical literature. In shareholding individuals participate in an indirect sense. Indeed, Senator Ross's view was rather like the Catholic school managers' view of how they represent at two removes Catholic parents. The idea that the pension funds, in so far as they involve the pensions of everybody who contributed a pension are all in an indirect way participating in some investment decision is the most curious kind of casuistry that I have seen other than in the theological realm I have referred to.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that where shares have been allocated they have been allocated almost entirely to people in the middle and upper ranges of income. They have often been allocated right at the top in order to substitute for certain kinds of increments in income which would be taxable. There is no evidence of the disbursement of shares down through the ranks of workers and they, in turn, being effected into some kind of information control, access decision making, and so on.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 21 of report No. 20 on the Fifth Company Law Directive has a definite view on this. It states:</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry has expressed the opinion that &ldquo;the unitary board structure containing representatives elected by shareholders and employees would tend to promote conflict rather than consensus in the board room&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Bruton, the Minister in Cabinet, has a different view from the Confederation of Irish Industry in this regard. The fact of the matter is that in sticking to this motion there is a danger of mythology being built around the notion of share dispersal.</P>
    <P>Let us stick to the facts. The facts are that those who control significant blocks <Col N="1732" /> of shares and who are closer to significant management decisions are the people who affect the policy of companies rather than the dispersed smaller shareholders across the entire economy. Put more clearly and sticking to my example from ICI, which is perhaps unfair, is it not more reasonable to expect in relation to a policy initiation that the chief executive would be more in consultation with a significant larger shareholder who might be represented on the board than with any individual small shareholder or any group of small shareholders? The whole philosophy of this is built around an interesting notion. It is reflected in the Minister's opening speech. There are no more class differences. We are all going to achieve an equality through gradually owning more shares. The assumption is, of course, that shares are being shed by those in whose ownership they are concentrated already. This is something that manifestly is not occurring.</P>
    <P>The next part of this notion is that, if this is the case, we have replaced what he regards as conflict by a new kind of consensus. It is a form of neo-corporatism. All of us have an interest together in the firm doing better. I like the ethical approach of that to a point, but the evidence is not in its favour. I was quite shocked to find that the Department referred to in the discussion on the Fifth Directive offered a political opinion. In fact, I encouraged them for it because I had long suspected that they had a political opinion. It is an ideological opinion of great force and I loved the honesty with which it was stated. The Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism have expressed their opposition. It is not an opinion, not a comment; they have expressed their opposition to the Fifth Company Law Directive.</P>
    <P>Turning again to this motion we have some evidence from this country as to what would happen. I do not want to take from the well meaning intentions of this motion but only last week I was dealing with an interesting situation. Forty five workers are due to be made redundant in a factory in the city in which I live. <Col N="1733" /> They know not by whom that decision was taken. It could have been the board of the company, Irish Medical Industries in Dublin, or it could have been the larger parent company ICI. They do not know. They spent six weeks trying to find out why the decision was taken. They have been totally precluded from any information.</P>
    <P>In an atmosphere where we are throwing people out of work, where more and more the economy is a world economy and where large trans-national corporations are not located within the boundaries of the State, how can you say you are going to transform society on a share ownership basis? There is a touch of Victoriana about it. Maybe there are people who want to do this but I could bring the point to the absurd and ask: what about a company that is going to close down and what do you do with your share when the company has closed? Do you invest your redundancy money once again in Irish industry and hope for resilience?</P>
    <P>I worry about the Minister's contribution to this debate. He spoke about manufacturing in services. I fear what is true in relation to services. This word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is a disguised word and it includes a spectrum ranging from people who turn over hamburgers on a spit to people who take decisions on the movement of capital with means that are electronic. What is meant by the services term? I worry about these kind of phrases. While I support the intentions of the movers of this motion to make all of these instruments effective so that productive investment will take place and jobs will be created, overall it is a deflection from the unemployment problem and from the investment crisis that exists.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer to the silly remarks made in relation to the State sector and particularly in relation to the National Development Corporation. I will ask questions I have often raised in this House and in the other House when I was a Member. What is the record of the private sector in research and development? What is the <Col N="1734" /> record of the State sector in research and development? What is the record of the private sector in technology innovation and what is the record of the State sector? I am getting bleary eyed from reading Confederation of Irish Industry submissions prior to budgets and at other times. They have the usual pathetic listing. After months of gestation they can only come up with fixing their little greedy eyes on bits of what has been established by State employees, State investment, State research and State commitment. Would it not be nice to have a bit of Aer Lingus, Bord Gáis and Guinness Peat? Where is the innovation in that? Where are all those people who are bursting for the climate to change so that they can blossom as full blown entrepreneurs and investors in the Irish, European or international sense?</P>

      <P>Thank you. I like the ethical motivation that the movers of the motion had in putting it forward. Senator Ross blew their cover by suggesting that you could go past the resolution, make the case for privatisation, and speak about getting bits of the State sector.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude with one sentence which I would like to place on record because it was mentioned in relation to British Telecom. We know who invested in British Telecom. It was not the individual worker with no chance of investment up to then. There was a rush to invest and it was decided on a lottery basis. The people who invested were those who were moving from gold, silver and other kinds of hoarding wealth, into what they now felt was a bit of the State. They felt they had got this through the courtesy of a Prime Minister with views that are prior to the flood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an attempt to encourage people to get involved in the area of job creation. It is an attempt all of us should welcome. We have a crisis in the area of job creation in Ireland. Many of our highly educated young <Col N="1735" /> people are leaving the country and many more are without jobs and with no prospects of getting jobs. There are many agencies working in this direction but, unfortunately, the results do not seem to be coming. For example whilst the IDA create jobs, as fast as they do so they are being lost in other areas where they were formerly created. It is vital that conditions for job creation in terms of incentives and general cost environment should be better than those offered in other countries.</P>
      <P>The major concern must be that if we wish to prevent unemployment rising we have to encourage investment from whatever source we can get it and as much productive investment as possible. This is the only way to ensure that the output from the productive sector is increased sufficiently to generate more jobs and more income. Given the difficulty we are experiencing in stimulating investment in industry, it is time we opened up the conditions for grant-aiding such investment. Given the seriousness of the problem, the role of the IDA should be expanded to allow for the form of development to which I referred.</P>
      <P>The motion before us asks us to note that the Finance Act, 1986, contains provisions promoting profit sharing, share option schemes and improvements in the business expansion scheme. This is highly praiseworthy and we should all support it. The motion is totally acceptable and we should all strive for its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disincentive for investment, lack of confidence and the £1.6 billion of capital outflow, all of which affect confidence in job creation, have been mentioned in the debate. There is, however, another important aspect of this which I will touch on &mdash; the distrust which exists between management and workers in Ireland. This is an impediment to the implementation of the motion, particularly in relation to the share option concept. This distrust is based on a number of bad experiences suffered by both parties. The worker sees himself as abused and oppressed by a system run and owned by <Col N="1736" /> management. Management, on the other hand, see the worker as having no genuine interest in the business. He is seen only as maximising his wages and taking no risk.</P>
    <P>In reality neither of these perceptions is correct because the vast majority of workers and management have exactly the same goals for the well-being of their company. Individual and isolated abuses on both sides have created a basic distrust which makes each party sceptical of one another. This can be solved only by educating both sides. Management must be more forthcoming with company information, which future legislation on disclosure should bring about. Workers must feel they are part of the organisation and be willing to take risks. Trade union officials have added to the problem, for example, by driving a wedge between management and workers which has not been helpful. If this distrust barrier could be broken down and management provided the information I referred to &mdash; where profit and all aspects of management were made known to the workers &mdash; the worker would respond and share in the risk. The whole economy would benefit from this. The system of all parties working together in common cause would be of benefit to all.</P>
    <P>In the motion, we are referring specifically to the Finance Bill, 1986. A major pitfall of that legislation is that it is pitched far above the average man's head. I presume that, of necessity, a Finance Act must be a technical document but the various individual sections and parts of the Act should be explained more clearly.</P>
    <P>The motion refers specifically to the share option concept. I should like to ask the Minister of State what attempt has been made to market this share option concept since the Act was brought in? At present the average working man with a small amount of disposable funds has absolutely no incentive to invest in his company. He knows better than anyone that he can earn three times the present rate of inflation in a bank or building society deposit in what is a straight and very simple transaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> Share ownership, as defined in the share option in the Finance Act, 1986, is seen as a complicated area for him, a risky business and one which he would prefer not to get involved in when he has the option of the simple transaction with the bank. This should be overcome if only because of the fact that our history dating back to the Land League of the last century shows it is a peculiarity of the Irish race to have home ownership and asset ownership and so on. They should be more involved in this kind of share option concept. Given that this concept is right, there is most certainly a place for all parties and organisations to educate themselves and the people they represent on the benefits and incentives available. These benefits and incentives should be available to all equally. If this were done, the people would all be beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The share option concept has not been marketed sufficiently. Until that is done, it will remain a section of the Finance Act, no more and no less. Until it is stressed time and time again, and encouraged at every opportunity by the Government, chambers of commerce and all the other groups referred to in the motion, it will remain a non-event. That would be a pity because it has obvious advantages for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. It has my party's total support. While the concept is there and is beautiful, other things could be done by the Government to make these aspirations in the motion part and parcel of the overall commercial life of the country.</P>

      <P>To say something in three minutes is going to be very difficult. I support the concept of share ownership. It will be very difficult to bring it about. It seems that clause (c) is the important clause because it is the implementation clause of (a) and (b). The aim set out in clauses (a) and (b) cannot be implemented unless clause (c) is put into operation. It is aimed at job creation. Therefore as labour people, as trade unionists, as people who are well informed about justice, we must back and support any concept of job creation. We live in a mixed economy which means we dare not reject any ideas from the private entrepreneur because of ideological hang-ups we may have from time to time.</P>
      <P>I praise the Minister for his emphasis on the small business concept and less dependence on foreign capitalists. A substantial exploitation of indigenous materials behoves us to have a strong industrial base based on ourselves &mdash; a kind of Sinn Féin policy. I support that. I also support wider share ownership. The Minister thinks that having workers owning part of the business in which they are employed might improve industrial relations. I hope he is right.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations. We require improvements in industrial relations. I am speaking as a trade unionist of 30 years standing North and South. By using phrases such as &ldquo;worker participation&rdquo;, &ldquo;worker directors&rdquo; and &ldquo;worker involvement&rdquo; we are touching upon industrial democracy without knowing clearly in our minds what we mean. I will try to tell Senators what I mean by it. Worker involvement and worker participation mean that at the point of production and at the point of distribution, the worker has a say in decisions, not necessarily his union official or his trade union. When he takes part in the decision making process he will feel he is enjoying industrial democracy. If that is absent, all the shares in the world do not count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He should feel part of the game in which he is involved, either in the State or private enterprise. That is what involvement means to me. If the worker <Col N="1739" /> on the factory floor, in the field or at the dock side is not involved then the experiment in worker ownership will fail. Someone said that lack of access to information, lack of knowledge on accountancy marketing and research, and closed minds on the part of management have caused more industrial problems than the closed shop. The man who thought that one up was right. If the workers are not aware of what is going on in a company, how can they be expected to become involved without full decision making knowledge and professionalism laid on for them? That is what I mean by improvement in industrial relations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch de na Seanadóirí ar fad a labhair anseo agus freisin seachtain ó shin, agus tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil siad i bhfábhar an rúin.</P>
      <P>I am very glad so many people have taken such a positive line on this motion and have been so complimentary to the Minister who, in his own way, has given such a dramatic lead on the whole question of workers being involved. Senator McGonagle said they should be involved in a very serious way, not just in a paper way having shares or some such thing. The Minister's views are well known. I would be justified in reading from the first paragraph of the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>I am a strong believer in the merits of promoting such ownership as a means of generating more investment and more employment. This will ultimately create a situation in which everybody owns a stake in the wealth-creating sector of the economy. I see this not so much as a desirable option but rather as a necessity, if we are to achieve the scale of growth in the economy that we need in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people found fault with the actual practicalities of this. In the long run once a Minister has the right idea there is hope that things will happen. We have heard a great deal about unemployment and the importance of employment. That is very true. The Minister said that creating new <Col N="1740" /> jobs in the public sector is no solution; We need self-sustaining jobs. This is not a choice but a necessity. Further on he talked about marketing which we always hear has fallen down slightly: we can produce the goods but we are not marketing them. He said that not enough money was invested in marketing. He highlighted the problems and the concept of research and development which are a major part of what should be going on in the country. If we have research and development and marketing there is hope that this awful unemployment problem will go. If we have research and development we have some hope that we will have new products. This is what is happening in Europe at present. The Minister outlined the importance of developing new products. Whether it is butter being maintained at the same percentage of milk production now as when we joined the EC, whatever it is we have to change. That is very important. He outlined the growth in some of these schemes and the business expansion scheme which started off with an investment of £1.53 million in 1984-85. This year it is heading for an investment of £15 million. Senator Fallon said there was not enough publicity. These things are slow; they cannot happen overnight. That is a dramatic growth.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight what the Minister said when he talked about the idea of two sides which has come through from many other speakers. You cannot have two sides in industry, a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude where workers are on one side and the management on the other. The Minister said: &ldquo;The idea of two &lsquo;sides' in industry is a time wasting phenomenon. If workers were share owners as well as providers of labour, both management and unions would be on the same side.&rdquo; We all mentioned in the earlier part of our speeches the importance of workers having a sense of belonging and a sense of pride. Senator Conway mentioned that in his working experience in the early sixties there was a great sense of confidence and joy working in a firm that was going well. These are the things we hope will happen to some extent right throughout industry <Col N="1741" /> and workers will feel part and parcel of a very important group producing goods and selling them and making a profit. The Minister reminded us that the share option schemes went from £1.8 million in 1983-84 to £8.2 million in 1985-86. That is a very encouraging sign of what is happening in these schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery in a very positive contribution outlined the good in the schemes and welcomed them. He had some criticism of things like the disincentive of the DIRT. The Minister replied on the spot that he did not agree. This is one area where there are two very different views. One is that the deposit interest retention tax has ruined the country. The Minister said the Government got £5 million more than they had expected which was proof that all this money had not left the banks. Senator Hillery emphasised the need for profits to enable people to invest in companies. That is a very sensible idea. There is no point in dreaming that people will invest in companies which will lose money and perhaps they themselves will lose their investment as well. His speech was a very positive one. He mentioned the question of costs.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway was very positive. He talked about encouraging risk-taking and highlighted the fact that Henry Ford was a one man band who created an empire. He mentioned the impact on business of faceless revenue officers and any politician will know what he was talking about. Many companies experience pressure if they have fallen behind. He was very complimentary to the Minister on his whole attitude.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald outlined the decline of industry in Laois. Since 1924 the numbers in employment have gone down. In Offaly he took a trip around the industrial sites with the Minister and found a very happy workforce there. He should change his abode and switch from Laois to Offaly.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons gave us a quotation from the Gospel. &ldquo;Godspell&rdquo; means good news. Senator M. Higgins linked Senator Ross with the bishops. We had a funny combination of industry and <Col N="1742" /> religion. Senator Fitzsimons was concerned about the worsening unemployment problem. Senator O'Leary felt that the motion was too wide and that it was not possible to deal with it in the time available to him. The whole idea of owning shares was quite laudable as far as he was concerned. He felt the business expansion scheme was difficult in that people did not have time to weigh up the merits of where they were going to invest their money. He suggested it was easier to invest in blue chip shares than in something that might be a risk. He was concerned that individual trade unions would not be able to deal with the problem and that an umbrella group of trade unions or the employer organisations might be able to step in and give advice. He questioned the whole idea of share ownership in factories and suggested we should expand it to the stage where we would have it in semi-State companies. That is something new.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was very much in favour of the motion. He felt that the expansion scheme was too restrictive. On the other hand, from the figures I have given, this year we expect £15 million to be invested so perhaps that criticism is not valid. The Senator also raised the question of the disincentive of a 60 per cent capital gains tax. The Minister dealt with that. He said:</P>
    <P>... the reduction in the rates of capital gains tax to a flat 30 per cent for shares disposed of on the smaller companies market of the Irish Stock Exchange will have a two-fold benefit. It will encourage companies to come to that market and at the same time increase after-tax returns for shareholders realising gains. The capital gains tax rates for gains on shares acquired under the BES are also being reduced to that rate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this scheme may be the answer to the disincentive Senator Ross was worried about &mdash; that it was 60 per cent and people would not invest their money. People would not invest their money if they had to pay 60 per cent on their capital gains, but if it was 30 per cent it <Col N="1743" /> should be a lot more attractive. He felt that the accountants and the lawyers would gain.</P>
    <P>Senator M. Higgins spoke about the need for incentives. It is not easy to get people to take risks in Ireland. He was very critical of the EC directives being imposed. Workers were not being given information, a view also expressed by Senator McGonagle who said workers were not being accepted. Senator McGonagle said the view of the Confederation of Irish Industry was that it would tend to promote conflict. He cited an example of 55 workers who do not know why they lost their jobs. He worried about critics who want certain things done. I thought he was going to quote &ldquo;Oh, to have a little house&rdquo; when he started off on, &ldquo;Oh to have Bord Gáis&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon spoke about unemployment and the distrust between management and workers which the Minister dealt with. He felt the Finance Act was above the head of the average person and reader and that it was very important that it should be marketed in a big way. Senator McGonagle was very keen that workers would have a real say no matter whether they were producing or at the port getting the goods out. It should not be a pretence that workers had a say but would be in there able to get information and be involved in the actual job.</P>
    <P>Overall it was a very wide-ranging discussion, cordial and positive. I want to thank all the Senators who spoke for being so courteous and helpful.</P>

      <P>I think there were two aspects when we were discussing it earlier. There was support on both sides of the House for the idea of incorporating a time limit where an application was made to amend. I understood the Minister to say that is acceptable and that on Report Stage a time limit will be introduced. That is very welcome. Senator B. Ryan raised in the context of his amendment No. 17 his concern, which I share, for those who are possibly already <Col N="1745" /> involved in a clinical trial which has commenced and which for one reason or another the person who has applied to carry this out wishes to amend, then makes application to amend. Our concern is whether those who are involved or who are enlisted to become involved and who have consented to a clinical trial under certain understood assumptions will be safeguarded in that they will know the nature of the proposed amendment, the consequences for them, the guineapigs, that they will know precisely what the implications will be for them.</P>
      <P>This matter was touched on by the Minister of State but I think it warrants a very clear response from the Minister. Although the Minister will not act upon an application to amend until in the case of a proposed clinical trial the ethics committee for the proposed trial has given its approval in accordance with section 7 (2), our specific concern on that was whether that would clearly require the ethics committee to ensure that the person or body carrying out the clinical trial had returned to anybody either participating or likely to participate in it for a new consent, a consent <i>de novo</i> to the amended nature of the proposed trial. I hope the Minister will be able to clarify some of these points.</P>

What is in the amendment relates to the introduction of something that is not in the Bill. I am talking of the question of a response within three weeks. I am prepared to have the period of three weeks adjusted to some extent. I seemed to gather from the Minister of State earlier that he was <Col N="1746" /> thinking of a period relatively similar to the 12 week period that exists in the original application to the Minister and in turn from the Minister to the National Drugs Advisory Board. When we are dealing with an amendment it must be possible to come up with a decision somewhat shorter than the original period of three months. If one looks at the earlier instance, in the area of planning appeals, the local authority have to respond within a two month period and An Bord Pleanála can go on looking at it <i>ad nauseam.</i> In some instances it goes on for years. In this case there will be an urgency to get ahead with a clinical trial, or a clinician may be waiting to advance something that is of importance in a hospital. It should not be more than half the period at the very most that exists in relation to the original application. Perhaps a period of one month might be suitable.</P>

      <P>I will examine the suggestion made by the Senator. We had in mind having the same time limit as on a permissions consideration, namely, 12 weeks. It is difficult to be precise because one can think of many exigencies which can develop which may require a full 12 weeks of consideration particularly when applications come in over summer periods and so on. One can run easily into July or August and a meeting may not be held until September. I will look at it on Report Stage. If we could reach agreement, I am not hung up on 12 weeks, if we want to bring it back. I do not want to spancel the applicants unduly and, above all, I do not want the application to finish up threatening to go to court in order to get an immediate decision in a very tight framework. I will look at it. I will consult informally before Report Stage.</P>

    <P>Senator Ryan's amendment would very explicitly oblige the Minister of the day to ensure that the consent provisions of section 8 have been complied with before he agrees to an amendment of a provision. However, the ethics committee, not the Minister for Health are given responsibility in section 7 (4) (d) for ensuring that valid consent has been <Col N="1747" /> given. It would be somewhat illogical to make the Minister responsible only for ensuring that consent had regard to the amendment of a proposal. In any event, the detailed considerations involved in assessing the validity of a consent in any individual case are not entirely appropriate to the Minister <i>per se.</i> For that reason I am still of the view that amendment No. 16 is inappropriate. I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>While the Bill outlines the responsibilities of the ethics committee it does not purport to be an exhaustive list of the matters they must have regard to. The nature of the ethics committee's responsibilities, generally speaking, can hardly be in doubt within the framework of this Bill. Such detail as requiring the committee to ensure the information to a participant is updated on an immediate basis can be dealt with administratively rather than within the framework of a full amendment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still somewhat perplexed as to why in the Government amendment subsection (2) (a) refers to section 7 (2) of the Bill only and does not include section 7 (4). If the Minister could explain that to me, I might be a lot more at ease about the whole thing. Section 7 (4) of the Bill refers to a list of the matters to which the ethics committee must have regard &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2).&rdquo; It would make it perfectly clear that an ethics committee was required on each occasion where there was an amendment to a trial proposed, that they had to ensure that the participants in the trial were fully briefed on what was being done, and had once again freely consented to participate. It depends on how you look at this issue, whether you regard what I am talking about as important. You could look as it as an administrative detail suitable for being dealt with by administrative practice if you have the perspective of the clinics and, indeed, perhaps of the State as a large body. If you do consider the type of people who in the past have been <Col N="1748" />&ldquo;subjected&rdquo;&mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; to these trials in the matter of their consent and their capacity to comprehend that consent, the information which was provided to them has been a matter of considerable concern. Perhaps the Minister can explain to me why he does not simply add it on in accordance with section 7 (2) and 7 (4) and make it perfectly clear that the ethics committee are expected to do in the case of an amendment to a clinical trial, that which they are expected to do in the case of the original trial itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general section is reasonably drafted. The important aspect of it is that, before an ethics committee start out on their work in detail, they must consider what is stated in the Bill:...&ldquo;shall each consider the justification for conducting the proposed trial&rdquo;. That is a fundamental precondition. The circumstances under which it is proposed to conduct trials, despite the elaboration in subsection (4), are an all encompassing obligation. The committee, having considered that, shall give their approval to the conducting of the proposed trial. The person who is arranging for the conducting of the proposed trial shall communicate such approval to the Minister in writing. We could elaborate on section 7 (4) but we would go into a great deal of excessive detail, in my view. There are data and criteria laid down. I do not propose to go over them because they are self explanatory in many ways and I would have difficulty in knowing how to elaborate on further criteria. If all the consent criteria had to be gone through first and then reverted back, one would never get the work to be done off the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <P>I am a bit perturbed because I appear to have heard the Minister suggest that perhaps where a clinical trial is to be amended we might not have to get the consent of the participants to the amendment. I have later amendments to section 7 (4). I am not interested in that. I am interested in knowing why <Col N="1749" /> there is not specific reference to subsection (4) in the Minister's amendment. Does he think the reference to subsection (2) obligates the ethics committee to do all the things that are referred to in subsection (4), or is it that he has the view that in certain circumstances they might not have to do all the things that are referred to in subsection (4) for some amendments to trials? Perhaps I misunderstood him. I formed the definite impression that the Minister thought that, under some circumstances, it might not be necessary to inform participants and get their free consent if a trial was to be amended and, if that is the case, I would be extremely unhappy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Senator Ryan there is an important point at issue here. The House should know, in a new section relating to procedure for amendment of an application for clinical trial, whether it is going to be necessary to get the consent of those who are participating in the trial for the amendment. If you look at section 8, it is quite clear that it is intended to provide very considerable safeguards to participants in clinical trials:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be a participant in a clinical trial unless a consent to such participation has been given in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>The person must be capable of comprehending the nature and significance and scope of the consent and the person must know the objectives of the trial, the manner in which the substance or preparation is to be administered etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is to be an amendment of all of that, is the person going to have similar rights? It is as simple as that. Will people have the protection of the safeguards in section 8? We are entitled to know that. We are not entitled to hazard a guess as to what the possible meaning of the section may be. If that is not absolutely clear now, the consequence is that there must be an amendment to bring about the result that a person who is an ongoing participant in a clinical trial or about to be a participant, who has consented to a <Col N="1750" /> clinical trial cannot suddenly find that they consented to process A and suddenly, because there has been an amendment granted, it is not process A that they are undergoing but process A with added complications they knew nothing about. It is absolutely crucial that we clarify this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of there being a material change in the trial I would find it extraordinary that an ethics committee would consider they were discharging their functions if they did not acquaint the participant of the implications of that amendment. That is the fundamental role of an ethics committee.</P>
      <P>There must obviously be a responsibility on the committee to let the participant know the implications of an amendment if the amendment is a change in the conditions of the trial and if it is of such a nature that it automatically affects the prospect of a consent being given or being withheld. I am at a loss to know how one can elaborate further on this section bearing in mind the follow through of section 8 on the role of an ethics committee. I have no preconceptions about the section but I have difficulty in seeing how the particular amendment can be fitted in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite simple. All the Minister needs to do in his own amendment is this &mdash; and I would be quite happy if he would agree to do it on Report Stage. Subsection (2) (a) on page 4 of the list of amendments should read:</P>
      <P>in the case of a proposed clinical trial, the ethics committee for the proposed trial has given its approval to the proposed trial (as so amended) in accordance with section 7(2) and 7(4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would satisfy me. It would then be perfectly clear under subsection (4) (d) of the terms of reference of the ethics committee that the procedures proposed for compliance with section 8 would have to have been investigated. Therefore, we would have what I want carried out. I simply believe that it ought to be made perfectly clear. It should not be a matter for an ethics committee to decide <Col N="1751" /> whether the change is sufficiently large for the individual participating in it to be consulted or informed. That should be a matter for the individual involved. It is not for me to decide whether another person needs to be informed because the change is large or small.</P>

      <P>If I may dispose of it just briefly. I can see the point being made by the Senator. I have some difficulty in inserting an appropriate drafting point. I am quite prepared to examine it on Report Stage. If I can accommodate that development I will willingly do so. There are always the difficulties of how does one assume than an applicant can comprehend the technicalties of a clinical trial. That is a dossier that would have to be presented to him. I have no objection to that being presented to him. I have no objection to the rigours being imposed on the applicant to so oblige it to be done but I have to do that within a legislative framework. I will certainly examine the points being made on Report Stage, that is, the two further amendments, one within 12 weeks or less and the one the Senator has suggested. On that basis I will be prepared to discuss it with the Senator, Senator Robinson and other Senators with a view to accommodating that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Cathaoirleach, through the Leas-Chathaoirleach, for allowing me to raise this matter and also to express my regret that I should have to raise it again so soon, that is, the question of the continued delay by the Government in issuing a circular to general hospitals to ensure that homeless people are not discharged from hospital onto the streets.</P>
      <P>This is, in fact, the third time I have raised this issue in Seanad Éireann. It is interesting that the first time I raised the issue the opening words of the Minister of State were: I wish to refute the suggestion that there is not adequate concern. We have made a lot of progress since then and I hope this will be the last time I have to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>The last time I raised this matter was on 18 June and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, who was here then, endeavoured to explain to me why a circular which the Department agreed to issue on 29 May 1984 had still not been issued. He promised the House that it would be sent out as soon as possible. The number of times I have heard that statement since I came into this House has made me very sceptical about that particular phrase.</P>
      <P>Let us remind ourselves, the record and the House what we are talking about. I am referring to a very well documented practice that some hospitals have of discharging homeless people direct from hospital onto the streets without arrangements being made for their after care. It is worth remembering that homeless people tend to use hospitals more than other categories of people because of the appalling medical consequences of being abandoned by society to live on the streets in overcrowded and usually unhealthy hostels and shelters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering that there could be no greater contrast between the warmth, concern and individual intention, the food, the heating and the care in a hospital and the isolation, cold and <Col N="1754" /> desperation of living on the streets. It is worth remembering also that the point of discharging somebody from a hospital provides a unique opportunity for the caring institutions to provide care for vulnerable and destitute people to ensure that their health and social welfare services, etc. are looked after and to ensure that there is adequate accommodation available for such people.</P>
    <P>In May 1984, the Department accepted that homeless people were being discharged onto the streets, that they were not receiving adequate after care service and that measures should be taken to deal with the situation. They rightly decided to issue a circular instructing all hospitals not to discharge a homeless person unless a 16 point check list was complied with, including such matters as the arrangement of accommodation, clothes, convalescence, letters for the labour exchange, medical condition stabilised, money arrangements and so on. To lay people all this will sound eminently reasonable and I am perfectly sure to both the Minister and the officials of the Department of Health all of this will seem perfectly reasonable. It would be a quite clear basic safety net.</P>
    <P>The promised circular was not issued until April 1985 as Circular 6/85 and it applied only to psychiatric hospitals. In February 1986 the Department of Health renewed their commitment to apply the circular to general hospitals. In June the Minister of State repeated his commitment to issue the circular and discharge list, as I said, as soon as possible. In fact, I was going to make a two word speech tonight, which would be unusual for me. I was simply going to say: &ldquo;Well, Minister?&rdquo; and sit down, but I will not because I think the subject merits a little more reflection than that.</P>
    <P>The facts are that the case for the circular is not in dispute. The need for it is not in contention. The urgent requirement that homeless people should not be discharged onto the streets is accepted, as far as I can see, by most of the bodies involved at national level. So the question is: what has happened to the circular which has been promised now for 30 <Col N="1755" /> months? The question arises: is somebody blocking the issue of the circular? I know it is not the Minister, neither this Minister, nor the Ministers who were here, nor any other Minister I am aware of. I know, too, that it is not anybody among the officials in the Department of Health who, I know, have been more than helpful in this issue. Nor is it the voluntary organisations who have been blocking the issue of the circular. I am fairly satisfied it is not the social workers dealing with homeless people or working in the hospitals who I know have welcomed the principle of the circular as a start towards the provision of comprehensive after care for homeless people. The only conclusion I can draw is that the obstacles and objections to progress must rest either in the senior levels of health board management or in the senior management of the non health board hospitals, the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>One wonders if these are the people responsible for blocking what is accepted by most people to be a necessary reform in this area. It would be particularly and supremely ironic if the caring institutions &mdash; perhaps I should in this context put &ldquo;caring&rdquo; in inverted commas &mdash; are the bodies preventing a service of care from developing. It is difficult to understand how bodies who are in many cases statutorily committed to the care of patients could stand in the way of a system that would provide care.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what possibly could motivate caring institutions to be worried about an obligation to ensure that clothing would be provided for homeless people, that accommodation, proper convalescent services, follow up medical visits, day care, a letter to a GP were available to a homeless person and that community care agencies would be notified. These are the things that should be involved and the circular agreed they would be involved.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that one is forced to the conclusion that it is the caring agencies who are objecting to having an obligation imposed on them to ensure that <Col N="1756" /> these obvious things be done before a homeless person is discharged from a hospital. It is very little to look for, for the poorest of our citizens. It is quite clear that you cannot define hospital care as some sort of abstract, pseudo-scientific thing called medicine. You are talking about people who have all the needs of a human being and not some sort of detached abstract organism which has an illness which is cured and is then dispatched onto the streets to live in isolation from the care with which he or she was provided.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying to the Minister that, if it is these so-called caring agencies who are holding up progress &mdash; and that is the only conclusion I can draw because he or his officials or the voluntary organisations who were to be consulted cannot have held it up &mdash; I hope he will do what he has shown great willingness to do in the past, that is, to remind them of their responsibilities and what their primary function is. It is not to run large organisations or big plants; it is to care for people and, in a particular way, to care for those people who, while least able to demand their services, are most in need of those services. I look forward to the Minister's reply and to an indication that the circular will issue promptly and efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware that this matter was the subject of an adjournment debate on 18 June and, therefore, I will briefly summarise the background to the issue. Following approaches from the Simon Community in which the question of after care facilities for homeless people being discharged from hospital was raised, the Department of Health issued a circular in April 1985 to the health boards and the voluntary hospitals. With regard to the discharge of homeless persons from psychiatric hospitals, a check list was enclosed for completion by the hospitals and notification to the appropriate directors of community care and the medical officers of health to enable the necessary follow-up action to be taken. In relation to acute hospitals a more general circular <Col N="1757" /> issued which did not make any provision for a check list.</P>
      <P>The Simon Community expressed reservations about the circular and in particular about the lack of a check list similar to that applying to psychiatric hospitals. In February 1986 my Department agreed to issue a further circular to general hospitals which would include a check list. In order to ensure that this circular would be as comprehensive as possible, it was decided to consult with the health boards, the voluntary hospitals and other voluntary organisations such as Trust who are involved in the provision of medical and social services to the homeless. The secretary managers of all voluntary hospitals were written to and their views were obtained. In addition, officials from the Department of Health met Trust on 15 August and 30 September 1986. A meeting was convened with the CEOs of the health boards on 23 September 1986 and the proposed circular was discussed in detail.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have emerged from these consultations. For example, the hospitals sought a better definition of the term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;. They pointed out that health board hospitals do not employ social workers, as such. They expressed some concern about the need to safeguard the individual's right to confidentiality. They pointed out the difficulties arising through lack of cover in the community support services, particularly at weekends.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the issue of a circular, no matter how well constructed, will not significantly improve the lot of the sick homeless unless the community support services can respond quickly and flexibly to their needs. The present arrangements could be improved, particularly in relation to assignment of responsibilities and co-ordination between the different disciplines. The Department of Health, therefore, considered how the position on the ground, particularly in the large urban areas, can be improved so that the problems associated with providing services to homeless people can be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department are now directly <Col N="1758" /> involved in this aspect of the work. The objective is to ensure that the provisions of the circular when issued will be seen to be sensible and practicable, having the good will and support of staff in hospitals and in the community, and above all that-they are made to work for all those who are sick and homeless. Therefore, it is likely that the Department will find it necessary to have further detailed discussions with the health boards and the voluntary hospitals, as well as with Trust and the Simon Community, in order to ensure that the circular will have their full commitment. These discussions, I can assure the Senator, will take place within the next month and the circular will issue shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>Though there has been some delay in issuing the revised circular the reasons I have outlined are good. There was a lot of consultation about this and it is the major concern of the officers of the Department of Health to ensure that the provisions of the circular will deal with the problem and that they will work in practice. As Senators know, I am fully committed, and all senior officers in the Department of Health are equally committed, to improving the health services available, particularly for the homeless sick.</P>
    <P>I want to make sure that the procedures will take full account of the practical difficulties. Accordingly, I can assure Senator Ryan that I share his concern in the matter. I want to put on record our admiration for the exceptional work being done by the voluntary organisations in providing care and shelter for homeless people. I know from considerable experience how demanding this work can be. I am confident that the circular will not be consigned to the limbo of some departmental or hospital God-forsaken ledge or some administrator's office. That is not the purpose of this exercise. Senator Ryan rightly asked if the issue of a revised circular will be followed through. I can assure him that it is now receiving attention in the Department of Health to enable us to overcome the difficulties which are evident <Col N="1759" /> and which require our continuous attention.</P>
