      <P>I have notice from Senator Mark Killilea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture to ensure that the vesting of the McHale Estate in County Galway takes place as a matter of extreme urgency as the families of the landowners are unable to complete extra family houses on the estate which are at a very advanced stage structurally.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay by the Department of Health in extending the provision of Circular 6/85, dealing with the discharge of homeless persons from hospital; to cover the discharge of such persons from general hospitals.</P>
      <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Killilea's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Senator Brendan Ryan may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask when <Col N="1453" /> item No. 21 will be taken. This is the fourth year that I mentioned it. I have asked on many occasions on the Order of Business when No. 21 will be taken. There are secret discussions and compromise arrangements are being rushed through here at the last minute. I want to know what the latest information is in relation to that. The Deputy Leader of the House might be able to tell us when it is proposed to take it if it is to be taken before the end of this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no comment to make about the select committee of the Dáil because it is a matter for the Dáil. With reference to Senator Cassidy's question about No. 21, the Leader of the House on numerous occasions has given him the up-to-date position on that legislation. I understand he was to come back to him on whether it will be taken in conjunction with the community radio Bill. I can assure Senator Cassidy that there are no secret negotiations or compromises. There are discussions between the parties in Government. They are proceeding and they are in line with the programme for the Government. When agreement has been reached on the legislative programme I am sure Senator Cassidy will be made aware of it.</P>

      <P>Since this important matter seems to have been decided at the whim of the Labour Party today at their parliamentary party meeting, has any decision been taken as to when this might happen, or would the Deputy Leader of the House care to indicate that it may happen in the near future, or that it may never happen.</P>

      <P>When agreement has been reached between the partners in Government, the Government will make an announcement of their intentions on community radio and then it will be a matter for the Opposition either to support or reject the proposals. We are an integral part of the Government and I take it that the Senator does not want to remove that right from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are similar and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government Amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;have in his possession&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;keep&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment. It arises out of a desire to maintain consistency of wording with section 2 which makes it unlawful to keep a dog without a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill would be better if we amended it by simply providing that a dog licence means a licence entitling a person to keep or have in his possession a dog. The words &ldquo;have in his possession&rdquo; should be retained and should not be deleted as the amendments suggest. I urge the Minister between now and Report Stage to reconsider these amendments and to provide instead &ldquo;to keep or have in his possession.&rdquo; They are two different concepts. Both could be provided for and would make these interpretations better interpretations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have a look at that between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government Amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>In page 4, lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;have in his possession&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;keep&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government Amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 4, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;greyhound&rsquo;includes any whippet and any strain or cross of greyhound or whippet;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This definition is necessary to complement section 10. The wording is exactly the same as that in section 2 of the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965. The term was defined in that Act to complement sections 19 and 20 of that Act which are, of course, now being replaced by section 10 in the current Bill. In other words a whippet is a racing dog like a greyhound but smaller.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I feel that there should be a definition of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. There is a definition of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and that is: &ldquo;premises&rdquo; includes any house or land. There is a specific reference in section 16 which is the section which gives very wide powers to this new type of constable we are to have marauding the countryside, namely, the dog warden. The powers of the dog warden are specified in section 16. His powers are restricted in that they do not operate in certain respects in relation to dwellings. The definition of &ldquo;dwellings&rdquo; should be spelled out very clearly in this Bill. A different definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is given in the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, also. &ldquo;Premises&rdquo; in the Air Pollution Bill, <Col N="1456" /> 1986, is defined as including &ldquo;any messuage, building, structure or land (whether or not there are structures on the land or whether or not the land is covered with water) or any hereditament of any tenure, together with any outbuildings and curtilage.&rdquo; I raise this because we have in the Control of Dogs Bill a very loose definition of &ldquo;premises.&rdquo; Premises includes any house or land but we have a restriction in relation to premises in section 16 by excluding a dwelling. &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo; should be spelled out in the interpretation section to include the curtilage and garden of a dwellinghouse.</P>
      <P>We are giving vast powers to dog wardens. We are establishing in this Bill a new form of police who are to police the landscape for a very particular purpose. We must be clear on the powers we are giving them. Do we want these people to have powers to snoop around one's dwellinghouse, to enter into one's barns and stables, to come into one's yard, to come into one's garden on the basis of statutory power? I do not think they should have that power, even if it is to find dogs which are worrying livestock. For that reason there should be a specific definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in the interpretation section. I also urge on the Minister that that definition should include the curtilage and the garden of a dwellinghouse. I do not think a dog warden should have the total freedom to come right up to one's kitchen window, and to go no further. This should be looked at very very closely between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might draw an analogy: power is conferred in the 1959 fisheries Act and that power is exclusive. It is conferred by section 296 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, the section which gives general powers to authorised persons. Subsection (2) provides: &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorising any authorised person to enter any enclosed garden or any dwellinghouse or the curtilage thereof except where the ordinary road or passage to any weir, dam or dyke is through such garden or curtilage&rdquo;. The same applies in this case. To give exactitude to the <Col N="1457" /> meaning of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; as defined in section 1, there must be a definition of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; because the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is specified in the later section. I urge the Minister to include in the section a precise definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; and to specify that definition along the lines I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>A premises is a premises and includes the land owned by the person. A dwelling is a dwellinghouse. We have had quite a debate on this with our officials and with various people and we decided that &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; means exactly what it says, the dwelling house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to be rather supportive of the Minister in this case because this will be an expensive scheme. In our local authority in Louth we have had this scheme in operation for the past few years. It is true to say we cannot continue indefinitely spending money without seeing some progress. We must achieve progress. I do not like to disagree with my colleague, Senator Durcan, on this point but if you do not give power to these wardens to go almost wherever they like to catch the dog, this is all for nothing. I must confess that I am not a dog lover.</P>
      <P>The reason I am so interested in this legislation is, firstly, that it is overdue and, secondly, it is great legislation from an agricultural point of view. I did not get an opportunity &mdash; through my own fault &mdash; to speak on the Second Stage of the Bill. This is most welcome legislation not only to sheep farmers but also to many other sections of the community. Dogs are roaming all over the countryside. They are a danger to man and beast. The country is polluted with dogs. No matter how harsh the measures the Minister is going to take, he can be assured of my wholehearted support on every section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the power the Minister is giving to these dog wardens, I have watched the scheme in operation. In fact, I was mainly responsible for getting the <Col N="1458" /> scheme introduced in my own local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Durcan talks about the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; which is on page 5, line 21. The word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is defined to include any house or land. Senator Durcan's point is: does that premises, which includes any house, include a dwellinghouse which is also a house? We want a distinction between the words &ldquo;any house&rdquo; and &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris has spelled out what I am saying. I fully support the tenor of this Bill. I come from an area which is essentially a mountainous sheep farming area. I am faced, in my various capacities, with people who have to cope with this problem. I am faced, in a professional capacity, with defending people who own dogs that worry livestock. I am faced, politically, with many worried people who have livestock. I am fully supportive of the Bill but we have to be clear on what we are doing. I have no objection to giving powers to wardens under this section, but to give a warden the totally free power to come into my back yard and my sheds without any authority other than his warrant of appointment, is a very drastic power to give him. We could provide that for a warden to do that, he should have a warrant signed by a district justice, or something of that nature. That is the usual power given, for instance, to a fishery bailiff, if he is to enter into the curtilage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very relevant to section 1. I think section 1 should include a definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. Otherwise, it is much too wide and very dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the warden has an effective measure of power or authority <Col N="1459" /> he will not do his job correctly. I disagree with Senator Durcan on this. If the warden is restricted from doing his job completely the game is over and the thing becomes totally ineffective. For that reason I believe that a dwelling must mean a dwellinghouse and the areas surrounding it. The warden must have the power and the right to enter the premises to do his job correctly. If we were to take the other interpretation, the warden would be rendered quite ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. We will come to that later in section 26 where, if we have to search the dwellinghouse, we will have to have warrants. Certainly the obvious thing for a dog that has chased sheep or done any damage is to hide itself away in some shed or house and if the warden is hot on his heels there is very little he can do to pick up that dog if he has to go to a district justice or somebody like that. We have to give these powers. Incidentally for the benefit of Senators who have concerns about the implementation of the Bill, we are not talking today about hypothetical situations. I will list the areas where these wardens are working very effectively under this type of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point but it is a bit like the Garda working effectively. It is a bit like anybody with with authority working effectively. Ninety nine point nine per cent of authorised people with statutory power work effectively but we have the .01 per cent of people who will abuse these powers. These powers may be abused for the wrong reasons in rural areas. Power can be abused for the wrong reasons. My concern is that nobody should be given unlimited powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be very relevant to the section. I am simply suggesting that we provide power to enter the barns, the sheds, the yard and the <Col N="1460" /> immediate area around somebody's house with a warrant signed by a peace commissioner and there are many of those.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Senator comes in, could I make it quite clear that in a particular area this Bill would be administered by county councils and by the county manager and the members of local authorities. If there are local problems that need local solutions, then you can implement local solutions. For instance, if the person is as bad as that, fire him and appoint somebody who will carry out his duties to the satisfaction of the councillors and the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he decides in his wisdom to go into a premises to search for a dog that may well have killed some man's sheep, or have done some damage, if he is good he will follow that dog no matter where he is. The only possible hope the owner of stock has is that the dog warden has power to go in search for that dog no matter where he is. If the dog warden has not got those powers, and if he has to go to a district justice who might be in Timbuctoo at the time, or a peace commissioner what compensation is there for the poor sheep owner who lost his sheep? Not alone could he not find the dog, but he could not find the peace commissioner or the district justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain merit in what Senator Durcan is proposing. I agree to a certain extent but if we are to make a success of this scheme and this legislation a dog warden cannot be expected to chase a dog up to a certain point and then, because he goes into hiding in a certain area where the warden is prohibited from entering, get a warrant to do so. That would be defeating the purpose of the Bill. The purpose of this legislation is to try to control dogs. I would agree with what Senator Lennon has said. Dog wardens will have to have a certain amount of freedom. If a warden <Col N="1461" /> who has been chasing a dog has to return and get a warrant signed by a peace commissioner or a district justice, God knows where that dog will be when he gets back with his warrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Incidentally an amendment to section 1 has been put in by the Department of the Environment which will have to be taken on Report Stage. I have been advised that Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation have traditionally been given the functions which, in the case of the other boroughs, are operated by the relevant county councils. The control of dogs functions seem to be appropriate matters to be operated by the borough corporation and I am considering, therefore, introducing an amendment on Report Stage to include Dún Laoghaire borough as a local authority for the purpose of the Bill. The borough will, of course, form the nucleus of one of the new administrative counties which will emerge from the proposed reorganisation of the Dublin local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be unhelpful. I am trying to be as helpful as I can even though we disagree. I am worried that the definition of the word &ldquo;worry&rdquo; may not be sufficiently embracive. The definition refers to, to attack, to kill, or to chase. The mere presence of dogs in a pack can be a worry to sheep and I can think of situations where sheep could be worried which would not come within this definition. Between now and Report Stage would the Minister see if the word &ldquo;worry&rdquo; can be made more expansive than it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have to be so negative with the Senator but &ldquo;worry&rdquo; means exactly what it does mean, and I cannot deviate one iota from it. If dogs are in a field unaccompanied by their owner where they should not be, they are worrying the sheep even though the sheep may be at the other end of the field.</P>

      <P>The Minister made one further comment about later on but, in fairness, if &ldquo;worry&rdquo; is defined as meaning to attack, to kill, or to chase, is it ruling out their presence? Do they have to be attacking, killing or chasing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is required to remedy a defect in section 2 which, as it stands, could be interpreted as requiring two people to license a dog, namely, the keeper of the dog and the occupier of the premises where the dog is kept. In many cases the occupier and keeper will be one and the same person but, where they are not, the amendment will ensure that where the occupier can prove he is not the owner of the dog and that it was kept on the premises by some other person who had a licence he, the occupier, would not be deemed to be the keeper and consequently would not be liable to license the dog.</P>
      <P>The section, as amended, will provide that where a dog is not licensed the occupier of the premises where a dog is found will be deemed to be the keeper and will be liable for the licensing. Therefore, a prosecution for failure to license a dog may be taken out against the occupier of the premises. The occupier of a premises is the person legally entitled to possession &mdash; the owner or tenant.</P>

You could have a licensed dog being kept temporarily by another person with the owner's permission, or at the owner's request as a result of the owner going on holidays or going to hospital. If the licensed owner of the dog was unable to look after his dog he could arrange for a neighbour or friend to keep that dog for him but that would not mean the dog was not licensed. It would mean the keeper of the dog at that time was not the holder of the licence. This amendment tidies up the section.</P>

      <P>With regard to the issue of licences, this is a matter which may have been raised on Second Stage when unfortunately, I was unable to attend. I suggest that, while talking about the issue of dog licences, we should consider the position of old age pensioners and other social welfare pensioners who may wish to keep a dog and may need it for protection and company if they are living alone. I am not suggesting they should have a dog without a licence or be exempted from having a licence. I do not think that would be right because it is important that there should be a licence in respect of each dog and that dogs should be controlled by us knowing that the dogs are around and have licences. I suggest that possibly persons in this position might be exempt from the licence fee so that they could be issued a licence and they would not be discouraged from owning a dog or from getting a licence because of the fact that they could not afford the fee. I suggest to the Minister that that possibly could be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points raised by Senator Ferris and Senator Browne but they are talking about exempting old age pensioners from holding a licence and I do not think that is particularly desirable. It is desirable that as many dogs as possible should have licences attached to them so that there will be a way of controlling these dogs. This is the whole point of the Bill. I am simply asking that a licence be issued under section 3 to old age pensioners. They should be exempted from paying a fee. This is a slightly different thing and arises under section 3 rather than section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator McGuinness says because section 5 deals with exemption from holding a licence. I agree with the point she makes that every dog should have a licence for various reasons, for example, so that dogs can be controlled. That is the purpose of this Bill. It is appropriate to raise the matter on section 3 rather than section 5. Between now and Report Stage it might be possible to draft an amendment which will provide that, for certain categories <Col N="1467" /> of persons, dogs would be licensed but that no fees would be payable in respect of that licence.</P>
      <P>One category who should be looked after are widows who are not properly looked after within the social welfare code. Very frequently dogs may be the only protection they have. I do not think it is impossible. If we are to control dogs, all dogs should have licences. It is simply a question of the State showing benevolence to a very weak section of the community. It seems wrong that a dog which is used by a blind person or a dog which is kept by a widow for protection should not be controlled by the State. It should be licenced and controlled but the State should not demand a fee for that licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing with my two legal colleagues who are quite right &mdash; they can raise it on any section they wish. This probably is now becoming the more relevant section on which to deal with the problem about a waiver scheme for social welfare categories. In my Second Stage speech I mentioned old people living alone who must have a dog for their protection. They may be in the category which allows them to have a free television licence, free electricity, a free telephone etc., but they cannot have a free dog licence.</P>
      <P>Section 3 needs to be amended to give the manager power to allow a person to apply for a waiver scheme. The reason I used section 5 is that the Minister was taking it upon himself in section 5 to exempt certain categories, including guide dogs for the blind. I thought it appropriate to keep them in the same category. However, I will await the Minister's response. I was worried because the Minister said he had bad news for me, in other words, he was not going to exempt social welfare recipients. The Minister will have to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest to the Minister that, in response to our pleadings on this section or, indeed, on section 5 if he considers it more appropriate he might do it before Report Stage. Everybody I spoke to about this legislation &mdash; including members of the Animal Health Council and the chairman of the sub-committee, Dr. David Poole, who has put much of an effort into this &mdash; was emphatic that they did not wish to penalise people in that category who, by their very nature need a dog.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is chiefly because at Christmas many children are given presents of nice little fluffy puppies who grow up after a while to be very ungainly <Col N="1469" /> animals and are usually dumped in the country. It is more or less in line with what happens all over Europe &mdash; to ensure people are aware that becoming the owner of a dog is a big responsibility.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that if a child under 16 years of age knows that the licence has to be in somebody else's name even though, theoretically, he or she owns the dog, it will take from the ownership value to the child. Some modification of that might be possible because it is very cut and dried. It may be appropriate in certain urban areas but it may be inappropriate in certain rural areas. I do not think it would meet the situation to have the licence in someone else's name. There are bits of paper which denote ownership, title etc. but to a person of 16 years the fact that he or she cannot license a dog diminishes the value of ownership of that dog.</P>

      <P>I am longing to get to the stage where I can find out how effective we will be in collecting all these licences. I am not so sure that all 16 year olds will be rushing out for licences. The kennel clubs have a special junior section for handling dogs. In 99 cases out of 100 their parents can get a dog licence for them but children who bring a dog over to Crufts dog show in London would like to have a licence themselves. I accept fully what the Minister said in relation to puppies being given to children as Christmas presents and being abused later, but would it be possible to make an exception <Col N="1470" /> in the case of special breeds of dogs which are looked after so well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage we discussed this point and the Minister responded. I made the point my colleagues have made about canine clubs who have junior sections for children who own dogs, show them and win prizes. It is a matter of tremendous credit to them for doing so. There is much satisfaction in dog ownership. The Minister said ownership did not necessarily go with licensing. The Minister is saying he is leaving the responsibility for licences with adults against whom action can be taken. I suggest to the Minister that, in the implementation of this section as it is written, if a person under the age of 16 years is required to have his or her name on the licence, the name of the parents should also be on it. That would cover the question of ownership and the licensee. It would leave the legal responsibility with the parent but give the child under 16 years of age the pride and satisfaction of owning the dog, perhaps having paid for the licence. Many children who show dogs professionally in canine clubs here and abroad have a certain pride in ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to stimulate a love of animals in young people. If removing some authority from them was a disincentive to that, I would not like that to happen and I know you do not want it to happen either. I know the section could look as though it would make that happen but we could overcome that by having a dual name on the licence. As regards ownership, <Col N="1471" /> the child would know he owned the dog if it were his dog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section the Minister might very well have a look at because even though we know that every 16 year old is not going to go hammering on the doors of local authorities looking for licences, there will always be the exception. There is always the case where young people who are involved in the handling and rearing of dogs from a very early age would like to have the responsibility for those dogs and also to have the licence in their own names. We know that, in most cases, there would be no objection to having the licence issued in their parents' names. There will always be the odd case where, for example, parents are deceased and there is no brother or sister older than the child interested in the dogs and they may not like to have to go to some outsider to get a licence for them. I am sure there are always cases like that and this is something the Minister might very well have a look at because not all 16 year olds are going to go scampering off looking for licences but there will be exceptions. There will be people who have a genuine interest in handling and rearing dogs from a very early age and their particular positions should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I find myself in a quandry because I am standing up to disagree with my colleagues on the points they have made. I am doing this for three reasons. We all welcomed this a short time ago as a very necessary measure. I agree with that view. I am concerned that at this early stage we are taking the &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; out of it. Should we ever have bothered bringing it in at all?</P>
      <P>With regard to the points we are dealing with, I believe that in facing up to the reality of the dog situation one must insist on the licence being available to the owner who can be held responsible in court of law for control of the dog. Therefore, if you come below the 16 year old point, you are certainly losing that control and power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> We are talking about very nice little dogs &mdash; they could be little dogs for shows and competitions but there are other types of dogs. When Senator Hourigan was speaking I was reminded of an encounter he and I had some years ago with a yard full of Alsatians. We were very glad that those dogs were under the control of a responsible adult. It is very likely that the progeny of one of these dogs &mdash; if the Minister agrees to take the teeth out of this &mdash; could be under the control of a minor and he would be the licence holder. One has to look at both sides and so far as I am concerned, the measure was necessary. If we accepted and agreed that it was a necessary measure, there is no use in weakening it as we go down along the line.</P>

We are talking about £5, about the price of admission to a disco I suppose. If these young people profess to be fond of their dogs they might consider licensing them. If they can get the money from either the father or the mother, that is fine; we should welcome with open arms anybody who is going to pay it for the licence.</P>

      <P>The situation might be met by what was said earlier, where the minor could be included with the parents or the adult in a licensing situation. However, I do not consider it to diminish in any way the effectiveness of this Bill to make some concession with regard to those under 16 years of age. I totally support the concept of the Bill as I did on Second Stage. It is a necessary piece of legislation but I would again state, as has been referred to already, that not all 16 year olds own dogs and that those who do may not license them.</P>
      <P>The ownership aspect is very important to a youngster. There is a pride in owning something. In an Irish context, it is extremely important. As Oliver Goldsmith said &ldquo;The price of ownership turns sand dust into gold&rdquo;. We should not in any way take the pride of ownership away from those who have a high regard for owning a dog but we must give a measure of responsibility to those dog owners of 16 years and under. If persons under 16 years of age cannot exclusively be given the right to license and to own together, which is understandable from a court's point of view, they should have a part in being included in a licensing situation. I do not believe that the aspirations of the ordinary youngster who owns a dog, would be met by the licence being held in the name of somebody else.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Howard's approach because if we are going to put in all the bits and pieces, we will end up with something which will be totally impossible to implement. The whole thrust of this is to discourage. It is all right to talk about the people in the kennel clubs. For the information of the House I have had long and arduous discussions with the kennel clubs, with Bord na gCon and with responsible groups of people, including the ISPCA, and unanimously they all say to set the age at 16 years to try to discourage very young people from the ownership of dogs. We are not really talking about the sort of young people who are proud of their dogs, we are talking about young people who have no interest in <Col N="1474" /> dogs at all but who get a licence and then because they lose their interest in and attraction for the dog, let the dog run loose, thereby making the job of the warden infinitely more difficult. I do not have a lot of sympathy with that point of view having spent hours listening to the various approaches to it. I appeal to the House to allow the provision stand at 16 years of age bearing in mind that an under 16 year old would be allowed to own the dog while the licence would be the responsibility of the parents. After all, responsible parents who will allow an 11 or 12 year old go off with a dog are going to be doubly careful if they realise they will have to pay a very substantial fine if that dog goes in among sheep.</P>

In relation to the Irish Guide Dogs Association, who breed and train guide dogs for the blind, could the Minister let us know whether dogs kept by this association, which are on their way to being guide dogs for the blind, are exempted. If not, could the Irish Guide Dogs Association be included under section 5 as an exempted body so that dogs being prepared to be guide dogs for the blind would also be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Durcan that rather than saying a licence shall not be required for dogs in all these subsections it would be better to say they should have licences but we will not charge fees for them. If we are going to control dogs, then we are going to control them. This is a very welcome Bill in this respect. It is much easier to control them if we know <Col N="1475" /> what they are and who holds licences, so that people cannot make excuses saying, this dog comes under this and that heading and does not need a licence. It would probably be better to issue the licences but not to charge fees to organisations such as the ISPCA, the Garda and so on. In these categories we should include the Irish Guide Dogs Association. This is where the dogs covered by paragraph (d) come from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGuinness. Her request is very reasonable. I presume dogs kept by the Irish Guide Dogs Association would be under the control of the association and would be kept under strict guard. Eventually when they are trained and given to blind persons for their guidance, or to persons whose eyesight is defective, those people are exempt from holding a licence. The same should apply to the Irish Guide Dogs Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too agree with this point. The reason I feel strongly that there should be a licence in respect of every dog is that in that way we can have a register of all dogs. While an exception might be a dog under a few months old, a licence is very desirable. It would make certain that one had ultimately a complete register and record of all dogs.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage the Minister confirmed that all dogs used for the purpose of guidance of blind people &mdash; whether in training or otherwise &mdash; would be exempt.

      <P>We had discussions with <Col N="1476" /> the people concerned. This is a difficult matter. The Senator will see paragraph (h) which says: &ldquo;... by such other class of person as may be prescribed by the Minister&rdquo;. At any stage we could have a look at that again. In the case of guide dogs for the blind we are talking in a very broad field because they select their dogs from various people around the country, mostly people who deal in Alsatians and people with very special types of dogs. These people, in turn, are subject to their own set of rules. At any one time the guide dog people would have very few dogs, maybe one or two. They would usually have them on a lease arrangement from the owner. It may well be that after one, two or three weeks that dog would be found to be unsuitable and he would go back to the owner. It is not as simple as it sounds. They do not have big stocks of dogs at any one time being put through their paces. It is not like that at all. They go out to breeders. They select very carefully what they think would make a good dog. They work on it for a week or two and, as often as not, these dogs will end up back with their owner again. It is not a big issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point. I am worried about dogs which are the property of the Irish Guide Dogs Association. Those are dogs on which a decision has already been made by them. They are suitable dogs and they go through a training programme and then are given out to blind people. I accept that we might exempt them in a general dog licence situation which will cover them. I am worried about the individual dog, at farm level or breeding level, which has not yet been acquired by the Irish Guide Dogs Association and its prospective purchase or lease. Because the association are very special and provide a very worthwhile service in the community, the section confirms that they should be treated differently. We do not want it wide open so that it could be abused by people who might say the guide dogs association might take the dog from them. We do not want that. Once the guide dog association make a decision <Col N="1477" /> that the dog is suitable for training, it becomes the property of the association.</P>

      <P>Even when the dog is taken in for training, three-quarters of the way through they could still scrap him. The dog might be vicious. While the dog is in the course of training he is owned by the person who gave the dog for sale. The dog, even though he is on other premises, is covered by that licence. What you are really talking about is a very short period between the time they say the dog is all right and the time they hand him over. That is something we could look at. It is not a big problem.</P>

Naturally enough, everybody knows dogs gather at certain times of the year and go off in packs as they are attracted to the bitch. These dogs generally end up in some field of sheep. Many people keep bitches, not necessarily for breeding purposes. The suggestion at one time was that the licence should be dearer for bitches.

I agree with the Minister that it is correct to keep the section as simple as possible now.</P>
      <P>I might suggest to some of our urban local authorities that one might charge a higher fee for a dog licence to those persons who insist on keeping enormous dogs in small suburban houses with small suburban gardens and with no way of exercising them. These dogs tend to be the kind that run wild and if there are other animals nearby they may worry them. This is something that local authorities might well consider because, while it is grand for a family to have a small dog in a small house, some suburban areas are rendered quite dangerous by the keeping of huge dogs in small houses.</P>

      <P>We looked at this because the Senator mentioned it. The point we came up with &mdash; some of our legal people having discussed it &mdash; was that any damage to sheep would involve a civil action. A person found guilty of this offence and fined in the courts obviously would have almost a clear cut case for compensation. If a person is found guilty under section 9 (3), automatically in court that person has to cover the cost of the damage which can be very substantial.</P>

It helps very much in one's negligence action. It is essential that these prosecutions should be taken fairly quickly so that people who are looking for damages in a civil action will have the result of the prosecution there in order to assist them, and of course it would assist them.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which I mentioned also in my Second Stage speech in relation to greyhounds. It is important for the safety of the general public that greyhounds should be muzzled when they are being walked in a public place. While the vast majority of greyhounds can be very pleasant animals some can be vicious. They can be vicious not only with the general public but with themselves, often fighting amongst themselves and causing damage to themselves. If two dogs see other dogs in the street while they are being walked this can cause problems. For that reason this amendment should be inserted in the Bill and I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>

I discussed it with a number of experts including greyhound people and I mentioned to Senator Hussey that I was disappointed that I could not meet his request. Provision to muzzle was in the <Col N="1483" /> 1965 Act but it was deleted at the request of interested parties. Dog kennel groups and Bord na gCon said that to keep a greyhound muzzled for a walk of several miles could in itself cause suffering. Dogs like to have the mouth open and the tongue out while exercising and by so doing they salivate and cool the mouth. Veterinary opinion is against muzzling except when very necessary. Greyhound owners know when to muzzle their dogs and generally use discretion in the matter. That is the best I can do.</P>

I am not saying they do not do it now but they are taking a risk. They are actually breaking the law when they do it. Normally they have suitable places where they can exercise their dogs. In Senator Browne's own area there are special privately owned courses laid out for this very purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express disappointment because the last time I raised this the Minister assured me that on a beach they were under control if they were being galloped. It is very important for dog owners to be able to go on the beach, if they are lucky enough to be near it, because in winter time the ground can be as hard as it is in summer time. This is where dogs and bitches get their toes damaged. I know of one that went out of a major stake only last Friday <Col N="1484" /> because of such a happening on a local track. It is very unfair to greyhound owners not to be able to take them to the beach because it is the only place that is soft enough for them to gallop and not damage their toes either in extreme warm weather in summer when the ground is very hard, or in winter when there is frost. If they can only exercise on a leash that is grossly unfair.</P>

      <P>Greyhounds can be controlled effectually especially by people who walk them regularly. The industry consider that greyhounds can be under effectual control. The owners of these animals are not the kind of people who would let them off the leash if there was a danger. They would let them off for a gallop only in an area that was safe and, of course, beaches are the obvious places. I listened to the arguments on Senator Hussey's amendment and I am not sure whether he wants to press it. I had discussions with people who were very worried about this amendment being accepted because, above all animals, greyhounds need to be able to have their mouths open especially in an exercising position such as in walking. At times owners of greyhounds decide to muzzle <Col N="1485" /> dogs because some are more dangerous than others. Legislation providing that all the greyhounds had to be muzzled would be inoperable. People could not walk greyhounds at all. Anybody who has seen them exercising will be aware, that they like to have their mouths open and their tongues out. They are on a leash and are not dangerous whether they are muzzled or not. The only reason people muzzle them is to stop them biting each other. The owners know that, and they do it without legislation.</P>

      <P>I would not try to give the impression that greyhound owners go to the beaches to gallop their dogs on glorious sunny days when everybody is out in their bikinis or swimming trunks.

I would not condone legislation that would allow, even on a winter's morning, dogs to run on a beach if, at the other end of that beach which may be a mile in length, somebody happens to be out with a small dog.

      <P>I have some sympathy for the Minister on this point because I do not think he could legislate for all the things we are talking about.

      <P>I also mentioned during the Second Stage discussion that there should be an age limit, that any person under 16 years of age would not be allowed to lead greyhounds. There can be various arguments for that. Section 4 defines quite clearly persons who are disqualified from holding a licence and one of those is somebody of 16 years of age. Could the same thing apply here? I know the Minister will have strong arguments against it, but we all know what can happen when dogs are being led. They can be savage and can create problems. It is very important that the person leading such greyhounds would have full control. Maybe something could be inserted here saying that only persons of 16 years of age or over should be allowed to lead greyhounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the objections to the muzzling of greyhounds in public. As one who has had the pleasure to lead as many as four greyhounds many times on the public highway, I would always insist that they be muzzled, but I know there might be objections. It is the nature of the greyhound to be muzzled. Somebody mentioned that they should also be muzzled when galloping, but when training a dog, he is led for 300 yards and he is galloped from whoever is slipping him and back to you. That is naturally done without a muzzle and therefore you try to pick a safe place. I support the section which says that greyhounds should not be set loose in a public place, that they should be at all times on a lead. I would prefer that they would be muzzled also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that it is the nature <Col N="1490" /> of greyhounds to be muzzled. They are muzzled in the kennel. Every Irish trainer will have every dog muzzled, less so the bitches. If you go racing you will find that every dog in the kennel is muzzled. When the dog is taken out of the kennel for racing he goes into the trap and he is muzzled for his race, whether it is a sprint of 330 yards or it is more than 1,000 yards. They run with the muzzles on. That is nothing new for a dog. It is the nature of the dog to be muzzled, and it is the nature of the trainer or the owner to make sure that at all times a dog is used to being muzzled. The Minister made his argument and said he would prefer if we did not press this amendment. As one who has handled four dogs many times, all I can say is that I would prefer to see my dogs on a leash and muzzled. Senator Hussey mentioned young people handling dogs. Any young boy of 14 or 15 will handle a dog, or maybe two or three, but he will not handle four. Some regulation regarding age limits should be imposed in the Bill. I support Senator Hussey's thinking on that section.</P>

      <P>The 1965 Act provided a minimum age limit of 16 years for persons exercising greyhounds in public places. It would be interesting to look at some of the debates at that time. The provision was opposed. The opposition was prompted by Bord na gCon and others and the Government deleted the provision at that time. An age limit was not considered practical because of the variability of teenagers' capacities. There could be a very able bodied 13 or 14 year old, and there might be a 16 year old who would not be capable of handling four dogs. Walking a dog by young people is widely practised. This is something I would not like to push, but if Senators feel strongly about it, I would be prepared to discuss it with them between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking to the local dog warden in my county and he told me his big problem is seizing or catching the dogs. He cannot shoot the dog; he must catch it. Very often the dog will have no collar and because he is a &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; dog, everyone disowns him. We are hopeful that this scheme will work. In my own county, which is the smallest county in Ireland, we have one dog warden. Up to now we had a Garda barracks in every parish and they were responsible for dog licences and the control of dogs. This shows the enormous task that faces a dog warden these days when he is trying to cover the whole county.</P>
      <P>How can we help dog wardens to seize and catch these dogs? It may be for the local authorities to decide what means are at the disposal of the dog wardens. The dog warden in my county informed me that so far he had done nothing more than collect the dogs from certain points throughout the county and take them away, but he cannot do very much to catch dogs. Responsible people are taking the dogs to the collection point but he is not getting to the root of the problem, and that is the aim of this Bill. Apart from licensing dogs, the dog warden cannot get to the root of the problem. In the Minister's discussions with other groups, what type of suggestions came forward as to how the dog warden can handle this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long section but there is one paragraph that perhaps the Minister would comment on. The local authority &ldquo;may, before disposing of a dog under this section, sterilise, or arrange to have sterilised, the dog.&rdquo; What is the thinking behind that section? There is another aspect to this which the Minister <Col N="1493" /> might consider on Report Stage. At the moment the parvo virus is rampant. Some concern might be shown in the Bill by providing vaccination against parvo virus everywhere dogs are kept. It is something the Minister might comment on. If he does not introduce it in the Bill, and since parvo virus is rampant at present, a statement from the Minister is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to mention. Senator Fallon mentioned that the wardens were finding it very difficult to catch dogs. We cannot legislate so that all dogs are caught because even with the best will in the world some of them will never be caught. This brings me to the training of dog wardens. It is vital that dog wardens are trained properly in the handling of dogs, catching dogs and taking them under control in a humane way.</P>
      <P>This brings us to the important point made by Senator Fallon about the humane destruction of dogs. The Animal Health Council have been very concerned about this. I mentioned on Second Stage that when dogs had to be destroyed having been kept in a detention centre for the number of days specified, their humane destruction should take place under the jurisdiction of a veterinary surgeon or under his control. &ldquo;Under his control&rdquo; means under his direction or supervision. We envisage that under another Act all local authorities will soon have to employ a veterinary surgeon. If it is not necessary to have a veterinary surgeon on the spot when dogs are being destroyed, it is imperative that dog wardens are trained by a veterinary surgeon so that the job will be done correctly and humanely and that no unacceptable type of destruction of these dogs would take place, as happened in the past. The NSPCA might be used to train personnel and if any surgical intervention takes place, such as the spraying of bitches this would have to be done by a veterinary surgeon. I do not know of anybody else who is competent to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the Animal Health Council, the Minister said it was not felt <Col N="1494" /> that the term &ldquo;humane destruction&rdquo; needed to be defined as the intention was quite clear. The Minister said he was leaving this to the discretion of the court who would order the dog to be destroyed and that he was confident the judge would order that the dog should be destroyed humanely and would lay down certain guidelines. We will have to ensure that this is done in a uniform way throughout the country. There will have to be a proper code of conduct for the wardens and a regulated course of training. Also, the humane destruction of dogs will have to be taught to the wardens professionally. The only way one can humanely destroy a dog is by injection of a lethal drug which, given intravenously, means instant death and given intra-peritoneal in only minutes. Naturally they are extremely dangerous drugs. I hope we will not decide that to destroy a dog by gassing it is a humane way to end the animal's life.</P>
    <P>We will have to get all the assurances necessary in this section from the Minister, because if he is not writing into the Bill what &ldquo;humane destruction&rdquo; is, we should at least be able to point to the discussion we have had on the section as setting down the norm for local authorities throughout the country to do this job properly. Otherwise we could be guilty of cruelty to animals. That would also apply to the catching of dogs because normally dogs will come to a call even from a stranger, but there are some hungry dogs, rabid dogs and so on that might not necessarily do that. I hope the warden would have the power to get assistance from other people working in the local authority if he feels dogs are a danger and need to be apprehended. This scheme will not be operable with only one warden in each county. I know that is the minimum, but I hope local authorities will have four, five or six wardens so that a proper service can be provided. Otherwise we will not be doing justice to the problem of unwanted dogs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Ferris said about the necessity for training dog wardens, although the <Col N="1495" /> employment of dog wardens is also dealt with under section 15, but particularly about arranging for the dogs' destruction in a humane manner under subsection (7). There is no definition of &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; or &ldquo;humane&rdquo; in the definition section. What is humane to one person may not be humane to another. The Animal Health Council in suggesting that dogs should be humanely destroyed by a veterinary surgeon or someone acting under the direction or supervision of a veterinary surgeon, are taking the right line. It is all very well to say that directing the destruction of the dog should be left to the court. This would presumably be a District Court and while District Justices are persons of great virtue, not all of them are experts in dog care, and not all of them would necessarily know the right way to destroy a dog in a humane manner, and they might not want the responsibility of having to decide what was the proper way of destroying a dog. If veterinary surgeons are to be employed by local authorities, it would not be necessary for him to be there on every occasion, that would be asking too much, but the local veterinary surgeon should train or direct the dog warden on how to do this properly and generally supervise the destruction of dogs in that local authority area. If it is not properly defined it could give rise to cruelty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Ferris said was right, but I wonder if his local authority are working under the same financial constraints as ours, because last Monday at a special meeting to discuss our financial crisis, I would not have liked to venture to talk about four dog wardens needed to do this job properly. If we were to agree to all the suggestions made by animal health councils and other interested bodies, I could not see this scheme being operated by the local authority at the moment. In my local authority we are at our wits end to try to keep the scheme in operation with one dog warden, not to talk about employing veterinary surgeons and others to carry out <Col N="1496" /> this work. If we include in this Bill everything that has been suggested, it will cost a fortune, and we cannot go that far, no matter how much we might like to. We hope there will be a good public response by dog owners to the new Bill.</P>
      <P>Four dog wardens in any county would not do the job Senator Ferris speaks about, even 24 would not do it. We have talked about so many things today that we would solve some of our unemployment problems if we were to follow them up. We are talking a lot of nonsense, really. The whole purpose of the Bill, from day one as I understood it, was to try to get rid of the scourge of stray dogs. Now we are chasing every hare and rabbit in sight. I worked myself into a sweat for two years in my own local authority trying to get one dog warden appointed. I will take many risks, but I certainly will not risk three more no matter what kind of a job he is doing.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris is probably right in talking about the humane aspect of the Bill, but it might cost between £10 and £20 per visit by a veterinary surgeon travelling to a dog pound to destroy maybe one dog. I do not think we can go along that road. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe I am looking at the financial side of it and thinking of what I would be confronted with as a member of my local authority when I go back at a time when, because of our financial position, we cannot employ some people on the road at the moment, no matter how much we might be inclined to do that, not to mention setting up a scheme to solve unemployment with jobs for dog wardens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with what Senator Lennon has been saying. I am sure when Senator Ferris and Senator McGuinness recommended that dogs should be destroyed under the supervision of or by a veterinary surgeon, they did not envisage local authorities employing veterinary surgeons for this purpose alone. Local authorities employ veterinary surgeons already for various reasons; they have to supervise slaughterhouses and so on. Regardless of what it might cost, it is very important that <Col N="1497" /> dogs that are to be destroyed are destroyed in a humane way. The vets, or people acting on their behalf, are the only people who can do that.</P>
      <P>If we are to worry about the cost of implementing this legislation then we may as well forget about it. This scheme is supposed to be self-financing. Let us look at the situation throughout the country. It is said that there are 700,000 dogs in the country, and only 80,000 of them were licensed in 1985. If we did our job efficiently and well under this legislation, we would be able to employ dog wardens and veterinary surgeons and anybody necessary to make the scheme efficient and ensure that dogs that must be destroyed are destroyed in a humane way.</P>
      <P>There is another point I would like to raise on this section. Again, this deals with stray dogs and particularly dogs that are known to be dangerous. Any dog that is know to have attacked livestock or people and is caught and brought into the pound should not be released if he is known to be dangerous and should either be held there of destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies let me just take up a couple of points. First of all, I do not think Senator Lennon was listening to what we were saying on this section. The Animal Health Council made a submission to the Minister, as is their right as one of the agencies involved in the preparation of the legislation, that this section should provide that the humane destruction of dogs should be done in a particular way. There was never a suggestion from them, or from me, or from Senator McGuinness that a veterinary surgeon would have to attend every time a county council warden wanted to destroy a dog. We are asking the Minister to ensure that dog wardens are properly trained through the agency of the NSPCA, because they are already doing it; they have veterinary expertise available to them and I am quite sure that with that agency, and with some local authorities who presently employ veterinarians, <Col N="1498" /> this proper instruction and training could be given to dog wardens.</P>
      <P>There is other legislation pending, such as the new slaughterhouse Bill, which will make it mandatory on local authorities to employ a veterinary surgeon. That means that immediately every county council will have a veterinary surgeon available for various functions, including this one. The minimum number of wardens required by law is one, but I suggest that if county councils can do so there should be more, and it can be done in conjunction with the existing agency who are doing this job very effectively in my county as well as in Senator Lennon's county. We all have financial constraints on us but it has not stopped us in the past from doing this and doing it correctly.</P>
      <P>In this legislation, there should be no areas of doubt left as to how we, as humans, feel about how animals should be treated when it comes to taking their lives. If, because of neglect and lack of control by their owners, they have followed their natural instinct and savaged sheep, that is no reason for treating them in any way other than a humane way when it comes to destroying them.</P>
      <P>I hope the wardens will be trained to know exactly how to do the job and, as the Animal Health Council said, the techniques and the manner of the application of the techniques will be under veterinary supervision. That does not mean one has to have a veterinarian all the time. But at least a veterinarian will explain to somebody how an animal should be given an intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of a deadly substance, which is the way I hope the dogs will be destroyed.</P>

    <P>The Minister replied by saying he felt the section is strong enough, and the definition of humane destruction is strong enough, and that courts would make a decision when they made an order saying the animals could be destroyed and a judge would take this into account. Senator McGuinness has now explained that some judges may be competent to do that and some may not. We want to ensure that the legislation will be as tight as we can make it in providing for a <Col N="1499" /> humane method of destruction of animals by wardens.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme will be self-financing. Naturally in the initial stages it may not be. Some councils have already done a lot in this area without any legislation. I suggest that if it is self-financing a lot of work will be done in this area. It is appropriate that we should talk about the humane destruction of animals. Otherwise we could hear it said that this legislation is anti-dog when it is not intended to be. It is intended to be anything but anti-dog. It is intended to handle a particular problem and to do it in a proper way by legislation, and that includes the training of the wardens in a proper way.</P>

      <P>I appeal to people to be practical and realistic about this matter because if we start chasing up all the little detailed avenues that have been raised it could be quite complex and it could take from the effectiveness of a very fine piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I totally agree with Senator McGuinness, Senator Hussey, Senator Ferris and others who talked about the need for humane destruction of the animals at a given point and under proper supervision, and so on. But surely this is something that will not happen on an ongoing basis. In a practical set up one will have a number of animals for destroying at any particular time, whether it be ten, 20 or whatever. We will not have the extermination of a dog each day which would cost so much money each week, each fortnight or whenever. That is the kind of thing we must address ourselves to. For that reason Senator Lennon may have slightly exaggerated the question of expense. He is right in so far as the number of persons required to do all the detail in the sort of way some might envisage would take a lot of money, but again it has been said that this whole scheme will generate finance, and ultimately something like £2.5 million from licences and so on. With a greater policing of the system by the dog wardens than was the case with the Garda Síochána, I am satisfied that a <Col N="1500" /> substantial sum of money will accrue to the local authorities for this operation. We must be practical and realistic about this and not go chasing hares. On the question of the extermination of dogs or their destruction, it will be done on a very organised basis where there are quite a number of dogs to be disposed of at any given time and because of this the cost will be significantly lessened.</P>

      <P>I will not take up too much of the Minister's time. I should like, however, to re-emphasise, with Senators Ferris and Hussey, that none of us envisaged a veterinary surgeon would be specially employed to run around from place to place just destroying dogs. This could be done in a very practical manner where a number of dogs could be destroyed at the same time. It is a question of the method of humane destruction being laid down by the veterinary surgeon who may very well be employed for other purposes by the local authority. A check should be kept on the way in which this is carried out by somebody who has the professional qualifications to do it. We are not asking that immense expense be incurred: we are asking that this matter be dealt with in a practical and humane manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my county we have a veterinary surgeon who spends quite a lot of his time in this way, in case anybody thinks we are not doing our job correctly. Some people have said that this scheme will be self-financing. Why do these people think that people will pay their licences now any more than they did before? Despite the fact that there is a garda in nearly every parish in Ireland, people have not paid their licences. I hope they will respond now under this new scheme but I am not fully convinced that they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure how we arrived at the figures of 250,000 or 500,000 dogs. It always amuses me when I hear about the number of dogs that should be licensed at the moment. However, I can assure the Minister that if it is 250,000 when we come back at some time in the future <Col N="1501" /> those dogs will not be licensed. If people did not license their dogs despite the presence of gardaí at their doors for the past number of years, I doubt if a warden going around the country, be they small or large, will have the necessary effect of scaring them into licensing their dogs. I hope people will respond and I will encourage them to do so, especially when county councils are operating the scheme, but I am not as optimistic as others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the Garda did not address their efforts to the matter of licensing of dogs. There were so many other urgent matters to which they had to give priority that the licensing of dogs was a very low priority. This would explain to a large degree why the number of dogs licensed last year was something in the region of 18,000 as against the estimate of a dog population of between 500,000 and 700,000. It would not necessarily solve the problem, but it would at least answer in part Senator Lennon's concern about why so many dogs remain unlicensed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost redundant: each speaker seems to be clarifying the speech of the previous speaker but perhaps that is a good way to have it. To get back to the thrust of the measure, humane means exactly what it says. All destruction will be carried out by trained people who will, in turn, be trained by the ISPCA. In the case of Senator Lennon's very praiseworthy efforts in County Louth, that dog warden is working under impossible conditions. He is almost operating against the law at the moment. He does not have the law on his side. He may not enter farmers' yards or fields and do all the things the new wardens will be able to do. Under a proper dog warden system the collection of dogs is an easy enough matter. The Senator is near enough to some of his colleagues at the other side of the Border and with the law on his side the picking up of dogs will be easy enough now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Destruction of dogs will be carried out <Col N="1502" /> in a humane manner. Councillors who are not happy with the way things are being done can address the matter at their local county council meeting. None of us want a sort of a Bastille around the place where dogs will be cruelly put down. That is not the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Training of wardens will be an ongoing process. On Second Stage Senator Hussey raised the matter of wardens not being allowed to operate until they are fully trained. In fact, the training will be ongoing and part of it will be on-scene training. There is no need to legislate for it. The wardens will be competent people and these animals will be put down humanely.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say the scheme will eventually be self-financing. While it is true to say that licences were not bought even while there was a garda in every parish, we must remember he had a lot of other things to do also. Fines were very petty and people convicted of not having a dog licence were usually given far too much latitude to get a licence. If one got away with it until June one would assume one would be all right until December. However, the new legislation provides that a licence taken out in June is valid until the following June, and a licence taken out in November is valid until the following November. The cost of the licence is quite insignificant, £5, whereas the fine is substantial, £100. The dog warden, unlike the Garda, will have nothing else to do except collect these licences for the local authority. In other words, he will be collecting his own salary, among other things.</P>

      <P>He can be authorised by the local authority to collect. It will not be written into the Bill but if Senators decide that is the way they wish to do it that is the way it will be done. His job will be to ascertain that every dog is licensed. In County Louth, for example, the county council may decide that the licensing will be done in the ordinary way through the local post office or the local <Col N="1503" /> county council offices or they may instruct their wardens to go out and collect.</P>
      <P>Dogs that are known to be dangerous will be destroyed. Dogs that are seen to be acceptable for use by other people will be spayed or castrated by a veterinary surgeon.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> Government amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P>In page 9, line 30, to delete &ldquo;within seven days&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments arise from representations made by the Advisory Council on Animal Health who felt that the time limit proposed before a person would have to take some action over holding a dog might not operate to the dog's benefit and might frustrate the search efforts by an owner. For instance, the sheep owner might be tempted not to feed a dog during the 72 hours he would be entitled to hold it before delivering it to a dog warden. Section 4 of the Dogs Act, 1906, which section 13 (1) replaces, contains a provision to act forthwith. This amendment will restore the <i>status quo</i> in that respect. The provision in section 3 of the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, to which section 13 (2) refers, contained no limit within which to act. It is considered desirable that a person who seizes a dog should be required to act &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is considered to be flexible enough to cater for situations where it would not be possible to deliver up a dog immediately such as, for instance, late at night. I think that is reasonable.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate to thank the Minister publicly and his advisers for conceding this amendment. I know the section consolidates the 1906 Act, the 1960 Act and the 1965 Act. There is a degree of urgency in the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;, as opposed to seven days in section 13, and 72 hours in subsection (2). The word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is also to be welcomed. It gives a degree of urgency and a degree of flexibility but it ensures that people do not starve a dog they have taken for some reason or other for the seven days. We were worried about that and it could happen as the section was worded originally. I want to thank the Minister for having conceded these amendments. They will improve the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 44, after &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on completion of a bona fide training course&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have already discussed this. I felt that this amendment was necessary. Section 15 says every local authority shall employ one or more persons to be dog wardens for the purposes of the Act. I recommend that they will be employed only on the completion of a bona fide training course. This is very important because you cannot pluck a person &mdash; male or female &mdash; from any other profession and say: &ldquo;You are being appointed as a dog warden&rdquo;, without giving that person training. It would be unfair to the persons so employed in the first instance because they would not know how to handle dogs in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who have a natural instinct for that kind of work; they are able to handle animals in a very humane and professional way, but there are <Col N="1506" /> others who just would not be able to handle the job and it is those people I have in mind. Before they are appointed by the local authority they should be given a training course. I understand that the ISPCA provide this kind of course. We should avail of them. Local authorities should avail of that course being organised by the ISPCA when appointing dog wardens. It would ensure that the people so appointed would be more capable of carrying out their duties, would be better able to handle the dogs they are employed to look after and give a better service to the local authority employing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment. The Minister might think it unnecessary to legislate so tightly on the section but it is in line with what the Minister is doing. We can have that interpretation of the words &ldquo;bona fide training course&rdquo;. As the Minister has said, it will be an ongoing training process continuing in the field. I have to be satisfied &mdash; and I am a member of a local authority &mdash; that in some way we will ensure that there will be a minimum standard of training required. I want to hear what the Minister has to say about the necessity for it. He has given an assurance that the Minister for the Environment will be giving a directive or making a ministerial order bringing this section into being. He can set down any terms he wishes as the employer; indirectly the Minister will be the employer. He can set down the recommended age and competence of the person concerned. If we make this amendment it will strengthen the section and meet the wishes we have been expressing on earlier sections, particcularly regarding humane destruction. That is all part of the process of the training of a dog warden in my opinion. The amendment is not an unreasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment as proposed by Senator Hussey would provide that a dog warden would not be issued with a certificate of appointment unless he completed the bona fide training <Col N="1507" /> course. The certificate of appointment will constitute evidence of the warden's authority to carry out his functions under the Bill and the effect of the amendment would be that a warden could not be appointed unless he was trained. That seems to be the difficulty about legislating for it. I support the motive behind the amendment but it is felt that it is not necessary, as we see it, having had discussions with the ISPCA and with the various groups of people concerned.</P>
      <P>Training of wardens as already provided for in the Bill can take place without a statutory provision. It is the intention that in all cases wardens will be propertly trained. Training of staff for any job in a local authority is an administrative matter and does not require to be legislated for. A local engineer, for instance, has to be up to his job. In the event of an emergency appointment being necessary, we could run into difficulty because we are implementing this suddenly on a national basis. We are hoping to get it passed in time for the lambing season. Under the amendment the emergency appointee could not operare effectively without his certificate of appointment which could not be given to him until he completed his bona fide training course. That certainly to my mind would, in the short term, frustrate the implementation of the Bill. As the local authorities will be implementing it on the ground, as it were, they should be totally satisfied that only such people as would be competent would be let out on the field. That is what we would be hoping. The point being made by the ISPCA is that the training is actually ongoing. It is a long process and the ISPCA would be happy to allow trainees out on to the field under their supervision. At a certain stage they would give a certificate. In the meantime they could be doing a lot of good work.</P>

      <P>Possibly the inclusion of this amendment in the legislation might frustrate the implementation of the Act at this stage. In the long term it <Col N="1508" /> might be better. If the local authorities advertise the appointment of dog wardens in each local authority they will have a very large number of applicants. The vast majority of those people will have experience in dealing with animals but none of them, as far as I can see, will have the training necessary to carry out effectively and efficiently the duties imposed by this legislation. For that reason there should be some kind of a crash course that ISPCA could give to people who are being so employed. If the local authority decide to advertise the appointment of those wardens they will interview a certain number of applicants and should make it quite clear to them that before they are appointed they will have to do some kind of a crash course. If that were done it would be sufficient because at least they would have the basic knowledge of how to handle dogs, how to collect them and how to deal with them when they get them into the compounds. If they even had that kind of basic training it would be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will find, in effect, that the ISPCA have assured us that that will happen. Nobody will be allowed onto the field without that basic training. All we are saying is that we do not feel we need to legislate for this. Local administrators can put in their own caveats at local level if they feel something pertains to a particular area &mdash; if it involves a town that might have restrictions or that sort of thing &mdash; that very specific training will have to be given to that person. All that will take place. There is no question that somebody who is not trained will be let loose on the public. Certainly that is the way it will operate. At any future date there would be nothing wrong with the Minister for the Environment, at the request of residents or county councils, making any alteration they may wish. The scheme will then be law and will be implemented. It will set it out that a person has to do two years, 12 months or six months specific training before he is allowed to act as a dog warden.</P>

      <P>There is no conflict here. We have a dog warden in Mayo working very effectively. He was selected by the local authority. We must remember that the warden will have to take a decision on the continuation of the life of a particular dog. A person from the ISPCA may not be able to take this decision. It may mean the termination of the dog's life. We have had major success with our scheme and we have provided money for it. You must have a person suited to the job to be carried out. If he is appointed by the local authority they will have to look for a happy medium in the type of character they select to do this job. The Bill will be there. When we have control of marauding dogs and dogs that have no homes the job will be much easier. At present there is no control and dogs are running loose. The authorities are beginning to assert themselves and at least we will have a breakthrough in this area.</P>

There is no disagreement on what we want to do in this section. In areas of staff recruitment and terms of employment the country managers are very slow to give power to the members of local authorities. Under the County Management Acts he is responsible totally for the terms of employment of anybody within his jurisdiction. I want to be sure that, when the Minister for the Environment is making a ministerial order, he will write in that some kind of minimum training will be required. This will act as a guideline for the manager and will ensure an even administration of this legislation. That will achieve what Senator Hussey suggests. It is what we all want now.

The Department of the Environment allowed us a capital amount towards that and also paid part of the capital expenditure involved. We transferred ownership in trust to the ISPCA. They are working in conjunction with us and we give them an annual grant.

Obviously the ISPCA will be regarded as such a person.

      <P>This section specifies the powers of the dog wardens. We have already heard some reservations being expressed about those powers during our discussions on other sections. I am not going to go into these in detail because I believe the powers given to the dog warden there are necessary if he is to carry out the duties imposed on him by this legislation. He requires those powers to enter lands or buildings in order to catch dogs that have been attacking persons or worrying livestock. Under this section a dog warden has the power to go in to inspect kennels or to inspect dogs <Col N="1514" /> that are being maltreated as often happens &mdash; we have seen terrible cases of dogs being allowed to starve to death. Will the dog warden have power to go in and inspect those kennels or buildings in order to see if they are being kept in a proper way? Will he have the power to take action against the owners of those dogs who are ill-treating the animals in such a way that they allow them to die of starvation or any other reason?</P>

      <P>I will have a Report Stage amendment on this section. The functional areas of local authorities generally extend to the high water mark only and, consequently, a local authority wishing to make by-laws for a beach adjoining its area would be unable to do so. Consequently, subsection (6), (7) and (8) of section 17 provide the procedure to solve this problem. I am, however, having another look at the procedure proposed to see whether a simpler formula could be adopted which would obviate the necessity of a ministerial order and I will examine this between now and Report Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is dealing with something I have been interested in throughout the debate on the Bill. Where a farmer has his stock attacked by a dog and where there is a great deal of damage done to them, I am satisfied that he has power under the section to claim damages. This is necessary because very often we find in the lambing season that farmers suffer terrible losses from dogs attacking their flock. Very often they have no recourse to compensation. It would be wrong if that were excluded from the Bill. The Minister might set my mind at ease on this, that farmers will have power to seek damages for any loss caused to their flock as a result of attacks by stray dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. Section 21 (i) states:</P>
      <P>The owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog and for injury done by it to any livestock; and it shall not be necessary for the person seeking such damages to show a previous mischievous propensity in the dog, or the owner's knowledge of such previous propensity, or to show that such injury or damage was attributable to neglect on the part of the owner.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where livestock are injured by a dog <Col N="1517" /> on land on to which they had strayed, and either the dog belonged to the occupier of the land or its presence on the land was authorised by the occupier, a person shall not be liable under this section in respect of injury done...</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one point in relation to the foregoing. Anybody who has established that his animals have been destroyed by a dog, under the provisions of this Bill is in a position to proceed to take the owner of the dog to court and to claim the correct amount of damage caused by the dog in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section. It includes a more absolute form of liability. It is particularly important to have included that it is not necessary for the person seeking the damage to show previous mischievous propensity in the dog or the owner's knowledge of such previous propensity. These are the things that can be extremely difficult to deal with if it came to a court action; it would be hard to prove that the owner knew that the dog had a mischievous propensity or that the dog had the mischievous propensity. It is to be welcomed that the section is so wide and should impose this sort of liability.</P>
      <P>The sections speak of the owner of a dog. Under section 1 &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined to some extent and it includes the occupier of premises where the dog is permitted to live or remain and so on. What is the position of the licence holder of the dog? Is he regarded as being the owner in any way or is he in any way liable? In the previous section the Minister stated that a child under 16 years of age might be the owner of the dog, but the licence holder would be the parent. You could sue an under 16-year old owner of a dog but it would not be much good because the likelihood of there being a mark for damages is fairly small. Can the Minister sort out for me the difference between the owner and the licence holder under the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In law, you proceed against the owner of the dog. In the case <Col N="1518" /> of the person under 16 years, it is the parents who hold the licence. You proceed in all cases in law against the owner of the dog. In most cases, it is the same person who holds the licence and owns the dog.</P>

Tá sé an-fhurasta an milleán a bheith á chur ar gach éinne ach amháin orainn féin go bhfuil an dí-fhostaíocht go dona, ach tá sé deacair rud a dhéanamh faoi. Dá bhrí sin, molaim an tAire gur ghlac sé leis na moltaí seo atá os ár gcomhair san leabhar beag seo &ldquo;Tax Incentives&rdquo; agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh as an obair sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness somebody said many years ago. The Minister has set about doing this in a big way by proceeding to encourage workers to be very much involved in their own business. By being involved in their own business and firm, having an interest in seeing that the firm is not there just to <Col N="1520" /> be bled for anything that can be got from it, the workers will actually put greater effort into it. Many workers feel completely cut off from the company they work for. They see the owners as the people making the profits and they seldom see the owners as the people who share the headaches, who perhaps wake up screaming at night. I heard on the radio this morning of somebody who woke up screaming every two hours at night because of his worries. Many a business person has that kind of experience. They do the worrying at home and often-times the workers feel that is okay for them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the question of people being absent from work. If workers feel they are involved, it will help to correct that fault. One cannot have absenteeism and progress at the same time. All in all, the incentives which have been offered by the Minister should do much to encourage individual workers to have a greater interest in their job, to turn up on time and feel they are part and parcel of what is going on because, in the long run they are producing the goods, they are doing the work and without them companies cannot flourish.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the schemes the Minister has introduced the business expansion scheme encourages people to invest money in Irish companies. We heard much about the black hole and £1.5 billion disappearing out of the country. If we have money it is very important that we do something to help ourselves. The business expansion scheme certainly encourages people to put their money where it should be &mdash; helping ourselves. If they can get total relief from income tax, it is a big encouragement. The fact that £5 million was invested in that scheme last year was a tremendous start up to a new scheme and especially a scheme we are not used to. It is easy for people to talk about the stock exchange and a certain group of people who are regarded as the well-to-do, as people who have much money to invest, whereas the ordinary person feels completely cut off from the idea of investing money. The whole concept of how to save money has <Col N="1521" /> been mentioned by the Minister on many occasions. The &ldquo;safe&rdquo; money is the money that is doing nothing for the country whereas money going into business is what we really want. Many businesses are stuck for finance. If they can get this money it will help them to expand, and will help the workers to have more work.</P>
    <P>Research and development are badly needed. Within a State where diversification is the name of the game very few companies can afford to remain as they have been for the past 50 years and expect to survive because markets are changing and it is a very difficult time. It is very important that people should be encouraged to invest their money in research and development. A company in Carlow survived the slump in the building industry by manufacturing tiles from concrete blocks and exporting gravel and sand to European countries for road making. This is an example of what can save a company from going to the wall. We need research and development to come up with new ideas and alternatives for companies who, perhaps with a reasonable amount of effort can switch their production to goods of a different type.</P>
    <P>In relation to patent income I know a local individual who spent much time developing a new idea and this is something I welcome on a personal basis. Very often people who come up with new inventions spend much time developing them. They take a risk. They borrow money and hope it will work out and sometimes it may not work out. For the person who comes up with the idea and who knows exactly what he is trying to produce, it is proper that he should have a reward at the end and that his profits should be free of tax. This scheme is intended to encourage people to invest in the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>The profit sharing scheme under which a company pays out profits to the workers in the form of shares gives an incentive to workers. Fifteen companies are involved in this profit sharing scheme. This is a marvellous step forward in an era when we have the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo;<Col N="1522" /> mentality in many firms and the workers feel cut off from the bosses. Division of profits with the workers in the form of shares is another step in the right direction towards encouraging people to become involved, to feel they are part of the scene and part of the company they are working for. The fact that this is limited to 5,000 shares per employee per year will not affect too many people. They will be very happy with that level of money.</P>
    <P>There is also a new scheme of share purchase by employees giving income tax relief. All of the schemes which were implemented in this year's budget, and the tax relief on loans where people borrowed money to buy shares, have been a big encouragement because if people borrow money to buy shares they take a risk and we need risk in this country at present. We need people to invest their money. Wise men go to the gilt markets and the Stock Exchange, but I applaud giving interest to people who borrow money to invest in these shares.</P>
    <P>Many incentives have been introduced by the Minister to encourage workers to become more involved in their work and this is very worthy of support. The third part of this motion where we call on all chambers of commerce, trade unions and employer organisations to involve themselves in the establishment of funds to use these tax relief provisions for job creation is very important. There is no point in having these schemes in speeches and books preserved in an office. The people involved in chambers of commerce, the business people, know what it is all about. They are in touch with their workers and so are the trade unions from the opposite side. While from the trade unions' point of view the job is to get as much as is possible for the workers, in the long run they can do a disservice if they press for too much at the wrong time. Leaders of trade unions in all walks of life are looking for more and more money but what we need is tax relief. If we stopped looking for the maximum salaries none of us will ever reach in our own jobs because of our tax, we could have a freeze for almost five years and <Col N="1523" /> still be gaining as much money if we got more tax relief.</P>
    <P>The chambers of commerce, trade unions, employer organisation and so on mentioned in this motion can play a leading role. I would like to see them giving this their goodwill and not seeing it as something that is against them or has long term effects for them as regards profit. Together we stand; divided we fall. We would gain immensely from the fact that everyone was pulling together. Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine, as we have heard so often in the past. We all depend on one another and, the more we depend on one another, the more we need to pull together. I hope these schemes introduced by the Minister over the years, &mdash; and in particular those in the Finance Act, 1986 &mdash; will be used by the workers. I hope their leaders will encourage them to take part and that the country as a whole will gain immensely. Instead of talking about unemployment, we will be doing something that will help to cut back unemployment and make this a better country.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed that the most pressing economic and social problem facing the country is that of unemployment. Any measure, therefore, that will help the objective of job <Col N="1524" /> creation is to be welcomed. The incentives which are the subject of the motion are designed to encourage investment in Irish companies by Irish residents and, secondly, to achieve significant participation of the ownership of business by employees. Nobody could quarrel with the commendable objectives of these schemes. There are, however, serious disincentives in the way of success for the schemes and I will return to these later.</P>
      <P>First, let me take profit sharing. Under profit sharing schemes the company profits distributed to employees in the form of shares are free from tax in certain defined circumstances. Assuming that the companies are profitable and that there are profits to share, there are benefits which may be reasonably expected from these schemes. Among the benefits to the employee of this type of incentive scheme are a potentially tax free reward and a stake in the success of the business.</P>
      <P>The employees of the company should become more cohesive in that through their shareholdings they will identify themselves with the company and with its future. There is also the prospect that industrial relations will be improved. A profit sharing scheme may help to motivate employees and to encourage involvement in participation at all levels since it will tend to demonstrate that the interests of the employees and shareholders are similar, a gulf that too often is the case in Irish industry. To the extent that employees identify themselves as stake-holders in the fortunes of the company they should recognise that individual performance, aggregated over the company, will have an impact on profitability. In the United States, for example those who have monitored the effect of profit sharing schemes note that the economic realities facing the company when negotiating pay levels come to the fore in realistic bargaining on what the company can afford to bear and how it will impact on the future of the company. These schemes encourage employees to think of the capital growth of the company as a whole, not just the particular part in which individual employees work.</P>

    <P>In relation to profit sharing, will the <Col N="1525" /> Minister give consideration to extending the right to profit sharing schemes to Irish residents who work in companies operating in the State but where the parent companies are registered outside the State? I have outlined some of the benefits that should accrue to employees and the company as a whole from profit sharing schemes. Will the Minister, therefore, agree that the balance of advantage favours extending the profit sharing schemes in the manner I have raised?</P>
    <P>The three schemes named in the motion, while all excellent in themselves, will only be attractive on a general scale if other disincentives against investment for employment and development are reduced or, better still, removed. This means in turn that the climate for enterprise and investment must be right. But is it?</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme, for example, which permits relief from income tax on amounts of up to £25,000 in any one year, relates to companies which must be engaged mainly in manufacturing. This scheme, again while excellent in itself, as I understand it has attracted investment of less than £10 million in any one year. This rather disappointing response is due, first, to a shortage of viable projects in which to invest and, secondly, because the total environment for enterprise and investment is still regarded by many investors as hostile. Furthermore, for would-be investors in the business expansion scheme guilts and other attractive investments are available at a time when they judge the climate for investment in manufacturing companies is not yet right. There is keen competition for these funds. Tax advantages are available for both profit sharing schemes and share options. The key incentive for investment under either arrangement is the profit level of the companies concerned. There is no point in investing in companies if there is no profit to share.</P>
    <P>With regard to companies in the manufacturing sector, input costs are a source of particular concern. Compared with our international competitors, electricity in industrial companies in Ireland is 20 <Col N="1526" /> per cent higher than the average in the EC countries, adding between £50 million and £60 million a year to manufacturing costs. In relation to road transport and other input, automative road diesel costs are twice as much here compared with the EC average, adding an estimated £100 million a year to industrial costs. Premium levels for employers' liability insurance are three to 15 times higher in manufacturing industry in Ireland compared with the UK. This form of insurance adds an additional £20 million compared with our competitors in the UK.</P>
    <P>A further serious imposition on industrial costs is the level of interest rates. These rates react to supply and demand. We have a situation at present where inflation is falling but interest rates are rising. Each 1 per cent increase in interest rates adds £16 million to the costs of the manufacturing sector. One reason for the rise in interest rates is within Government control. I refer to the scale of Government domestic borrowing which is crowding out other potential borrowers who would use such funds for investment.</P>
    <P>All in all, industrial input costs in this country are £200 million to £300 million greater than our competitors. The burden of these additional costs reduce profits &mdash; and that is the sense in which I want to raise it here &mdash; in industrial companies and, therefore, make the profit sharing scheme and the share option scheme that much less attractive because there are less profits to distribute. I understand a working group were established in May 1986 to examine industrial input costs and that their report &mdash; and here I would like the Minister to give me the picture on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will repeat it. I was making the point about the weight of industrial input costs in Ireland compared with our competitors. I reckon they amount to an additional £200 million to <Col N="1527" /> £300 million per year compared with the countries with which we compete. There is, of course, a further dimension here. In the case of imports with which we are also competing, they have the advantage of lower input costs and, therefore, they can sell that much more competitively on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The burden of these additional costs reduces the profits in industrial companies and, therefore, makes the profit-sharing scheme and the share option scheme that much less attractive. This is the point I was raising about the working group. I understand a working group were established in May 1986 to examine industrial input costs and that their report was submitted on 8 July to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have not heard anything further about the findings of the working group. Is the Minister in a position to let us know the present status of that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the removal of disincentives against investment for employment are essential if the scheme, which I think are highly desirable, are to have any real chance of success. The DIRT tax was a move in the opposite direction. This rentention tax on interest payments has already adversely affected the Irish banking system. Furthermore, it will continue to have an adverse effect on the cash flow of companies who are in receipt of deposit interest. I want to highlight a point here which I think is not adequately catered for in our plethora of State agencies. Working capital and cashflow are the life and blood of enterprises. The DIRT tax is adversely affecting working capital and cash flow. It is essential that governments should understand the role of working capital in job creation and in the retention of jobs. As a country, we have a range of State institutions and services that help companies at their formative state; for example, the IDA and CTT. We also have services if a company is in serious financial trouble or on the way out for example, Fóir Teoranta. We do not, however, have adequate support <Col N="1528" /> for companies during the main part of their life cycle.</P>
    <P>As I said, the DIRT tax goes in the opposite direction. It represents a further serious imposition on working capital and cash flow, the very areas that present trouble repeatedly for companies and contribute to their demise. This tax has chased hundreds of millions of pounds out of the country and while it remains on the Statute Book it will act as a disincentive to the return of funds to the country. We need these funds back, not least because of the contribution they would make to reducing interest rates. The DIRT tax, therefore, is a seriously misplaced measure which will continue to discourage investment and, therefore, will continue to discourage job creation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it will be evident from what I have said that the profit sharing, share options and business expansion schemes are excellent in themselves but strong disincentives remain to counter these highly desirable investment incentives. Foremost among these disincentives are the particularly servere tax régime which obtains in the country, the very heavy additional industrial input costs which I would put at £200 million to £300 million per year compared with our competitors and, thirdly, the DIRT tax which is a serious disincentive to personal savings and, worse still, a tax which has driven massive funds out of the country which are needed right now to encourage investment for job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in Seanad Éireann on a motion dealing with wider share ownership. I am a strong believer in the merits of promoting such ownership as a means of generating more investment and more employment. This will ultimately create a situation in which everybody owns a stake in the wealth-creating sector of the economy. I see this not so much as a desirable option but rather as a necessity, if we are to achieve the scale of growth in the economy that we need in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to set, therefore, are targets we can achieve. I want to put in place <Col N="1529" /> a system to monitor progress. I want to find out what the obstacles there are to faster progress. I want to talk about how we can stimulate action to surmount these difficulties. I hope, indeed I am confident, that the debate here in the Seanad will be a help to me in all of these four regards.</P>
    <P>We are all here agreed on the need to develop a strong indigenous industrial base. We all recognise there is potential for investment in new sectors of the economy. We are beginning to get a stronger appreciation of the valuable role which small business can play. It behoves us then to develop policies which will maximise our potential and open up new opportunities.</P>
    <P>Some other countries have a stronger tradition of risk investment than here. In Ireland people, unfortunately, have preferred to invest in gilt-edged securities with a guaranteed return. A consequence of this has been that there has been insufficient capital for productive investment. This is especially true in the case of small industry.</P>
    <P>We have seen over and over again, instances of small businesses, with definite potential, struggling, and in many cases failing, because of their excessive dependence on bank borrowing. They are unable to cope with the volume of debt. Interest bills come when they are least able to be met. They would have much more flexibility if a higher proportion of their capital was provided in the form of shares rather than bank borrowing. One only pays the dividend on a share when there is a profit but one has to pay interest whether a profit is being made at the time. This is an essential economic and industrial argument in favour of share-ownership and is why it is so important to promote it.</P>
    <P>Wider share ownership opens up the possibility of another source of investment for the developing company. Such investors are likely to take a close interest in the fortunes of companies into which they have put money. They may also be a source of further funds as the company expands. They may have some special <Col N="1530" /> expertise to bring to bear, or they may have contacts which can aid the company's progress.</P>
    <P>If you have a small company employing, perhaps, 15 or 20 people set up by somebody who, for instance, has a production background producing some engineering product, for example, he may have no expertise in marketing or in the accountancy area and his business may fail subsequently for lack of adequate marketing or lack of adequate financial control. If he had gone looking for capital early in the life of his company there is a strong possibility that under the business expansion scheme one of the people who had a high income and who might have invested in his company might be the marketing director of a large local co-op or other business. That person would then go on the board of directors and in addition to money he would bring the specific expertise the company lacked. Likewise, another person with a high income wishing to reduce his income tax by investing under the BES might be a local accountant and if he came on the board of directors of the company he would provide a very valuable free service to the company in the form of consultancy at board meetings through his membership of the company. That is a very important reason why wider share ownership should be seen not just as a means of getting extra capital but also as a means of bringing extra expertise into the company.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the clear need for investors to get away from the idea of limited returns on relatively risk-free investments. Firms must lessen their dependence on restrictive and expensive loan capital. There is a wider dimension. There is justifiable debate at the present time about poverty in this country. I know that is a subject which frequently engages the attention of Senators. Poverty takes many forms. The most obvious is lack of funds to support an adequate living standard but a more pervasive and equally damaging form of poverty is the sense of non-involvement in society. Those who are unemployed, sick or housebound suffer not only some <Col N="1531" /> material deprivation but an even greater sense of being cut-off from the main stream of society. The aim of social policy must be to address not only the sense of material loss but also the sense of isolation that is suffered by so many at the present time.</P>
    <P>The concept of wider share ownership is one way of bringing more people into the mainstream of economic activity in Ireland. The sense of being involved in a company as a part owner is a very important way in which people can play a part in society. That is something that can be undertaken by people of all ages and stages in life. The level of involvement in the company can be fitted to suit their capacities at a given time.</P>
    <P>I see the promotion of wider share ownership as a key element of social policy, not just an economic issue. If we can get more people involved in the wealth creation sector of our economy, we are removing one of the major perceived senses of inequality and grievance in our society. This is the sense of being excluded from the important wealth creation activities of our society. It is obviously important that those who work in firms should, as far as possible, own a share in the company in which they work, but it is equally important that those who have retired from firms should continue to hold shares in that company after they are no longer actively employed. This is not a substitute for a pension, but it is a basis for continued involvement by retired people with the firm in which they worked. This can be very important as the sense of being useful one day and rejected the next is frequently felt by those who retire.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that people should also own shares in companies with which they have no working connection. It is prudent that people should own shares in a wide range of companies rather than have all their shares in one particular firm, putting all their eggs, so to speak, in one basket. It is equally important that people should have an interest in different sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> We have to take new initiatives quickly to speed up economic growth and employment. We are in the unenviable position of having the highest budget deficit and the highest unemployment in the EC. Creating new jobs in the public sector is no solution and would simply magnify our problems in the longer term. We need self-sustaining, self-financing jobs which generate their own wealth. This is not a choice but a necessity. These jobs presuppose investment in the private sector in particular.</P>
    <P>We have introduced here in Ireland the best set of tax incentives for share ownership in the manufacturing sector that exists anywhere in Europe. They are designed to make it tax efficient to do what is patriotic from a national point of view. People can pay no income tax at all on money they invest in shares in a manufacturing company. The maximum income tax they will pay on any dividends they receive from those shares will be 24p in the £, compared with 58p in the £ paid by many people. This is a really attractive tax package and should, as I intend it will, make a major impact to broadening share ownership in Ireland and reviving the manufacturing sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>Some say it is wrong to confine these incentives to manufacturing but it should be remembered that Ireland is an exporting nation. We can, of course, develop our services sector, but we suffer the inherent disadvantage that people have to travel across two stretches of sea from continental Europe to get to Ireland. It is easier for goods to travel than it is for people. Thus, Ireland is likely to retain a larger dependence on the manufacturing sector because of its physical isolation than other countries more centrally placed in Europe who can more easily provide services. Ireland, therefore, is right to put the accent on development in manufacturing. It is concentrating on that area in which we have a comparative advantage.</P>
    <P>However, it should be stressed that these incentives are not in all cases confined to manufacturing. They also include traded services, but it would make no <Col N="1533" /> point to extend the tax incentives to non-traded services. All that would then happen would be that new firms would be set up, with the aid of the tax incentive, to displace old ones. In other words, we would have new jobs replacing old ones and we would be no further on. No extra jobs would be created. By confining the incentives to the traded sector, whether it be manufacturing or services, we are ensuring that the emphasis will be on extra jobs, not the displacement of existing ones.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern in Ireland about our failure to develop the food industry and other aspects of our material resources. The real problem here is marketing. We have the raw materials. Our fresh food is better than that produced in most other countries.</P>
    <P>What we lack is sufficient investment of money in marketing. We have not invested enough in quality control, in after sales service, in advertising, in research into new markets and new products and all the other factors that go to make the difference between a good product that is left on the shelf, and an equally good product that is a runaway best seller.</P>
    <P>Investment in marketing to achieve this has a long lead time. You cannot develop a new market over-night. Thus bank finance is unsuitable for the development of markets. Bank finance requires interest payments to be made virtually from the day the money is available. This is no use for a long term project with, initially, a low return. Indeed it is worth noting that banks are not interested in financing marketing because there is no physical asset to provide security for the bank in a marketing programme whereas there is in a building or a machine. That is another reason we must seek other forms of finance if we are to develop our full marketing potential.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the provision of equity in the form of shares under the business expansion scheme is ideal to financing marketing. It provides capital that only seeks remuneration when the marketing programme has been a success. <Col N="1534" /> It is essential that the food industry use the business expansion scheme to the full to develop new food products in Ireland. I have stressed this time and time again at every opportunity. Most recently I addressed the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, at their annual meeting and urged them to use these schemes to fund food marketing, rather than relying unduly on bank finance.</P>
    <P>I also believe that, with the development of specialist foods for particular market niches, farmers themselves will be able to avail of the business expansion scheme to develop food products. New products are going to be required, and there is no reason why farmers, with an income tax liability, should not use the business expansion scheme to fund companies to develop the marketing and processing of products on their farms. This is particularly relevant to the development of alternative forms of agriculture in areas that are not surplus in the EC at present.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Irish Farmer's Organisation and the ICMSA to see how their members, who have an income tax liability, can use this scheme both to offset the tax liability and develop new products for the market place. It is only through developing new products which do not rely on EC subsidisation that Irish agriculture will achieve its potential.</P>
    <P>The special package of tax incentives which has been incorporated in the 1986 Finance Act to stimulate private investment are, of course, selective. They can and do involve a loss of revenue to the State and consequently it is important to ensure that the benefits will outweigh the immediate revenue loss. If they are too generous or too wide in their application, they can cause serious distortions, as well as being very expensive.</P>
    <P>The main incentives are: the business expansion scheme; the research and product development scheme; a reduced tax charge on dividends for manufacturing companies; and selective reductions in capital gains tax rates. The take up of the business expansion scheme in recent months has increased dramatically <Col N="1535" /> and this is in a sense to the point made by Senator Hillery. Ten companies received £1.53 million in investment in 1984-85. In the following year to April 5, 1986 29 companies and investments of £3.7 million were approved. Since then the rate of growth has been spectacular.</P>
    <P>By the end of August last a further 17 companies and £1¼ million of investment has been approved. In the past two months alone 24 more companies have been approved with investments of over £2½ million. Inquiries are now being processed from another 102 companies. I can see every prospect of this scheme alone producing £15 million or more of new investment in 1987 as against £1.5 million in 1984-85 and £3.7 million in 1985-86.</P>
    <P>Clearly firms, investors and specialist finance houses are now becoming fully aware of the possibilities of the BES to generate growth and expansion and, at the same time, earn very generous returns. The life of the scheme was extended to 1991 in the Finance Act and I fully expect that, long before then, it will be making a major impact on investment.</P>
    <P>A number of the other changes made this year will help to accelerate the use of the scheme. In particular, the reduction in the rates of capital gains tax to a flat 30 per cent for shares disposed of on the smaller companies market of the Irish Stock Exchange will have a twofold benefit. It will encourage companies to come to that market and, at the same time, increase after-tax returns for shareholders realising gains. The capital gains tax rates for gains on shares acquired under the BES are also being reduced to that rate. This is important because people frequently say: &ldquo;Yes, it is a good idea to buy shares in the business expansion scheme company but how can you get rid of them? If you want to realise your gains, if you want to sell your shares how can you do it?&rdquo; Some of these companies are too small to get a full quote on the Stock Exchange. That is why the smaller companies market is an important disposal mechanism for the business expansion scheme. The knowledge that <Col N="1536" /> such a disposal mechanism exists, suitable to small companies, is a very good incentive to people to go into these companies as shareholders in the first place because they know that, as the companies develop, there will also be a means of disposing of those shares, selling them to somebody else who will bring in other money instead.</P>
    <P>The research and product development scheme which was newly introduced in this year's Finance Act is designed to widen the range of methods open to investors to become involved in investment and research. This new scheme also enables trading companies, known as sponsoring companies, to have much needed research and development done specifically for them without diluting their own capital base or taking on expensive loan finance. Again research and development are more suitably financed by equity than by loan finance. The scheme is a complicated one but experience with the BES suggests that once investors, their advisers and firms, become familiar with the &ldquo;workings&rdquo;, its use will spread rapidly as it is spreading now two and a half years after its initial introduction.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned during the past few months to publicise the value of these schemes. I have done this consciously because the need for action is so great. We just have not got the time any longer to wait for incentives to be gradually adopted. We need not only to bring about change but to bring it about quickly. I should like to refer to a point made by Senator Browne in his contribution. He referred to the tax relief for patent income. It is only now that people are beginning to take an interest in the fact that if you get a patent in Ireland, the royalties you receive from it are entirely tax free. That scheme was introduced by the then Minister for Finance Deputy R. Ryan in 1976. It is only now that it is really being taken up. We certainly cannot wait ten years for these incentives to deliver their full fruits. That is why it is very important that a debate like this should take place and that every means should be used to bring to the public mind the <Col N="1537" /> availability of these incentives. We cannot afford to have good incentives lying dormant in the Statute Book when the need for innovation and investment is so great.</P>
    <P>That is why I have approached the opinion makers in the financial and commercial world to throw their weight behind these schemes. The banks have undertaken to distribute promotional literature on the schemes at branch level. Some banks have advertised loan finance for investors who wish to become share owners. I have approached the chambers of commerce of Ireland to set up a designated fund. I have referred to approaches I have made to the IFA and the ICMSA. The chambers are working on this at the moment and I am hoping for a positive outcome in the next few weeks. The chambers organisation can provide a powerful motivation at local and regional level for practical steps to create jobs.</P>
    <P>These initiatives to encourage investors are balanced by a package of measures to stimulate employee participation in bringing about the success, and enjoying the fruits of the success, of the firms in which they work. We need to get past the stage of talking about improving the industrial relations atmosphere. My contribution is not on theory but on the form of practical changes.</P>
    <P>Some of our best talent in Ireland is wasted in industrial relations conflicts. The idea of two &ldquo;sides&rdquo; in industry is a time-wasting phenomenon. If workers were share owners as well as the providers of labour, both management and unions would be on the same side. Both would have exactly the same interest, which unfortunately they do not have at the moment, in the development of the firm. They would not be looking at it from different angles with different demands.</P>
    <P>My ideal would be a society in which trade union officials were participating actively as representatives of member shareowners in the development of new policies that will increase the profitability of the firm in which their members work. This would be a much better, and a more fulfilling use of the talents of our trade <Col N="1538" /> union officials than the current adversarial system. It requires a revolution in trade union thinking but worker share ownership also requires a revolution in traditional management thinking as well. These tax incentives provide an opportunity for both so called &ldquo;sides&rdquo; in industry to meet one another half-way and develop a common interest.</P>
    <P>The fundamental employee participation incentive is that for profit sharing. This term is something of a misnomer because the actual incentive is concerned with wealth sharing and only secondarily with profit sharing. Under it, firms are encouraged to allocate shares, that is part ownership, to employees. Employees may obtain full income tax relief on the value of the shares allocated and the company may deduct, for corporation tax purposes, the cost of providing the shares. This scheme encourages employers to give and employees to look for not just an interest in their company but a say in their company as shareholders. The upper limit on allocations of £5,000 a year is very generous.</P>
    <P>The growth rate in the use of this scheme is phenomenal. In 1983-84 after two years in operation only £1.8 million worth of shares had been allocated to workers share owners. In the following year a further £2.9 million was issued. In 1985-86 the figure rose to £8.2 million. Up to the end of 1985-86, 15 company groups were approved. In this year so far a further 11 companies have been approved or are under active consideration. I want to see the number of firms operating profit sharing schemes this year doubled.</P>
    <P>At this point I wish to refer to a point raised by Professor Hillery. He referred to foreign-owned companies not being open to use the profit sharing schemes. There are two profit sharing schemes in existence. One originated in the Finance Act, 1982, and another separate scheme originated in the Finance Act, 1986. The 1982 scheme is one which allows companies to distribute profits to employees in the form of shares in the company. That scheme is available both to domestically-owned <Col N="1539" /> and foreign-owned companies. The problem referred to by Senator Hillery does not arise in that scheme which, incidentally, is the most commonly used of the two schemes. There is a restriction in regard to the 1986 scheme which allows companies to allocate not shares out of their profits but actual money to employees to enable them to buy shares as distinct from the company giving them shares. That second scheme, and one can use both, is confined to Irish-owned companies. It is no harm to give a little bit extra to Irish-owned companies because it is our common objective in the Houses of the Oireachtas to promote a little bit more the idea of indigenous, Irish-owned companies.</P>
    <P>A parallel scheme covers share options where completely new tax arrangements have been introduced this year. These arrangements will facilitate firms in attracting and holding on to key staff. We frequently hear in debates on Finance Bills and elsewhere representations on behalf of high tech firms that they cannot hold on to key research personnel, that these people are being attracted by fantastic salaries to Silicon Valley, in California or somewhere else, or even to England, where not only is the salary higher but the tax level is lower.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is not possible in a country where the entire PAYE revenue has to be devoted to paying interest on debt to introduce big cuts in income tax for top taxpayers in general to keep a number of key personnel in the country. That is not on; it is not on in grounds of equity and it is not on in practice. This share option scheme provides an alternative route where profitable companies, instead of allocating money, can give options to people to buy shares on tax advantageous terms. If any firm complains to Senator that they cannot keep key executives he should refer them to the share option scheme. That is designed and targeted specifically at profitable manufacturing enterprises to enable them to keep staff, without giving a general tax concession to doctors, accountants and all the rest in <Col N="1540" /> society to whom one might wish to give such concession but which simply cannot be afforded.</P>
    <P>Another new measure, this is one I have already referred to, gives full income tax relief to an employee on money used to buy shares in his company. The limit here is £750. Supporting these measures is a tax relief referred to by Senator Browne on interest on loans used to acquire shares. This I think &mdash; and I summarise now all the elements in the package &mdash; represents an unprecedented set of co-ordinated measures to stimulate the creation of wealth and, secondly, the equitable distribution of that wealth among investors and employees as stake-holders.</P>
    <P>Wealth creation should not just be an option for the very few. The opportunities and the right conditions are there for everybody to take part. The measures introduced are extended in this year's Finance Act and are intended to bring all these elements together. I am asking the House to support these measures and I call on the key institutions in the State to actively promote them in the interest of creating and maintaining jobs.</P>
    <P>There were one or two points referred to by Senator Hillery I would like to refer to although I am not sure whether they were relevant to this debate. The Senator rightly pointed out that the profit level is a key factor. He referred to input costs and naturally enough &mdash; I presume he might have got some information from the Confederation of Irish Industry &mdash; he picked out the areas where we are disadvantageous in terms of industrial costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors in Europe. It is important to put this context by pointing out a few things. First, most European countries do not offer manufacturing the general range of grants for marketing, for technology acquisition, for research and machinery that we offer. This is a very important means of reducing costs. Secondly, no European country offers a 10 per cent corporate tax rate to manufacturing companies, as we do. Thirdly, most other European countries have higher rates of social security taxes on employees than we do; much <Col N="1541" /> higher in some cases. Fourthly, cost of labour is considerably less in this country than it is in other European countries.</P>
    <P>While some costs are higher, partly as a result of the fact that Ireland is an island off another island off the mainland of Europe and cannot enjoy the benefits, for example, of an electricity interconnecter for producing electricity, there are other areas in which the Government and the trade union movement make up that disadvantage. In relation to the report on industrial input costs, the position is that it will be the subject of a meeting in the near future between the Taoiseach and the Confederation of Irish Industry who initiated the report.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery referred to the Deposit Interest Retention Tax and suggested that this was a move in the opposite direction to all of these incentives. I beg leave to disagree with the Senator. If you want something done, you apply a combination of the stick and the carrot. One of the things we do not want is money lying dormant in bank accounts or in gilts. If you have the Deposit Interest Retention Tax that gives people encouragement to look around for another form to which they will put their money that will not be subject to that tax at 35 per cent. Clearly, therefore, the Deposit Interest Retention Tax encourages people to take their money out of bank deposits and put it into shares in the directly productive sector so, far from it having the negative consequences Senator Hillery referred to it could be argued that it is consistent with the general move of trying to get people to put their savings into the risk sector rather than the saving sector of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">

      <P>The evidence certainly would suggest that the money is not in the country because otherwise the revenue from the Deposit Interest Retention Tax would not be £5 million higher than we expected it would be. If the money had run away we would not have been able <Col N="1542" /> to get a larger revenue than we expected. That probably disposes of that argument once and for all.</P>

I am simply dealing with the question of whether it is consistent with the idea of share ownership or whether it is consistent with the idea of getting them to put their money into risk sectors rather than non-risk sectors. I am also dealing with the point raised by Senator Hillery that it was chasing the money out of the country. The evidence clearly indicates that that is not so. That is an important point to make.

      <P>In relation to the scheme of tax relief to an employee on money used to buy shares, the Minister mentioned that a marginal advantage is given to Irish companies. The thrust of what I have been saying in relation to the advantages of profit sharing, including this scheme, was that the advantages <Col N="1543" /> were so important to employees and, in turn, to the health of the company in the corporate sense that there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of people who are working in companies here where the parent company is abroad, who should be encouraged to gain the same advantages for themselves and for the companies as in the case of Irish companies. Would the Minister give it further consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is, if you encourage Irish people to buy shares in companies that are maybe 90 per cent operating overseas, only 10p. of the 100p. invested by the Irish share owner will be used in Ireland. That is why it makes more sense in general to give a slightly better tax regime to encourage Irish workers to invest in Irish companies. That is not to say I have a closed mind on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to listen to the Minister's speech. One of the tragedies is that, if the Minister had not been defeated on the budget that time, we would have had a lot more of this legislation on our Statute Book. His positive attitude towards the small business is to be welcomed. I welcome wholeheartedly the idea of share ownership by our workers and also the idea of profit sharing and involving the trade unions and chambers of commerce in the activities of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He touched on a very important aspect, the social policy. If more people become involved in companies and take shares in companies there will be less friction, more employment, better industrial relations and a better feeling throughout the companies. I would like to take up the time at my disposal to outline what I think the situation is and to outline the assets we have available to us. We stand at a strategic crossroads between two powerful blocks of countries and their trading, the USA and the EC. Our international reputation as a location for profitable investment offering a stable <Col N="1544" /> and a very good political environment is invaluable.</P>
    <P>We are well poised to take advantage of the new industrial and service sector frontiers opened up by the information technology explosion. We have the expertise and the technical systems to make this country a winner. Our population is young, well educated and flexible through its youth to be able to change with the economic changes. Given the right environment, the Irish people are a great people for achievement. They can achieve great things in other countries. We should be encouraging them to stay at home and to achieve at home. It is a tragedy, as the Minister knows, to see young, highly educated people leaving all sections of the country. It used to be the west; now it is the midlands. The best possible people are leaving the country. We have got to address ourselves to that problem to keep them here, to invest their time and their energy in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about people participating in industry. I worked in an industry in the sixties and I know what it is like to be part of a company going places, to be part of a workforce who identified themselves with the management and with the products. The relationship between the management and the staff was excellent because we were all going on the same road.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about taking aboard all sections of the community because we have massive unemployment, high interest, massive problems on all sides. The only way to tackle the problems is to get people to work together. We have a lovely country. Why should all the tourists go to England? Why should they not come here? A vast number of tourists go to London every year. There is an unbelievable difference in the number who come here. We should be developing a positive attitude towards risk taking; we should not be afraid of failures. If you have two losses out of every ten very good things, you should be able to take risk and there should be an incentive to go back to take more risk.</P>
    <P>The large IDA factories that we have <Col N="1545" /> spotted all over the country should be broken up into smaller units to encourage small companies to develop. If two people with an idea come together with one employee, next year it can be four employees. The following year small companies become big companies as in America where the once very small companies are now the major companies. When Ford started off he was alone and he developed an empire. The thing is to identify people, get them into small clusters of units and get them working.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's idea to get people to put their savings into industry rather than into gilt-edged securities. I agree with the Minister about the reduction in the tax on dividends in manufacturing. Why not consider the possibility of actually doing away with it altogether, of not having a tax on dividends when you invest your savings into manufacturing companies? The provision of the same interest rates for small companies as well as large ones is very important.</P>
    <P>The IDA should be picking winners. They should be identifying small companies, seeing that these companies are winners and putting everything they have into those winners so that they can develop them and spend their time developing companies that will do very well in the future. The Minister spoke about marketing and product. Marketing is a massive area because, if we have not got our marketing right, we cannot have our products right. We should look at the Irish Goods Council, revamp it, and get it involved basically in Irish production.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Government could help is to reserve about 30 per cent of all State purchases for small firms. With regard to the long-term emphasis on teaching foreign languages in our primary and secondary schools, I am not saying we should train people to go abroad but that we are training them to become Europeans, to understand the languages and to be able to trade in them. The Minister said we should not have one faction here and another faction elsewhere and I agree totally. The Unfair Dismissals Act is a major barrier with its emphasis on the employee: it should be <Col N="1546" /> directed to the employer and the employee.</P>
    <P>An area the Minister should be examining is the provision of staff for a special inquiry branch for the Revenue Commissioners. These people should be recruited locally where they would have the necessary knowledge of the small industries in their areas. At the present we are talking to a faceless person in the Revenue Commissioners Office. The Government should consider a real amnesty, to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh.</P>
    <P>There are many accountants servicing small companies around the country that are in severe financial trouble and who owe the Revenue Commissioners millions of pounds. The Revenue Commissioners come along and say: &ldquo;You owe us this amount of money and now the interest is half of what you owe us&rdquo;&mdash; in some cases the interest is exactly the same as the amount owed. These companies have no ability to pay the money and they will go out of business. The Minister should ask the accountancy companies around the country to second these accountants for one day per month to come together and examine these companies to see if they can pay their arrears and still trade. People owe so much money now and there is no way that they can pay it. The only way out of this is for them to go into liquidation or out of business. These expert people who have no axe to grind could examine each company, interview the directors and the board and see from their cash flow projections if they are in a position to pay this money. Perhaps they could waive the interest. It is better to get some money than not to get any money; it is better to have employees who will always be there.</P>
    <P>I know of one company who owe £100,000 and they have 20 employees. The Revenue Commissioners say this money has to be paid, plus the interest, which is another £70,000. There is no way that company can afford to pay this money and the only alternative they have is to go out of business. The result is that the Revenue Commissioners will lose and <Col N="1547" /> the employees will lose everything. If the Minister had somebody to go into a company who owe money and say &ldquo;forget about the interest&rdquo; and write down the debt to a reasonable amount the company can pay because of their orders and so on they could continue in business and be in a position to pay their debts in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the competitors of that company who have been paying all their taxes on time react to that? Would the Senator make a distinction between the company's own taxes, such as corporation tax, and money like PAYE and VAT which the company are only collecting from other people as an agent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would. The reason is they have used the money because the banks have put a ceiling on their payments. They have returned the cheques that were due to the Revenue Commissioners. It was a case of paying the Revenue Commissioners or continuing trading and pay the money owing to the suppliers. The banks decided which course of action was to be taken. I agree with what the Minister says but overall it is better that a company should stay in business. There is a reason for not doing anything and there is a perfectly logical reason why the Minister should adopt that policy. The reason he should not adopt that policy is that the company will go out of business. If he adopts the policy I mentioned that small company could develop into a big one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might consider issuing a trading licence to companies so that if they do not pay their VAT and PAYE they will not get a licence and if they cannot obtain a trading licence then they cannot operate. I am involved in a small company of accountants and I have yet to get a communication from the Revenue Commissioners for money that is owed, yet if I owe £10 to a publishing company, they will be on the telephone every week hounding me for that money. In all cases <Col N="1548" /> the Revenue Commissioners are forgotten about and companies go further and further into debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many areas I should like to cover. I agree with what the Minister said in his speech. It is seldom I praise Ministers but we are fortunate to have Deputy John Bruton in the Department of Finance. The Minister's attitude to small business, to saving and to the production sector is second to none. It is a pity his ideas do not perlocate down the line. They do not get to where they should and people do not go along with him and create a structure in business. The Minister has identified the problem but we have all got to be together to solve it. We have to work together in order to enjoy together but we cannot do this unless we all come together. The package of incentives that are given out are second to none.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's whole attitude to business, and particularly to the small business. The future of the country is in small businesses. We should have a positive attitude like he has and that should percolate from him down through his Department. The officials do not always get the message through. What the Minister is saying should be conveyed to all sections of the community. Then we would have a more positive attitude to business and to employment as a whole.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way he has spoken about the social aspect and the effect on the poor. When I started work in the company for whom I work there were many poor people working there, cleaners and so on, and they all felt part of the firm. When we talk about shareholding and share diversification, we talk about not only the rich, but a combination of the rich and the poor. This is a positive attitude and I am glad that the Minister mentioned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which has given us food for thought. In his speech the Minister has given great encouragement to many people. He <Col N="1549" /> reminded them of the facilities and the provisions that are available to encourage them to invest in their own future, in their own job place and in the economy of the nation as a whole. For some time the papers and the media in general seem to be saying that we are in a state of malaise, that people seem to grope around almost without hope. Yet, as the Minister has so clearly pointed out, more and more people are availing of the provisions of this year's Finance Act which are of substantial financial benefit to them.</P>
      <P>During the past few months many people raised the issue of the DIRT under very many headings. Most people seem to forget that this is not just an Irish taxation provision. It has been operating in Northern Ireland and in the UK for a decade or more. There is no guarantee that if people shove their few shillings from one jurisdiction to another while they may escape paying tax here they will not be caught elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Conway's view that the Minister has made an enormous contribution in encouraging companies, especially small companies and small family concerns, to develop. The small family company, with the help of these provisions, will become more and more an extended family manufacturing firm. I come from the midlands which does not have a great industrial base. Unfortunately the industrial base in the county of Laois is less than what it was in 1924, if we are to look at the ordinary statistics of people in manufacturing industry. That is unfortunate and it is one of the reasons those in public life try to put forward the claims of our area for additional industrial investment. We have suffered since 1957, since the late Gerard Sweetman brought in the industrial export tax relief and the Industrial Investment Act. If people wishing to establish industries move 20 or 30 miles west across the Shannon, they are into a 60 per cent or 70 per cent grant situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the point I was making was that, if people are content with the lower rate of grant aid, they just stay near the eastern ports, near Dublin or Kildare. That is one of the reasons we have such a low base in the midlands. In our experience the firms who give the greatest service and who are very conscious of the living and working conditions and the future of their workforce are the old traditional family firms. A big multinational firm who move in have absolutely no sentiment. They are in business with the sole idea of making as much profit as possible. They have no allegiance to old brand names, to areas, or to traditions. That militates against the small areas in particular.</P>
      <P>I passionately believe that this country must have a future and that the people and the workers, skilled and semi-skilled, given the incentives and given the opportunities, will be dedicated to their firms and their place of work. There is a question of leadership involved. Last week I accompanied the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a tour of factories in County Offaly, in Birr and Tullamore. I was very impressed by the high standards and the happy workforces we met, which I had not expected. This reflects great credit on the individual manufacturing companies and on the management and staff in all of those six factories we visited. I wish them continued success.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points I should like to make on this. The Minister has been very clearly encouraging workers to invest in their companies. I support that 100 per cent. There is also the question of the lame dogs and the people who find themselves in great difficulty. The Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners should take equity or some shares in concerns that may be in difficulty. If a firm owes the Revenue Commissioners either VAT or taxes, why do not the Revenue Commissioners, through the IDA or some other semi-State organisation, take equity in that firm to that value, and give the firm a chance rather than close it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying these semi-State organisations are not playing their role and doing what they can. Nevertheless, in a county with a very small industrial force &mdash; because there are so few we know them all &mdash; one can count on one hand &mdash; the number of firms where these agencies have moved in and, for one reason or another in the way they do their sums, have not found it possible to support those firms. A number of firms have just gone out of business. In so far as small family industries are concerned, there should be a greater percentage of risk capital. By and large the IDA have done a marvellous job. The number of failures is proportionately very small. People tend to talk about the larger concerns which have not succeeded. There should be a greater risk investment where small enterpreneurs are involved. If we are to widen our industrial base we should be prepared to give a fairer crack of the whip to the ordinary Irish man down the street who has an idea and gets a few pounds together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a point? The Senator is talking about companies who get into difficulties. If companies take in shareholders from outside, as this tax incentive provides, they are less likely to get into the difficulties the Senator is <Col N="1552" /> talking about. That is the time to deal with the problem, not when they are on their death bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the Minister should also give the lead to a greater extent by having his own agencies do exactly what he is prescribing for the ordinary worker. Nevertheless, the Minister's speech is one that we can study. It certainly gives a tremendous boost to people who, for one reason or another, do not see the sunny side of the development this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that ten companies received £1.5 million in investment in 1984-1985. This year he anticipates that 150 companies will receive something like £15 million under this scheme. That is a great boost and it is a great act of faith on the part of the Minister for Finance who has brought in this scheme. I know from the very dramatic growth rate in the take-up of the provisions and of the incentives offered that this scheme will play a significant part in revitalising many industries.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will continue to place his hope and trust to a greater extent in the small private sector to provide the kind of environment that will sustain very many more jobs in the manufacturing and service industries. As far as exports are concerned, while transportation amounts to something like 17 per cent or 18 per cent of our GNP, it is unfortunate that the EC has not addressed this problem. This country needs a proper transport policy which would take account of the fact that we are so far removed from the profitable markets in central Europe. I hope when he wears the European hat he wears from time to time, the Minister will press for a meaningful transport policy. It was one of the few headings included in the original Treaty of Rome almost 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his foresight in nuturing this scheme in which I have great faith and which I am sure will <Col N="1553" /> provide the job opportunities that are so badly needed in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section because under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, it is a good defence for shooting a dog if the defendant proves that the dog was shot while worrying livestock on agricultural land. The provisions in this section are now widened to permit the shooting of dogs worrying or about to worry livestock no matter where they are, and of stray dogs which had not left the vicinity where livestock had been injured or killed and which could not be seized or identified. This is a good section provided we do not have some trigger-happy, gun-toting farmers who are prepared to shoot every dog in sight and use this section as an excuse for doing so. I wonder what kind of evidence they have to produce. It could be very hard in court to prove that a dog intended to worry your stock or that you thought he was about to worry your stock. I wonder would it hold up in a court of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Hussey in saying that this is a good section. I compliment the Minister on introducing it. As the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, it extends the provisions of section 4 of the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960. There are one or two things in this section which must give cause for worry &mdash; perhaps it might be better if I use the word &ldquo;concern&rdquo;. The first thing is the use of the word &ldquo;worrying&rdquo; and I come back to the remarks I made when I addressed the Minister on the general definition of the word &ldquo;worry&rdquo; in the interpretation <Col N="1554" /> section, section 1 of this Bill. It says that worry means to attack, or kill, or to chase livestock. If you are &ldquo;worrying&rdquo; that means that you are attacking, you are killing, or you are chasing. There are circumstances where dogs can be present without doing any of these things and can be having an effect on livestock which can be detrimental or damaging to livestock. That is why I want once again to express my concern about the definition of the word &ldquo;worry&rdquo; contained in section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully support the principle underlying this Bill and I compliment the Minister of State on bringing it forward but if it is to have teeth the definition of the word &ldquo;worry&rdquo; in section 1 will have to be looked at again. If it is not looked at again this section and many of the provisions of this Bill will become a source of considerable meat to lawyers in various courts in the country. With a view to ensuring that the provisions of section 23 (1) (a) have proper and full effect, I would like to see the Minister extending or expanding the definition of the word &ldquo;worry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The second point I would like to make on this section arises in relation to section 23 (1) (b), (c) and (d). This is the provision which allows a person under certain circumstances to shoot a stray dog. It would appear that the right thereby conferred on a defendant to make use of this new statutory defence is limited to a person who is the person in charge of livestock at the material time. If one refers to section 4 of the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, one sees that that section also provides a statutory defence for the shooting of a dog, but it is a defence that is available to and I quote:</P>
      <P>(1) the occupier of the land, a member of his family or a person employed by him, or (2) the owner of the livestock, a member of his family or a person employed by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 (1) (c) requires to be expanded beyond the simple phraseology, and I quote, &ldquo;the person in charge of the livestock&rdquo;. The right conferred there should <Col N="1555" /> be extended beyond that person to members of that person's family, to any members of a farmer's family or to any person employed by the farmer and, indeed, to the owner. It may be that the owner is not in charge of the livestock.</P>

I cannot see the basis for limiting the right. A broad discretion is given in the 1960 Act. The 1960 Act states &ldquo;the occupier, a member of his family or a person employed by him.&rdquo; I cannot see why this Bill does not go to that extent also.</P>

That is true but, at the same time, you cannot wait until a sheep is killed or slaughtered to take action. When this Bill is enacted and when people become aware we are serious about it dog owners will take care that their dog is not wandering around where there are sheep. For instance, where there are sheep on land the owner of the dog may not be aware that the dog is doing any harm and he will not expect anybody to come along and shoot the animal. Where livestock and sheep are concerned I hope the person in charge of the animals would take in the dog but he would certainly be entitled to shoot the dog.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Browne, the court seems to have no problem. It is really a civil matter. The aggrieved person usually wins and it is up to the person concerned then to abate the nuisance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The aggrieved person usually wins in spite of the fact that it might not be a legitimate complaint. I have experience of people making a complaint about what they termed to be <Col N="1558" /> excessive barking but where no barking had taken place. Maybe this legislation will tidy things up as certain definitions are laid down about nuisance of barking dogs. In the past people made complaints when, in fact, through technical means and otherwise, it could be proved that no barking had taken place. Because they felt aggrieved they kept on complaining, sending solicitors' letters and so on and eventually the person involved had to move the whole enterprise away from the district. That is the unfortunate thing about living beside somebody who would complain about anything. If they heard one dog bark in the middle of the night they would complain about the nuisance. I hope the courts will treat this matter properly and that evidence will have to be provided in a civil case to prove beyond doubt that there was excessive barking. They do not want frivolous complaints, as has happened in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair point. There is a sort of a cooling-off procedure in the Bill, that before anybody makes a complaint to the District Court in relation to the nuisance of excessive barking of a dog he should serve notice of his intention to make such an application on the occupier of the premises. We have to accept that excessive barking of dogs can seriously diminish the comfort of life for neighbours and many complaints made to the Department relate to this problem. I hope the subsection will provide a remedy in the court to any person who wishes to pursue the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often the occupier of the premises in which the dog is kept may not be the owner of the dog. Should there not be something inserted to specify that the <Col N="1559" /> owner of the dog would also have to be notified?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already welcomed the section. It seems that if a person operates in breach of the court order no offence is created. This is one of the few sections in the Bill which does not appear to create an offence for non-compliance. If I am correct in saying that a new subsection should be added to the fact that if a person acts in breach of the court order that person shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty. Section 27 deals with offences and penalties and there is no penalty in relation to the breach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a civil matter but it comes before the court by way of a summons. It does not come before the court by way of an ordinary civil process and an individual still has his civil remedies separate from this statutory section. This is a very good and novel section but to make it more effective and to give it teeth, there should be a provision that non-compliance with a court order will make the person liable to payment of a penalty. I am trying to give the section more of a bark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Hussey, that is the normal wording of the existing legislation, &ldquo;the occupier of the premises in which the dog is kept&rdquo;. I will have another look at this for snags but basically that is the existing wording and it does not seem to be causing any problems. We are trying to relate this Bill to offences under the control of the warden and the local authorities. If you go into the area suggested by Senator Durcan, you are talking about taking the whole Bill into the civil court area which is another matter entirely. I would prefer to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only worry I have is that the section provides that a court may order the occupier of a premises in which the dog is kept to abate the nuisance <Col N="1560" /> by exercising due control over the dog. Take, for instance, the situation where the court makes an order of that nature and the order is served on the dog owner. The dog owner says: &ldquo;To blazes with the court; I am not going to comply with that order&rdquo;. There is nothing in this Bill that imposes any penalty for non-compliance. There is nothing in this Act which gives anybody any power to enforce the order. Whereas I think the provision in the Bill is a very novel one, it should be given more teeth and I ask the Minister to look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section is strong enough. I have experience of people in the country who have complained about one dog barking. This section gives the court power to serve a notice on the dog owner to abate the nuisance. What will the dog owner do? Will he come out and say to the dog: &ldquo;You are not to bark please; there are neighbours complaining about it&rdquo;? There is nothing to stop the dog barking again in the middle of the night. One must relate this to on-the-ground situations. Dogs will bark. A cribbing neighbour will avail of every single bark to close you down. This has happened.</P>
      <P>I do not want any penalties in the section. If somebody makes a reasonable effort, he should keep the dogs and you must accept that they bark. I do not know how to stop a dog barking. If it is suggested that people should be fined because their dogs bark, we are living in an extraordinary society. With all due respect to Senator Durcan &mdash; and I am not pointing the finger at him in particular &mdash; I am worried about what would happen on the ground if he gave the Minister power to impose fines for a barking dog because all the dogs I know bark and a lot of them bite as well, especially during election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris misses the point. We are not giving power to the courts to make an order against the dog. We are giving power to the courts to make an order against the dog owner. What happens if the dog owner throws <Col N="1561" /> the court order in the air and says: &ldquo;To blazes with that&rdquo;? There will be two parties involved and the owner will know it was Senator Ferris or Senator Browne or somebody else who motivated the provision that led to the court order and he will say to his dogs: &ldquo;Keep barking&rdquo; to annoy Senator Ferris or to annoy Senator Browne. What I am worried about is that there is nothing in the section to say if that happens and if the owner does not exercise proper control, and if the barking increases, there is a penalty which can be imposed against the dog owner who does not exercise proper control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite obviously, as the Senator surely knows, you can refer back to the court again and you can go before the same judge. I know the sort of treatment such an owner will get. He will be put in his place and it will be a very expensive business. That is what the law is all about. But we do not intend to get into that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind the section is very good and the basis of this section is a very good one if it is followed through.</P>
      <P>It provides a simple procedure but to make the procedure effective you must have a penalty at the end of the day. This is one of the few instances where a court can make an order which does not have to be complied with and the person who does not comply with it is not subject to any penalty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the courts is that not only do they make an order but they also impose a penalty. There is more to it than just an order. You are fined in the court. Assuming the person is prepared to pay these fines <Col N="1562" /> which will grow in size, I am sure they will have due respect for the law. We are certainly not going to get involved in that scenario.</P>

      <P>That is a totally different matter. This is part of the Bill over which we have direction too. In other words, dog wardens and local authorities who have a direct function in this legislation have the benefit of a series of penalties right through from cases of dogs worrying sheep to no licences.

The thrust of the Bill is to do something about the damage being caused in the hinterland of this city and all over the country annually by dogs getting out of control and engaging in the slaughter of sheep and lambs. We tried to make the Bill as comprehensive as possible. We have done so but there are certain areas of the Bill that we are leaving to the local authorities themselves to deal with such as fouling footpaths and things like that. We will be leaving penalties for quite a lot of things. We are leaving it up to the local authorities themselves.

The subsection imposes the onus on a defendant in a prosecution for an unlicensed dog of proving the age of the dog if the offence is for a dog under four months and is kept with its dam and does not require a licence by virtue of section 5 (e), that the dog was in fact licensed, that the dog had been imported into the State for a period not exceeding 30 days. I am advised that prosecutions for non-licensing might require an inordinate amount of proof that the dog was not licensed. For instance, it might be necessary to prove that the dog was not licensed by any of the 32 local authorities involved. Consequently, I propose to consider between now and Report Stage whether it would be appropriate to provide for a presumption that the dog required the licence and that it was not licensed unless the defendant can prove otherwise in place of the provision now contained in the subsection.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because there are serious vesting problems in many areas. I have nominated this one because of the lack of facilities and finance to complete the vesting orders. I will give a brief resume of what vesting is in this instance. Twentytwo years ago families in the village of Ballyhale, County Galway, received additional lands from the Irish Land Commission. It took quite an abnormal length of time, even when the Land Commission were in full swing, to bring the vesting of holdings into line. Heretofore, in individual cases it could be done by alerting the Land Commission to the individual problem &mdash; the lack of vesting &mdash; and getting them to move. In fairness to the Land Commission they were always courteous and kind where it was at all possible that the vesting could be done. I have in mind a number of families and I will give the Minister the specific details after I have finished, I have all the data and the numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several families in this village of Ballyhale and Headford. The son of one family commenced the building of a house on a portion of land the family had received from the Land Commission approximately 22 years ago. Like the good son he was &mdash; he was married and had two children &mdash; the first built a little garage on to the house and went to live there. He is still living in that garage. He brought the building of the house to the roofing stage and when he offered the site for mortgage purposes the legal people informed him that the farm was not vested in the Irish Land Commission. On his behalf and on behalf of three more families in the village I went to the Irish <Col N="1568" /> Land Commission in Galway. I was told: &ldquo;Sorry. We cannot do anything. We do not have any finances. The Land Commission are not doing this operation&rdquo;. I asked the honorable question: &ldquo;Where can I go to get it done?&rdquo; I was told I could not be informed of that.</P>
    <P>I then went to the Department of Agriculture. I made representations to the Minister's Department &mdash; not to the Minister present, Deputy Connaughton, because I did not think he was dealing with it. I wrote to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Since then I have been receiving acknowledgments on a three weekly basis saying; &ldquo;We are looking into the matter&rdquo;. My only option was to highlight the matter here this evening in the hope that some finance could be made available to the Land Commission to complete the vesting orders around the country.</P>
    <P>This man, his wife and two children are facing their third year in a garage built onto the house. They cannot complete the house because they need to borrow the money to finance the completion of it. I am appealing to the Minister this evening to look into this case. The McHale farm was the original estate. There are several families in this village. I will give the exact details and the map numbers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to make some organ of the Land Commission respond urgently, because there are three families who are absolutely stuck and cannot move. I have had similar requests from people in other parts of County Galway and I am sure that similar circumstances prevail in other areas. Some organ of the Land Commission should be revived and finance provided to deal with this aspect. Many farmers believed land allocated to them was their own. They were paying rent for it. Many of them had almost all the rent paid on it. Some method should be available whereby individual cases could be dealt with speedily. I am not saying we should have a total vesting programme, but people should be able to go to some section of the Department and get those lands vested. The responsibility rests with the Irish Land Commission to <Col N="1569" /> whom they are still paying rent. I make the point public here this evening because I have exhausted every other avenue available to me. I hope the Minister will recognise this need and have it dealt with even on the basis of individual cases. That would suffice to get us out of trouble until such time as some proper programme can be drawn up to have the vesting of all lands allocated by the Land Commission finalised. Something has to be done, because legally it is not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed, this is a particular problem. Not alone does it exist now but we have had it for a long time. I will try to go through the reasoning behind it and then see what we can do. The estate in question is the McHale Estate, EC 455, County Galway. This rearrangement scheme was partially prepared and operated in 1963 but, due to the non-cooperation of one of the tenants, it was not found possible to complete it until 1975. The area of the lands involved is 400 acres approximately in the townland of Ballyhale. Although only 16 different tenants are involved, the scheme comprises 33 separate holdings consisting of about 500 plots or shares of grazing, all of which were allocated by way of a series of inter-dependent exchanges where no plot can be vested on its own &mdash; all must be vested simultaneously on the same vesting order in accordance with section 17 of the Land Act, 1953. This means that an obstacle to the vesting of one holding affects all holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many legal reasons for that which I will come back to in a moment. The basic reason why there is a delay in the vesting of land allotted by the Land Commission is that there are a large number of cases awaiting vesting. This goes back over ten or 12 years and at the moment there are 8,000 such cases in the pipeline. Because of the limited staffing resources available, it has been found necessary to arrange for vesting work to be done on a priority basis, with preference being given to those cases where, for mortgage purposes, the establishment <Col N="1570" /> of good title was essential for the allottee. A similar priority system operates in the Land Registry and, of course, vesting itself is only a necessary preparation for the registration in the Land Registry of the allottee's title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Before it comes to the Land Registry vesting has to be done, so the priorities follow through. It cannot move unless vesting has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the case made by Senator Killilea, arrangements have been made to have this estate put in hands immediately for vesting. However &mdash; and I want to make this very clear &mdash; having regard to the large number of exchanges involved, the amount of research that has to be done and the slowness and complexity of the legal processes involved, irrespective of how many people are working on it, it is not possible to say when exactly the vesting will be completed, but it will be put in train.</P>
      <P>I gather from what the Senator has said that several tenants on this estate are anxious to have their holdings vested as soon as possible because &mdash; and this is the nub of the question &mdash; some lending institutions or local authorities insist on vesting before they will give a loan. I have a few thoughts of my own on this because I come across it every day of the week and have done so for many years. I would like to take this opportunity to state that I see no reason whatsoever why the banking institutions and others should not be able to devise a system under which financial accommodation could be extended to people who got land from the Land Commission, without waiting for the lands to be vested. They are the actual owners of it and, in fact it cannot be taken back from them. It goes without saying that all land allotted by the Commission will eventually be vested in the allottees, or their successors in title. This has to be done, irrespective of what changes in land policy there may be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the legal experts of these institutions could get together and try <Col N="1571" /> to devise an arrangement whereby loans could be given without an insistence on vesting. This is something that I have asked my officials to have a look at and perhaps in the short term we could get those financial interests to see it this way. When you think about it, there is no reason to doubt that land that has been allocated properly by the Land Commission is in the pipeline for vesting. There is no place else that land can go other than to the allottee or to his successor. I fully appreciate the Senator's <Col N="1572" /> problem. It causes great frustration, particularly in rural Ireland. We should have a look at it and hopefully we will get some leeway because, irrespective of how many staff they had even in the best days of Land Commission, we were always ten or 12 years behind. This estate will get priority and we hope it will not take too long but it is a very involved case.</P>
